<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">30th May 2014, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">guys, there's not much discussion on this reporting tool. i have seen the demo of the latest version yesterday and it has some good points. my company's requirement is user-friendliness as we want to be able to have a few users outside IT develop their own reports. i have seen this product before. i think they have made a lot of enhancements on their latest version. i am worried about how it can handle complex queries because it does not use standard SQL. they could have a workaround for each scenario. they have human-readable baan table field names on a click of a button. they also claim faster speed although that's not what i saw before. the company has 100 employees, more or less, so i'm pretty sure they are very aggressive in selling the software. attempted partnership with infor but wasn't successful. anybody has any take on this product? good or bad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">30th May 2014, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the product.  The programming language is kinda clunky for more complex reports, but for the user population it's great.  Also, although I haven't done it, I've been told that you can connect it to stored procedures, so you could design your really complex reports in something like that and still use eCQ to execute.<br />

<br />
Its always better to keep the &quot;Complex&quot; part with the IT Guys unless you are ready to spend time in troubleshooting the problems caused.<br />
<br />
No experience with this product, just an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">30th May 2014, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">The product works as advertised.  Like any product that accesses tables in Baan/LN, the author has to know about the table structure and relationships to reduce full table reads.  The language and views will provide necessary information to the users.  We have somewhat technical folks and end-users creating and maintaining reports.<br />
<br />
There is an Excel plug in that most of the end-users use.  This lets you create the queries and views directly from Excel with output going straight to Excel.  One of the stongest parts of the product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">30th May 2014, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">vince, no doubt you can create stored procedures or even physical tables in SQL server that hosts ecq. this is one of the &quot;workarounds&quot;. with these the product can actually handle everything. that would then be another overhead. some softwares don't need as much &quot;spoon-feeding&quot;. this is possible because the product can access multiple data sources on top of the LN datasource.<br />
<br />
bushan, that would probably what's going to happen. probably the real driving factor is the end-user developing their own &quot;simple&quot; reports. i am just not used to this philosophy. during my consulting years, i only had one client (out of maybe 20) that allowed users to do their own reports. in some cases they still bother IT on the report they're developing. having said that, most users' &quot;simple&quot; report could only take me a couple of hours max, sometimes in less than 30 minutes. so to me i would rather have IT developing and get the report done correctly.<br />
<br />
baaninohio, just yesterday i spent at least half an hour teaching a user how to open a csv file in excel :) i think this would work to a certain degree too. we will have an evaluation copy pretty soon.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
