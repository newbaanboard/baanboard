Baan supplies sample driver code on request.<br />
Is this true, can I approach our local Baan support center requesting the driver?<br />
<br />
Much obliged!<br />

If I found this in Baan provided documents - I would call and ask.  Or maybe I would do it online. The worst that they can say is that it is not covered under your maintenance agreements. If you do give them a call please let us know what happens.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbclark79</div><div class="date">2nd August 2002, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a $BSE/bin/lib/ddc directory available per every installation of Baan.  Within the &quot;source&quot; subdirectory is a ddc_driver.c file that can be compiled and used a very generic and basic driver to demonstrate how DDC is used.  This driver reads information from an ASCII file and not directly from an RF Scanner.  It can also be used as a starting point for a developer to build their own robust DDC driver. <br />
<br />
In addition, there is also a &quot;doc&quot; directory that contains additional DDC information.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">2nd August 2002, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks chaps, I posted a  call on support.baan.com. They refered me through to solution 7869. We never had the ddc software loaded. Strange as it seems we've always received the apilib.Z file as part of the portingset, however an uncompress always yielded the file apilib (without an extension). Now how was I to know that that's a tar archive  :D. I've extracted all the goodies, source, includes and examples - yahoo new toys! Although I haven't been able to compile the ddc_driver.c file yet - some obscure errors. Should I start a new thread regarding this problem with the driver and if so, where? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd August 2002, 14:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I would start a new thread in this forum about the errors while compiling.  That way people could find the solution you posted(thanks) and find how you resolved the error issue by searching for DDC. At least I hope someone can answer you question.<br />
<br />
Also thought I would mention that I found our ddc directory under $BSE/api/ddc.<br />
