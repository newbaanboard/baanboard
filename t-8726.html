<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RAMSBaan</div><div class="date">4th February 2003, 19:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
Can I use DDC module in Baan for creating an interface with third part package ( not any third party hand held device) ? If yes how the function servers can be called without third party DDC drivers or is it necessay to have one?<br />
Main doubt  is  whether there should be a middleware to talk to ddc server and thirdparty package, if not how can it be done? or this can be achived by AFS without having a costly middleware?<br />
Please let me know about this. <br />
Thank you<br />

I think the answer is yes.  As long as you can extract(or import data )to the third party package then you could use DDC or API function servers to interface to Baan. For example - With VB you can call DLL's or you can directly use the API code.  I have only played with this, but it is possible.  Just beware that this may sound simple, but in reality it could be complicated.  This all depends on what you are actually trying to accomplish.<br />

There is overhead for handheld menus and other handheld field control features built into the DDC.  The DDC requires the middleware ddc driver to function.  That piece bridges between the Baan DDC module, which is message/transaction based, to the handheld.  You can purchase one as you mentioned, or attempt to write your own - Baan has published DDC Middleware standards to start from.  My company does a lot of DDC's and a lot of other types of coding as well.  In the past, we have used the ddc to interface to 3rd party products, even if it's just to use the DDC Function Server Generator to get nice 3gl versions of the Baan 4gl code.   The DDC Module provides good logging and testing capabilities.   However, with the introduction of AFS, I would not suggest you use the DDC module to do anything but interface to handhelds or the palm pilot styles interfaces.   With AFS coding you can call the Baan sessions without the source as needed in the DDC's.     (You can combine the DDC with AFS coding to get around the source code needs of the DDC.  But still, the DDC has a lot of overhead directed specifically at handhelds, and the middleware is an expense or a big project.)<br />
<br />
There are lots of ways to call the AFS's from outside of Baan not using the DDC.  Some free, some not.  Off my head, I know you can call Baan libraries (AFS code) from Visual Basic using OLE instructions, and from Excel.   There are samples of this type of coding on these boards.  You can go up the $$ scale with interfaces such as Cordies and OpenWorld, which provide development environments, testing and logging capabilities for you.<br />
<br />
Hope something in there helps - good luck!</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply. We are in a discussion of creating interface with baan without Middleware like OW /MQ. We can't afford it now, so we are looking into different solutions avaiable and i looked into DDC , then into AFS. So I feel like I can have a mechanism to call in this fasion<br />
Third party apps=&gt; AFS-&gt;AFSDLL-&gt; Baan session.  Mostly the third party apps will be JAVA/VB based system. Any suggestion is always welcome. Thank you.<br />
Lets see  how it goes.<br />

I have not really done anything in a production environment, but I have used it to call a Baan DLL with the parameters needed to run a AFS or API type function server.  Of course I only tested this in excel and it did work.<br />
<br />
I believe Al Smith uses VB and files to talk to and from Baan using VB.  He has some posts on the board about using VB.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
If you're C oriented like me you can use C# to interface with AFS, you can turn the Baan Type Library into a .NET assembly and use it like a class.<br />
I also had to look into making handheld wireless scanners work with Baan (receptions).<br />
After some investigation and reading through this forum and also with the help of the gurus out here (thank Marks and others) I decided to go for AFS and I'm happy I did.<br />
I used Wavelink to interface with the wireless scanners (we have different models) which also provides a COM interface. So I developed the wireless interface using C#, a console program that talks with Baan&amp;handheld using C# (this was needed because the OLE object opens the option window which in turn created problems with the wireless scanner) and the Baan DLL. <br />
I runned into all kinds of trouble with it (especially making the receipts AFS work) but it's working very well now. Also by starting with receipts I got some experience with AFS and have done more function servers without many problems. <br />
<br />
I would go for AFS because:<br />
a) You can use VB/C# and easily interface with DLL's you create inside Baan.<br />
b) AFS simulates user entries so you get all the standard validations.<br />
c) Sooner or later users will want to automate several Baan functions (fill SO from file, fill PO from file, etc) so it's a good investment to learn AFS.<br />
<br />
Hope that helped,</div></div><hr />
