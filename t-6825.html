<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">23rd September 2002, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I also had this error but I don't remember the exact circumstances. You will have to trace the communication between Baan, the Crystal Baan Server (the part of Crystal Enterprise for Baan that does the communtication with Baan, interprets the XML File and upload it on the server), and Crystal Enterprise itself. Baan Support and Crystal support did help me, <br />
probably you can find something in the knowledge bases of either Baan or Seagate. (By the way, the communication between the two support organizations seemed to work amazingly well).<br />
<br />
I know that you can set some parameter within the Windows registry of the crystal Baan server that will make the crystal Baan server produce some (really helpful) log files.<br />
<br />
In my case the problem ended up as related to our german version of Crystal, because the adminstrators group in crystal enterprise default installation is &quot;Administratoren&quot; in german, while the Baan server had &quot;Administrators&quot; hardcoded. (Or something like that...)<br />
<br />
There should also be a document to be found at www.support.baan.com (in the user documentation section) on the Baan-Crystal-Connection. You should be able to download it from there.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help you, don't hesitate to log a case at baan support. The Baan-Seagate connection is still new, and not yet and on an install-and-it-will-work-always-without-any-trouble <br />
level. (Nevertheless, I believe it to be the<br />
future of Baan reporting)<br />
