How to set the value of check box using stpapi.* command. <br />
<br />
The stpapi.put.field() take the string value only to set the variable.<br />

<br />
Thanks friends, but problem is still there. I think its not due to the incorrect domain or some thing like that. I tried the same thing with RFQ session (tdpur1401m000) its give the same error but there is no such situation like in reprint invoice session where text boxes enabled after setting the value of check box. Any idea ? The same code is works fine with the Print Sales order (tdsls4405m000) and Print Purchase Order (tdpur4401m000) session.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

<br />
Mark, I put the code in the debug mode and found the things,<br />
<br />
in the form.init section the piece of code is there <br />
<br />
form.sel.by.br = tcyesno.no<br />
sel.by.inv     = tcyesno.no<br />
disable.fields(&quot;brid.f&quot;)<br />
disable.fields(&quot;brid.t&quot;)<br />
disable.fields(&quot;sfcp.f&quot;)<br />
disable.fields(&quot;sfcp.t&quot;)<br />
disable.fields(&quot;ityp.f&quot;)<br />
disable.fields(&quot;ityp.t&quot;)<br />
disable.fields(&quot;idoc.f&quot;)<br />
disable.fields(&quot;idoc.t&quot;)<br />
<br />
that set the values of form.sel.by.br &amp; sel.by.inv and disabled all objects.<br />
<br />
In my code, its is supposed that when these statements executed <br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(strip$(progname),&quot;form.sel.by.br&quot;,str$(tcyesno.no)) <br />
stpapi.put.field(strip$(progname),&quot;sel.by.inv&quot;,str$(tcyesno.yes))<br />
<br />
the values of variables should be set and corresponding events should called as follows: <br />
<br />
field.form.sel.by.br:<br />
when.field.changes:<br />
	set.fields.to.initial.values(1)<br />
	enable.disable.form.fields()<br />
before.display:<br />
	enable.disable.form.fields()<br />
<br />
field.sel.by.inv:<br />
when.field.changes:<br />
	set.fields.to.initial.values(2)<br />
	enable.disable.form.fields()<br />
before.display:<br />
	enable.disable.form.fields()<br />
<br />
function enable.disable.form.fields()<br />
{<br />
	if form.sel.by.br = tcyesno.no then<br />
		disable.fields(&quot;brid.f&quot;)<br />
		disable.fields(&quot;brid.t&quot;)<br />
	else<br />
		enable.fields(&quot;brid.f&quot;)<br />
		enable.fields(&quot;brid.t&quot;)<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
	if sel.by.inv = tcyesno.no then<br />
		disable.fields(&quot;sfcp.f&quot;)<br />
		disable.fields(&quot;sfcp.t&quot;)<br />
		disable.fields(&quot;ityp.f&quot;)<br />
		disable.fields(&quot;ityp.t&quot;)<br />
		disable.fields(&quot;idoc.f&quot;)<br />
		disable.fields(&quot;idoc.t&quot;)<br />
	else<br />
		enable.fields(&quot;sfcp.f&quot;)<br />
		enable.fields(&quot;sfcp.t&quot;)<br />
		enable.fields(&quot;ityp.f&quot;)<br />
		enable.fields(&quot;ityp.t&quot;)<br />
		enable.fields(&quot;idoc.f&quot;)<br />
		enable.fields(&quot;idoc.t&quot;)<br />
	endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
and in function &quot;enable.disable.form.fields()&quot;, the state of the objects will be set again as enabled as expected. Actually these events are not executed and all objects remains disabled. How should I send an stpapi request that these &quot;field.form.sel.by.br&quot; &amp; &quot;field.sel.by.inv&quot; section should executed on change of values.<br />

<br />
He did not resolve, and as you see I posted there that I have had problems with this via the API's as well.   As usual, make sure you have the most updated API libraries as well as the most updated session script to see if Baan has made any corrections in this area recently, it seems to be a problem.<br />
<br />
Your flow shows what it should be doing, but what is it really doing?  As Mark suggests, debug that all the way through, starting from the function server - you will see it call all the session code as you walk through if that is in debug as well.  See if it hits your sections, if you can get any clue from there. <br />
<br />
One additional suggestion I have - the Wrapper programming tools (RMCgen, QKEY, 'rush'), and I can really speak only for ours (RMCgen), can generate a callable library from a session, and they do not use API calls to do this, and they do not require the source or changing the source.  They could be an alternate solution when the API's are not working well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th June 2004, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Was just reading this in the AFS document:<br />
<br />
&quot;Note that no field sections in the script are executed during the put.field call, so no validation is performed. These sections are called when all fields are processed for an insert or update call.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was hoping a save might work.  You can also try the insert with &amp; without the do.update set to true.  I am just trying to figure out a method of getting the when.field.changes event to get activated.  The last resort would be to modify the session itself, but I was trying to avoid recommending that.<br />

Mark, I tried with all possibilities of insert, update and delete methods, but the error message remains same with these command i.e. &quot;Command Disabled&quot;. No method helps to call &quot;when.field.changes&quot; event.<br />
<br />
some other idea, I dont wanted to update the standard session.<br />

<br />
I have check the same thing with Print RFQ's session (tdpur1401m000). There is nothing like the enable and disable of input filds on selection of any check box as it is in Reprint Invoice session. But this session is still giving the same error message &quot;Command disabled&quot;. I think the problem is some thing else, its not that the input fields are disabled. The same piece of code works well with Print Sales Order and Print Purchase Order session. Why its work with some sessions and not working with the other session. <br />
<br />
The print RGQ's session is quit simple, and supposed to run well as POR and SOR sessions working. I think we were at the wrong track, it could be one of the reason that &quot;when.field.changes&quot; event not fired as expected. But there is some thing else that cause that error or it is a general error message returned by the stpapi commands in all cases when command fails.<br />
<br />
One more thing, I supposed that the following command should run and excute a function in the specified session<br />
<br />
stpapi.form.command(strip$(progname), 5, &quot;choice.cont.process&quot;, errmsg )<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
stpapi.form.command(strip$(progname), 2, &quot;choice.cont.process&quot;, errmsg )<br />
<br />
It is stated in the AFS document that for BaanERP use this command instead of <br />
<br />
stpapi.continue.process(strip$(progname), errmsg)<br />
<br />
<br />
but its not functioning, and no error message returned. If this commands work well then I can execute some methods in Reprint Invoice  session where object state set as enabled or disabled. I lost much time with this problem, its seems to me that it really a bug in stpapi. Any one has some clue then please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st July 2004, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing I thought of was the forms - have you compared the forms to make sure that all the same options are checked.  Just trying to think of all the things that can effect how scripts execute.<br />
<br />
It could very well be a bug in the stpapi libraries.  You might want to ask Baan.  Also you might want to get the current session object.  They may have fixed something.<br />

<br />
Friends, one more thing I found is interesting. An statement is there in the documentation of AFS about the possible errors:<br />
<br />
Command disabled; no insert/update is possible in the current state of the<br />
session.<br />
<br />
<br />
I noticed that in the two sessions, Reprint Invoice and Pringt RFQ's, where this error message retrun, there are some db.insert() statement in their script/libraries. But the other session, which works well like Print Sales Order and Print Purchase Order, there is no such db.Insert() or db.Update() statements in their script/libraries. <br />
<br />
Friends, what your openion, what is that &quot;state of session&quot;, which may be the cause of this problem. How we can manage the state of a session, which launched through the stpapi commands and run in the background. Is the predefined variable &quot;background&quot; maintains the state of the session or there is some thing else? Is there some way to maintain or set this state, any idea?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />
Mahmood</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st July 2004, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan V you are right, issue the stpapi.form.command to get to cont. process.  The cont process is odd though, it's a section in the script but on the Maintain Forms / Form Commands screen it's a function called 'exec.cont.process' The form command call must match the name of the function as defined there.   You can use form.command to call any function (5) or session (2) defined there.  Try: <br />
<br />
stpapi.form.command(strip$(progname), 5, &quot;exec.cont.process&quot;, errmsg ) <br />
<br />
I have found 'command.disabled' usually translates directly the buttons or specific drop down menu options on the form, 'Button is Greyed out', or 'I don't have a button called that'.  The db.* actions in the script are not so much of an influence.<br />
<br />
Wrappers are probably off topic now.  Lots of posts - try a search for RMCgen, rush (shareware scripts with similar concept), QKEY (FullScope product) on these boards, or pm me if you want info from us.</div></div><hr />
