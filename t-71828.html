<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sikima</div><div class="date">26th March 2019, 04:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All,<br />
I am trying create Sales Order Line using Process.SalesOrder BOD (SO Header is present and I need just enter new Line) and I got problem(s). <br />
<br />
I am wondering if somebody could provide working Process BOD XML file for creation SO Line (no header change). <br />
<br />
In general, I have problem with setup unit code (it is 'ea' and ISO code is 'EA') but in this moment, I get already present line overwritten (ie. position 10 is present and I load line = 20). On the end of process, only one SO Line is present (line =20) with information from XML file (new line).<br />
Could you please give me some hint how to force BOD to create line and don't touch existing line(s) ? :)<br />
In attached files, I am sending current setup which I tried to change over and over and getting worse after each change.<br />
The environment is LN 10.5 (in cloud)<br />

It is just last step to complete task ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">27th March 2019, 11:26</div></div><div class="posttext">How to handle missing lines in LN can be influenced. The BOD documentation is explaining that:<br />
If an existing sales order line is not present in the received BOD,<br />
- and SalesOrder/SalesOrderHeader/UserArea/Property/NameValue@name is equal to 'ln.UseDeltaDetection' and SalesOrder/SalesOrderHeader/UserArea/Property/NameValue is not equal to 'false', the sales order line is deleted.<br />
- and SalesOrder/SalesOrderHeader/UserArea/Property with SalesOrder/SalesOrderHeader/UserArea/Property/NameValue@name equal to 'ln.UseDeltaDetection' does not exists, the Sales order line is deleted.<br />
- and the sales order line has a positive quantity, the sales order line is deleted.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">27th March 2019, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">You could also include just line 10, not all tags but just the linenumberto let LN know that the line need to stay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sikima</div><div class="date">27th March 2019, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I appreciate for your respond. I found that paragraph in BOD documentation but let me try put in more clear way.<br />
Here is example:<br />
 - line 10 present<br />
 - line 20 to be inserted<br />
<br />
Could you please let me know what it should be:<br />
<br />
actionCode = ????<br />
SO Line section (what it should be present along with any specific parameter)<br />
 - for line 10<br />
 - for line 20<br />
<br />
I have tried my best to understand logic behind 'DeltaDetection' but I couldn't :) <br />
<br />
If I have to specify each time what it shouldn't be deleted (to be inserted later), I am not sure how I could know that when I update line from outside world.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">27th March 2019, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">2 remarks to make it work:<br />
1) you repeat the SalesOrder section below the DataArea. That can be removed.<br />
2) on the SalesHeader please add:<br />
		&lt;UserArea&gt;<br />
			&lt;Property&gt;<br />
				&lt;NameValue name=&quot;ln.UseDeltaDetection&quot;&gt;false&lt;/NameValue&gt;<br />
			&lt;/Property&gt;<br />
		&lt;/UserArea&gt;<br />

<br />
I resolved problem with adding magic word (parameter) as per your original answer. Also, for any reason I got problem with mapper (Infor term: 'smart mapper'). I turned off that feature, removed all mappings and I did it again.<br />
Inside 15 min everything was working.<br />
<br />
I got advise directly from Infor consultant to use XSLT editor (not expert) and avoid any graphical mapping. Just in case somebody come to similar problem try this method as well.<br />
<br />
I appreciate for your help in resolving this problem.<br />
