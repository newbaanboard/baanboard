But some how the record isn't found. The return is 2 (other record found).When I check this field it's always the first record. :confused:<br />
<br />
this is the code I use:<br />
o.item is a existing item!<br />
<br />
	stpapi.put.field(&quot;cprmp2101m000&quot;,&quot;cprmp300.plnc&quot;, &quot;001&quot;)<br />
	stpapi.put.field(&quot;cprmp2101m000&quot;,&quot;cprmp300.plni&quot;, o.item)  <br />
	<br />
	ret = stpapi.find(&quot;cprmp2101m000&quot;,error.msg)<br />
	if ret=1 then<br />
		|record found perform action<br />
		stpapi.form.command(&quot;cprmp2101m000&quot;, 5, &quot;update.plan&quot;, error.msg)<br />
	else<br />
	if ret=2 then<br />
		| Check which field is found<br />
		stpapi.get.field(&quot;cprmp2101m000&quot;,&quot;cprmp300.plni&quot;, i.item)<br />
	endif<br />
	endif		<br />

Anyone has an idea?</div></div><hr />

(1)  I have had to do a find twice to get the correct record.  So see if a second find works.<br />
(2) In one multi-occ session I had to do a stpapi.change.view followed by a find.<br />
(3) And in one case I had to do a stpapi.change.view, followed by the browse.set to look through each record.<br />
<br />
No promise these will work.  Plus with your profile showing LN then I do not know if segmented items comes into play.  I do recall for segmented items if you did not put them correctly it would not find that item.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply, but it didn't solved the problem.<br />
But I found the solution, after browsing the baanboard again. :D<br />
<br />
The solution is that I have to to fill the segments for the planned item.<br />
(in this case segment 3, because planned items consists of 3 segments, the 3rd is the item-segment) <br />
<br />
So in my case it should be:<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;cprmp2101m000&quot;,&quot;cprmp300.plni.segment.3&quot;, trim$(o.item))</div></div><hr />
