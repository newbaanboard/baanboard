<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">8th June 2009, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having 2 problems with session tdsls5202m000.  <br />
<br />
First, I am archiving sales order history with flag set to archive/delete and received reference error stating &quot;Reference does not exist:  tdsls051.cpva -&gt; tipcf500.cpva [45162].<br />
<br />
I have looked at product variant 45162 and it is for sales order 193709.  The product variant did not archive when the project was archived.  Don't know why.  The project was archived when we were running in c3.  Now we are running on c4.  I have opened a case with BaaN.<br />
<br />
So while I'm waiting, I decided to run the session beginning with sales order 193710 and nothing archived and no error messages were received.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else run this?  Experienced these problems?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
