<br />
Manual Find function in the session tdpsc0191s000 is not working eventhough the record is present in the session. Find works for some records and it is not working for some other records.  As we are running the session through AFS, we face a big Problem. We have loaded the solution 10923.<br />
<br />
Please let me know what is going wrong.<br />

But, tell me did you load the data into the table using exchange scheme or using some database utility?</div></div><hr />

Are you having problems with the session when you run it manually? Or using an API process? Or is it a data integrity issue?<br />
<br />
I had no problems selecting records in the session using an api process. Are you defining the following fields? (Receipt, Packing Slip, Date, and Supplier) Are you using stpapi.change.view() or stpapi.find()?<br />
<br />
A little better description of the problem might help in getting you an answer. Don't be afraid to attach your code either.<br />
<br />
If this is an AFS/API question, it should be moved to that forum. Let us know, a moderator can do that for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I come to the said tdpsc session from 'Maintain Receipts', <br />
I have to do a stpapi.find on a particular record b4 i could do a stpapi.mark and then &quot;Save + Exit&quot;. It happenned that sometimes 'Find' and 'Mark' worked, and sometimes not.<br />
Let me say that for a batch of 50 records, it works fine for 45 cases.<br />
<br />
Even wehn I tried manually, the cursor was goin to the record sometimes and sometimes not. We just logged with Baan Support. Donno if we got a solution for that, as I left that place.</div></div><hr />

I think she put the find in a loop for 10 tries. If it made it throught the loop without finding the record then it returned an error code.  Maybe this will work in your case.<br />
