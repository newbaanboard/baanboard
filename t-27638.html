<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way of capturing the contents of the BW Error Window when making an OLE call into Baan from VB?  I have no problem returning normal error codes from within my Baan functionality.  However, if something pretty catastrophic happens, the BW window flashes and then Baan shuts down.  I've added -keeplog and -logfile filename to the BWC.  This gives some stack trace information that is helpful, but doesn't actually tell me what the error was.  I'm going to try to step through the VB in debugger to see if there is a point where the BW Error is visible before Baan goes away, but I was hoping for something less interactive to use in the future.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried setting option in the option dialog box.  According to this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6783) you can set these options in the bwc file.  What I did was to log into baan, start option dialog, check show messages, check output to file.  This created a bwtrace.log under C:\Program Files\Baan\log.  I then forced a form error.  The file contains a lot of stuff, but I did see the error.  I have not really looked at how to set this in the bwc file, but again, according to the other thread you can.  I am not sure if this helps or not, but just wanted to mention it.</div></div><hr />

I'm probably going to ask a rather silly question given my lack of knowledge on the technical stuffs, but here it is:<br />
Is it the -mdebug option? I tried searching that document for &quot;error&quot;, &quot;message&quot;, and &quot;window&quot; and the -mdebug option seems to be the closest to what we want here<br />
Thanks, guys. Pardon my &quot;non-technical&quot;ities :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th October 2006, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">No that is a good question and one I can not answer.  I tried playing with several of the commands and I could not get the &quot;show messages&quot; and &quot;output to file&quot; checked on the option dialog box.  Maybe a query to Baan could get it answered. Sorry this is not much help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th October 2006, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">See solution 148090:<br />
<br />
&quot; Turning on tracing without using Option Dialog<br />
For Baan5/Baan6 versions of BW you can also start BW with the -debug option: bw -debug<br />
In this way tracing is generated from the first moment BW starts.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wonder what might work with 4.</div></div><hr />

But probably me missing your reply is good for my fragile brain as it is getting rather overwhelmed with all this &quot;dash options&quot; stuffs. The stuffs are beginning to sink in my brain now, but please allow me some time to chew through the information more :)<br />
