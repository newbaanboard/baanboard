<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhowells</div><div class="date">23rd August 2011, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to get a custom session to recalculate and entire order after changing tdsls040.pcpr (customer for prices/discounts).  When running the sessions manually I can use &lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;P when on the Price field; which works in recalculating the discount and amount.  In the sls4102 source code it is checked in a variable called in.ret.  How can I trigger this event with AFS?<br />
<br />
FYI, tdsls4810s000 does not seem to be working.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Is there any other way to execute this - on special menu?  Can you add a button to the form?  Something like that might work.<br />
<br />
Another option - I have never used this, but I think a way you can include a session code into AFS code and call a routine in that code. Seems to me I have seen something like that, but I do not know if it would work in this case.</div></div><hr />
