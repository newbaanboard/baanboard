In AFS, when I carry out a <br />
                     stpapi.put.field(&quot;session&quot;, &quot;field&quot;, str$(value))<br />
, then            sw=stpapi.find(&quot;session&quot;, err)<br />
 and finally    stpapi.end.session(&quot;session&quot;, err). <br />
err possesses an afrase that says &quot;Process is gone&quot;.  <br />
Because this message gives me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th April 2003, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes API code works even though you get something in the message code.  The two I am most familiar with are &quot;Command Cancelled&quot; and &quot;Process is gone&quot;.  In both cases the code has usually worked, so just I code around it.  The receiving API code I am working on has this check in it:<br />
<br />
if not isspace(msg) and strip$(msg)&lt;&gt; &quot;Process is gone&quot; then<br />
<br />
<br />
In this case I know my code worked.  So if your code works, then just ignore the message.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">msanchez</div><div class="date">14th April 2003, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been seeking the because of this message, but I have not been able to resolve it, the message this stored in the dll ottstpapihand, but not itself to that owes itself its unfold, alone itself that is when I carry out a stpapi. put. field.  My program this functioning with your suggestion.  But I wanted to know the because.  If your you can consult with someone more and to communicate, thanks.  <br />
<br />
A to question in qptool6.1, when your you put &quot;: var&quot;, this the type asks yourself and value of the variable inside the select, Â¿there is perhaps a form to put the type in the script and alone to put the value when is executed?  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Beforehand many thanks Mark<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th April 2003, 22:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have usually seen this error when I am calling a sub-session from a main session.  In those cases when I process the data through the sub-session, the sub-session closes and returns control to the main session.  This happens before I do the stpapi.end on the sub-session.  Since we do not own source I can not be more specific but I think the end.program event causes this error.<br />
<br />
I have no knowledge on qptool6.1 at all so I can not help in that regards.  I would recommend posting a question in the tools forum.<br />

You can run it from a batch file and pass the needed variables if that helps.  You can try Easy SQL for similar with a generated input screen.</div></div><hr />
