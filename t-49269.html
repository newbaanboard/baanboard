<br />
Is there anybode who has experience with tuning Baan and Oracle running in client/server mode?<br />
I have a customer who wants to switch from hostmode to client/server mode. They are using Baan IVc4 and want to use oracle 10.2.0.3.0.<br />
When running is hostmode performance is fine. Eg printing all Articles within 15 seconds. When running the same session in client/server mode the same<br />
session took about 5 minutes.<br />
I am wondering if special tuning is necessary for running in client/server mode. Network looks ok. It is a 1Gbit/s network and eg ftp large files is no<br />
problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Richard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 00:22</div></div><div class="posttext">there isn't much tuning specific to a 3 tier setup. most likely it is something to do with the network (duplex settings, packet sizes, etc.)<br />
<br />
Otherwise it could be something they did in the actual move. (export/import oracle but didn't re-create statistics, re-installed oracle but didn't bother to tune it.. etc.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">17th March 2008, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Dave. Some more things that could be tested: <br />
- Did everything became slow, or a few sessions? If everything became slow, than we have to suspect the setup, else we have to determine what has changed.<br />
- Do you have a dedicated network between app and db server? It is advised to do so as the application server can generate quite some traffic.<br />
- Can you check if the connection is setup properly? Can the the database server be resolved quickly etc.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Customer is also using oracle 10.2.0.3. There are some performance issues<br />
known in this oracle release. Customer will first install the patches to see<br />
if this helps.<br />
<br />
And yes, everything became slow. There is a dedicated network between<br />
app and db server. Connection looks ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or, if the problem has been resolved, what was it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">30th May 2008, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">there are a few SQL net settings, which might be beneficial and if the problem still exist, then I will did them up for you.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, for a single user host mode is always faster, than client-server, simply due to the network overhead. The question is, how many users do you need, so that client-server starts making sense?<br />
<br />
In the last 10 years I have seen many customers going from client-server to hostmode due to that reason. Single HW boxes bacame so fast, that even for a 1000 user installation, hostode is better than client-server. I have a real life example of this of a customer running on HP-Ux in Switzerland.<br />

*The* Oracle patch does not exists :D. Can you be a bit more specific what kind of patch they installed? In 3-tier it could well be that they upgraded the client aso to 10g or so.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
