<br />
Since some days you can access the Baan user docs there. A search for &quot;Archiving&quot; should deliver at least one result - I definitely know there is a standard document on archiving.<br />

We used a whitpaper from Baan that described the technical and functional approach and the Luminux Archive Indicator report (I do think you can get this report from Baan). <br />
An exampel of the report can be found at:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6663&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=1<br />
<br />
If you want the whitepaper, send me your e-mail adress, and I'll send it to you.<br />
<br />
We didn't have any problems at all when we did the archive job. We followed the approach in the whitepaper, and the result was excellent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">24th September 2002, 08:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Standard Baan archiving means copying data from your production company to another company (the archive company). The main purpouse of this is to reduce table size which will increase system performance and maintainability (eg. you are faster in creating test environments then). <br />
<br />
This archiving is part of Baan. No other software has to be bought, however, if you have modified software components you should check if the standard archiving routines will do or if you have to modify the archiving routines also (e.g. to archive additional tables).<br />
<br />
For any other &quot;archiving&quot; - like storing data as &quot;printout&quot; on CD-Roms, microfilm..., Document Management Systems, whatever, additional Software (like a DMS, an interface) or services (like microfilming) will be required of course.<br />
<br />
The Luminux/Baan Support Eye Tool mentioned is additional software that will help you analyze your system configuration. It doesn't do any archiving by it's own.<br />

<br />
1 Does Baan have any limits on filesizes beyond which it wont function?<br />
<br />
2 Having archived at say 4b2 and now on 4c4 what are the options to be able to review the data archived under 4b2 ?<br />
<br />
Does Baan provide special programs for &quot;upgrading&quot; the archived data to 4c4 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maaxim</div><div class="date">25th September 2002, 03:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes we are doing couple of Baan archiving projects. Let me know if you need something specific. Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">25th September 2002, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Frank, <br />
the file size should be limited only by the database you use (if the database has a limit).<br />
<br />
However, there is a semantic limit: You can run out of number: eg. you only have 999999 sales oder numbers. So you will have to archive if you produce many orders a day.<br />
<br />
As long as 4b data is archived within another Baan company it may be converted the same way as you converted your operational data to c4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">25th September 2002, 10:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks Ulrich !<br />
<br />
With respect to sales /purchase order range I was told that on reaching 999999 it is possible to reset 3 digit code to 001 again as the previous record of 001 had a timestamp in the index with uniquly identified it . Is this correct ? but not the best practice ?<br />
<br />
Also on the conversion of archive data from 4b to 4c I take it then that the Baan programs take into account tables that have been dropped during the original archiving process and do not &quot;complain&quot; about them when the archive data is upgraded. <br />
Being sceptical , has someone proved this ?<br />
<br />

<br />
sasa <br />
<br />
please take a look at www.cofiba.de. Cofiba is a german consulting company and made a lot of work around archiving.<br />
<br />
The main features are:<br />
<br />
automatic initialisation for archive company<br />
extensions for sales and purchase<br />
export nearly every archived data to ascii and delete</div></div><hr />

Is there not a way to setup archiving rules for sessions and then run a batch process on a monthly basis to archive data based on the rules.</div></div><hr />

you can find information about archiving on my website.<br />
<br />
I'm using an archive planning tool that checks the data on a system and automatically generates an archive plan and other information needed for archiving. I'm convinced it delivers the most efficient approach to archiving currently available. <br />
<br />
Please find examples on www.maxsc.com. The tool did run on Baan 5 and Baan 4 systems and I've received very positive feedback from all clients who used it. I also offer all necessary add-on sessions for Baan 4 and Baan 5. Please find a list on the same website. You're welcome to contact me if you have any questions.<br />
