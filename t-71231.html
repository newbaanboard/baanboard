<br />
We have created Custom BOD to Update Picked Quantity by reading Database of another Application. We are able to Test the same from Test Business Object Method(tlbct3232m000) session. Now we have created document Flow to read database using Database Connection Point and update ERP LN using Custom BOD. In One View, we are able to see only Process BOD from Database to ERP LN but no Acknowledgement BOD. I have modified Custom DLL of Custom BOD to create one File in Temp directory of ERP LN but no file has been generated whereas when I am calling it from tlbct3232m000 session it is creating file and updating picking qty. I have checked General Log, Database Connection point log file but now errors. Also no error BOD in ION. <br />
<br />
May I know how to troubleshoot this Custom BOD. <br />
<br />
Any help appreciated. <br />

I have fixed issue with DLL and we are able to get called from ION. I am assuming even we have Issue with DLL, ION should call Custom DLL and we could have see file created(as modified custom DLL for Testing) for each call from ION. <br />
