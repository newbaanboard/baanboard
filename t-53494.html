 <br />
I know that the C-Interface is used to call BaaN dlls (that are converted to C like libraries using bic_cstub6.1) outside of BaaN. But, what else is involved in making this happen?? Is there a C-Interface server that needs to be started?<br />
<br />
I am working on project that would require interfacing with BaaN from external programs. I know I could try OLE, DDC or BOI etc., but I came across this method and want to see if it can help.<br />

Any help is much appreciated.<br />

we recently had to move one customer from Baan IV to ERPLN. They had an existing interface to industrial scales implemented using the C-Interface. We could successfully port this to ERPLN. There was no C-Server involved. Basically you write a C-Programm using the Headers provided and compile and link this to the shared libraries provided by the porting set. When the compiled  object is run an instance of bshell is started automagically! An expert c-programmer (which i am not) should have not much of a problem in understanding the basics by looking at the examples provided in the $BSE/api/examples/cint/ folder. Here you find a c program &quot;ci_example.c&quot; a Baan DLL script &quot;src_dll&quot; and the makefile(s). Very clever stuff and it realy works!!</div></div><hr />
