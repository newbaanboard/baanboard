Can anyone tell me how I can get myself started?  I've read through the DDC user guide and I'm understanding the concept and what each section does, but I'm not sure how to get myself started.  Maybe, its so very simple and I'm just making it much more difficult than it needs to be.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Here you can send a message directly from Baan to a DDC Server. For getting a &quot;feeling&quot; on how this messaging works you could start here - without any external system parts needed yet.<br />

The test function server session you speak about does not go through the DDC.  It is only for testing the function server capabilities.  I have seen several instances where function servers will operate in test function server but not in the DDC.  You also cannot acquire certain characteristic which are available such as default values.  I am not saying that you shouldn't jump in, just make sure you know where you are jumping.</div></div><hr />
