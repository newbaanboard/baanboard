<br />
We would like to implement the purchase statistics module (our environment is BaaNIVc4 / DB is Oracle 4.0).<br />
<br />
The problem we encountered is that the session &quot;Update Purchase Statistics&quot; is running a very long time and it creates huge temp files. We had to kill the session after 48 hours...<br />
<br />
Do you know how we could improve the performance of this session? I received a patch from BaaN Support to improve the performance, but I'm rather sceptical that it will work...<br />
<br />
Any hints would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
<br />
Erik</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please request the latest object of the session compiled in profile mode from BAAN Support.<br />
It is important to allow the session to run completely. The output should give BAAN Support enough info what is happening here.<br />
<br />
Are you really running Oracle 4.0? <br />
<br />

<br />
In Baan Standard, if you start the update sales statistics,  a lot of statistic-tables would be deleted, row by row ! (very nice).<br />
<br />
I had created a small baan program, which delete the tables with db.clear.table.<br />
<br />
Then create a job, first session is delete the baan tables, then run the sessions for update sales statistics.<br />
