<br />
I'm hoping that someone out there has experience in configuring the NAZDAQ B2Email Merge product on Baan 4c4.<br />
<br />
Everything is installed correctly, and in fact it does wok (I recieve the standard message showing failed and successful processes) but I am having some issue actually merging documents in.<br />
<br />
I have set up a few simple reports in tccom2mergc (both for manual run and in jobs), but the reports are not getting picked up properly.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any tips or tricks that they can share?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why don't you just mail Nazdaq your question?<br />
They should be able to support the product they sold you.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The origian post was made during afterhours for NAZDAQ and was in no way intended to look unfavorible on NAZDAQ's support staff. They have been more then helpful in this matter.<br />
<br />
The intent was to see if anyone had been in a similar situation before as I was attempting to wrap up a project that I am working on as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
NAZDAQ support has been, and remains a top-of-the-class orginazation. <br />
<br />
My appologies for any confusion in this matter.</div></div><hr />
