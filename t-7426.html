   We are planning to use DDC Function Servers as the handheld device has to update BaaN.The handheld device uses a VB program.I understand that the handheld device has to connect to DDC function server in BaaN.How should this be done ? <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">The handhelds talk to the Baan DDC Server through Middleware.   That's the piece of software that talks to the server and the handheld, does all the logging, etc.   That is a piece that you can purchase from several Baan Partners / Middleware vendors - my company included.   (RMCis, also, Connectware and I believe Full Scope all offer middleware solutions.  Probably others, you can search the forum for a thread with a discussion on all.)<br />
<br />
I have heard of some people writing their own - people were posting suggestions on these boards.  You can try and search this forum and see what progress they have made.  Baan released a set of Middleware compliance guidelines that any developed middleware should support.  I have only a very out of date hard copy - pls. contact Baan for an updated copy if you wish to persue this on your own.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are already using VB on the handhelds, you already doing this a little different than the ususal DDC setup.  Usually, just an ASCII interface of fields as communciated by the Baan DDC through the Middleware.  If your system already knows how to look up, display and do other things through VB, you may want to investigate the VB / OLE options to call Baan routines instead...?</div></div><hr />
