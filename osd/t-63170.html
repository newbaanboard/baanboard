We are running our production BaanIVc4 (Informix) and planning to upgrade to LN ERP, a full-blown LN ERP with 100 users license. We are thinking of moving away from Informix to Oracle 11g database. To save the cost we would like to select standard edition of Oracle 11g database. From sizing model and capacity planning, the Oracle 11g standard edition has enough power to support our production.  If you have any experience with Oracle 11g database standard edition, please let us know your thoughts. <br />
Our concerns are that the standard edition is lacking of many features. For example in the Manageability area: <br />
Oracle Change Management Pack<br />
Oracle Configuration Management Pack<br />
Oracle Diagnostic Pack<br />
Oracle Tuning Pack<br />
Oracle Provisioning and Patch Automation Pack<br />
<br />
Do we really need the Enterprise edition of Oracle 11g for LN ERP? Which third party tools can we use to replace those manageability features above? Please let us know the pros and cons if we select Oracle 11g standard edition. <br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
In order to use Oracle with Infor you don't need the enterprise edition. It's also rather expensive compared to the standard edition.<br />
<br />
In my opinion you can do perfectly without these options. If you run a few queries to monitor the free available space and make sure your statistics keep up to date it should run fine. For monitoring you can also use free tools like zabbix or nagios.<br />
<br />
Subscribe to the mailing lists of oracle in order to be informed when they supply new security updates. <br />
<br />
Other things like diagnostics and performance tuning can be done manually if needed or with help of Oracle or Infor (depends where you buy your oracle licenses). A great help can be sql-developer and/or db-console.<br />
<br />
In my personal opinion the additional costs of an enterprise edition are not needed.<br />
<br />
Ever thought about db2? Also a good RDBMS, even the express version should be able to handle 100 users without any problem.<br />
