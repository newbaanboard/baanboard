<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chet Weber</div><div class="date">12th August 2002, 04:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to migrate data in a BAAN 4C Oracle database to a BAAN 5 database on Oracle 8i. Do you need specific data migration tools  to do this? If so are any provided in BAAN 5?  Can I just use Oracle export/import?  Has anyone done this?  What is the easiest way to do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">But as usual, that's probably not an option, right?<br />
<br />
You definitely do not NEED data migration tools to do this. Unless Baan has changed their policy since the last time I did an upgrade, these tools are not provided with Baan and do not come for free.<br />
<br />
Oracle import/export will work, but you need to map out what you want to load where. Most tables are significantly different between the two versions.<br />
<br />
Another option is using Baan Exchange. The advantage of using exchange is that you'll have the DAL functionality to slap you on the wrist when you are attempting a boo-boo.</div></div><hr />

I am trying to do the same to create a test environment but I<br />
haven't come that far till now, I hope there is someone out<br />
there who has the tools to do so but I do not get any answers<br />
on this post.<br />
<br />
Hope you have more luck to find a solution, I am wondering<br />
if Baan knows the consequenses from this shitty thing, if we<br />
cannot test as administrators how can we recommend the<br />
migration from B4c4 to 5.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 22:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure that Baan is recommending this upgrade just for the sake of upgrading, 'latest and greatest' reasons.  You would need a very good functional / ROI reason for upgrading from Baan IV to V.  <br />
<br />
There does exist a tool, but only Certified Upgrade Consulting Companies have access to it, of which we are not one, so I cannot speak in detail of it.  However, I have seen the documentation on it, and it is reasonable for it to require consulting to run.  You must redefine your business processes through pilot room testing, and put the new parameters into the tool as you export the Baan IV data, so the data comes over how you would need it in the new company.  The tool also requires you to move all of your 'transactional' data through to processed delivered sales orders, and other processes to eliminate transactional data.  They also recommend archiving.<br />
<br />
I won't mention the price tag, as I understand it will fluxuate greatly depending on who you get to do it.   You will probably have a consultant on site, and the minimum is 6 months.  I BELIEVE (do not quote me) that Full Scope is a migration partner.  <br />
<br />
Some are trying on their own, to varying degrees of success.  If you choose to do so, you must do all your own data mapping, and the tables have changed a great deal.    As mentioned above, you will need to do Pilot Room testing and develop new business procedures before you ever get to migrating the transactional data.  You will also need a lot of patience.</div></div><hr />

data as we use it now!! It is not intented to do an upgrade just <br />
for the sake of &quot;upgrading is better&quot; but only to test what we can expect when moving to BAAN ERP, we are working with BAAN for almost 4 years now and we have a fine group of key users who can deal with the expected problems, I will and cannot afford the use of consultants only for a small test, the setup of complete data transactions in a test environment will take to much time from the key users, IT is not our core business so I have to do this on my own.<br />
<br />
If you have the documentation I would appeciate if you could sent me that!!!<br />

<br />
you should write a mail to migrationsolution@baan.com. I heard, that they offer to (test)migrate customers data on one of their own servers.<br />
<br />
The migration software for IVc4 - 5.0c is available and works quite good. We did a couple of tests within the last 8 month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I viewed the hard version of the documentation at a client site that was considering the purchase of the tool &amp; services.  I don't have a copy, sorry.<br />
<br />
It did not have table mapping or such, just documentation on the upgrade sessions</div></div><hr />
