<br />
1) There is indeed a combo mode for AS/400. And it performs better than the non-combo. I think most customers work in combo mode.<br />
<br />
2) Maybe if they will support it for ERP LN. This because ERP LN only supports Level 2 drivers. The parse of queries is very expensive and there only it gains when bshells are up and running for hours. SSA needs to do lots of development to get it running with acceptable performance. With I don't expect on the very short term.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

I heard from Baan that, combo mode is already available for AS/400 and one of the AS/400 customers in Italy already using this mode. You are saying that Baan going to release for ERP LN!!!! I am confused. Please clarify.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Q1 was about combo: this is generally available for AS400<br />
Q2 was about Level 2: this will maybe become available when LN will be supported.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

I am saving 8-10% CPU through this configuration...Users clearly noticed this change.<br />
<br />
Just want to share this info to all.<br />
