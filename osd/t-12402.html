<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FriarTuck</div><div class="date">28th July 2003, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I was curious to know if anyone has knowledge of an education course that would cover the various &quot;nuances and oddities&quot; of Baan.<br />
<br />
Put another way, I'm the UNIX admin/Oracle guy here and don't have much in the way of practical knowledge of how Baan &quot;works&quot; with the database.  Although we have a Baan programmer and an application specialist, their knowledge doesn't translate well to my arena of expertise.<br />
<br />
I am attempting to find a course that would bridge the gap in my knowledge.  Perhaps there is a &quot;Concepts&quot; guide similar to Oracle Concepts guide available online.<br />
<br />
I'm not so much concerned with how Baan (the application) works as I am with how Baan (the drivers, et. al) work with the database.  Point of example: our programmer tells me today that the work he did over the weekend &quot;dropped the tables then rebuilt them with the flat file export&quot;.  Looking at the database, Baan (the application) decided that it knew best how to lay out tables in the database.<br />
<br />
There has to be a &quot;Baan for Oracle DBAs&quot; course somewhere.  Even a darn webpage I can read...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever seen the Oracle Roadmap for Baan? An excellent doc covering alot of technical ins and outs on the Baan/Oracle combination. It's a bit outdated as I don't think Oracle maintains it anymore but you should be able to get from your local Oracle representative.</div></div><hr />
