<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scotty</div><div class="date">5th October 2005, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: Hi everyone. After installing Service Pack 15-16-17-18 on BaaN IV c4, huge performance problem during approx 30' every day roughly at the same time. Probably someone running a session with a weird behavior since SPs. Any idea how to find out what's causing the problem ?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

So basically you need is to monitor Baan user sessions for a certain period of time.<br />
1. Or you turn user history on and check the history log file - not a good choice.<br />
2. Or (my prefered way at least) to build a UNIX shell script around bshcmd to check for each Baan user logged in what sessions he is running and log the output (and run in a loop or thru cron during the time you want to analyse). If this is your option then follow up on this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=12125&amp;highlight=bshcmd).<br />
<br />
After some session(s) are identified as possible culprits, you can run them with tracing (search the threads for DBSLOG or read that thread mentioned asstarting point and search on the bschmd parameters) to see if they are causing the problem and why.</div></div><hr />

Assuming you named it db_resource.  It dramatically improved performance for us.<br />
