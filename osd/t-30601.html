<br />
I need to make a change to our item master which will mean the table will require re-configuring. We have 6 Baan companies with populated item masters so this process takes over 24 hours. As it's difficult to find a suitable time to take the Baan system from the business for this long I'm wondering if there is a quicker way. The change I need to make is to add an additional column at the end of the tiitm001 table.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if there is any other way to make this change with having to run a re-configure for 24 hours. Our item master is relatively small so I'm sure other people have come across this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">31st January 2007, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">rename refint6.1 to refint6.1.real<br />
<br />
create a shell script in $BSE/bin called refint6.1<br />
<br />
#!/bin/ksh<br />
refint6.1.real -rs &quot;$*&quot;<br />
<br />
should be much faster if your item master is as small as you say.<br />
The time must be being spent on refint, which is worthless unless you plan on deleting a lot of texts soon.<br />
<br />
also, you can set:<br />
ORA_MAX_ARRAY_FETCH=1000<br />
ORA_MAX_ARRAY_INSERT=1000<br />
RDS_FULL=1000<br />
SSTS_SET_ROWS=1000<br />
<br />
in your BW or unix environment before you start.<br />

a) Are those commands &quot;ORA_MAX_ARRAY_FETCH=1000&quot; etc entered in the Command field of a BW Configuration?<br />
<br />
b) Are the above mentioned commands Oracle based? If so, then any idea whats the equivalent ones for SQL Server?<br />

Appreciate your input on this..<br />

<br />
although I like 'hacky' tricks, there is one flaw with the proceeding you suggested.<br />
I haven't got access to a Baan system atm, so I don't know the table name, but there is a tools table which specifies the tables columns. You would have to add the new column here with ttaad4100, or the next CRDD (maybe run in far future) will lead to serious confusion.<br />
But generally your idea sounds pretty good to me.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">1st February 2007, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually my idea is to do the normal customzation within Baan, but not the CRDD. This way the required ttadv table will have all entries.<br />
<br />
Wether it works is something different.</div></div><hr />

I'm starting to get 'cold feet' and thinking that I'm best sticking to the tools provided to avoid getting in to a real mess if things go wrong.<br />

Yeah, my solution was for unix and oracle.. <br />
<br />
I'd check the SQL drive manual for equivilant commands, but in my experience they're not needed.<br />

That's essentitally what NPRao will refer to as &quot;The Boeing Method&quot;.<br />
Just skip d and e and use internal export / import and you're fine.<br />
<br />
Also - that's what Baan 5 and LN do automatically. <br />

You can at least use the ORA_MAX_ARRAY= stuff i mentioned, those are just environment variables for processing large amounts of data.<br />
<br />
Also, if you choose &quot;repair references to parent only&quot; (if that option is available for you on the convert/create screen.) it will be the same as my script.<br />

<br />
Made the table change in Baan, CRDD without re-org.This gave me a *.new table def file. Removed record from ttadv501. Altered the table in Oracle and copied the 'new' table def file to replace the existing one.<br />
<br />
More or less what you guys suggested. <br />
<br />
The only thing now is that my overtime for doing this type of change is dramatically reduced!!</div></div><hr />
