SSA claims that this version of Baan won´t support Itanium based machines.<br />
Of course you can always try to run a 32 bit application in a 64 bit environment but I don't think it´s a good option.<br />
Perhaps you should think about placing the database server in the Itanium machine and the Baan server in a 32 bit machine.</div></div><hr />
