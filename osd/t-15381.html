<br />
I've to change the Baan Server.<br />
Actually we have a sunsolaris on Unix.<br />
We want to install Baan on a Windows 2003 server.<br />
<br />
I want to have information about :<br />
- security (have you more problem on windows than unix)<br />
- capacity (what about baan on windows)<br />
- response time<br />
- other information on such migration<br />
<br />
Thanks for all information</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">19th May 2004, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Security: for virusses you need to install the available patches even if you don't have your machine connected to the network. One day someone will attach an infected notebook to your network and your machine will be infected. However you should do this as well for your Unix server but the risk is lower that you get infected.<br />
<br />
Capacity: should be no problem but I don't have experience with windows and more than 80 users.  We run maximum of 80 users on a application/database server with each 2 CPU's in a cluster environment.<br />
<br />
Response time: if configured well it's ok. Not worse/better compared to Unix.<br />
<br />
The main reason why I prefer a Unix environment is that I have more possibilities to build my own scripts ( I am not familiar with scripting possibilities on windows there is a lot possible but not so easy with batch files so you should consider using windows host scripting). I don't like the fact that I have to use tools in order to take controle of the console, or have to use terminal server (I prefer to use telnet and command line interface). <br />
<br />
Use the possibility on Windows of using an internal database driver via configuring ipc_info. This will create less processes, process handling in not the strongest point of Windows.<br />
<br />
Error messages are normally logged in the eventlog, no longer in the log files in ${BSE}/log. <br />
<br />
Hope it helps,<br />

<br />
I don't understand your point about the internal database driver via ipc_info.  Do you mean the combo bshell? If so, this is only available from Baan 5 onwards.</div></div><hr />
