<br />
we experience a sorting problem since we migrated from tbase to oracle 9i.<br />
As we are a german company, we use letters like ÖÄÜ as item descriptions, line &quot;Ölpumpe&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Now, when you use print sessions in which we can specify a print range of item descr., from-to, we find, that those items starting with ÖÄÜ are not printed.<br />
range is &quot;   &quot; to &quot;ZZZZ&quot;.<br />
<br />
problem is that oracle sorts the ÖÄÜ after &quot;Z&quot;, so no printout.<br />
<br />
when using binary sort and range up to &quot;ÿÿÿÿÿÿ&quot; it works.<br />
<br />
this would be a work-around but is not very convenient, cause we have loads of sessions that use form defaults like &quot;ZZZZZZZZZZZ&quot;, so we would have to modify them all :(<br />
<br />
any good ideas ?!?!?<br />
<br />

<br />
I guess you are now using ISO-8859-1 which is best for western europe and I would say Oracle does the right thing. I have no idea what character set T-base uses.<br />
<br />
As you already said, common usage of ÄÖÜ is in some fields such as descriptions (and hence in generated search keys). For such fields, you must not use the fix string &quot;zzz...&quot; but insead &quot;fmax($#)&quot; e.g. on form defaults or session scripts. I think you have to change your customizations here, sorry.<br />
<br />
There is another point to mention: Check your user's locale (Maintain User Data, Form 4). There is a difference between &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; and &quot;ISO_BIN&quot;. I guess you should have &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; for your problem. (Please check the different behaviour for one user first on sessions having fmax($#) as form default; don't forget to convert to runtime).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gentercz</div><div class="date">9th February 2005, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Danke Günther for your thoughts.<br />
<br />
i already changed the locale before, with no effect concerning our problem.<br />
<br />
i guess, the only possibility would be to modify all sw-components, which i don't want.<br />
OR<br />
i think i make my users change all descriptions ( or write a small query ).<br />
<br />
any more ideas ?!?!<br />

<br />
Bah! My name is Günther, not Guenther - what more should I say?<br />
<br />
Have you already tried to figure out, how much data you have to change. What about the future? Germans will enter Ölpumpe the next day, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gentercz</div><div class="date">9th February 2005, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Günther, not Guenther,<br />
<br />
would you also insist to be filed as Günther even when you know you won't get paid any commision for your orders.<br />
I guess out reps would prefer to be called Guenther and receive full commission.<br />
<br />
 :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
If you have a session with e.g. two form fields &quot;item.f&quot; and &quot;item.t&quot;, the first one should have default [x] and value (empty). The second one should have [x] and value &quot;fmax($#)&quot;.<br />
<br />
* For a user with locale &quot;ISO_BIN&quot;, the item.t field will be &quot;ZZZ...&quot;.<br />
* For a user with locale &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;, the item.t field will be &quot;ÿÿÿ...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please check that for the moment!<br />

<br />
so no need to change forms etc.<br />
