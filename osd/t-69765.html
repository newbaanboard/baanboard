If any thing happens and it causes hardware failure , then what are the things we should have so that we can restore the LN as it was earlier.<br />
<br />
What are the things we need to take into accounts.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

To be precise, all you need is a good IT Policy which includes the following - <br />
<br />
1. Ensure Proper Backups<br />
2. Ensure Proper Backups <br />
3. Ensure Proper Backups<br />
<br />
That's true. A good back-up and recover policy(for application and database) and you don't need to worry. If you have your back-up's with you, any physical damage wouldn't affect your data. Rest, if your servers can be remotely logged in, either go for a cloud based service or keep at least 2 lease lines to make sure your servers are reachable 24/7. <br />
<br />
Either hire a consultant in to help you set it up, or self-learn the things regarding databases and application data backup policies and you will be good.</div></div><hr />

Basically I want to know how to take backup of LN. Is it the sequential dump itself is the backup or any other things we need to take care.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Sequential dump will only backup the tabular data. You will need to take application data backup's plus database backup's as well.</div></div><hr />

Application data backup is the data dictionary backup , is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
application backup is $BSE<br />
<br />
and data backup is your Database backup (Oracle/MSSQL....) .<br />
<br />
