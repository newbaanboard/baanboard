<br />
anyone using Qkey on an Itanium system (HP)?<br />
<br />
We're thinking on migrating from HP PA-RISC system to HP Itanium system.  Called FullScope to make sure that Qkey is still going to work on an Itanium but got this &quot;you should not have any problems&quot; or &quot;i don't think you'll have problems&quot;.:eek: <br />
<br />
For me, should not and don't think does not cut it.  So i'm asking the Baan Community to see if somebody is running Qkey on an Itanium and if they got errors.<br />

<br />
can you give me a little more info about your system?<br />
what's your version of HP-UX?<br />
what'syour version of Baan?<br />
What's the model of the Itanium?<br />
<br />
Did you had to install a special program on HP to be able to run Qkey?<br />
Are you able to generate new QKEY scripts?<br />
<br />
From what i got from FullScope is that Qkey wasn't made for a 64 bit system and that old scripts was going to work but there wasn;t sure that we could generate new QKey scripts.<br />
<br />
HP told me that they could install an application called Aries that can run binaries of a PA-RISC.<br />
<br />
Is that what you did?<br />
<br />

Baan IVc4 SP 17<br />
I don't know the model of the server.<br />
<br />
We use Qkey v3.70 Build 75<br />
<br />
I've never heard of Aries.  I can tell you we don't use it.</div></div><hr />
