Hello,<br />
<br />
here are UNIX error codes:<br />
<br />
0: no error<br />
126: program returned exit code 126 or execve(2) failed with<br />
ENOEXEC<br />
127: program returned exit code 127 or the command was not<br />
found<br />
128+: program returned exit code &gt;128 or it was terminated by a<br />
signal<br />
255+: program was terminated by a signal (and shell behaves like<br />
ksh93)<br />
<br />
Maybe the path to your shell script is not correct.<br />
<br />

I don't think you need the sh there. Refer to the screen shot from our system.<br />
Make sure you have the appropriate shell set in your shell script:<br />
#!/bin/ksh<br />
...<br />
<br />
Post your shell script for others' reference.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
does the called script run successfully ?<br />
<br />
Try to give the whole path, like :<br />
<br />
/home/users/myuser/myscript<br />
<br />
or does your script need an environment variable, which is not set at execution of your script ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

in the job definition you only have to set the complete pathname of your shell script. The file should be executable (bit x) the the user that runs the job. If the file is a shell script, than it should start with &quot;!# /bin/sh&quot; as the first line. Moreover, the executable or shell script should return a vlid exit code, i.e. a non zero means error (and will reported in the job history), while zero mens ok.<br />
