<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">16th March 2009, 20:04</div></div><div class="posttext">When attempting to run the session for Convert SSA ERP User to Database User, we have issues.  I think the error message explains my problem, please assist ...<br />
<br />
Here are the steps we follow.<br />
<br />
<br />
1)	create user in OS – I have already created user “user01” with password “********”<br />
2)	from session ttaad2500m000 – create a new baan user by inserting a new record or copying existing user (need baan password “******”<br />
3)	change system login to user01 (if copied from some other user)<br />
4)	convert to runtime from specific menu<br />
<br />
<br />
5)	Convert SSA ERP user to database users (here database comes into picture)<br />
<br />
There are two ways <br />
<br />
5-a)	we can use existing windows authentication to access db<br />
            Press the convert button, system will prompt for sa credentials. <br />
<br />
5-b) we can create a new db user in db <br />
in this option, db user and password should be given with default password checkbox checked.<br />
It need not be same user baan user and password. We can generate a new db user and password and link to user01<br />
For convenience, we always keep it same.<br />
<br />
      In both cases, baan user is automatically linked to db <br />
<br />
6)	Convert to runtime from links between db user and baan user session if ttstpoledaemon error occurs<br />
<br />
Our case has got stuck in step 5 where we need help from infor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just so you know while answering this question, this is the configuration:<br />
<br />
BaanAppServer = Windows 2003, w/ Baan LN 6.1<br />
BaanDBServer= Windows 2003, w/ SQL 2005<br />
<br />
Users are created locally on BaanAppServer.<br />
<br />
Our current workaround is to manually create the user within SQL on the BaanDBServer, and then manually connect the BaanDBUser to the BaanUser, using a different session than this one.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, someone can have an idea of what my problem might be.<br />
<br />
Here is the error message:<br />
Error from Database: Error-1, [MSQL logon failed.  Connect error 0 from 'Microsoft-SQL-DMO (ODBC SQLState: 08001) as 'sa' to server '.' [Microsoft][OBDC SQL Server Driver][Shared Memory] SQL Server does not exist or access denied.<br />
<br />
I think my problem is that the session is attempting to connect to local BaanAppServer, rather than connect to remote BaanDBServer, since it says &quot;.&quot; ... I think that  &quot;.&quot; usually means connecting to yourself, like in most directory  languages, &quot;.&quot; means connecting to yourself.<br />
<br />
Is this my problem?  How do I repair it?  Is there a place to correct this linking?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
After repairing the config for the location of the DBServer, with the assistance of Infor, it worked. (Yes, I am so lame as to not know how to configure this stuff.)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
