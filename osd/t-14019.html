<br />
We are running BaaN IV c4 with Ms-SQL Server 7.0 as db on Win NT.<br />
Currently approx. 20 users works concurrently. <br />
<br />
Although I am not a SQL DB adminsitrator, but what I have seen is that per day db space consumption is about 50 mb which leads to approx. 1.5 gb / month usage at Database level. <br />
<br />
I really doubt that this much transactions are entered in my system, ... my intution is that somewhere space is being used , may be some logs or may be something else at database level which I don't know... may be part of db administration activity, which needs to be cleaned up.<br />
<br />
Am i thinking in right direction, if yes then what should I do.<br />
Can i verify this ?? May be some chap running baan with Ms-SQL Server 7.0 as db can help me out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">22nd December 2003, 00:41</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience is with Oracle and not MSSQL but I think you may be surprised just how much space is consumed by database growth.  <br />
<br />
For example: Some tables such as tfgld410 for which, depending on your environment, many records are added for each baan transaction, have a large number of indexes which also consume disk space.  (These records are ultimately posted to tfgld106 which again consumes space)<br />
<br />
There are other tables that often have large numbers of records such as sls and pur order history tables, inv and ilc transaction history.<br />
