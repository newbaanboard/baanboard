<br />
Thanks for your reply jaotto. Yes, you are right. I want SSO for MyDay only. Do you have an idea how to setup SSO?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaotto</div><div class="date">18th July 2010, 03:52</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be best to get the document from support.  There is specific configuration on the Myday side as well as the sessions on the ERP.  Also there is a sso_permissions.xml that must be created on the ERP system as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hardei</div><div class="date">18th July 2010, 19:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, But i think CAS SERVER has to be setup first for integrating ERP LN with MyDay...<br />
<br />
DO you know how to integrate ERPLN with MyDay?Do you have done any Single sign on set up to integrate with ERPLN?<br />
<br />
Please guide<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Hardei</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaotto</div><div class="date">19th July 2010, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">yes the CAS server must be setup first but that is installed with the Myday product.<br />
<br />
Yes I have installed myday and integrated with BaanIV and ERPLN.  Things are always changing with the configuration though and the versions of Myday that is why it is recommended to get the Myday installation guide and Integration guide for ERPLN from support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hardei</div><div class="date">19th July 2010, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi jaotto,<br />
<br />
there is no need to setup a CAS server seperately?<br />
<br />
Could you please explain how did you integrate Infor ERPLN with Infor MyDay1.2.1. We could install Infor MyDay1.2.1 stand alone, but couldn't integrate with ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Do you have any document for integration?<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Hardei</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaotto</div><div class="date">20th July 2010, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">No the CAS server is installed with Myday.<br />
<br />
No I do not have the documentation for this integration, that is why it is suggested to contact support for this documentation as it is always changing for this product.<br />
<br />
There are several steps to integrating Myday with ERPLN as well as several post installation steps that must be completed after the installation of Myday.  If these steps are not followed correctly it could cause many problems down the line for this.<br />
<br />
This is why it would be suggested to get the latest documentation from support.</div></div><hr />
