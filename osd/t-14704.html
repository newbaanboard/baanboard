<br />
I have finally updated the paper i wrote about one week ago on the many ways to set trace in Oracle and added quite a lot more information. <br />
<br />
Thanks to all those who sent me comments and new ideas. It has now more than doubled in size. <br />
<br />
I have updated quite a bit of the original text and added sections on logon triggers, how to find trace files, how to make them publicly readable, CBO trace, oradebug, setting events in the init.ora, a few more bits and importantly a large section on how to use the new 10G package dbms_monitor for setting trace via sid/serial, client identifier and service/module/action so that end to end trace can be done for multi-tier applications.<br />
<br />
The paper is available from my web site and is called &quot;How to set trace for others sessions, for your own session and at instance level&quot; it's at<br />
http://www.petefinnigan.com/ramblings/how_to_set_trace.htm<br />
<br />
Hope its of use to some of you.<br />
<br />
kind regards<br />

Pete</div></div><hr />
