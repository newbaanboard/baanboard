<br />
I haven't installed our Baan/10g environment yet, but from the error you mention I don't see any indication that is has anything to do with Oracle 10g.<br />
<br />
Can you ping the server from the client where you are trying to connect?<br />
Can you ping the client from the server, and ping it's hostname?  I think Baan/rexec tries to do a reverse DNS lookup on some platforms before it allows you to connect, so maybe you are failing there due to some network configuration issue.  Is there any more detail in your log files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Deepak - SuSE comes with rexec turned off by default. You can turn it on in Yast.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tired SuSE 10gR1 and Baan 4. I really don't like 10g, it was a Pita to install, and gave weird buggy error messages in the trace files. (were on EMT64)<br />
(known issue that's fixed for all other platforms.)<br />
<br />
importing 120GB worth of data into 10g took like 4 days, and yeah, i know how to turn a database and server.<br />
<br />
I rolled back to 9i and haven't been happier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bsyeven</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback Dave, but how about 10gR2?  Have you tried that?  Oracle first releases of every version tend to be pretty buggy, but I've heard 10gR2 is a lot better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 18:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if R2 exists for my platform yet.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think that Baan supports it yet..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bsyeven</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, according to Metalink 10gR2 is supported for your platform:<br />

In Baan's portingset (6.1c.07.09) documentation it just says &quot;10g&quot; is supported so I assumed that meant 10.x, but I have opened a case with them now to find out specifically if 10.2 is supported - will post the results when I get them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 20:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the info from our support case<br />
<br />
Details: What porting set or function pack supports Oracle 10G Release 2?<br />
<br />
Resolution: Unfortunately at this time Baan does not support Oracle 10g R2 yet.  It will work with the latest porting set, but it has caused problems in the Baan environment.  We will continue to improve functionality with future porting sets and feature packs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">waldih</div><div class="date">24th February 2006, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">new portingset is available for 10g rel2 on the downloadsite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bsyeven</div><div class="date">24th February 2006, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, but could you please elaborate on what porting set version you are talking about and where it says that it supports 10gR2?  The most recent porting set I see is 6.1c.07.09 and in the release notes it only mentions 10g.  I don't see any mention of 10g release 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">waldih</div><div class="date">24th February 2006, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">When you go to the ftpsite from ssa support you can see the new portingset at /updates/port and in the documentation from this portingset you can see thats its compatible with oracle 10.g release 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bsyeven</div><div class="date">24th February 2006, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, your right - I see it on the FTP site.  They haven't posted this new porting set in solution 15219 yet, but that will be coming soon I'd imagine.<br />
