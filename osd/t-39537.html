After we added a field in table - tdsls040 some of the user experienced the sale order header and line session to perfomr slow. They experience this problem intermittently. Any reason for such a behavior?<br />

 <br />
If not, it could be just a coincidence that the users started feeling a bit of slowness in the sessions. Did you check the network traffic or the server resource utilization at the time the users felt the slowness?<br />
 <br />
Last but not least, Did you run Re-organize tables after this inclusion? or perhaps a Create Run time data dictionary {ttadv5210m000) for the table that was modified?<br />

I only did Convert to Run time Dictionary and didn't  do Create or re-orgainize table. I think the Convert process empties the table and again loads the data.<br />
The new field is not part of the index. Also, from my previous experience it seems the problem gets resolved like in a weeks time. I am thinking it is somehow related with Database query optimizer, but I am not a DB expert, so cannot say. <br />

If u do not suspect any problem in this regard , then there is no need  to run . This reorg itself can be good overhead on the system .<br />
<br />
Which process takes more in process monitor , ntbshell or db driver . Any log message in eventvwr .</div></div><hr />

In some cases, the table need to update their statistics. I have worked with Informix and Oracle, and this databases have a procedure to perform this.<br />
You should ask to your DBA to verify it.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">25th July 2007, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Under windows environment I am told that once  we do convert to run time with &quot;Reconfigure&quot; checked then system automatically does a &quot;Refrential integrity&quot; Check, but under windows environment a separate process is called? Is that a bshell process? And how do we know it is done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">25th July 2007, 20:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Update statistics is a separate process from baan. This process runs directly from database. As a rule of thumb you must update statistics after upload great amount of data to a table. But in some cases, I have found that this process can help on certain baan sessions that runs slow.<br />
<br />
How can you know when it is done?<br />
Only the DBA knows when the statistics was updated. This function is a 100% DBA task.<br />
<br />
For example, I update the statistics at last once a month.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

On my unix box, when you run an integrity check, internally the system executes the command refint6.1<br />
<br />
On windows boxes, I suppose there are an equivalent.<br />
<br />
When the process finish, on my case, the waiting clock, changes and close the black screen opened first.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

BaanERP Oracle Database Driver Technical Reference Manual<br />
Document Information<br />
Code: U7076C US<br />
Group: User Documentation<br />
Edition: C<br />
Date: May, 2000<br />
<br />
BaanERP porting set 7.X<br />
This section describes the configuration file format as used by the porting sets 7.X. Although these porting sets are capable of handling the configuration file as used by older porting sets, You must use the new configuration files.<br />
File Format: $BSE/lib/ora/ora_driver_param<br />
The driver parameter file provides a means to influence the behavior of the database driver on a per table/index basis for:<br />
 The ownership of the database tables (See Chapter Database Security).<br />
 The query generation (See Chapter Query Tuning).<br />
 The refresh time of the record cache (level-1 mode only).<br />
The following is an example of an entry in the driver parameter file:<br />
*:*:T: group:0214::<br />
In this example, the database driver will create tables owned by a BaanERP group, and will use the iterative  technique during the query generation. A driver parameter file is defined for each database driver. The storage file for the BaanERP Oracle database driver is called ora_driver_param and is located in the Windows NT directory %BSE%\lib\ora or the UNIX directory $BSE/lib/ora. If the ora_driver_param file does not exist, the driver will fall back to the functionality of porting set 6.2a.X, and use the ora_storage file to retrieve the required information.<br />
<br />
table/index optimization<br />
Description<br />
Specific flags related to indexes and tables can be specified. When specified on a T object entry, it<br />
defines the default for all indexes.<br />
Octal values can be used to set the flags for a specific index or table.<br />
00 use default initial technique (filter)<br />
01 ignored, treated like 00<br />
02 ignored, treated like 00<br />
03 initial technique is nested<br />
04 initial technique is iterative<br />
05 initial technique is filter<br />
06 ignored, treated like 00<br />
07 ignored, treated like 00<br />
The following flags can be ORed to this value:<br />
0010 generate statistics at creation of the table<br />
0020 disable index in WHERE clause for descending<br />
joins so it can be used for ORDER BY<br />
0040 (not used)<br />
0100 disable INDEX hint for ascending joins<br />
0200 generate INDEX_DESC hint for descending joins<br />
0400 (reserved)<br />
The following values for the index optimization field are recommended:<br />
0214 for Oracle server versions 7.3.2 and later.<br />
Example 0214  recommended value for Level 2 mode</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Re-org runs refint executable .  Normally reconfigs done through bdbreconfig in convert runtime will have 'ignore referential integrity' turned off . So ref integrity is taken care at re-org .<br />
<br />
I think B40c3 works on SQL2k SP3a . Also SQL7 will not have level 2 driver . Level 2 driver is  definitely  way faster .</div></div><hr />
