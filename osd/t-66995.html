<br />
I'm planning to virtualize my ERPLN Production Environment (FP7/Win2008/SQL Server 2008.) using VMWare vSphere 5.0.<br />
<br />
I would like to know if is there someone else using such configuration and if is this a problem. <br />
<br />
My development and test environment is already virtualized and I've never faced any problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
PS: Sorry about the poor english.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see no problem. <br />
Being with the SLM and PortingSet that support this configuration (in your case, you already have in development and test environments). <br />
<br />
I have already virtualized environment Baan + Oracle + Hyper V and work well. <br />
<br />
If you need help, please send me an email. <br />

<br />
We have run successfully our LN FP7 both with Linux/Oracle and Windows/SQL Server with Vsphere 5.0, with no hiccups at all.<br />
That given, I must say that with the same VM configuration and some tuning, the couple Linux/Oracle runs about 50% faster than Windows with SQL.<br />
But both were very satisfactory for our 60-concurrent user environment, and I'd not hesitate to grow up to 200 or more users in virtual environment.<br />
As Thiago said, pay attention in the portingset and SLM, as the newest versions are required to go virtual.</div></div><hr />
