----------------<br />
Our ERP-LN is running on HP-UX server with Oracle database. The server has become full and we want to have an external database for the new companies. When I try to define a database definition(ttaad4510m000) there are only option to choose Oracle, Informix or DB2. Our intention is to use mysql as an external database installed in a separate server.Infor support has given a feedback that on HP-UX we cannot use mysql. However if I store mySQL in a separate machine, ERP-LN application that is running on a HP-UX must have the facility to connect. But there seems to be no way.<br />
<br />
Another question. Is it possible to use DB2 running on a windows machine as an external database for ERP-ln running on HP-UX? In ERP-LN the option is available in the database definition(ttaad4510m000) to connect to DB2. But my doubt is whether it is possible to connect to a windows machine.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Unix porting sets dont have windows db driver for any database.<br />
<br />
However if there is no data sharing between companies , u can have new windows install with some license sharing (??? to check with support abt technical possibility) or bifurcation through separate validations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming that the DB server's protocol is the same across both platforms (which it is in all major vendors: DB2, Oracle, Informix)<br />
<br />
So (ERP LN) HP-UX -&gt; (DB2) Windows<br />
<br />
Is no problem.<br />
<br />
But as Hitesh said below, you can't split a company or a shared company between the 2 machines, because Baan won't handle the 2 phase commit.<br />
(i.e., if commit on DB-A succeeds and DB-B fails it won't roll back DB-As transaction).<br />

Thank you both. We are going to maintain only new companies in the external windows machine database and there won't be any table sharing. However, how will it behave when Tools tables are involved. Say I run an update session in the new company and that update also prints a report. The update will happen in the separate database but the device queue will be inserted in the old database. Will this have a problem? Also, we might create archive companies in the new database. When we run archive sesssions it deletes in one database and adds in another database. Is it a problem too? Thanks very much for your inputs.<br />

Those are both very common occurrences (many many people do that), but they could run into 2phase commit issues. The general consensus is that it's fairly minor. <br />
In tools because tools doesn't really have application data, so it isn't the end of the world if a record of a report is written (or not).<br />
<br />
In an archive company, it writes, then deletes, so the 2 phase is kind of built in. if the write fails then it won't do the delete.<br />

<br />
Will windows have the separate porting set or it  will only have the db2 .<br />
<br />
I agree that if windows db  driver and unix  db2 driver has same mechanisms , protocol etc there will not be any issue. Acording to me it is different . But I dont have any experience on this (DB2) and I am open to others empirical conclusions on the same.<br />

Low intensity transactions across db like printing will not have problem . But  high cpu intensive transactions across db (like archiving ) may probably pose a problem and  needs to be tested well .  Earlier i had tested a bisam and oracle db in a similar situation with negative results.</div></div><hr />

You'd install the db2/oracle client libs on the app server. So your porting set would access those client libs and the client libs handle the cross-platform communication between baan and the DB. <br />
(Just like an admin tool like Toad would when connecting to Oracle, for example.)<br />

<br />
Yes, always test. I've never had an issue, i'm sure everyone else's mileage may vary.<br />
