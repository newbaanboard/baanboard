I am attaching one UNIX Script Which will genrate a report in such manner so you will have information that how many ( and which)  sessions are being used by which user.<br />
<br />
You may need to change it according to your env. but i feel its worth full to you guys.<br />

<br />
Just a suggestion to help with performance of your script, combine the multiple grep -v statements into 1<br />
<br />
ex: cat users | grep -v bsp | grep -v kiosk | grep -v root| awk -F&quot;.&quot; '{print $2}' &gt; ./user_pid<br />
<br />
changed to: grep -vE &quot;bsp|kiosk|root&quot; users| awk -F&quot;.&quot; '{print $2}' &gt; ./user_pid<br />
