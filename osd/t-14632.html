<br />
Follow the following steps<br />
<br />
a) Install the operating system on the new Server including the latest service packs MUST be used for your Baan Version<br />
b) Install the Oracle 9.0 database with all the Service packs useful and advised by Baan for your Version<br />
c) Install the Baan Software, Validate the Server with Licenses,<br />
    Create companies accordingly and Create all the Tables in Baan first<br />
<br />
d) Install all Baan Patches, which were there on your Old Server<br />
    in Update VRC<br />
e) Create your Customization VRC for Test Environment.<br />
f) Now take the Dump (i.e EXPORT) of each Package VRC Customizations (Carried out at the site) included all objects from the OLD server and Import them on the new server<br />
 one at a time.<br />
g) Create RUNTIME DATA DICTIONARY....<br />
h) Take DUMP of TABLE definitions from the OLD SERVER and import them in NEW server<br />
i) Create runtime data dictionary.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Also Please read Lots of documentation on Service packs for Database / operating system etc.<br />
<br />
On the New setup , u will have problems on Finance company setup; U have to make sure that ur test environment is SIMILAR to your OLD SERVER setup except the database...<br />
<br />
Hope this should go smooth...  And you can also follow guidelines from Baan support for this transition.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />
