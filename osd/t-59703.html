The new server are having 3 hard disks 300GB each, Intel Xeon, 2.4 Ghz. Currently, we have a database of 26 Gb. About 15 users concurrently.<br />
What is the best options for RAID setups and hard disk partitioning? If any of the hard disk fails and assure that we cannot lose any of our data and the OS itself. <br />
Thanks in advance to some one who can help us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you only have 3 HDD then the best choice i think is using RAID 5 with 30% reduction in space and 1 fault tolerance, but watch out for the write speed, it's pretty low.<br />
<br />
the other alternative that pretty good i think is 1+0, it's pretty good with read/write performance, but you need minimum of 4 HDD, and it's eating 50% of total size.<br />
<br />
please count of your IT investment on the storage though, the RAID setting will affect it.<br />

Do i need or is a must to have a partition in each harddisk? What is the best way especially im only having 3 HD (300 gb each).<br />
HD1 - RAID5<br />
HD2 - RAID5<br />
HD3 - RAID5<br />
Can you please elaborate/explain more? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you're planning to use the RAID 5 then the total size(Approx) is<br />
<br />
900 - 900 X 33% = 603GB less <br />
<br />
<br />
it seems i was wrong typing the size reduction of RAID 5 on my previous post, sorry about that, the correct one is 33% loss of size o RAID 5<br />
<br />
the standard partition for me is, C for the OS, D for the ERP, E for the data<br />

if we put all 3 HDD as u said in raid 5...... and the HDD having the OS is damaged..... do the other 2 HDDs will recover windows ? !!!!<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">14th December 2010, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally good redundancy is required for baan and db . We have Raid 1 configured on separately for each of following for best performance and data recoverability  and online backups .<br />
<br />
1. OS &amp; cluster<br />
2. Baan<br />
3. SQL log file and application<br />
4. SQL dbf files <br />
<br />
Such configuration is  not possible with 3 disks only . Configuring Raid 5 of 3  disks and keeping db log file , baan temps and sql dbf in same partition is not recommended for best performance and data recoverability purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">14th December 2010, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">You should put baan and the OS on the first disk.<br />
<br />
Then mirror (RAID 1) the 2nd and 3rd disks and use that for your database.<br />
<br />
Database + RAID 5 = poor performance.<br />
<br />
Your database is small enough that you can easily back it up nightly, and backup the tx log 2x per day. so you don't really need the fault tolerance of raid 5. The parity calculation for inserts kind of trumps any performance gain you'd have going across so few spindals in a raid 5.</div></div><hr />

Thanks<br />
<br />
if we use the RAID 5 the fault tolerance is 1 HDD down, the other disk will do the parity again.<br />
