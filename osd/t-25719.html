<br />
Are there any known issues with this version of Oracle which cause in slow performance over a period of time(like over a period of 2-4 weeks, performance of various sessions or jobs become slow or something on thise lines)? Or are there any other fundamental issues known with this version?<br />
<br />
I am working on a project where we are going to use Oracle 9.2.0.5 on AIX 5.2 (ML4) for Baan IVc2 and I want to make sure that there are no fundamental issues with this version.<br />
<br />
If you are using Oracle 9.2.0.5 or if you know of some of your clients using it, please respond.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your repsonse.<br />
<br />

<br />
Why not using the latest patch set of Oracle 9i?<br />
<br />
Having said this, I haven't heard any 9.2.0.5 specific performance issues.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. We have applied that solution. The reason to use this version(9.2.0.5) was made because of standardization and was made a couple of months ago when Oracle 9.2.0.7 was either not released or just released.<br />
<br />
I have invested a lot of time using this version and do not want to change if I do not have to. Recently, there were some discussions from some folks which seemed to indicate that their may be an issue with the version and I want to know if that it really true(if it is, other folks would have also faced that). Ours is a FDA regulated industry and any major changes require a lot of testing and validation efforts.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Baan solutions, have you tried the ANSI_OUTER_JOIN parameter and seen its effect(Solution 202618)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Will you please provide more evidence on the slow memory leak issue? Have you seen any client or customer report this?<br />
<br />
As you know each Oracle version has one or the other issues and I want to make sure that there is no major show stopper on the Oracle side.<br />
<br />
Of the Oracle sub-versions 9.2.0.5 and higher, which one seems to be the most stable one.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Suresh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pierre</div><div class="date">25th November 2005, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running BaaN IV b2 (c4 for tools) on 9.2.0.5 without problems, and no major performance issue. We have 400G of data and 300 users.<br />
I experienced a serious problem this week when a new table dump was installed : in this case BaaN drop the table during the reconfig and recompute the oracle statistics while the table is empty (i.e. before reloading the data) : this can fool the optimizer of course. I will report this as a bug to BaaN</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
How long have you been on Oracle 9.2.05? My project involves about 135 concurrent users(when we Go-Live) or 375 named users or so.<br />
<br />
Also, were any other major reasons why you upgraded to c4 Tools?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Suresh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pierre</div><div class="date">28th November 2005, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running on 9.2 since 3 years, first 9.2.0.3 and then 9.2.0.5. It is stable on our machine. I have another instance of BaaN which is still in version 7 but I will migrate it to 10 directly. <br />
<br />
We upgraded to tools c4 mostly because there is no driver for Oracle 8 and above on BaaN b2. We could not move the application from b2 to c4 because we have a lot of customisations that would have had to be rewritten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuple9i</div><div class="date">1st December 2005, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure that you have the Auto Memory Manager set for the Oracle database. This really helps performance with applications. Haven't had to test this with BaaN previously since my prior incarnations dealt mostly with Oracle and Peoplesoft applications, but I saw a marked improvement when I let the database manage the memory.<br />
<br />
Database version: Oracle 9.2.0.5<br />
O/S: AIX 5L, SUN 2.6/2.8, Win2000<br />
<br />
I am currently upgrading my BaaN database (Oracle) to 10.2.0.1 from 8.1.7.4 to see if BaaN will work with no modifications to the application. I am going to try to use the exact porting set that I currently have installed. Please note that this is a highly customized version of the BaaN application, so my experiences may not neccessarily hold for your application.<br />
<br />
porting set 7.1d.03<br />
Win2000</div></div><hr />

<br />
Recently, one of our group company setup has got ORA-04031 having Oracle 9.2.0.5.<br />
I have investigated much on this issue, seems resolved in 9.2.0.7. We tried to increase shared pool size and frequently clearig SGA. But could not fix it permanently yet. Heard oracle has patches to resolve this issue.<br />
Increasing SGA postponed the error for few days but again reocccurs.<br />
Also BaaN support not able to give solution on this, instead saying &quot;it is related to Oracle&quot;.<br />
I surprised because same setup at different company works fine.<br />
Hence take this in consideration. Also expecting your experience on this issue.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
