the old envrioment is like that:<br />
 erp ln6.1 fp2 (portingset8.2 ) on IBM p570 (aix5.2) power5<br />
the new envrioment is like that:<br />
erp ln6.2 fp2(porting set8.2) on ibm power6 p570 (aix5.3)<br />
<br />
everything seems normal .but only session (ttibom1110m00) cannot work normally . it really can open a bom ,but the spped is too slow .it might spend 5 minutes when you change to another bom . we check the index of this table . we can confirm the database is ok .<br />
<br />
we reinstall this in another host (ibm power5 p570 aix5.3)<br />
and use the same database . that session can work normally.<br />
<br />
what is wrong ? ln cannot work in ibm power6?</div></div><hr />

other sessions like to check item where used  can work normally . i think this might mean the hardware and database is normal . <br />
<br />
only cpu (ibm power6) is new . <br />
what happened?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">8th February 2008, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">or that you just haven't found another session that doesn't work normally YET - and that this one taxes your network load more than the others based on your data.<br />
<br />
the fact that other sessions run fine suggests that it isn't a baan problem with your hardware. if baan had a difficult time with your architecture then everything would be slow.<br />
<br />
Also, your problem is with displaying and navigating records. Baan doesn't do any work here, it's all the database and baan is just a passthrough.<br />

oracle is always installed in ibm power6 570 aix5.3 .<br />
and ln6.1 installed in different hosts <br />
<br />
1) ln6.1 installed in ibm p6 570 aix5.3 ,<br />
    that session cannot work normally , but with oracle client , you can get the bom data quickly <br />
2) ln 6.1 installed in ibm p5 570 aix5.3<br />
    that session can work normally<br />
3) ln6.1 installed in ibm p5 570 aix5.2<br />
    the session work noramlly<br />
<br />
baan function -portingset -aix -(microcode) -network -database<br />
<br />
in this chain ,only microcode is different between power6 and power5. all others are the same . but i think bshell only work in aix  level,it should be nothing with microcode</div></div><hr />
