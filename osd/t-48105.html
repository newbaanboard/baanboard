I want the archive company to be in another Oracle Database.<br />
What has to be configured at Baan and Oracle side?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">13th February 2008, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">This is actually a pretty common setup. here is what you do:<br />
<br />
a) Create the new instance, ie. call it &quot;archiv&quot;<br />
b) Create the user baan and all the other users with the same password as in the origional database<br />
c) create the role r_baan and assign it to the users (same as connect and resource).<br />
d) Create in Baan in &quot;Maintain databases&quot; two new database entries, ie. archiv and archiv+A, which basically set as parameter something like &quot;ORACLE_SID=archiv&quot;<br />
e) Create a new company in baan and assign it the newly created database definitions.<br />
<br />
That's it. Straight forward and works like a charm.<br />

<br />
I am also working on the Archiving and Having HP unix11.00 and Oracle 9.2.0.7, I would like to know the following<br />
b. How to creat Baan Users with Same password? Is there is some command at Ora Admin or Unix to copy existing all Baan users with same password.<br />

C.  How to create R_Baan and assign it to the users.?<br />

I have assign SID in the database.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">28th June 2008, 12:16</div></div><div class="posttext">oraadmin is not a suitable tool to be used, when working with two databases, so you have to resort to sqlplus:<br />
<br />
to create a user: <br />
<br />
create user X identified by Y temporary tablespace Z;<br />
grant r_baan to X;<br />
grant connect to X;<br />
grant resource to X;<br />
<br />
<br />
naturally replace X,Y,Z according to your system.<br />

I hope that helped,<br />

<br />
I am still stuck at the first step.<br />
As per the DB team, they have created a new Db instance and provide us the details.<br />
I have created new archiving companies and added it to the new DB instance. <br />
However, now when I create companies using bsp or other super user account, I am getting same error as that of Manoj i.e. Logon denied. <br />
Need this board's guidance here. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th September 2023, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you make sure this step was complete:<br />
<br />
 Create the user baan and all the other users with the same password as in the origional database<br />
<br />
I have not done archiving, but I just had a case where our dev company (as BSP) if I tried to do anything with the tables I got login denied,  Had to get DBA's to reset the account and I had to fix the baan password in our 4c4 instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">19th September 2023, 11:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Aakash,<br />
<br />
It is a looooooooong time ago, that I was on the board here and also a very long time ago, that I worked with Baan. I am also impressed that there are still Baan IV customers around. <br />
<br />
But here is what I recollect:<br />
<br />
a) When a normal user works on an existing Baan company, then the Oracle Driver or Baan connects to the oracle instance using credentials specific to that user. These credentials are stored encrypted in a file called &quot;ora_users&quot; under $BSE/lib/ora (if I remember correctly).<br />
<br />
This is the reason, that you need to create all oracle users of your &quot;baan&quot; instance with the same login and password also in the &quot;archive&quot; instance, as Mark said above.<br />
<br />
b) When a super user, like bsp creates a completely new company or just a single table, then the Oracle driver is not using the user specific credentials, but the credentials of the oracle user &quot;baan&quot;. This user owns the role &quot;r_baan&quot; and on table creation assigns the required read/write permissions of new tables to r_baan, All valid baan users on the other hand have r_baan assigned. <br />
<br />
This is specified in a file called &quot;ora_groups&quot; in the same directory. For this to work again you need the oracle user &quot;baan&quot; in both instances with the same username/password and the ora_groups file needs to contain two entries, one for each oracle instance.<br />
<br />
Depending on your baan version there was a binary (script) called ora_admin6.1, which you could use to manipulate these runtime files, or you could simply edit them in vi.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you for your reply. It had some good information for me. <br />
However, pardon me for being naive, I would like to ask one more question:<br />
<br />
In the part a), you mentioned that  &quot;This is the reason, that you need to create all oracle users of your &quot;baan&quot; instance with the same login and password also in the &quot;archive&quot; instance, as Mark said above.&quot;.<br />
How should this step be performed? Should it be done at Application level using &quot;bsp&quot; account or does it need to be done at the DB level by the DBA team?<br />
<br />
In whatever ways, if possible, kindly guide with the steps too. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
Aakash Singh</div></div><hr />

<br />
in Baan IV, this had to be done by your DBA.<br />
<br />
In Baan VI they added functionality to do this from within the application, if I remember correctly. But I had left the BaaN universe before that happened, so I can not tell for sure.<br />
<br />
In any case doing it on the DB level works for sure.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
