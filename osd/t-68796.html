So make sure your database is up and running - then make sure baan is pointing to the correct place for the database. I do not really know where all of this info is - our sysadmins and dba's work on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">7th April 2016, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Means the application isn't able to connect to your database.<br />
Use qptool with a simple query to test it after set the necessary environment variables.<br />
Check eventlog. Using DBSLOG=077777 helps sometimes too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lebowski</div><div class="date">8th April 2016, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably a mismatch in the UserIDs of your database user(s).<br />
Assuming that the DB user is &quot;baan&quot;:<br />
<br />
Open SQL Management studio<br />
There are two logins for &quot;baan&quot;: one is under &quot;security&quot; of SQL server and one is under &quot;security&quot; of your Baan database.<br />
After the restore the user IDs differ because one is from the installation of c4 and the other from the backup.<br />
You have to delete the user from the Baan database and then assign him the database again by checking the appropriate checkbox in the SQL servers security. Aftter you checked that box you see his login under the Baan database again and the error should be gone.<br />
Make sure that the users have the same password (the installation user and the user from the backup).<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

If so, what is the error message when you tried using qptool?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ERPpals</div><div class="date">10th June 2016, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, if you have restored this, did you checked your $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1 file and see where the DB is pointed and also check your DB path if its correct or not. Secondly, check $BSE/lib/SQL/sql_groups try to check if that encrypted password for baan is correct or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">10th June 2016, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">also check that your db is NOT in single user mode.</div></div><hr />
