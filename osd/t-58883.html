<br />
We have a customised session that populates a temp table whilst it's processing. I keep getting an error 100 and I want to debug so I can see what the duplicate data is to help me troubleshoot.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how I can do this? I've tried osme of the dbslog switches but they give me nothing useful.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
But if it's a custom session, it's probably easier just to compile in debug and step through?<br />

I used DBSLOG=1570 which came back with lots to read. However, it still wasn't too clear to me what actual record was causing the issue.<br />
<br />
With regards to compiling in debug I've never got on with the debug console. Maybe now is the time!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Code: I often make some code to get quickly to what I want to see, e.g &quot;before.program: e = 0&quot;. That starts the debugger as soon as the session starts; otherwise the debugger will start for the first line of your code, and if you have a type 1/2/3 script with only little code, it might take some input before the debugger will be started.<br />
 <br />
Code: In your case, I would recommend that you always use commit.transaction after each db.insert or db.update. That makes debugging easier.<br />
 <br />
Debugger: In the debugger, you can search with &quot;/db.insert&quot; (and may be repeated by Return), an you can set a breakpoint on that line with &quot;b&quot;. When you press the Continue button (or enter c) to run, the session will stop at every breakpoint, and then you can check values (enter their name in line 2; be careful for vars that are identical to debugger commands - just add a shlash to them).<br />
 <br />
Code: Another simple way is to add a variable e.g. &quot;extern long foo&quot; too your code. Add lines like &quot;foo = foo + 1&quot; to the interesting part. Then you can use the debugger command &quot;t foo&quot; to trace the variable. The debugger will stop each time the value changes.<br />
 <br />
Hope that gives you some appetite to give it a try!<br />
