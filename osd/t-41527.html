Belowed is our company's situation:<br />

This would tell you what configuration best suit your needs. Each Baan module has a weightage when it comes to cpu utilization. So there is set calculations in this Sizing document which would give you what sort of a configuration you would need for your organization. <br />
 <br />
Since you are insisting on HP, HP Proliant 370 G5 dual core processor with min 4gb of RAM and ample hard disk storage would be a start...<br />

You would have to open up a case with Infor and then you would get hold of a copy of baan sizing tool. This is one of the most confidential document of Baan from Infor...<br />

Does anybody have any experience with ERP LN and quad core processor?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot say anything about LN as we use 4c4 supply chaine.  However, I do have a new rack mount server I setup that has dual Quad-Core Processors (4Gb Ram) with Baan IVc4 and Oracle 10g installed.  Test show that it is indeed very fast.  I see no issues that would cause any concern.<br />
<br />
We are working on a migration plan that will move us from our old server to this new server.  It is licensed and ready to go otherwise.<br />
