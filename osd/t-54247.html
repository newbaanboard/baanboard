<br />
I would like to backup our ERP LN 6.1 to a Vmware machine.<br />
<br />
In case of ERP server crash, we could in that way start the ERP temporary on a new machine.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to do so?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">11th November 2008, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">yes it is possible, if the licensing is running on the box you would need to  get the box re-licenced after a crash (there are ways round that if you running on windows, manually run the brand executable, spoof the mac of the original machine). I don't know what the licence situation would be with infor about running it in a Vmware enviroment. Some companies have different licence requirements in virtual enviroments. Your windows licence may also be affected, depending the licence type of the original box you may or may not be able to have the backup in vmware without buying an additional server licence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However the license manager doesn't run in vmware, Infor wants you to run it on physical hardware so you need to install slm somewhere else.<br />

<br />
in the technical point of view is easy, even if you arw or not running in vmware, because you can backup an existing virtual machine or virtualize an existing phisical box.<br />

   With the help of a Hot backup (backup taken while the database is in use), you could recreate the db in another environment (VM or physical) up to the point of the backup without any consistency issue. I can vouch for this as far as SQL Server is concerned and Oracle too if i am not mistaken. <br />
