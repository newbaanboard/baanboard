Database tbase6.1<br />
OS Solaris 2.6<br />
<br />
Currently we are transfering data to SQL Server using  Safari ODBC,every day we are running schedule at night. This is for the purpose there are few reports/application which we are not able to do it in Baan (example Vendor Rating, Assembly Target Completion Report etc.) But for all the application we are using One day old data.<br />
<br />
Is there any other way by which I can transfer data/replicate data as and when it get update in Baan. For Some application which are on SQL server are required live data.<br />

What you could do is something like the following:<br />
if the tables you want to replicate have ascending primary keys (like orno or something), write a program that sleeps for a certain time, then looks up a control table (individual new table) for the last key that was exported. Then the program looks whether there are &quot;bigger&quot; keys in the table in question. If yes, it will write the data to a seq. file and then insert the exported keys into the control table and sleep again.<br />
You will have to pay attention to some sync-issues and range of keys, but this is solvable.<br />
For synchronizing, you can use another seq.file. If your program works, it should create a file &quot;stop.sig&quot; and erase it, before &quot;it goes to bed&quot; again. If it wakes up and there is such a file, it must sleep again.<br />
<br />
The program that wants to import the seq. file into a db must look whether there is no file called &quot;stop.sig&quot;, create it, then read the data file and before it terminates delete the &quot;stop.sig&quot;.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<br />
By the way, be carefull with safari and performance, if you do. Safari tends to create a lot of full table scans, but this might not matter so much with tbase, as it does with oracle.<br />

Like We are thinking to migrate from tbase to oracle<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">7th March 2003, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, once you switch to a database, you have a lot of options.<br />
<br />
- You can directly access your data via any ODBC/OLEDB tool<br />
- You can use snapshots to create copies of tables<br />
- You can use triggers to update other tables, whenerver your source table changes.<br />
- You can use Oracle transparent gateway to write data to sql server.<br />
<br />
The options are very broad.<br />

<br />
Thanks , We can use both places oracle i.e at Baan Backend and in place of SQL Server.<br />
<br />
What I heard about Oracle  for Baan  that we can not see or connect database from out side i.e. without using Baan.<br />
<br />
If it is not like that I can use snapshot replication and carryout my work.<br />
<br />
Thanks once again.<br />
