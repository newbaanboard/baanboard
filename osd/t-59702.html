<br />
I'm trying to implement the Pluggable Authentication Module for AIX 6.1 as this is required to allow LN an LN user to change their password via session (ttstpchangepw). When I executed the ttstpchange pw session, a new window keeps opening everytime i keep trying to set a new problem. according infor, PAM should be enabled to solve this issue.<br />
<br />
I've edited the /etc/security/login.cfg to use the PAM_AUTH but from here what else do I need to set.<br />
<br />
There is /etc/pam.conf which I've not edited as I am not sure what settings are required to allow LN to make use of the PAM.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ian</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may want to consult your UNIX admin on how they would like PAM configured for your environment as there are several options that can be configured.</div></div><hr />

I have LN FP5 with the latest porting set of 8.6a3.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we don't have a unix admin that knows how to set up the PAM. I'm trying to figure out what I can to sort this out but i find the concepts of PAM somewhat confusing especially when refering to IBM AIX 6.1 Documentation.<br />

No, the server is in a workgroup and not an Active Directory.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to allow the users within LN to be able to change their own password.. Apparently PAM is required for this to work in an AIX environment.<br />

Did you get anywhere with this?  <br />
<br />
If it's a standalone Baan server, then password aging should work without the need for PAM.  We were using Baan 5, porting set 7.1 and password aging worked fine without requiring PAM to be turned on in /etc/security/login.cfg.<br />
