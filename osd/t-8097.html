<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aeolian</div><div class="date">13th December 2002, 13:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to find out how Big a Baan installation W2K/SQL2000 can handle.  I can't seem to find any decent case studies for larger installations (say, 200+ concurrent users).  <br />
<br />
Is anyone using Windows/SQL with Baan with 200+ concurrent users?  If so, what is the system spec, how is reliability and what issues are there?  Or is it only for SMEs?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

(They found huge gains in performance in many areas and almost equal or slightly greater performance in the rest.  Database size has reduced by almost 40% after moving from level1 to level2.) <br />
<br />
They have their production system consisting of 4 application servers (with 4 CPU, 4GB RAM, 40 GB disk each) and a DB server (with 8 CPU,8GB RAM, 1TB disk space).  <br />
<br />
After moving to level2 for BaanERP5.0c, their database size came down from 700+ GB to around 390 GB.  Their db growth rate too got reduced by 50%. <br />

<br />
<br />
Did you get anyother responses to your question as to scalability ?<br />
<br />
Were you interested in Baan IV or Baan 5 ?<br />
<br />
I ask as we are trying to find user experience in the same area as you but with 250 users on IVc4 or Baan 5 ( we may migrate but if so it will be to Baan 6 )<br />
<br />
Also we wish to compare Informix version ?? to SQL<br />
<br />
So any information would be useful</div></div><hr />

with ~7000 users / w2k / sqlserver<br />
on fsc-platform<br />
<br />
we will see ...</div></div><hr />

I know of the SQL account refered to earlier and it is definitely the exception.  I have three accounts including that one which are &gt;200 on Win 2000.  But two of them are on Oracle...<br />
<br />
Baan 5 -- much better choice due to the TODAY availability of L2 drivers.<br />
<br />
It will work -- but UNIX will work &quot;more better&quot; as my HP-UX internals instructor used to say...<br />

I am sure that Unix is &quot;much more better&quot; but a &quot;policy&quot; decision has been made to move to Windows.<br />
<br />
We are homing in on IDS Workgroup Edition ( with the 4 processor limitation) using an application and DB server<br />

As we run 4 instances SQL is a nogo<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">15th April 2003, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">From CPU point of view: As far as my knowldge goes: On NT/W2K adding more CPU scales less compared to UNIX. Especially above the 4 CPU's.<br />
<br />
From a database point of view there are differences in the high end and for me this is above the 500 users so I assume this does not count for you.<br />
<br />
Scalability depends on more than only CPU and database scalability. Good scalability also requires a good scalable product. In general Baan scales very well but when adding more users, it becomes a problem when users start to do the same work on the same tables (locking).  At this point it depends on the sessions you are using if your configuration can perform/scale well.<br />
<br />
But in general I don't see any real issues when having less than 300 users on a W2K/MSQL box for scaling.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">16th April 2003, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Many Thanks for advice Dick<br />
<br />
As stated we have 4 CPU on both Application and DB servers<br />
<br />
We will be using IDS Workgroup Edition  FC7.31 UD5<br />
<br />
We will now have 5/6 instances<br />
<br />
We shall know results by start of Q4/03</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">19th April 2003, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">That changes things -- are you asking about 5-6 seperate instances on different machines supporting this many users?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">22nd April 2003, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi James<br />
<br />
Yes the data will be held on the one DB server but will be allocated to some 9 Baan coys within 5/6 instances</div></div><hr />
