<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FriarTuck</div><div class="date">29th November 2004, 22:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done a bit of searching around on BB prior to this post.  Although I've come across one posting that had some relevant information, I must confess that I am a bit under the thumbscrews.<br />
<br />
I'm sure we UNIX gurus can agree that using &quot;root&quot; for anything short of the actual administration of the operating system is a big no-no.  However, I am constantly (and consistently) seeing files with &quot;root&quot; ownership under $BSE.<br />
<br />
I'd like to stop this, but I am not savvy on Baan &quot;internals&quot;.  I've done a bit of dancing around the issue with our Baan administrator, but short of pulling teeth, as the UNIX jockey, I am downright tired of &quot;root&quot; this and &quot;root&quot; that everytime somthing has to happen with the Baan software.<br />
<br />
Painting a picture, new policy requires root only for the UNIX system administrator, yet the Baan folks here at the office &quot;need root&quot; for Baan administrator (not startup/shutdown).<br />
<br />
Three questions:<br />
<br />
1.  Baan only &quot;needs&quot; root for startup/shutdown, correct?<br />
2.  Nothing in $BSE needs root ownership, correct?<br />
3.  How can I do this without congressional oversight?<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers, and thanks for hearing my vent!<br />

You still have to provide sudo or other forms of access to kill process/users, reset passwords.</div></div><hr />

$BSE/bin/badmin6.2 -- Who needs it?<br />
<br />
$BSE/bin/blogind6.2 -- most people don't use it.. but if you do...<br />

$BSE/bin/pdaemon6.2 -- Does anyone out there NOT have a shell script to clean up tempfiles?<br />
<br />
$BSE/etc/rc.start -- a shell script... <br />
$BSE/etc/rc.stop -- a shell script... <br />

That doc he gives is good, but its conservative. a lot of it depends on what you need obviously...<br />
