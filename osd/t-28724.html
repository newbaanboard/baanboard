<br />
1. Does Baan support Oracle real application clusters (RACs) ? <br />
2. Is there any specific step or method involved which is different than the normal Oracle + Baan install ?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

1. Oracle RAC is not supported yet. But there are customers live with it.<br />
2. Yes, I won't recommend to use RAC for an average DBA. You have to know what you are doing. E.g. when you create tables, you have to know if these tables can be accessed from multiple nodes. If so, you need to know what kind of locking can involve this table. I recommend not split on e.g. company level per node. So, company 100 can only be accessed from node 1 and company 200 from node 2. Also make sure you don't have linked tables on multiple nodes.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Load balancing keeps Baan connections balanced between the two database servers.<br />
<br />
I have two nodes running Windows Server 2003.  Each is a node in the Cluster.  Both Nodes have a Fiber Channel link to an IBM Fibre Channel Storage Server.  Both Nodes are connected (as required) with a Gigabit Link.  The second network port connects to our network for direct access to oracle.  We also have a third network connection that connect the application server to the database machines via a private LAN.<br />
<br />
The Baan Server is another Windows Server with two network connects.  One Network connect to our Network..  The second is a private connection to the Database Machines.<br />
<br />
Using Oracles OCFS file system, both machines can see the common drives that hold the cluster data files as well as all tablespaces.  NOTE: Oracle System files must be installed on an OCFS Drive as well.<br />
<br />
Once the cluster is created, creating tables can be done from either node.  They must exist on an OCFS Drive as must all Archive Log files.<br />
<br />
We use Oracle Rman to backup up our database every night.  We have done a restore of tablespaces from the Rman backup and can verify that the backup is workable.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, let me know.<br />
