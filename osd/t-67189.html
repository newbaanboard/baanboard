<br />
I am a new user of BAAN, so I am still looking for a lot of things about this ERP. I used to connect to accounting databases with MS Query, MS Access and MySQL Workbench. Now, it is really new to me, because the ERP BAAN is installed here in a Linux Server (AIX server). So I don't really know how to set up the configuration between SQL Developer and BAAN Database. The main objective for a Financial guy, like me, is to write some select into tables.<br />
<br />
Can you help me ?<br />
<br />
Version of ERP : BAAN IV<br />
BW Version : B40c.98<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Hello bdittmar,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
Why do you advice me not to manipulate BaaN Tables in SQL Developer or outside the application BaaN ?<br />
I didn't know LISTENER, is it working like SQL Developer ?<br />
<br />
Actually, what I want to get is the data from accounting and purchase in a way that can help me to use them. Because if you use the Excel export that is implemented in BaaN application, you don't get a good data extraction, it is just an Excel view of what you have in a paper view...<br />
<br />
Best Regards.<br />
