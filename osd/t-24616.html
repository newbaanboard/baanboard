<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">20th July 2005, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">No such thing as 0 downtime. But you can get very limited downtime by implementing Oracle RAC.<br />
<br />
You can find out more about RAC on metalink.<br />
<br />
One thing though, I've been to a lot of sites were people threw around the terms &quot;0 downtime&quot; and &quot;100% availibility&quot; and when i showed them the complixity of their system, cost, etc. which just got them to say.. 95%.. they<br />
usually decided that it wasn't worth it and standard hot backups with maybe a standby database (Oracle dataguard) were good enough.<br />

Baan is just a logic frontend, a &quot;user&quot; accessing your database so, whatever you do to keep an Oracle instance available will be valid also for Oracle+Baan.</div></div><hr />
