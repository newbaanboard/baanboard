Migration would change os from hpux to aix, and database from informix to something else.<br />
Which DB options are currently available for LN?<br />
Is oracle only viable option since informix and ms-based solutions are excluded?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">12th November 2008, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">In the technical notes for the most recent ERP LN portingset, the following databases are supported for AIX:<br />
<br />
Oracle 10.1, 10.2, 11.1<br />
IBM Informix IDS 9.4, 10, 11.1<br />
IBM DB2 8.1, 8.2, 9.1, 9.5<br />
<br />
The technical notes also indicate that multibyte is not supported for Informix or DB2.<br />

<br />
Of course it hasn't all the features of Oracle but do you need them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">13th November 2008, 01:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point Han.  I was just sticking with the AIX supported DBs because of the original post, but there are other options out there.<br />

I'm considering alternatives because their solution seemed like overkill when I read through the proposals.<br />
<br />
Our current userbase is around 50 persons, and uncompressed data dump size is around 1Gb.<br />
Concurrent users during peak hours is probably somewhere around 10-20, so our userbase and data amount is rather small.<br />
<br />
Multibyte support in DB is one of the requirements, since some of our users are based in China.  Mysql should support it, atleast from version 5+, AFAIK.<br />
<br />
Money-wise linux with mysql seems rather easy to sell to my boss, since we could get mirrored environment with cost of single informix license.<br />
<br />
Is anyone running similar size/bigger setup with linux based solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">13th November 2008, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I know of a location using SUSE with Oracle as their DB.  I don't know their user count off the top of my head, but I believe it is larger than yours.  They are pretty happy with SUSE.  I am not aware of any unusual issues they've had because of Linux.<br />
<br />
I haven't personally dealt with a site using MySQL, but I have seen posts on here indicating people are at least piloting with it.<br />

MySQL supprt Multibyte, but if I informed correctly the release notes of the latest portingset says that LN is not supported for multibyte on MySQL.<br />
<br />
In LN you also have the the possibility to choice for Unicode. This is only supported on Oracle, DB2 and MSQL.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
