<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">janeza</div><div class="date">18th February 2002, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Thaks all of you to be cooperative with my first question on this<br />
topic.<br />
The problem is that this is not an ordinary upgrade but<br />
upgrade with a new instance on MSQL 2000. <br />
Database bandb was transfered to this new instance with<br />
Copy database wizard. The database was succesfully transfered<br />
to this new instance with the same name (baandb)<br />
I tested with isql if the new instance has a contact with the OS.<br />
select @@version answers positive.<br />
<br />
How can we say to Baan to use database on this instance instead of the old database on MSQL 7.0.<br />
As I know file on {BSE}/lib,  &quot;tabledef6.1&quot; , has information about that.<br />
example:<br />
cfcec000:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=SRV1):Y<br />
Say that SRV1 is name of host and SQLServer_name.<br />
Say that our instance on MSQL2000 is INSTBAAN.<br />
<br />
As I understand this, a new one have to be like:<br />
cfcec000:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=SRV1\INSTBAAN):Y<br />
<br />
Am I wright with the syntax ?<br />
<br />
The second problem is the port number at which SQL2000 listens.<br />
Instalation lets this number to 0 and said that it is dynamic assigned.<br />
<br />
Is anywhere else in Baan {BSE}/lib flat files that have to be<br />
changed in respect to the new instance.<br />
<br />
Has anyone any experiences with this problem ?<br />
<br />
Best regards.</div></div><hr />

No other flat files need to be modified.  Instead of manually editing the %BSE%\lib\tabledef6.1, you could use the Baan session ttaad4110m000 to specify the MSQL_SERVERHOST.<br />
