<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">28th June 2002, 01:27</div></div><div class="posttext">You can easily create a DOS batch script to delete the temp files. This script should be available to certain people only as you dont want to accidentally delete active tmp files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">28th June 2002, 09:14</div></div><div class="posttext">In the tmp dir there are all kind of temprarily files that may be used during login time. One of the largest sources is the printing. Before sending prints to a (OS specific) print queue, the bshell generates a printer and OS independent file that is being picked up by the portingset.<br />
<br />
These tmp files contain data to be able to reprint these printjobs. There is a table and a session where the filename and print-status is stored. From there you can also reprint previously send prints. This session is the ttaad3120m000.<br />
<br />
On Unix the printerdaemon takes care for deleting these files. They will be automatically deleted and also the status in the table will be changed after a certain delete wait time. <br />
<br />
On NT there is no printerdaemon. So it works slightly different. There have been fixes that deleted these files right away, but this has been reverted.<br />
<br />
Best way is to empty the printqueue before deleting the tmp files. This makes the system less inconsistent. Also do keep a delete wait time in consideration, so you won't delete active files. 7 days is generally spoken safe enough.</div></div><hr />

Since I'm not so familiar with WinNT batch programming I would appreciate if someone could provide an example batch-pgm for &quot;cleaning up&quot; the $BSE\TMP so I have something to start with.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Look at this site,<br />
<br />
http://users.accesscomm.ca/gbraun/batch/batches.htm<br />
<br />
There are few files there with delete functions. Be sure to test it first on a test machine before testing on your producton box.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for WINNT and repeat print requests the session ttaad3225m000 was created and introduced. If this session is available then the print files on NT are hold in the $BSE/tmp directory. Start the session ttaad3225m000 to remove all no longer used files like the print daemon does.<br />

Bye,<br />

to clear the temp folder i follow this steps...<br />
<br />
1-run ttaad3221m000 to clear the device queue<br />
2-delete all tmp* files of $BSE/TMP folder.<br />
<br />
to create a simply script to delete them try it...<br />
use the notepad and write it:<br />
<br />
del &lt;path&gt;/baan/tmp/tmp*<br />
<br />
save and rename it like &quot;cleartemp.cmd&quot;.<br />
You can do it with a scheduler batch every night for example.</div></div><hr />

If someone remained logged in, you cannot delete the file in the first place, deleting the file-in-use can cause nasty problems!</div></div><hr />
