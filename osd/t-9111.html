<br />
We just finished to upgrade our system:<br />
Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition with 2 CPU - &gt; Windows 2000 Advanced Server with 4 CPU.<br />
Total RAM 4 Gb<br />
<br />
Informix 7.31 TC6 - &gt; Informix 7.31 TD4<br />
<br />
The tests performances are bad comparing to the tests before the upgrading.<br />
<br />
Is anyone having any suggestions to make the system run as should be? (ONCONFIG/db_resource).</div></div><hr />

In order to determine the cause of performance problems, a system needs to be monitored, the database needs to be monitored, baan needs to be monitored.<br />
<br />
You need basic information, like<br />
- consecutive users<br />
- table sizes<br />
- most used sessions<br />
- etc.<br />
<br />
As for the database settings, simply start with the recommendations that Baan gives in the documentation that came on your installation cd.<br />
<br />
Then finaly, check articles and discussions here that match your situation and hopefully some will apply to you.<br />
Unless you have a very specific problem, I am afraid that nobody will be able to help you because of the many unknown variables.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your quest though.</div></div><hr />

As mentioned, getting good performance means a lot of monitoring and changes of configurations...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">7th March 2003, 04:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this was the case on UNIX, but I am not sure on NT going to the TD4 release of Informix.   <br />
<br />
Due to a change at 7.31 UC5, we had to recreate some indexes due to an introduced &quot;inconsistency&quot; between versions.  I do not know if this applies to NT.  The symptom was a gradual slowdown that was fixed by restarting Informix and then after a little while the system would begin slowing down again.<br />
<br />
Also, as Victor mentioned you will need to generate statistics after the upgrade.<br />

One change I would make to your onconfig is from<br />
NETTYPE soctcp,1,100,CPU<br />
to<br />
NETTYPE soctcp,3,100,CPU<br />
<br />
You have set up your Informix instance to be multi-processor and multi VP's, but you have only one thread handler.<br />
This will defintely cause an issue with performance.<br />
<br />

<br />
It has been suggested we use this with Win2000</div></div><hr />

As far as I am aware, the workgroup edition is exactly the same software as Informix 7.31, but is limited to 2 CPU's, this is certainly the case with Solaris. Informix just rely on the fact that even though you may have physically more CPU's in your server, you only have 2 configured to be used with Informix. This is simply achieved by making the necessary changes in your onconfig file.<br />

<br />
Are you using the &quot;workgroup edition&quot; ?<br />
<br />
See link for current offerings , if of interest<br />
<br />
http://www6.boulder.ibm.com/devcon/devcon/docs/ids93wso.htm<br />
<br />
Was interested as there is also an IBM DB2 Workgroup Edition<br />
and wondered which was developed first and whether it was a &quot;mix&quot; of Informix and DB2 or DB2 with an Informix label ?<br />
<br />
Also interested if anyone using it in anger with Baan ?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

Can anyone give me suggestions for db_resource parameters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 06:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not think your answer will be with db_resource.  <br />
<br />
It is probably going to be in the version/patch level of Informix, regenerating indices (or some other large-scale database tuning) or an OS SP/patch level.  <br />
<br />
What does IBM say about the Informix version you are on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kereni</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">The system was installed on WinNT and Informix 7.23.TC14<br />
The Informix was upgrade to 7.31.TC6 (at this point a performances test was good)<br />
Next the WinNT was upgrade to Win2k. The Informix version works OK but some tools were not working (onstat, ontape etc).<br />
After consulting with Informix they told us to upgrade to 7.31.TD4 that support Win2k. Now the Informix version is working as should be on this environment but the performances are very bad compare to the tests in WinNT.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
What Win2000 SP are you on?<br />
<br />
I would also suggest posting at dbforums.com or the comp.databases.informix group.  A lot of Informix people hang out there that may have hit your problem.  I would also push Informix support more for a solution -- what is the latest patch set, Client SDK and SP level for Win 2000.  My gut reaction is that you will find the solution here.<br />
