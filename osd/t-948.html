<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bherkend</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 10:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
is anyone using Oracle Multithreaded server (MTS) in conjunction with Baan IV or ERP Application ? If so, which OS is used ?<br />
I once had a trial with HPUX which came out with a very high (65-80%) system time usage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would be very interested for answers to this question!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oracle normally recommends already using MTS starting with 100 oracle users or so. This would fit most Baan installations.<br />
<br />
I was always confused by this issue, especially in regards to Oracle on HP-Ux. HP themselves do not recommend to use MTS with Oracle on an HP platform at all. Reason they give: The Thread implementation is not so efficient.<br />
<br />
But if you read the documentation of oracle, how MTS works, then you see, that actualla operating system level threads are not really used!<br />
<br />
So what's the deal?<br />
<br />
Does anybody have example configurations of MTS within a Baan environment?<br />
<br />
