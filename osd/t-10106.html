<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkahler</div><div class="date">22nd May 2003, 04:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been doing some looking at the forums, and also at my system performance during busy periods. While the Informix read and write percentages are OK (98 and 88% respectively) and check point times are OK (less than 1 second)- we seem to have many checkpoint waits, and large amounts of processor utilization.<br />
<br />
After reading through the forms, I have seen differing opinions on the use of the SQLMUX nettype, and it's support of multiplexing in Baan. Would adding this nettype to the stream pipe and tcp that we already use allow for performance increases in baan? Is multiplexing a necessity for Informix and Baan?<br />
<br />
BTW- we are running IVc4 on IDS 9.30FC1 on HP-UX 11i. 6 processors and 12 GB of memory.<br />
<br />
I can post onstats if needed...Thanks for any advice you can offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">22nd May 2003, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">From top of my head, SQLMUX gives good scalability on Informix, but lower performance when having a small amount off users. This can be explained by:<br />
<br />
- SQLMUX is a process that concentrates Informix connections to a few processes to the engine. As Baan has many connections to the database it makes sense to use this concentrater when having many (2000 +???) connections. <br />
- The concentrator is an extra chain in the whole process. So, when having only a few connections, the performance will drop with at least 10-15% by enabeling the multiplexer.<br />
<br />
As said in the first line: this is from top of my head. As I haven't played intens with the latest Informix versions this can have changed one waye or the other.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
