One of the things we are looking at changing is the system umask from 00 to 022. All files created subsequently will have read/write access for the file owners but only read access for everyone else.<br />
<br />
Could this potentially cause us any problems?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

umask value 022 is at least what it should be. I hope your system was not installed with a umask of 000.</div></div><hr />

I'll forward this info onto our UNIX Administrator.<br />
<br />
It looks as if our system was intially set-up with a umask of 000.<br />

Thanks<br />

This will have the consequence that e.g. a convert to runtime has to be done by one certain account. Furthermore the developers can't work on work that collegue's have developed. <br />
<br />
Baan has a quick guide no. 1029 which will give you some more info.<br />

Good comments. I was assuming a production environment here. We do not allow any maintenance (CRDD, patch install etc) to be done by any other account than bsp. In that scenario a umask value of 022 is appropriate. For development server you might consider a looser security to allow files under $BSE to be group (bsp) writeable.</div></div><hr />

You are right, in a production environment it makes sense. However personally I would like to know which administrator did what, I am not a fan of sharing accounts.<br />
<br />
As described in the QC you can solve the problem as well with a group bit on the bshell.<br />
