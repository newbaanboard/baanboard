<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">20th October 2010, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently we have Oracle running on our actual baan server as that was how it originally was set up.<br />
<br />
We would like to now consider moving Oracle over it a dedicated 64bit server and point in Baan how to talk to that server.<br />
<br />
We can't find out where to specify this. We think it is some file or setting that is not perhaps visible within Baan to point it. Can anyone help out ?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

Than in tabledef specify ORACLE_HOME and TWO_TASK. As soon as you can connect than change the settings in your database definitions and convert to runtime.<br />

<br />
When present, it overrides Baan looking for a LOCAL DB.<br />
<br />
<br />
We actually pointed our backup to our live data just for testing and worked fine...<br />

Thanks for the pointers ... Cheers.</div></div><hr />
