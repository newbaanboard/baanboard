<br />
Does anybody have experience with the combomode for Baan5c. This means that the database process and the ntbshell process in WNT are integrated. It's described in case 115988. <br />
If you have experience with it please let me know. It should increase performance with 20% according to Baan, but is this proven in practise.<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

but certainly will give it a go on the test box<br />
<br />
I'll let you know what happens.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">14th November 2001, 07:19</div></div><div class="posttext">First, the ntbshell implementation was done to avoid the overhead of the NT context switching.  On servers that are lightly loaded, I did not see much difference in performance, but on medium to heavy servers, I do see a 5-15% performance improvement.  Baan's 20% number is reflective of a box being able to run 20% more processes before becoming saturated.  So, it improves scalability and performance.<br />
<br />
I have also used it on a mainframe Baan 5 implementation.  Running in the UNIX environment on a mainframe there are huge performance penalties for context switching, the combo bshell made a difference in batch job performance (sessions running about 18% faster if I recall).  <br />
<br />
UNIX manages processes more effectively so the payback is less than on NT (or so I have heard).  I am waiting to test this on UNIX.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">28th November 2001, 05:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to some changes in the combo bshell, on fast systems you now see a visible performance improvement.  However, I am encountering a regular series of errors where the bshell is reporting a stack overflow from the dbserver_dll.  When I turn the combo mode off, this problem goes away.<br />
<br />
I will post more info as I make progress on resolving this issue (but maybe someone else has already fixed the problem).<br />
<br />
Don't recommend the latest porting set -- already done that -- it appears this problem was introduced in the latest 7.1c porting set.<br />
