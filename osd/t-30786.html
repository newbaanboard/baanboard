This will mean that the domain which our Database and Application server and clients are currently located within will no longer exist and the Servers and Clients will be moved into the Group Active Directory which will be synchronised over the company WAN. <br />
<br />
We need to establish what issues (if any) this will cause us by moving these machines into the Active Directory. Forewarned is forearmed as they say! Does anyone out there have any experience in carrying out such a migration.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fripper</div><div class="date">2nd February 2007, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I have implemented Baan within organisations using Active Directory. The last one chose to have the Baan server off the Active Directory and the users from the Directory were added to a local group with the appropriate access. Which maybe a way for you to have a more gentle migration.<br />
<br />
Depending who is in charge of the new Domain and its GPO they would need to be aware that the baan user is a member of the Administrators group on the machine. The other &quot;feature&quot; is that Baan setups typically use Rexec to start the bshell which again maybe something that would typically be locked down using the Default File Security GPO (found in Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\File System).<br />

<br />
I remember one similar incidence, wherein all users personalised desktop couldnt retrive, when they connected to new domain result local data loss.<br />
<br />
Hence I advice to take backups of users local data before implementing this.<br />
<br />
I recommend to implement Active Directory.<br />
