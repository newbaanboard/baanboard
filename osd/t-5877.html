 <br />
I am facing a very strange situation with table tfgld418  which is allocating a new extent nearly every week.<br />
<br />
Date       /  number of rows    /   total disk spaceused  /  extends<br />
1 Jun 02     /    12.300.000    /              5.7 Gb       /                  5<br />
5 Jul 02       /    8.400.000     /             6.3 Gb         /            6           <br />
12 Jul 02     /    8.750.000     /             7    Gb        /                 7<br />
18 Jul 02     /   10.200.000    /             7.6 Gb        /                 8 <br />
<br />
As you can see above, the row size of the table has never reached the number on 1 Jun. But it is still allocating new extends. And every extend size is 640 Mb ,therefore I need to stop this growth.   <br />
In June I deleted about 5.500.000 rows  from the table.<br />
I can monitor that I have deleted The rows from informix and from baan .  what I am anxious is that the index pages are not deleted  or not freed for reuse.<br />
<br />
In May 2002 we had a data migration, untill this date we had two dbspces; datadbs  for data and idxdbs for indexes, and each of the dbspaces were on different disks thus the index of the of each table was on a different disk and different dbspace. With the data migration we added a new disk named data3dbs to informix and mixed all the data and indexes  in the same disks. thus each tables index  is now in the same disk.<br />
<br />
With the old configuration I had deleted many times such a mass deletion. and never faced this problem . <br />
<br />
Has anybady faced a situation like this before?<br />
<br />
We are using baan4 c3 / Informix DS 7.31 /Hp Unix<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
i remember, there are some problems in informix, with freeing<br />
indexpages. So, if you delete a lot of rows, it could be happend, that the indexpage is not completly freed. so the indexpage could not went to a freepage. In informix 7.3 indexpages and datapages were created in the same extent. So, if the indexpage could not be freed completly, the page is not reused for a new index, only for indexes with the same key values.<br />
<br />
Solution : recreate the index<br />

<br />
You can do a dump from the table, delete the table, import the dump.<br />
But are your settings in the INF_STORAGE file correct??<br />
(An extend of 640Mb is a very big one)<br />

<br />
I do such a mass deletion every month and cannot reorganize it every time. I we did not face it before our new database configuration . With the old configuration I wasn't facing a problem like this. With the old configuration I was able to say after how many rows ,  my table will allocate extend. But now cannot consider when it will allocate a new extend.<br />
<br />
if the reason for this is  , not freed  index pages then all other tables are in the same situation and I then I will need to reorganize whole the database in frequently times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

the setting in the inf_storage are Ok.<br />
We planned the 640 Mb extend size. so that it should take less number of extends . <br />
<br />
<br />
Martin ,<br />
How can I recreate the indexes. without playing with data.<br />
and is this problem solved with informix latest versions<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
from IDS9.2 onwards, datapages and indexpages where written in different extents.<br />
<br />
With IDS7.3 you could create the index seperat with<br />
<br />
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name IN dbspace<br />
<br />
To rebuild the index, i think you must drop the index and create the index new. (to create a cluster-index with ALTER INDEX indexname TO CLUSTER is not practicable because there is only 1 clusterindex per table allowed. You need the space for the table 2 times because IDS build a copy of the table, sort the table in index-sequence an write the copy to disk. After this the old index was dropped.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems, you have a lot of work.</div></div><hr />
