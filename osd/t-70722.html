<br />
Am trying to remove the last server from our SQL cluster to make it a single SQL server, but am having an issue where removing the SQL instance is causing an issue connecting to Baan.<br />
<br />
In db_resource I am changing from:<br />
<br />
msql_serverhost:192.168.200.10\\baan<br />
<br />
to<br />
<br />
msql_serverhost:192.168.200.10<br />
<br />
Once I have updated this am having an issue logging into Baan.<br />
<br />
Is there any other locations that I need to update?<br />
<br />
The tabledef6.2 all looks correct and there is no change required there as the servername is not included there.<br />
<br />
Am getting the following on Baan login:<br />
<br />
Error bdb_errno 510 on ttadv999<br />
Can't read session or object (ttdskbrowser)<br />
Error 510 (Database not on)<br />
<br />
Am able to browse and see the database using SQL Enterprise Manager, so the database is definitely up and running.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

I dont think there's an entry in db_resource necessary if you run a single instance. What happens if you delete this entry so that only tabledef is taken into account ?<br />

<br />
I really appreciate the time you have taken to respond to this post.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the same issue occurs when removing this line entirely and not having it present in the db_resource file.<br />
<br />
I feel as though there is some other location that I am unaware of that requires updating to also reflect the removal of the sql instance.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks lebowski,<br />

<br />
hmmm, that's strange. You haven't changed anything except this entry ? I am asking because error 510 could have other reasons as well (e.g. permissions after a restore from one to another server). Does the event viewer say anything helpful ?<br />
<br />
I am not having access to a Baan 5b system but other locations where environment variables are stored are (some might not exist in B5b): <br />
$BSE/lib/defaults/all<br />
$BSE/lib/bse_vars<br />
Infor Manager: properties of logic service<br />
<br />
Good luck !<br />
