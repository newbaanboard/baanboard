How much more memory is needed per baan user for 9.2 compared to 8.0.5 and 8.1.7? Has anybody measured and how?<br />
HP-UX PA-RISC is our platform for next three years.<br />
<br />
So, 8.1.7.4 or 9.2.x ????</div></div><hr />

<br />
IIRC, a benchmark, conducted on Solaris, indicated no change in memory requirements when using undo tablespaces and automagic PGA management. But your mileage may vary; some sessions used (slightly) more, others slightly less.<br />
<br />
CPU demand increased with about 5%, btw.<br />

<br />
Anyway, my recommandation is clearly to take Oracle9. It brings some really usefull features to ease administration.<br />
<br />
You might want to check your Tools patch level and Portingset Version. Obviously for Oracle9, both should be pretty recent, even though I would not be able to specify excactly, which versions you need, but you find this information on Baan's Support site.<br />
