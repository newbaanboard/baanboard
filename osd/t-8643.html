<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">astrom</div><div class="date">28th January 2003, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to the SQL SLQMMER worm we upgraded to Service Pack 3 for MS SQL 2000 Standard Edition. After that we have experienced performance problems. The session &quot;Rebuild Planned Inventory Movements&quot; used to take 4 minutes, now it takes 40 minutes.<br />
<br />
We are running IVc4 level 1.<br />
<br />
The problem seems to be simple queries taking long time. I isolated the following code:<br />
<br />
	select	tdsls051.*<br />
	from	tdsls051<br />
	where	tdsls051.trdt &gt;= :from.date<br />
	and	tdsls051.ckor = 3<br />
	order by tdsls051._index5<br />
	selectdo<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
This code runs much slower with SP3.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else seen this problem? Do you have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This problem looks like have affected many, which means the problem is more with the SQL2000 SP3 (or related) than with Baan.<br />
<br />
Did you try reverting back to the previously installed MDAC version?  SQL 2000 SP3 comes with MDAC 2.7 SP1.  There are lot of bugfixes in this service pack, one or more of which would have affected the performance.   <br />
<br />
The following link tells you how to do that:<br />
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnmdac/html/data_mdacinstall.asp<br />
<br />
This might help.  If not the MDAC, one of the hotfixes or security patches might have given this problem.  But mostly rolling back the MDAC should help.<br />

We have noticed that msql7_srv.exe processes consume huge amounts of processor (virtually all of it) and huge amounts of memory, approx 100MB.<br />
<br />
We will attempt to go back to MDAC 2.7 also and let you know.  <br />

Thank you very much for sharing this information.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramiro</div><div class="date">31st January 2003, 23:57</div></div><div class="posttext">SP3 wasn't released several months ago as you said. <br />
In the final versions they can include other components, like in this case.<br />
As stated in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-061, in the Technical Details Section:<br />
<br />
Technical description: <br />
Microsoft originally released this bulletin and patch on October 16, 2002 to correct a security vulnerability in a SQL Server stored procedure. The patch was and still is effective in eliminating the security vulnerability, and includes the fix for the vulnerability exploited by the &quot;Slammer&quot; worm virus (Note: Slammer affects only SQL Server 2000 and MSDE 2000). However, while the patch was fully effective in eliminating the security vulnerability, in October, 2002, it was found to interfere with SQL Server operations under some circumstances. As a result, on October 30, 2002, an additional non-security hotfix (317748) was required to ensure normal operations of SQL Server.<br />
<br />
Microsoft released SP3 just last week. Included in this SP it was the hotfix for the security vulnerability, but also, it was included the SP for MDAC 2.7. Microsoft adviced everybody to install SP3 instead of installing just the fix.<br />
<br />
Evidently, something has changed between MDAC 2.7 and MDAC 2.7 SP1.<br />
<br />
It seems that Microsoft will have to release an additional non-security hotfix again, to solve the performance problem introduced in MDAC 2.7 SP1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dedwards45</div><div class="date">1st February 2003, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the point being made here is that Baan should be more proactive in testing service packs / hotfixes instead of being reactive and causing a lot of customer frustration.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">1st February 2003, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. Baan seem very reactive.  To find out whether a SP is supported you need to raise a case with Baan support.  Why is this?  Why is the status of support for a service pack not public information? Can't Baan say if a SP is Supported, Unsupported, or still under test ?</div></div><hr />

What I meant is the first beta release of the SP which was made available to testers 04-11-2002. I would assume that Baan would also have access to these beta releases and test them against their software. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sqlbuff</div><div class="date">1st February 2003, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Ben,<br />
Testing the beta release is not always an indicator about all the problems, particularly performance problems.  Particularly with respect to customer scenarios.  It is Microsoft's product that is beta tested and not Baan product.  So Baan wouldn't have as much real time data as Microsoft with respect to  Baan's own products.  Ofcourse it doesn't mean that the beta releases of SPs should not be tested.<br />
<br />
But think about this... After so much of beta testing over a really big number of sites, Microsoft products still have some problems after the release.  What would be the chance that Baan can find them early?  And certifying Baan with the official release of Microsoft's SP is not equal to testing the beta release of the SP.  They have to test with only the official release.  And it needs some time after the release.  <br />
<br />
If not for the slammer stuff has occurred, customers wouldn't have upgraded to SP3 so early.<br />
<br />

<br />
Beta testing is off course no guarantee but I have the impression that Baan is not very fast with checking new Microsoft products and SP's. It took them many months after the official code freeze of Windows XP to get a BW Client which worrked 100% with the new Windows GUI.<br />

<br />
I know this thread is old but there is some more info that can be posted.<br />
<br />
I recently had this same problem.<br />
Instead if revertind to older MDAC versions I installed MSQL SP3a. This also solved the problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sqlbuff</div><div class="date">19th August 2003, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep.<br />
<br />
SQL Server Service Pack 3a includes the fix for the above performance problem(infact SP3a has just a couple of fixes... this performance issue seems to have affected too many and made Microsoft release an interim SP:).  Before SP3a you either had to approach Microsoft for the hotfix or rollback MDAC.<br />
<br />
Microsoft now suggests the customers to either stay at SP2 (plus all those security patches) or directly go to SP3a (instead of SP3).<br />
