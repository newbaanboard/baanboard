<br />
Explanation:<br />
There is no AD or domain, therefore the ERP LN user has to be created on the W2K3 machine as a normal user as well. Due to the fact that he/she need access via the ERP LN software to $BSE (e.g. /log, /lib, /audit) the user can map the drive with the $BSE to his local machine and has direct access to the whole $BSE directory (and maybe even more). <br />
<br />
How can I prevent the &quot;normal&quot; login to the server and/or the drive mappings and limit the access to the ERP LN server only to the REXEC functionality of the BW ?<br />
<br />
<br />

   When you say that users are able to map the drives, it could only mean two things. Either they are having administrative rights on the ERP Ln server or you have shared the BSE folder (not to be confused with the admin share). For normal client-server access for Baan, i dont think you need to share BSE folder. So which of these scenarios have you got? <br />

Yes, you are right. This users were in the group Administrators, because normal users did not work properly after the initial installation. I have adjusted the access rights in the $BSE directory and moved the users from Adminstrators to normal users. Now everything is as it should be.<br />

Thanks for the hint.</div></div><hr />
