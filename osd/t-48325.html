<br />
I have the following problem during installation from BaanIVc4 on W2K3 with MSSQL database.<br />
<br />
The database is about 32 GB and the transactionlog is 4 GB. During importing tables I get the error 2105 in Baan ( DB error 1105) transactionlog is full.<br />
<br />
I have no possiblity to backup the transaction log (wh is it not possible??) and the option dump database with no_log is also not working<br />
<br />
Any ideas?? What can I do to resolve it??<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

I´m not MSSQL experienced, but in Informix, also this happens.<br />
Perhaps the same solution apply for you.<br />
We had addressed the transaction log to a series of files. When this files are full, the database can´t continue due to log full. So, we re-addressed the transaction log files to a tape device and, in operation, this tape are preserved until next level 0 backup. <br />
<br />
Addicionally, when I upload a great amount of data, I usually address the transaction log to null device.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
