<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noonie</div><div class="date">23rd September 2003, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to attach an insert trigger to tiitm001, to write to an item# and current date to an separate audit table. The update trigger works fine, however I get the following after the insert fires :<br />

Fatal error: Error 1000 (bdb_errno 520) on tiitm100100 in SELECT<br />
Fatal error : Can no continue in tiit,0202s000 in DLL : otiitmd110003 (get.company)<br />

Any suggestions? thx.</div></div><hr />

In any case can you please post the script of your trigger? This would definitely help :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's pretty basic :<br />
<br />
Create Trigger RecordModDate On ttiitm001100<br />
For Update, Insert<br />
As<br />
<br />
Insert Into ItemModHist <br />
	Select t_item, getdate()<br />
	From INSERTED<br />
<br />
<br />
It works fine if I make it solely an update trigger. I tried setting up 2 separate triggers, one for update, one for insert, and crossed my fingers.....same results.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I were to ASSUME that you're using the Level 1 SQL driver....<br />
<br />
Which means that every time you insert data into your table outside of Baan it will corrupt the table....<br />
<br />
search the board for &quot;hash columns&quot; or Level 1 driver...<br />
<br />
If that's not the case, let us know! thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noonie</div><div class="date">30th September 2003, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I'm using Level2. I didn't see any real clear cut way of determining that on any of the posts.<br />
<br />
I upgraded to MSSQL2000 about a year ago. There was a section in the upgrade quide that listed copies of the db_resource file, and what they should look like for each of the 2 driver versions.<br />
I noticed it had a line I was missing:<br />
<br />
msql_level1:0<br />
(I also happened to notice that this section of document U7648AUS has been removed since I printed it about a year ago)<br />
<br />
I added this line...same results. I also installed the latest porting set...same results.<br />
<br />
I'm still screwing around with things to try and get it working.<br />
Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">30th September 2003, 23:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you will be on level 1 driver as Baan did not and will not create a level 2 driver for Baan 4 on SQL Server 2000 (or SQL Server 7). This is despite many documents suggesting that there would be.<br />
<br />
I don't think you can use triggers therefore I am afraid.<br />
<br />
If you discover differently in the future or come up with an alternative, please post it here as I would be really interested to know.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noonie</div><div class="date">1st October 2003, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, Ed is correct. <br />
Here's Baan's answer to my question on whether or not they do or will exist for IVc4 :<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For the moment we do not have an specific date or plans: Baan IV : _________ For the moment Baan has not plans to deliver a level 2 driver for SQL Server 2000 and switching to level 2 mode using porting set 6.1c.06.06  Baan or onwards will not work. db_resource file examples for Level 2 shown in document :<br />
  U7648A US BAAN IV/BaanERP SQL Server 2000 Upgrade Guide for BAAN IV and BaanERP are only relevant for iBaanERP. Reference to level 2 mode in document :<br />
  U7210B US Baan IVc Installation Guide for Microsoft SQL Server Version 2000 is not relevant.<br />
<br />
iBaanERP 5.0b (Grieg) and 5.0c (Corelli):<br />
Level 2 mode is fully supported from porting set 7.1d and onwards using SQL Server 2000 and onwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Back to the drawing board.</div></div><hr />
