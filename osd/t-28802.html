<br />
We just started a group wide migration project for transition from several <br />
Baan IVc installations to a single logistic/multi finance environment on <br />
Infor ERP LN 6.1 (FP3).<br />
<br />
The question now:<br />
Would you use SQL Server as DB with about 600+ users?<br />
Or never ever?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

PS<br />
After some basic training we like LN 6.1 very much :)</div></div><hr />

As all implementations you have to know what you are doeing, but it is possible.<br />
For large sites I still have my doubts about the stability of this combination, but customers proof that is possible.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

I'd be interested to know your opinions of MySQL with ERP LN. How do you feel it compares to SQL Server and how far do you think MySQL will scale when used with ERP LN?</div></div><hr />

<br />
MySQL is limited available with is not without reason. It has constraints and scaling is not optimal yet. One of the current problems is the implementation of cursors: they are based on temp tables. Hopefully version 5.1 will give us improvements. <br />

Hope this helps,<br />
