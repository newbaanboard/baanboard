<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question on BaaN Unix file security.   What does BaaN use (bshell6.1), to decide the file security foe new files generated<br />
from BaaN sessions (I.E. ASCIF print files).<br />
<br />
Here is why I am curious!<br />
<br />
We have the ipc_info changed to execute a unix script to set up the BaaN environment prior to execing the bshell6.1 command.  In the script we have the umask instruction set to 660 (why, I do not know).  This shoud create a file with ------rwx security, but it actually creates a file rw-rw----.   I checked the /etc/profile file and it also contains a umask command of 002 which should create a file rw-rw-r--.   I am not sure, but I suspect that the default umask for the Unix box is 006 (rw-rw----). <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I am familier with these commands, but the man command for these commands does not explain what the bshell is doing.  <br />
I am curious of what the bshell is using for it's file security, the system default, any security set in /etc/profile or the ipc_info environemnt script that sets any file security.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I am confused at your interpretation of the permission codes.  My understanding is below.<br />
<br />
1 = execute<br />
2 = write<br />
4 = read<br />
therefore:<br />
660 = rw-rw----<br />
002 = -------w-<br />
006 = ------rw-</div></div><hr />

<br />
The umask command subtracts the numbers fro 666 for it's file<br />
security.  Thus umask 002 would be;<br />
<br />
                           666<br />
                           002-<br />
                          -----<br />
                           664     or   rw-rw-r<br />
<br />
If it is a directory being created, then it subtracts the umask given from 777.<br />
<br />
there is an error in my note though, umask of 660 should create a file, (666-660 = 006), as ------rw- instead of ------rwx.</div></div><hr />

You can also use the umask option. For more information you can check solution 77916. <br />
<br />
SOLUTION 77916 <br />
Default permissions used by bshell when generate ASCII files on the OS. <br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: <br />
Bshell environment <br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
Default permissions used by bshell code  when generate ASCII files on Operating System using Baan device. By default the umask is set to 06 because this value is hard-coded in bshell. <br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
The value of 06 can be narrowed down by using the environment variable BMASK. The value of BMASK is OR-ed with 06.  So it is  not possible to set permissions lower than 06 , for example it isn't possible to set BMASK to 02 or 00. <br />
<br />
A new environment variable is introduced called: USE_BMASK_AS_ABSOLUTE. <br />
When this variable is set to 1, the value of BMASK is not OR-ed with 06 anymore, but used as an absolute umask. So in this way you can obtain an umask like 02 or 00. <br />
<br />
Ways to implement: <br />
1) ASCII implementation: <br />
        Set  up these variables on the  .profile  from user <br />
configuration. <br />
        USE_BMASK_AS_ABSOLUTE=1 <br />
        BMASK=02 <br />
<br />
2) BW implementation: <br />
        Set up these variables on command line from the BW user <br />
configuration <br />
        -- -set USE_BMASK_AS_ABSOLUTE=1 -set BMASK=02 <br />
<br />
With this implementation you will obtain the mask &quot;rw- rw- r--&quot; on the Operating System. <br />
<br />
LAST MODIFIED ON:       30-11-99 <br />
<br />
NOTE: <br />
This solution is applicable for  UNIX . <br />
<br />
COMMENTS: Be very careful in using this functionality. The default <br />
setting of 06 in bshell was introduced for good security reasons. Do serious tests after introducing this.</div></div><hr />
