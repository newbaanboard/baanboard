We are talking about tttxt001 and tttxt002.<br />
<br />
In Baan threre is no app.lock concerning this tables.<br />
<br />
Is there a way in oracle to remove a lock?</div></div><hr />

Is your database Oracle?<br />
<br />
If it is true, please check your dml_locks value in init.ora.</div></div><hr />

Killing sessions after determining locks possible using above query/command. I searched &quot;error 113&quot; into KQ, here is info -<br />
<br />
- Table Update Lock<br />
	When a table has been locked with an Update Lock, then the table is in Read Only mode.  Update actions on the table are suspended till the Update Lock is released.  (This action differs from the Baan action to lock a table.  A process which has put such kind of lock on a table can perform any action on that table.  All other processes which try to do an update action will get error EFLOCKED (113).<br />
<br />
The procedure for backup will be now:<br />
1) 	Put Database Lock<br />
2) 	Put Update Lock on all tables to be backed up.<br />
3) 	Release Database Lock<br />
Since each table which has to be backed up is locked now, the lock for the database can be released.   The status (contents) of the database as it is backed up, is the status at the moment of releasing this lock.  Processes which were waiting for some read action on a locked table can continue now.  <br />
4) 	Release tables Update Lock<br />
When a table is backed up, its lock can be released.  From that moment on, also updates are allowed on this table.  Processes which were waiting for some update action on a locked table can continue when the tables lock has been released.<br />
5) 	All locks on all tables are released.  <br />
Update and read actions can be done on all tables.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
