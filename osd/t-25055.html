We are going to upgrade to 9.2.0.4.<br />
Who has any experience concerning performance of 9.2.0.4 with BaaN IV c4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">9th September 2005, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">No difference between the two versions. On Baan support you will find a solution, how to set a number of hidden parameters in Oracle to get things working acceptable. In the worst case set &quot;compatible&quot; to 8i and that's about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I installed release 9.2.0.5 on top of 9.2.0.2 without noticing any difference in performance.<br />
<br />
Why do you go to 9.2.04 ? I think the latest release for version 9 is 9.2.0.7 <br />
<br />
The big performance degradation comes when you move from oracle 7 to higher, because than the memory usage of each process is doubled + oracle started to play a lot with the optimizer while BaaN is not designed for that.<br />

We have Oracle 9.2.6 with BaanIV on HP-UX.<br />
Performance is ok.<br />
After migration from 7 to 9 we had performance-troubles which were solved with the init-parameter optimizer_features_enable.<br />
<br />
Info from BaanSupport:<br />
Since the baan oracle databasedriver is still compiled with oracle 8 libraries we found that execution plans are created better if optimizer_features_enable   is set  to   8.1.7 instead of 9.2.0.<br />

<br />
What is the problem you heard of in 6?<br />
<br />
Sounds like I don't want the latest bugs, but only bugs that are already solved. Maybe the bug you know from 6 was already in 4....<br />
<br />
From what I have seen was 9.2.0.4 not so stable (1, 2, and 3 neither). The 5, 6 and 7 are better.<br />
<br />
Best luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 16:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  I got hit with a major bug in 9.2.0.4 that corrupted my Oracle OCFS File System.  Things got real ugly!  I needed Oracle to come in and get things straightened out.<br />
<br />
Durring that time we upgrade to 9.2.0.6 and have not had any serious issues since.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bferro</div><div class="date">17th October 2005, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">We migrated from Oracle 8 to 9i for Baan C4 on a Unix 11.11 system.  We had some big performance problems with a few sessions.  One was with tibom1510m000 which sometimes would take 6-8 seconds.  Doesn't sound like much but when a user has to do hundreds of them, then they complain.  Also, another problem was with copying router text to a ascii file and then pasting it to a new operation.  The problem seems to happen when you had to scroll mutiple pages of routing text.  This would take over 45 seconds.  I added the following line to the db_resource file and the first problem takes no more than a second and the second problem takes about 3 seconds.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately we had to reset the variable again after some days, because printing order acknowledgements with certain range conditions became so slow, it was not bearable for the users.<br />
<br />
So we all learn: There are no miracle to be expected!<br />
