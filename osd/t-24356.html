<br />
We are porting our BaaN application on oracle Database, which is currently working on Sql server.<br />
if some one can tell me which version we have to chose between Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition , the responses will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">22nd June 2005, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The edition depends on what you will be using it for and how much you are willing to pay (enterprise edition comes with a much higher price tag).<br />
Check the features between versions, from Oracle itself, here:<br />
- For 10g: http://www.oracle.com/database/product_editions.html<br />
- For 9i (pdf): http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/oracle9i/pdf/9idb_rel2_prod_fam.pdf<br />
<br />
If I was given the chance to choose I would go for the SE since most of the capabilitis of EE are not used within a Baan environment (and it is also cheaper).<br />
You should post more details about what your system will be like and its planned usage if you want to get better advises...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">22nd June 2005, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Either one will work for you. Baan does not use all of the bells and whistles in Oracle for its implementation. You just need to decide if you want to use the advanced features of the Enterprise Edition for projects external to Baan.<br />

We are doing the TBase to Oracle thing but have also though about MS-SQL as well.<br />

<br />
100% agree with Victor, go with SE as EE feature are not usable in BaaN environment.<br />
<br />
EE will be use for advance feature of oracle. Just go through URL's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">6th August 2005, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">SE only supports 2 CPUs (i think) EE supports &gt; 2 CPUs<br />
<br />
that should be the deciding factor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">6th August 2005, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">SE supports up to 4 CPU's.<br />
If you have more than 4 CPU's then you need to go for EE. If not, you can go for SE and if, later on, add more than 4 CPU's, upgradeyour SE to EE. <br />
Just go thru those two links, all is explained there.</div></div><hr />
