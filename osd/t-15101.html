<br />
I am switching my Baan IVc4 install from Windows 2000 to AIX5.2. All my users are running bw from their XP desktops.<br />
<br />
I created a an NFS share on a Windows server using MSWindows Services for Unix and mounted this on my IBM box so that users can save reports from Baan there and retrieve them again later from their desktops.<br />
<br />
Whenever I write an ASCII file to this NFS share on the IBM and try to open it in notepad in Windows, the return characters seem messed up and the whole file has become one line.<br />
<br />
The file does look OK when opened in a vi editor on windows, when I just save and close it again it now shows up OK in notepad as well. This is not something that would work in production however since the users do not have access to a vi editor.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any idea what is causing the file to become 'messed up' and how I can prevent this from happening?<br />
Or for that matter, does anybody have suggestions on easier ways to share files between a UNIX and Windows server?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help.<br />
Ronald.</div></div><hr />

<br />
U can use OS commands like unix2dos (available in solaris) to convert files readable by notepad.<br />
<br />
Alternatively instead of using NFS share for windows, u can server2client function of ottdllbw to transfer file from unix to the network folder of windows machine (accessible from PC). <br />
<br />
The 3rd argument has to be true for function server2client .</div></div><hr />

Could you provide me with some more detail on how to use this function?<br />
Thanks again,<br />
