<br />
I would like to implement password agging in the HA environment and to allow users to change their passwords form ERP LN application. I did some tests on a single server and everything works as it should. The problem is, because I can not change user password on both servers simultaneously. Session ttstpchangepw change the password on the application server only, but does not change password on another server, which is the database server and stand-by Application Server.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea how to achieve this?<br />
<br />
Both servers are IBM wih AIX 6.1.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I see no other way than to sync /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow (not sure about AIX, but in other Unix OSs the files are called like this) via a cronjob.<br />

If you are using NIS, the passwords can be synchronized.</div></div><hr />
