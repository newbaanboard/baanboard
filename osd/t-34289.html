When you perform your level 0 backup, the transactions logs is also backed up, if you are backing  up the transactions log also.<br />
<br />
I mean, first of all the transactions logs have to be backing up on a physical media,  for example a tape. I have found some instalations that the transaction log has been directed to null device. Of course this is a bad practice due to, when a disaster occurs, you have to restore your last level 0 backup and then the incrementals. But if you don´t have the transactions logs backups, you can´t recover the database up to the failure time.<br />
<br />
If you want to check this, you can edit the file onconfig.<br />
<br />
Finally, if you perform a level 0 backup on working hours, the performance will be affected, mostly when the system will backup large tables.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

SQL files can be repaired due to sql database repair (http://www.recoverytoolbox.com/sql.html). The program restores mdf files after power failures, viruses, malicious software. It can show the results of repairing as a table list. Program works under Windows 98 and higher.</div></div><hr />
