<br />
I thought you guys might be intersted in this. I have just seen the CIS has finally released the free Oracle security audit benchmark scoring tool. They have also updated the Oracle security benchmark document to version 1.1. The benchmark is a big security checklist document based in part on the SANS Oracle security step-by-step book. The tool checks quite a lot of the items in this benchmark automatically and checks some items via a questionnaire. The document lists which items are checked. With the tool you can generate a score to tell how compliant you are with this security benchmark. It is also possible to view the log of the tool for detail of the checks that it has performed. Its in Java and is available for Windows, Solaris and Linux. It is worth downloading and checking your Oracle database security with it.<br />
<br />
I have added a link on my site to it on my tools page <br />
