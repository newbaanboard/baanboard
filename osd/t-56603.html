<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaotto</div><div class="date">25th August 2009, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Does this happen for all users or just one specific user.<br />
<br />
If this is only one user it could be a problem with the BW client and a reinstall or upgrade of the BW would be required.<br />
<br />
If this is happening for all users we would need more information and log files.</div></div><hr />

I have seen this error when you delete a user that have designed some process under DEM.<br />
<br />
In most cases, you can re create the user and the error will disappear.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
