<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arbutt</div><div class="date">12th July 2014, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently we have installed production server with Windows server 2003 standard and SQL 2005. Server is 32 bits. We have installed BaaN IV C4 and ERP LN 6.1 FP6 on it.<br />
Users are complaining that BaaN is working slow as reports and transactions takes time. But major problem is Server hangs almost every other day. Screen is on, showing desktop but fully frozen, mouse moves but can not click any where. And strange thing is that if we ping the server, it replies positively. Event viewer does not have anything for the time when it hangs. There is an error recorded in event viewer regularly &quot;Could not load Performance DLL&quot;.<br />
So only option in this scenario is to Hard reset server and then everything starts normal.<br />
<br />
Need your help and guidance to resole this issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this happening only particular time of the day or no specific time, secondly, could you please send more information from the event viewer.<br />
<br />
Other question, as you mentioned that in the same server you have Baan IV &amp; ERP LN, in that case users are working on which instance.<br />
