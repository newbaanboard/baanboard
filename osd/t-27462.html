Any ideas? I know someone solved this problem at this customers site in a previous implementation, but they didn't document it. They only thing they told me is that it was a typical Baan problem, not a Citrix problem. :confused: <br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />

thanks for the links, but we solved the problem yesterday: I didn't have an account to test the scrolling myself in the old farm, so I looked up a couple of users who did. It appeared that my testers could scroll in the old citrix farm, but users in my building couldn't. After some testing I discovered that the Citrix servers on the other location (same farm!) were installed with a newer version of baan, B40.c76(instead of c61). Copied the files over the baan files on a testserver in the new farm et voila: scrolling works! <br />
I've been cursing for about an hour, hope I'll never meet the person who did this on only part of the farm :mad: , took me two days of testing.<br />
But very glad it works! :) <br />
Thanks again for the links, found some other usefull info there.<br />
regards,<br />
