Have you considered blocking the item codes from being used in transactions with the help of signal codes? Once an item is used, its best to leave it and block it from being used again with the help of signal codes. Trying to find out in which all tables it is used and deleting them isnt a good idea especially if its gone into your integration tables...<br />
