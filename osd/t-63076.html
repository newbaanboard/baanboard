<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BurghMan</div><div class="date">9th November 2012, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">We have intermittent BaaN slowness.  We have a Windows/SQL Server environment with the SQL server being an active/passive cluster.  The application will run fine for 1-2 months then be slow for a week or two at a time and it's driving us crazy.  We have had network experts/ database experts and Infor look into this but can't find anything....then the problem just goes away for a while making it difficult to troubleshoot.  I have noticed some files in the tmp directory on the BaaN server that I haven't noticed before and was wondering if anyone knows what they are.  We are getting mssql.err files, audit.err files and bshell files that are all showing 0 kb size with nothing in the file.  Does anyone know what these files are and how are they getting generated?  Has anyone experienced intermittent BaaN slowness and/or have suggestions on what could be causing this?<br />

Thanks in advance, Rob</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it realy the server or the network ... if it is slow for the users and you run a bshell directly on the server do you have the same effect.<br />
<br />
Have you measured some explain plans of sessions running normal, compared to the explain plan of the same sessions when they run slow. You could also measure this with the baan logging getting an idear which part gives slow response.<br />
<br />
We had some issues with an oracle based system ... it runs fine for weeks and then some standard session using item master e.g. runs extremely slow.<br />
<br />
Reports run before 1 minute, than runs for hours.<br />
<br />
Reason was a problem with the optimizer and the statistics. One solution was to update the statistics, helps in 3 of 4 cases ... but sometimes nothing helps. We than went back from cost based to rule based and the sessions runs with acceptable answer times.<br />
<br />
Other effects i remember was hardware issues connecting patch wires to some plugs causing parts of the network to slow down.</div></div><hr />
