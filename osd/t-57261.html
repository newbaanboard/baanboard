Since the past 2 days the performance of certain sessions (standard and customized).There were never any complaints prior to this.<br />
There hasn't been any system upgrade recently or anything of that sort and neither is any other baan session like backup etc running. The system has been shutdown and restarted a no. of times.<br />
We have conducted the following diagnostics.<br />
<br />
There was no virus found on virus check<br />
The network is working fine other than this issue.<br />
The Oracle 8 database size is ok i.e. dbf, idx and temp tablespaces are fine.<br />
The CPU usage is ok<br />
The db_resource file contains:<br />
dbsinit:01<br />
ora_init:0111000<br />
ora_max_array_fetch:1<br />
ora_max_array_insert:1<br />
<br />
The ora_storage file contains:<br />
*:*:T:group:0214:MSGSIZE:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE BAANDB INITRANS 3 <br />
*:*:I:group:0214:MSGSIZE:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE BAANIDX INITRANS 3 <br />
<br />
What else could be the cause of this sudden problem ???<br />
The users are getting quite impatient due to this, so immediate help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's something from an old document I found:<br />
<br />
&quot;The Oracle RDBMS uses a Cost Based Optimizer that optimizes the access to the data that is needed to process transactions and queries, based on the physical data distribution. The way transactions are processed can also be influenced by giving the Oracle Optimizer specific commands.<br />
The Cost Based Optimizer uses statistics on the physical data distribution to compute the best access path to the data. These statistics should be estimated or computed on a regular basis, using the ANALYZE TABLE command within Oracle.<br />
The Oracle Optimizer functions optimally if the statistics are as recent as possible, especially on tables for which a good performance is important. The Baan Database Driver for Oracle however, issues special HINT commands with the SQL statements to improve the processing of the SQL statements. This implies that the need for very recent statistics is of less importance. An analysis once per week or month can be sufficient.&quot;<br />
<br />
You might want to run an &quot;analyze table &lt;tablename&gt; estimate statistics&quot; for at least the large tables used by your ill-performing sessions, but preferably for all your Baan tables on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">19th November 2009, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">As u say certain sessions only , i can imagine following<br />
<br />
1. As recommended by others statitics on concerned tables are not properly updated.<br />
2 Too  many files in $BSE/tmp. Clearing $BSE/tmp through purgin device queue (say 2 days old) can be of help.<br />
3.The sessions may be transformation sessions with lot of selects and disk based data transformation . Changing the algo to in-memory based will improve performance while reducing the load.<br />
4. Use the performance counters to check extent of paging file being used .<br />
5. How many processes are used with how much memory and what load on server.<br />
<br />
This thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=55262) though for sql server may also be relevent.</div></div><hr />

- Is your virus scanner configured correctly? Are the folders of Baan and the database disabled? If not, everything will be slow.<br />
- creating database statistics can indeed make a huge difference. To do so, remember that every version has its own way of creating these.<br />
- This document (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/attachment.php?attachmentid=3474&amp;d=1194015547) can help to identify performance issues in an LN enviornment.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Several years ago i faced the same problem and i discovered, there was an indexfile on the same disk as the datafile. We moved the indexfile to another disk (no datafile disk) and the performance problem had been solved.</div></div><hr />
