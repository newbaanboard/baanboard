<br />
Thanks in advance for viewing my problem.<br />
<br />
A couple of days ago,we rebooted our Baan server. Ever since, the performance of this server has become very slow. It takes 1 minute for each baan session to open. Every time a session opens, an error message appears in the $BSE/log. <br />
<br />
The description of the error is as follows<br />
<br />
E:root: session: &quot;ottstpstdlib &quot;;object: &quot;ottstpstdlib&quot;; company number: 0<br />
Log_mesg: BclmProductLicense returned cannot make connection<br />
<br />
<br />
Also someimtes an error occurs in the $BSE/log/log.oracle8 as follows<br />
<br />
dbs_errno = 510, Error 510 occurred:<br />
Could not load shared Oracle library<br />
path = /app/ORACLE/product/10.1.0/baandb/lib32<br />
library = libclntsh.sl<br />
Flushed at /view/port.8.4a/vobs/tt/servers/ORACLE_2/oci_shlib.c : #363.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please suggest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance.<br />

<br />
The Oracle error 510 usually indicates that Baan thinks the database is not up, though the specifics from log.oracle8 are interesting.  I would first check to see if libclntsh.sl is actually in the path specified.  Confirm that the database is up by:<br />
<br />
Oracle: Execute the command &quot;ps -ef|grep ora|grep &lt;ORACLE_SID&gt;&quot; to see if the dbwr, lgwr, pmon,smon are running . The other way to check if the database is up and running is to set the ORACLE_SID[ or TWO_TASK] , ORACLE_HOME [ or TNS_ADMIN] in the environment and then to try to login to SQL*Plus. If this test, shows that the database is not up, start the database and then try again.<br />
<br />
<br />
For your other error, Baan seems to be having problem starting the standard library.  With &quot;BclmProductLicense returned cannot make connection&quot;, i would try patching tools objects by running &quot;Patch Objects after Error solving&quot;  ttiex3226m000.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, I would highly recommend that you call Baan support.  My guess is that the reboot wasn't clean.  I have had similar situations and usually patch objects after error solving cleans it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your valuable inputs.<br />
<br />
I cannot locate the session Patch Objects after Error Solving in LN6.1.<br />
Is there any other way to Patch the tools objects?<br />

Thanks and Regards,<br />

<br />
Where is your license server? Is this process (or service) started? If this server is on another host, could you &quot;see&quot; (ping) this host from application host?</div></div><hr />

My license server is on the same machine in which baan is installed. The License service BclmServer is started.<br />

This session is not valid anymore in the Reger (5.2) and LN (6.1) Tools versions.<br />
BclmProductLicense returned cannot make connection<br />
Did you execute the BclmClientTest utility to verify your license connectivity?<br />
