<br />
We are running BaaN IV c4 on Win Nt having Oracle 9i as db.<br />
<br />
I am trying to take BaaN Table backup through a batch file which is utilising bdbpre exe, but unfortunately i am getting error <br />
TNS-12560: TNS:protocol adapter error <br />
<br />
Ofcourse I am able to take backup through BaaN session, so my Oracle listener service is running, the only thing which i could guess regarding error is probably i will have to write something in my batch which talks of some Oracle related environment variables, such as SID, or oracle hom etc etc.<br />
<br />
One more thing we did BaaN migration from Oracle 8i to 9i.<br />
<br />
Can somebody guide me ?? Am i moving in the right direction.<br />
<br />
I am herewith attaching the batch file, along with the log file , and sqlnet file which got generated when i executed my batch file.<br />
 <br />

<br />
Is Baan on the same server as Oracle? If so, why are you using a listener? that's just wasted time..  (If not then disregard, but I'd have to ask why you are concerned with ORACLE_SID? )<br />
<br />
see if you can connect to oracle through the command line sqlplus, you would do something like<br />
<br />
sqlplus system/manager<br />
<br />
if you can connect that way let me know.. I would suspect that you cannot. you can probably only connect like:<br />
sqlplus system@&lt;service name&gt;/manager<br />
<br />
Which means that you have a configuration problem at the  oracle level.<br />

<br />
Well yes both BaaN Application and Oracld db are on same server.<br />
<br />
I tried connecting through command prompt by :<br />
<br />
sqlplus system/manager<br />
<br />
and i was able to login sucessfully.<br />
<br />
The reason why i thought about listener or Oracle sid is that the sqlnet file which got generated after running the batch file contained error 12560 and even the 700_err.700 file also contained the same error.<br />
<br />
<br />
do u mean to say there is no need to specify any sort of environment variables in my batch file which is using bdbpre ??<br />
<br />
Any suggestions what should i do next to resolve this problem ??<br />
<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
Ok, so its a Baan problem and not an oracle problem. That's good!<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have the same oracle_home and oracle_sid for all of your companies? If so, try adding<br />
oracle_home:\path<br />
oracle_sid:sid<br />
to your db_resource and trying again..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">22nd February 2004, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
As u suggested i tried putting up the following in my db_resource file<br />
<br />
oracle_home:C:\oracle91<br />
oracle_sid:baan<br />
<br />
but nothing happened, and i received the same error.<br />
<br />
Then i inserted these 2 variables in my Win NT system variables, by right clicking on <br />
my computer ---- &gt; properties ----&gt; environment var. <br />
<br />
After that it worked.<br />
<br />
I din't shutdown/restart my database after inserting it in db_resource file.<br />
<br />
do u think that because of this the settings were not affected ??? just wanted to know out of curiousity.<br />
<br />
anyway thanks for all the help u provided, now i am able to successfullt take the backup through batch file.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
That's good news!<br />
<br />
the db_resource thing should have worked.. not sure why it didn't. No reboot or anything needed.. <br />
I guess its something I'll have to play with a little.<br />

<br />
I tried following combinations/permutation in my db_resource file<br />
<br />
FIRST TIME<br />
<br />
SET oracle_home =c:\oracle91<br />
SET oracle_sid=baan<br />
<br />
SECOND TIME<br />
<br />
SET oracle_home:c:\Oracle91<br />
SET oracle_sid:baan<br />
<br />
None of them worked .... which one do u think should have worked ??<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
All db_resource variables are &quot;:&quot; so there should never be an &quot;=&quot; in there..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">24th February 2004, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Well i will have to just try again, i think i also tried without putting SET.<br />
<br />
I will again try putting up below mentioned values in db_resource file<br />
<br />
<br />
oracle_home:c:\Oracle91<br />
oracle_sid:baan<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
let's see.<br />
