This is my first post and this is my problem:<br />
We are in the middle of project of implementing Baan 5.0c on Win2K and SQL2000. We have bought another software for Human Resource Management (HRM) from the same company that implements Baan. This HRM runs with Microsoft Internet Information Server 5.0, MS.NET Framework and SQL2000 database. <br />
Does anybody think there would be a problem if we install HRM product on the same server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 08:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Not knowing what the load is for the HRM app, my first inclination is to not run the package with the Baan server.  The .NET, IIS and second instance of SQL Server could easily destabilize the Baan environment.  <br />
<br />
Secondly, since Baan runs your enterprise, it may be good to set this up on a test server first, see what the install and performance issues are and then decide whether or not to colocate this with Baan.  Thereby making a decision from a position of firm knowledge rather than making Baan run poorly and then attempting to clean up the pieces.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nribnikar</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some detailed information.<br />
We have IBM NetFinity 8500R server with 4 Pentium III Xeon 700 processors,<br />
4GB RAM, 2x18,2GB HDD in RAID1 and 5x18,2GB HDD in RAID5.<br />
In this phase of implementation we have 20 licenses for 20 users,<br />
when we go live we planned to have about 100 users.<br />
We have about 1000 employees.<br />
For HRM application our partner propose server with 2 Pentium III 1GHz with 512 MB RAM<br />
and installation of IIS, .NET  and SQL 2000.<br />
We have SQL2000 standard edition.<br />
We do not have a test server.<br />
<br />
Does anybody has problems when installing IIS and .NET on BaaN server?</div></div><hr />

I responded to your email request but for the sake of the board here is part of what I sent:<br />
<br />
If it were my system, I would want them on seperate boxes. <br />
<br />
Here are some of the problems: <br />
<br />
1.  The .NET environment and IIS are patch intensive.  Due to the frequency of security and bug fixes, you will be patching this frequently. Each of these patches are a potential source of instability and downtime for the Baan environment.<br />
<br />
2.  Having two SQL databases on the same server can lead to unpredictable performance issues.  For example, during a payroll check run in the HRM -- will this put load on the system that will slow down Baan.<br />
<br />
Every customer I have had that has tried to do this on NT or 2000 has eventually split the applications on to different boxes.  It sounds good initially but it is incorrect and not a good practice.<br />
