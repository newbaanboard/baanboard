<br />
We have changed hardware, 7.31&gt;9.40 and changed to level-2. This is on hp-ux 5-way box...<br />
We have performance problem with Informix. Basic problem is that CPU-power doesn't get freed. We have started with 3 virtual CPU's and after working day there seems to be full CPU-load  on these oninits without any user connected to instance.<br />
<br />
Crazy thing is also that when I take CPUVPS off one by one (onmode -p)...run queue on unix-level (vmstat) gets shorter.<br />
<br />
In Informix-level there isn't any queue problems. Statistics seems to be ok. We have changed also optimizer behaviour and opt_goal. I/O serves also very well.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
