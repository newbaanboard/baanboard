<br />
We are trying to migrate our Oracle Database from Unix Server to AIX Server because of space constraints in Unix Servers.<br />
<br />
The Application Server will still continue to be on the same UNIX Servers for all environments though.<br />
<br />
Please list down all the necessary steps to be performed.<br />
<br />
Whether revalidation is necessary?<br />
<br />
What files need to be changed on baan side and what other changes is any?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th January 2009, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">1.migrate small /test company data to other aix db2.<br />
2. create separate new database definition for database in aix and assign the same to test company . Keep all unaffected same.<br />
3.Also create audit database defn for db2 to  assign the same to parameter tables <br />
4.Test the same for test company and on successful tests , plan and implement complete migration.<br />
<br />
As db2 may not be in ur validation ttiex3101m000 , u may need to re-validate the server before u start this process. When u assign db to tables , in the backend tabledef6.1 is changed when u convert to runtime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hitesh thanks for quick response.<br />
<br />
But we are going to use Oracle as the Database in AIX also and it is already present in requested system configuration.<br />
<br />
Can you elaborate for Oracle from Unix to AIX server as steps or will they be the same as you have already mentioned?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Normally you can clone a database if the oracle version/os is the same. However you need to verify if this is possible too if you copy from your unix to aix. If it is not possible I suggest that you simply export your database and import it again. Use the new impdb/expdp tools they should be faster as the old exp/imp tools.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">9th January 2009, 01:54</div></div><div class="posttext">depending on your oracle version you can either use transportable tablespaces or just copy the datafiles across. (copying the datafiles will only work if your &quot;unix&quot; and AIX  have the same endian.)<br />

Baan related sugestions are valid as understood by u .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">9th January 2009, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Han's and Dave's suggestion sounds spot on to me. The simplest is exp/imp.<br />
<br />
In regards to the validiation: As long as the new server is only a database server and not running baan, then you do not need to change anything in your existing validation and the new server does not need any.<br />
