<br />
Once you have both the nodes setup as a Active/Passive or Active/Active Configuration, you will need to do a logical install of Baan on both the nodes.<br />
Do a full install of Baan on your NAS/SAN (Storage Area Network) and point it to the Virtual Server. This is the drive on which your Baan will reside... say E: or D:   (OR... you can do a dirty install , by copying your e:\baan from your current Baan server to the cluster virtual server, change registry entries and do a logical install).<br />
<br />
Check the e:\baan\lib\license6.2 file<br />
Check the e:\baan\lib\tabledef6.2 file   to point to your SAN.<br />
<br />
In the Network Resources... create BaanLogic Services, Licensing &amp; also Shared memory (if applicable). This is managed thru your Cluster Administration.<br />
<br />
To License...<br />
Run your RSC for Node 1 and Node 2 respectively.<br />
 Validate the NODE 2 first. Because, the RSC was taken on it last.<br />
 Insert the Tools Key &amp; Software Standard Key and Validate Tools set.<br />
 Do not run Configure Application session just yet.<br />
- Fail over to NODE 1.<br />
- Insert the Tools Key &amp; Validate the Tools set. (The Software Standard Key need not be entered Its the same for both nodes)<br />
- After the above steps are done.. <br />
  Go to e:\baan\lib\license6.2 File and change the entries from &lt;NODE1&gt;,&lt;NODE2&gt;  To &lt;Baan Server name&gt; (The virtual Server).<br />
<br />
But remember, Baan software is NOT Cluster aware. Everytime you failover.. you will lose connection to Bshell.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
Thanks for paying attention on this thread.<br />
<br />
we already did the instalation with the help of a document designed for NT 4 cluster/ oracle 7.3.  It take 4 days to install the baan application. Right now we are loading service pack after that we will load the IS5 (indian localisation). After that we will validate the licence. You are quite right that Baan software is NOT Cluster aware. Everytime server failover.. we will lose connection to Bshell &amp; we have to login again.<br />
<br />
Any Way Thanks a lot to u. <br />
<br />
Definitly if we get the reply before of that, then we completed it in a day or 2.</div></div><hr />
