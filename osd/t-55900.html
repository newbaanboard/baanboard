13-05-2009 <br />
New version of the portingset released, New PA numbers are used, check PA number. <br />
This was needed for a problem in bdbreconfig where only one table was handled even if there are more tables in the list. <br />
18-05-2009 <br />
Also new techincal notes made available for this portingset. <br />
<br />
NOTE4: <br />
18-05-2009 <br />
SQL Server 2008 SP1 has been successfully validated with porting set 6.1c.08. As a consequence, SQL Server 2008 SP1 is supported now with porting set 6.1c.08. <br />
<br />
The Installation Wizard for ERP LN uses a Microsoft addon package called DMO (Distributed Management Objects) for an initial installation on SQL Server 2008 SP1. DMO is not part of the SQL Server 2008 SP1 installation, but can be found at the SQL Server 2008 SP1 Installation medium. Search for the .msi file &quot;SQLServer2005_BC.msi&quot;. There are two flavours, 32 and 64 bits. To be installed after SQL Server 2008 SP1. Package does not install if the wrong version is taken. <br />
