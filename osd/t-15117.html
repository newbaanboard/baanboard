<br />
We reorganized all &quot;medium tables&quot; (about 150 tables) two weeks ago with:<br />
- bdbpre6.1 ...<br />
- drop table (oracle level)<br />
- bdbpost6.1 -f<br />
Some of them were not reorganized since december 2002.<br />
All are in the same two tablespaces (one for data, one for index).<br />
<br />
Since this date, our EDI process has no more performance problems.<br />
I wonder if the problem is really linked to this action.<br />
<br />
How often do you reorganize your tables ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richard</div><div class="date">23rd April 2004, 09:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The EDI problem came maybe from table ttaad512 which had a lot of records with cjob = ' ' which were written by the EDI process. This table was never reorganized.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">28th April 2004, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Your reorg did 2 things:<br />
- it recreated the tables. If the settings in the ora_storage where the same as before you probably got the same amount of extents as before.<br />
- As you used the -f option, it did an analyze table afterwards.<br />
<br />
So:<br />
- when reorganizing tables make sure that:<br />
  * you only reorganize tables that suffer on performance e.g. because they are really fragmented (#extents &gt; 500).<br />
  * change the ora_storage according the new situation<br />
- Make sure you analyze your tables on frequent basis. Use dbms_utility.analyze_schema in Baan 8 and use dbms_stats.gather_schema_stats for Oracle 9 and 10.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
select 'ANALYZE TABLE BAANDB.' || TABLE_NAME || ' ESTIMATE STATISTICS SAMPLE 40 PERCENT ; '<br />
from dba_tables<br />
where table_name like '_________123' ; -- 123 is company nr.<br />
<br />
We have created a script/task that automatically analyzes all the tables in the company in one week and then the process repeats again.<br />
