I have recently installed Oracle 9i with baan IV c4 on Windows NT.<br />
<br />
I am new to Oracle.<br />
<br />
From the command prompt through which Oracle command i can take the backup of my whole BaaN Database ??? so that all the baan tables comes in the backup ???<br />
<br />
If any one using Oracle on win for BaaN , I would be greatefull , if he can share the backup procedure /document  with respect to BaaN &amp; Oracle 9i.<br />

<br />
There are a lot of options for backing up.. <br />
<br />
An easy one would be<br />
<br />
&lt;shutdown baan&gt;<br />
exp userid=system/&lt;password&gt; file=baan.dmp owner=baan direct=y log=baan.log<br />
&lt;startup baan&gt;<br />
<br />
not the best one, but its a start.. <br />

<br />
How about doing an online backup without shutting down oracle db ??? In Ms SQL Server through enterpise manager i use to take Online backup of full BaaN Database.<br />
<br />
How should i go ahead for online backup in Oracle ??? I hope exp. command can be run when users r working !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
meanwhile i am also reading Oracle Backup manuals on the site.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
&quot;alter tablespace &lt;tablespace name&gt; begin backup;&quot;<br />
<br />
is the key. There's a lot to it, i can't really explain it here. Maybe someone else has a consice doc on it, with scipts...<br />
<br />
and no, don't use exp while users are working..<br />

<br />
well as u gave the hint , i searched on the net , and read about this command<br />
<br />
<br />
alter tablespace begin backup<br />
<br />
<br />
http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/cd/A91202_01/901_doc/server.901/a90133/backup.htm#1004914<br />
<br />
and it says that i can do this if the database is running in ARCHIVE MODE, but when i did the baan installation with Oracle , by default it took as NOARCHIVE.<br />
<br />
Should i make my baan db to ARCHIVE MODe, is this step performed at most of the sites where Oracle is running ?<br />
<br />
I also read about the use of ARCHIVE and NOARCHIVE Mode.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
Yes, you absolutely want to be running in archivelog mode. There are 2 steps, first, add the archivelog info to your init.ora and second, shutdown the DB, do a <br />
&quot;startup mount&quot; and <br />
&quot;alter database archivelog;&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not positive about the &quot;mount&quot; it might be &quot;nomount&quot;<br />
<br />
If you're using OEM tools, then i assume there's a few clicks to turn on archivlog mode.. I don't know what those are though...<br />
<br />
Of course now you have to make sure you're backing up your archivelogs and removing them on a regular basis!<br />

<br />
I'm running 4c4 (Nas0) using Oracle 9i RAC on Windows 2003 Enterprise with my Baan (App Server) Machine running Windows 2000.<br />
<br />
I think that you should at least look into using Oracle's method for backing up the database.  I use Rman in batch every night to do a full backup of the entire database.  Baan is only part of my Entire Database so the need is to Backup Oracle.<br />
<br />
The backup just creates files on a drive that can moved to tape later in the evening via my Backup software.  I can post my script if it would help you.<br />
<br />
In addition, I have a JOB Scheduled in Baan that runs session ttaad4226m000 (Create Sequential Dump of Tables) every Sunday AM.  The session will export all data from my production company into sequential tables.  These tables are then picked up my my Backup Exec routine to a SDLT Drive.<br />
<br />
You might need to play some tricks with Baan to get the Job into the Job Scheduler for your production Company.  In my case because I run NAS0, just creating a job from the session, put the job into the Tools Company table instead of the table that is used by my production company.  I used Oracle to move the data and It works fine from there.<br />
<br />
I've been doing backups this way for about 2 years.<br />

Yaah I am also taking Sequential dump of table through a batch file by utilising bdbpre.exe and specifying seperator as '!'. I hope this is OK.<br />
<br />
Regarding RMAN script which you are executing, could you please post the script so that i can verify and re-use the same.<br />
<br />
and one more question , are you running your baan oracle db in ARCHIEVE MODE ??? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I'm running in Archive Mode.  Note also that using oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters) I have two machines running windows 2003 Enterprise both running Oracle.  They both access the same database on an IBM Fibre Channel Storage Server.  Note also that I haven't re-booted either machine for 6 weeks now!<br />
<br />
Both instances of Oracle must run in Archive Mode.<br />
<br />
Also, the script I created for rman is below:<br />
<br />
replace script Baan_backup {<br />
allocate channel c1 type disk;<br />
backup incremental level=0<br />
format 'G:\Rman_bck\dF_%d_%s_%p.bck'<br />
tag = Backup01<br />
filesperset = 4<br />
(Database include current controlfile);<br />
release channel c1;<br />
}<br />
<br />
You can also use Rman to backup your Archive Log files.  I just use backup exec to do that.  There are many things you can do with Rman and best of all, it knows how to backup the database while the database is running.<br />
