<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">21st September 2009, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We have some triggers placed on certain Baan tables.  We recently had users complain that a report (with data generated by two specific triggers) was not working properly.  Upon investigation we found that these two triggers were gone.  We recreated the triggers, but we are curious as to how they were removed.  They were not deleted directly (by a DBA or sql script).  Would modifying the table definitions in Baan (i.e. adding a field) for the table that also has a trigger cause the trigger to be removed?<br />
<br />
Any other ideas/suggestions?  <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">21st September 2009, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, in older versions of baan and in some cases with newer versions of baan, when you make a table change it drops and re-creates the table which wipes out your triggers.<br />
<br />
Which is one reason, why it's always considered bad-form to use triggers on baan tables.<br />

We have also trigger monitoring scripts to see if they are gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">23rd September 2009, 22:29</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't like triggers because of the error messages they tend to generate.<br />
<br />
For example, you create a trigger on your item master to update a record another table. Then that other table changes in a way that breaks your trigger.<br />
<br />
You'll be alerted to the problem because someone is getting an error 512 (or something) on the item master table. If you're lucky you'll remember, &quot;oh, i have a trigger and that's probably failing&quot; but most likely you'll spend 2 days looking into why &quot;Baan broke my item master&quot;.<br />
<br />
Even worse is when you leave the company and a new admin or dba comes in. they might spend weeks looking for the problem.<br />

Even then, you have all of the issues with reconfigs, etc...</div></div><hr />
