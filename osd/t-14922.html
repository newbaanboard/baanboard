<br />
I'm moving to Oracle 9.2 and I'm switching to locally managed extent management but have a few questions.<br />
<br />
I read in an earlier thread that the recommended approach is to use different tablespaces for tables with different extent sizes.<br />
<br />
I have about 200 tables that will require a non-default extent size. Will all the lines in my ora_storage not give me a serieus performance penalty? I will have 400 lines in there since I have my data and index separated in to different tablespaces to spread them out over separate controllers.<br />
<br />
I would create 3 or 4 tablespaces for these 200 tables and 1 more for the rest of the tables that are all small. Should I use Uniform Allocation with a small extent size for this last one as well and what is the recommended size (1MB?) or should I configure this tablespace with Automatic Allocation?<br />
<br />
What is an 'ok' number of tablespaces, is there a performance penalty, what is too many? With my separate data and index I would end up with at least 10 tablespaces.<br />
<br />
Would I use the basic 'out of the box' ora_storage without any additional storage parameters?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help. Any hints and tips are much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Ronald.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can create a file called &quot;ora_storage2&quot;. Baan will read from<br />
that for the access method (0214) for your tables. <br />
<br />
It would just have 2 lines<br />
<br />
*:*:T:group:0214::<br />
*:*:I:group:0214::<br />
<br />
Then you can have as many lines as you'd like in your ora_storage file, as baan will only use that when creating a table.<br />

<br />
you are using Oracle 9.2. OK.<br />
You need only 1 TBS for Data and 1 TBS for Indices. Use the Option 'automatic extend management' = yes AND 'automatic segment management' = Yes and it works well. No Reason to use seperat TBS with different extent allocation, Oracle calculates the extend size automatic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rochus</div><div class="date">31st March 2004, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">but for online-backups (one tbs per comp)<br />
it makes sence to have more than one tbs</div></div><hr />

<br />
that was not the question.<br />
<br />
No Reason to use seperat TBS with different extent allocation <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">1st April 2004, 14:50</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing to consider....<br />
If you're trying to distribute IO across multiple disks / i/o channles it won't be as easy with 1 tablespace for data and 1 for indexes. <br />
<br />
sure you can add datafiles that span these disks and channles, but how do you make sure that table X stayes within that datafile? <br />
<br />
So there is something to be said for multiple tablespaces. simply for the control you gain.<br />

One more question though, if I leave the extent size up to Oracle I understand that it will increase the extent size based on the size of the table. However the maximum extent size that oracle uses is only 10MB?<br />
I have some tables where the index is over 10GB and that would create quite a few extents, impacting performance.<br />
Would this not support the use of tablespaces with uniform extent size?<br />
Thanks again.<br />
Ronald.</div></div><hr />
