<br />
Just been given the go ahead to move to Baan IVc4 with Solaris and Informix.<br />
<br />
Currently running on Solaris 6 and planning to move to 8 or 9. Are there any major differences between these two versions and is their any reason to favour one over the other in my situation.<br />
<br />
Regarding Informix plan to move up to 9.40 from 7.31 which I believe allows the use of chunks over the previous 2GB limit. Although I believe my migration may be easier if I stick to my current DBmap and continue to use disk management software to allow me to break down the larger disks we will be using into the 2GB chunks. Are there any disadvantages / advantages to using the larger chunk sizes and what method is generally preferred.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.<br />

Cheers<br />

The down side is unloading all the tables and reloading them with Informix tools.  I wrote some scripts that used high performance loader for the larger tables and a straight unload for the small tables.  Using this method, a 120Gig db took less than 6hrs.<br />
