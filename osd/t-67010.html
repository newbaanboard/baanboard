<br />
Does somebody have experiences on database switch of baan system?<br />
For example, for Oracle to SQL or from SQL to Oracle?<br />
<br />
BSE files are easy to copy from one server to another server. And also easy to re-point the database, however, how about the data?<br />
<br />
Do we need to use the baan tools to dump the data out and import the data ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Jeffers</div></div><hr />

You could also use something like SQL*LOADER to dump on the Oracle side and bcp with format files to load on the SQL side.<br />
<br />
And, as mentioned above, bdbpre and bdbpost...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting about bdbpost method.<br />
However, I am wondering about:<br />
For the new environment, only BSE files had been copied, Database side maybe just as empty database, for this situation, did the bdbpost work?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
SSIS need to change the columns of baan special format, right?<br />
For instance, in the SQL side, t_ and in Oracle side, t$.<br />
Also some other special things.<br />
<br />
I think it's also a huge workload.<br />
Thanks.<br />

tabledef6.1<br />
ora_storage etc ...<br />
ora_users, ora_groups (manually created in the database)<br />
<br />
-&gt;bdbpost works with empty database</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">24th October 2014, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, definitely some work involved in mapping the tables from Oracle to SQL using SSIS.  From a resource perspective, it is actually quite a bit faster than bdbpre/post.  I think we did a 750 GB database in 16 hours or so with SSIS whereas it took 30+ hours using bdbpre/post.  <br />

Thanks a lot for your answer, it give me clearly enough ideas on this topic. <br />
