<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">9th June 2011, 21:33</div></div><div class="posttext">The Linux OS and Oracle DB we use for Baan IV c4 are going out of support and I am considering moving to Windows and SQL. <br />
<br />
I've always used Baan with Unix/Linux and I wonder what sort of issues I will face moving to Windows. <br />
<br />
We would probably be using the latest versions of Windows server and SQL on a 64bit platform. We are not considering upgrading from Baan IV at this time.<br />
<br />
Why am I considering Windows and SQL?<br />
Better integration with our Windows network, printers, backup system, single sign on, etc. <br />
No annual support fees for SQL or Windows (unlike Oracle and some Linux platforms). <br />
<br />
One main question I have and can't find answers for is can users access Baan on Windows through an ASCII terminal emulator? Some of us use the GUI, but the heavy data entry people prefer the ASCII. They can enter massive amounts of data very quickly in multiple sessions without ever taking their hands off the keyboards. Loosing that productivity by moving them to a keyboard and mouse would be a tough sell. <br />
<br />
I know that if there are scripts that access the filesystem, I need to be careful with the slashes when moving from Linux to Windows. We only have a few cases where that would be an issue. Are there any other programming gotchas I need to be aware of. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
Rob</div></div><hr />

1. 64bit does not have any memory limitation . So go for higher memory as far  as possible . SQL  is very resource intensive. But with hardware and resource upgrade , we experienced tremendous throughput  improvement.<br />

2. All porting set binaries are exes as against 6.1 in unix/linux.<br />
<br />
3. When doing installations / other baan admin jobs on server using RDP  , take it in console mode.<br />
<br />
4. All programs work without modifications barring some SQL  queries involving double comparision of odd figures worked some  times . So we had recoded those part. But that was very minimal and was detected and resolved hardly in couple of days.<br />

5. Baan installation / config  documentation is quite comprehensive and try to follow it scrupulously.</div></div><hr />

I have not tried to  use ASCII  in windows bcos we never used the same in unix also. Probably ur users are not aware of the short cuts available in BW  for anything and everything. At our ends also , all data entry users hardly use mouse using BW.</div></div><hr />

I have literally just done this for a BaanIVc3 installation</div></div><hr />

- ascii interface is not available;<br />
- you can't use bisam as database;<br />
- printing is done via windows drivers, it looks a bit different, you will get some comments about it;<br />
- make sure that for the printers you use windows drivers are available;<br />
- check used path's in jobs/scripts etc, could be you have to change it;<br />
- scripts around the baan environment will not work unless you use e.g. cygwin but still will need some rework;<br />
- if you use multiple baan environments on one server be warned that updating a portingset will bring all environments down;<br />
- you will need to export all data and import it again via bdbpre/bdbpost. Oracle is less strict in date data so you probably have to repair some data before being able to import into sql.<br />

<br />
&quot;ascii interface is not available&quot;<br />
<br />
Is not strictly correct, and have a look at my previous post, the ba6.1 components can be ran as remote users on a Linux sub install.<br />
<br />
Moving from Unix/Informix/Oracle to Windows/SQL Server can save huge amounts of money and provide considerable performance improvements.<br />

p. s. We are Neustro and we know Baan</div></div><hr />

Via you workaround yes. However if you want change to windows it's a bit weird if you still need a linux machine around. It will bring additional costs if you want to be able to run it on a supported platform (SLES or Redhat Enterprise server).<br />
<br />
License costs can probably decreased if your company is big enough and get a company license from MS. If I am correct you get licenses for 'free' if you have bought enough of them.<br />
<br />
IMHO you will not get better performance with ms-sql. However it's more easy to manage for sure.<br />
<br />

In the BW configuration command field enter &quot;-- -set ui=ascii mtccom000000001&quot; (excluding the quote marks) and an ascii type screen appears.<br />
<br />
It seems to work ok but never having needed an ascii screen interface, I don't know if there is any functionality missing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">14th June 2011, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">That's another option. However I guess that they have developed some macro's in e.g. reflection to make live simpler. That will not work by using bw and ascii mode.</div></div><hr />
