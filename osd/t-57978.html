<br />
I'm new to this group and we highly appreciate everyone's help. We are trying to check if our proposed solution will work or not and will highly value anyone's experience or opinion on this.<br />
<br />
We want to use SQL 2005 peer to peer replication to synchronize business partners and item masters data between two instances of Infor LN 6.1 FP5 servers. SQL 2005 replication mandates the use of primary key columns in the tables used, but Infor LN 6.1 does not use primary keys on its tables. So, we thought of adding rowID integer Identity columns to the end of the respective tables and use them as the primary key. The identify column is guaranteed to be unique by the DBMS and inserting a new record into the modified table should not cause any problem as the identity column does not need an input value. Additionally, placing the column at the end of the table will avoid any 4gl programming practices that may use the column's ordinal value to access a columnâ€™s value.<br />
<br />
We have carried on a small test and the data seems to be working fine, but we really want to know if this setup will work or not based on the experience of others who may have carried out similar activities.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your feedback<br />
