<br />
Is it possible to have two different databases under the same instance baan, that is, a baan instance can have two portings or the same porting can access differents database?<br />
<br />
The reason of this question is that we need to move a trial company into a new database. The problem is that the real company runs under Oracle 8.0.6 and the version of the new database is 8.1.7.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">30th September 2003, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to follow following steps.<br />
<br />
1.Take complete export of the test company<br />
2.Delete the tables of those company.<br />
3.Create a new database in ttaad4110m000 with appropriate parameter.<br />
4. Assign the tables of test company to this database in session ttaad4111m000 .<br />
5. Conver to runtime dd<br />
6. Log out/ login<br />
7. Create tables in baan for the test company<br />
8. Import the data from the export taken in 1st step.<br />
<br />
As the 2nd database also is Oracle8 you don't need to re-license Baan. Just check whether Baan porting set u have can work with both oracle database version simultaneously.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure if you can use different porting set version for the same installation/environment.<br />
<br />
Hitesh has already explained about creating multiple database instances for the same baan environment.<br />
<br />
If you have different Oracle version it would still be working but you have to be aware of how BaaN database drivers are functioning.<br />
<br />
[DEV:bsp]/app/lms/lmst/opt/bse/lib/defaults&gt;cat db_resource<br />
use_shm_info:1<br />
dbsinit:01<br />
ora_max_array_fetch:5<br />
ora_max_array_insert:5<br />
nls_lang:american_america.we8iso8859p1<br />
nls_sort:binary<br />
oracle_home:/app/common/oracle/product/8.1.7.2<br />
ora_temporary_tablespace:TEMP<br />
[DEV:bsp]/app/lms/lmst/opt/bse/lib/defaults&gt;<br />
<br />
You can have only one ora_home set for a particular login. You can still set different db_resource files for specific users and use them in command line options. But you cannot specific different ora_home for different databases for the same login. So once a ora_home is set, then the driver would use that particular Oracle binaries during execution and most of the Oracle binaries are forward/backward compatible. You still would have to refer to the release notes of the porting set to validate which particular Oracle versions are support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">1st October 2003, 10:14</div></div><div class="posttext">As Prashanth pointed out u can have only 1 Oracle home for 1 particular Baan login (not unix login). You need to create different logins for ur test database. You should not switch between companies with different database. Further there should not be any table sharing between such companies.<br />
<br />
U need to check if your current porting set is valid for both oracle database version or not . This is very crucial.<br />
<br />
Creating 2 Baan environments (with different BSE's) is technically possible but not advisable due to elaborate procedure . You may need to re-licence Baan also.<br />
<br />
Another important thing is kernel settings in OS  and buffers settings in both oracle instance . If any one Oracle instance is not able to create searate shared memory segment , then the system performance may degrade / oracle instance may not start itself.<br />
<br />
Further decide on the driver level in both database. According to me it should be same in both database instance. Let some Oracle / Baan user confirm this.<br />
<br />
We have done somewhat similar things (not exactly same) in the past. <br />
<br />
In order that your live environment is not disturbed at any cost, it's advisable to get Oracle and Baan support advice and confirmation also in this matter.</div></div><hr />

   I read this and I think I did this before but I am little confused for a particular case.<br />
   Our archive companies are getting big and back time is getting more and more. <br />
   This is our current Set up.<br />
Baan version = IVb4<br />
Oracle Version = Oracle7<br />
One Bshell and One Oracle database for both production Company 150 and Archive company 500 (for year 2000), 501 (for year 2001) etc.<br />
We back the whole database everyday and we have lots space problem.<br />
<br />
What I want to do, please tell me possible or not?<br />
<br />
Baan version = IVb4<br />
Oracle Version = Oracle7<br />
One Bshell and two Oracle database, one for production Company 150 and <br />
another for all Archive company 500 (for year 2000), 501 (for year 2001) etc.<br />
We will take everyday backup of first database.<br />
We want to switch company and see data in either Production or Archive company. We ran Data Warehouse Project in Archive database. Archive database is backed up when needed and also on monthly basis.<br />
<br />
If you can tell whether this is possible or not. If possible what should I do with archive companies as they are in the same database now.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Sincerely...<br />
<br />
Jay</div></div><hr />

Jay, yes that is possible, but there would be different issues you you would have to consider and plan accordingly.<br />
Adding a database on a server does add more resources to the box. Also, multiple databases causes multiple baan database driver connections, hence some performance impact for the BaaN application.<br />
You can surely add another database and move your company from the existing database to the new one. Time is the big factor in this process for a production downtime. You would have to export the archieve company from the current database, delete tables in the current database, change tabledef's and database definitions to the new database, create tables in new database and then import the data into the new database, create database users.<br />
<br />
This is under the assumption that the new database is built according to the sizing, specifications, settings etc etc... wrong NLS settings can cause some datacorruptions, or insufficial rollback segments would affect the import process, do you like to keep it in archieve mode or not for the point in time data etc...<br />
<br />
May not seem as simple as it seems but its do-able :p we juggled around the companies across databases few times.<br />
<br />
Good Luck...! :)</div></div><hr />

   Can I have the second database in Baanbase or TP. I tried creating another company 200 and assign it to Baanbase.<br />
But I am not able to create table and giving 515 error.<br />
Thanks <br />
<br />

<br />
I am not sure with BaaN/Triton-Base.<br />
<br />
According to the tools error manual-<br />
515  ELICENSEERROR  This indicates a license error; probably an unpatched binary. <br />
Refer to the other thread on the board - <br />
<br />
Bisam on BaanIVc4  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13323) <br />
<br />
According to Dikkie - <br />
The only thing you have to consider is the Baan licence. If your original installation is not able for TBASE/ Bisam, you have to change the licence to make it work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">29th October 2003, 08:51</div></div><div class="posttext">As Prashanth told , u can have Baan base /oracle provided u are apropriately licensed and proper sizing is done.<br />
<br />
But looking at ur original post, I believe ur only problem is hard disk space because u take complete database backup. In Oracle it is possible to take the backup of part of the database.  Or alternatively u can take the backups of your live company through Baan export itself. We use Baan export at our place for daily backup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaymukh</div><div class="date">29th October 2003, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Prasanth and Hitesh,<br />
   Now I have more  questions...<br />
   How to create a new Oracle Database. It has to be in same Oracle Home I know. Is it just creating a new database instance or something else. I am confused because of , how to create users and group. Current we triton/triton as user/password and group as triton.<br />
   Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patrickmonks</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 08:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jay<br />
<br />
You will need to create the following users/roles<br />
<br />
grant dba to triton identified by triton;<br />
create role r_triton;<br />
grant r_triton to triton;<br />
alter user triton default tablespace LIVESMALLDAT temporary tablespace TEMPORARY_DATA;<br />
<br />
<br />
For each user that connects to Baan create as follows:<br />
create user test_user identified by test_user;<br />
grant create session to test_user;<br />
grant r_triton to test_user;<br />
alter user test_user default tablespace LIVESMALLDAT temporary tablespace TEMPORARY_DATA;<br />
<br />
I would generate a script from the ora_users file.<br />
<br />
You may not need to grant dba to triton - <br />
connect , resource, create session may be sufficient.<br />
<br />
You could also use ora?_admin and ora?_maint</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 08:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everybody,<br />
<br />
just to stir up this discussion a bit:<br />
<br />
It is not true, that the different databases need to have the same ORACLE_HOME!!! When you define the databases in &quot;Maintain Databases&quot; you can enter in the &quot;Parameter&quot; field the ORACLE_HOME (and other parameters) to be used.<br />
<br />
It is also not true, that you can not switch with a user between companies in different Oracle instances. Baan is handling this perfectly ok!<br />
<br />
We have this setup in several places and poses no problem at all. You only have to consider two restrictions:<br />
<br />
a) You have only one ora_users file, therefore the passwords in the different Oracle instances must be the same, if a baan user is working in companies accross Oracle instances.<br />
<br />
b) As mentioned before, it is not advaisable to have logical tables accross Oracle instances or to mix tables of a single company in several Oracle instancs. Technically this is possible with Baan, but transaction consistency (Rollback) is not given anymore.<br />
<br />
I hope, I could contribute to the overall confusion a bit :-)<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Markus is right with the ORACLE_HOME. Sorry, I overlooked it early. We are trying to upgrade to Oracle-9i (9.2.0.3) and we have some problems using the 8.1.7.2 driver paramters from the $BSE/lib/defaults/db_resource. We faced some data corruptions due to NLS settings etc. Not yet sure if its BaaN or Oracle problem.<br />
<br />
It also seems something dependent on the porting sets versions.  Also seems like having a uniform database version is good but if one already has big databases and lesser downtimes then we have to do only one at a time to take it slow, test, evaluate and go ahead with others.<br />
<br />
It seems when we upgraded the porting set and changed the executeable binaries to 9.2.0.3 it seemed working fine, but for the porting set is a buggy one with some other good and bad features.<br />
<br />
Got case with BaaN support and working on it...:cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
it is possible to configure tables of one company in different Oracle databases.<br />
But:<br />
<br />
it's not easy to design on Oracle, because you had to setup a distributed database.<br />
If you do this,  you had also transaction consistency.<br />
