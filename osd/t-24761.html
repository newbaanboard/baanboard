If so, what hardware, any known issues, any recommendations?<br />
<br />
We are looking at migrating our BaaN IVc4 environment with tBase to the Oracle database, and while at that we are also considering a migration from UNIX True 64 to SUSE Linux.<br />
<br />
Any tips, tricks, traps, recommendations will be appreciated. Thanks<br />

ORMA :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">5th August 2005, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Have not done the combination, but have BaanIV running (with TBase) on SuSe 7E, and also an Oracle9i database on the same box.  Just need to link the two... but lack the time to do it! :( <br />
<br />
However, both environments run very good, so I don't think you'll have problems, unless there is a quirck in the Baan Oracle driver on SuSe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I´m not a guru, but we have done nearly the same installation last year.<br />
We have migrated from Unixware7, Baan 4c4 and tbase to SuSE ES8 and oracle 9i. Hardware: HP Proliant ML 570, 8GB ram, 2 Xeon 2,8 GHz Processors. We have 175 concurrent Baan users.<br />
<br />
If you follow the installation instruction from SuSE and Baan, you shuoldn´t run into trouble.<br />
<br />
Here is a link for installations documents for oracle on SuSE -&gt; http://www.novell.com/products/linuxenterpriseserver/oracle/documents.html<br />
<br />
For Baan, please refer to Document U7028H US<br />
<br />
We are very satisfied with this environment, we don´t have performance problems and the system is very stable. One big issue is of course is to set up oracle properly, but this is not a linux problem.<br />
<br />
We had only one problem with rexec protocol, used by the BW clients. We got a message &quot;Where Are You&quot;, becuase in SuSE ES8 they have changed the rexec package, I don´t know how it is in other versions. There are some possible solutions to fix this problem. Either install an older rexec package, or you follow the instructions from this link -&gt;http://www.starnet.com/KB/error/where_are_you.htm <br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
