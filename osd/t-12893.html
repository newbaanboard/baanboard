<br />
We are currently considering replacing our current hardware with IBM kit. IBM offer a &quot;performance guarantee&quot;. I would be particularly interested in hearing from any BaanBoard members that have a &quot;performance guarantee&quot; in place with IBM and their comments on the &quot;guarantee&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the hack about any type of performance guarantee is how to define performance:<br />
<br />
- duration of a batch job?<br />
- duration of online transactions?<br />
<br />
in the second case, how do you measure them?<br />
<br />
However you define them, it will be easy for IBM (and also any other vendor) to avoid any payments in the future, by discussing the environment parameters of your system:<br />
<br />
a) Did you add users in between?<br />
b) Did the numbers of items/Sales orders/bom change?<br />
c) Did anybody change any application parameters?<br />
d) Did anybody install some third party sw?<br />
e) who configured the system?<br />
<br />
Legaly that is a lost case for you. My recommendation is to buy just a completely oversized server.  Sorry :-)<br />
<br />
If you still want to go for a performance guarantee (and I know that IBM is pretty easy going about it), than go for general descriptions and state your expected growth rate.<br />
<br />

I don't know if IBM offers such a solution but certainly HP does: it's called ICOD: Instant Capacity On Demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpvdgiessen</div><div class="date">10th September 2003, 01:47</div></div><div class="posttext">First think about the storage (many physical disks in a logical volume), how much data we are talking of. Is a SAN a better solution then a local storage.<br />
Second the network, this is mostly the premium problem. (10Mb/100Mb/1Gb or higher) are we talking about a LAN or a WAN<br />
3) the concurrent users, what kind of processes are they doing.<br />
4) What kind of a database(s)<br />
5) two-tier or a three tier solution.<br />
6) What kind of integration with third parties<br />
<br />
In the past I have done more of these kind of migrations, please send me mail in private with your wishes. There are more roads to Rome then only IBM or HP</div></div><hr />
