We've got some strange errors while job execution via job management. The job just started, then immediately stopped producing an error in $BSE/log/logcomdll0020 file with such kind of text:<br />
02-09-23[21:00:23];0.000;&lt;username&gt;;timrp1210m000();<br />
Cannot write 255 bytes into mailbox . When we removed boosters for this session it worked. In the end of this case we had to restsart everything (Sun ES server with solaris 8, Oracle, Baan itself).After that it begun working (seemed to be stable). It is not clear what happened and where those suspicious &quot;mailboxes&quot; are located and why they stopped MRP job?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check the mailbox of the user running the jobs.<br />
<br />
For jobs run via cron, the 'standard output' for any job will be sent to the user mailbox - in something like /var/adm/mail/<br />
<br />
If you've not re-directed your 'standard output' to a log file, its likely that your jobs have been outputting a lot of info into the mailbox and consequently filled up the mailbox ie. filled up the disk space quota allocated to the mailbox file system. (e.g. /var)<br />
<br />
Restarting Solaris would have cleared down /var somewhat <br />
<br />
Though, not being able to write to standard output should not really affect the MRP jobs, but may explain the 'cannot write into mailbox error'.</div></div><hr />

WE are using BaanIV with Oracle8.1.7 &amp;Solaris8.<br />
We found out from Knowledge Guide that mailbox is an element of APP - Baan application parallel processing used with table boosters. We have otccomdll0200 which controls its behaviour. we have no idea where 'mailbox' is located - it is not Unix thing but Baan's and seems to be in shared memory.  Turning boosters off disables mailbox but mrp is performing for a very long time. Any idea to avoid growing mailbox too large?</div></div><hr />

Contact BAAN support and they will let you know hte parameters to be changed.<br />

Mailbox queue is the way baan is using to contact the OS while running MRP jobs particularily. the solaris command ipcs is the good way to control the queue.</div></div><hr />
