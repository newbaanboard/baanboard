<br />
How is the performance? If its running well, I'am interested in the oracle parameter setting<br />
<br />
Last summer we upgraded our Oracle DB form 8.1.7 to 10g (by a new install and exp/imp). Some baan sessions (mainly related to sales and purchase) has a (very) poor performance (was not in 8.1.7).<br />
We running Baan/Oracle on a sun 480, 4 CPU, 8 MB internely for about 100 users.</div></div><hr />

Symptom information<br />
Some Sessions runs very slow after upgrading to Oracle9 <br />
Does Baan IV c4 run with Oracle 9i 64 bit version <br />
Upgrade 9i <br />
TLS-NA:LES Periodic from LES to ERP aborts on temp space overuse <br />
ORA-NA: Sessions tfgld4432m000 and tfgld4201m000 are hanging <br />
ORA-NA: same question - converted database 9.2 is too slow <br />
OTH-NA: Session tdrpl0120m000 too slow in 9i - 3 to 6 seconds response time <br />
TLS-NA: ORA-01555 errors and slow performance in some sessions <br />
TLS-NA: Performance issue with some sessions <br />
ORA-NA:After Migration to Oracle9, some table gives Error 512 in bshell log <br />
PS-NA: Is porting set 6.1b.05.01 compatible with Oracle 9? <br />
ORA-NA: Certified Oracle Versions for Baan IVc3 <br />
OTH-NA: Performance of the Baan sessions slow after DB upgrade <br />
TLS-NA: After migrating to new Hardware session hangs <br />
ORA-EX: After upgrade to Oracle 9i, we get &quot;rollback segment too small&quot; errors <br />
TLS-NA: SFC Performance - tipcs5250m running very slow after 9i oracle upgrade <br />
PS-PF PS 7.1d.07 causes sever performance problems with aliases <br />
 <br />
See Metalink Note 62337.1 for information on changes to Oracle Hidden parameters in Oracle 9i.<br />
<br />
In addition to these parameters, the Oracle tables and indexes should be analyzed using the dbms utility so that the CBO has up-to-date statistics about the Baan tables and indexes.<br />
<br />
The db_resource file settings should be set up in accordance with Quick Guide 1822 - Basic Oracle Tuning if they are not already.<br />
<br />
Load the latest porting set for your version of Baan so that you have the most recent version of the Oracle driver.<br />
<br />
Last, see Oracle Metalink Note 223299.1 for more information on Oracle initialization parameters. <br />
<br />
We faced some issues with the Oracle-10g analyzers, some sessions were extremly slow, and it was found that Oracle had issue with the cost optimizer, analyzers command (which is depreciated now in 10g), so you have to computer the statistics and build the histograms again, depending on the data volume, you might have to increase the shared pool size etc.</div></div><hr />

We turned this off and improved the response time across the board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We tried al lot of (hidden) oracle paramaters, most with no effect.<br />
Last Friday we add &quot;max_tables_joined:5&quot; to the db_resource file, that gives better performance (some sessions 5 times faster).<br />
About the recyle bin, AFAIK, that is only used if you drop a table (?)<br />
