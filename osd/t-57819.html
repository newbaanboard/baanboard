<br />
We're currently using hpux commands to monitor daily system activity in 20 minute intervals.  Generally the system's running well, no major issues.  <br />
<br />
Occasionally, we'll see some increased system activity that appears to be user related;<br />
<br />
I've been asked to identify what user/session is being run to ensure that it's valid system activity causing the load (not bottlenecks such as slow disks, i/o cards, etc)<br />
<br />
Does anyone monitor the Baan&lt;-&gt;Oracle database sessions, and the queries being executed?  <br />
<br />
What I was thinking of was monitoring the v$session_longops to determine longer running transactions and hopefully try &amp; identify the session based on the query being executed (and hopefully the user executing it).<br />
<br />
I was hoping to script it so I could get an end-of-day report of longer running sessions, rather then monitoring it in realtime.<br />
<br />
Most Oracle query analyzers I've found are geared towards writing better SQL.  I don't really want to optimize the SQL coming from Baan, just identify it.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping someone has done something similar.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

They have various options in there to setup alerts.</div></div><hr />

OpenView would only show me what I already know.  And OEM would work, except we don't have the license (and I couldn't get it working reliably without tanking performance when we did have the license).<br />
<br />
I'm more looking for a report that could gather stats throughout the day and I could look at it at the end of day, rather then realtime.<br />
<br />
Knowing the query being executed (and the user executing it) would help me identify what session is running...<br />
<br />
Even if someone has a script that grabs currently long running SQL, I could implement something to log that on 20 minute intervals.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
