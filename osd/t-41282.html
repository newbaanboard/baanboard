<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">v.rohatgi</div><div class="date">4th September 2007, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">We had installed Oracle 10g database for ERP Ln6.1 on an AIX5.3 platform.<br />
<br />
We are having serious performance issues and Infor is recommending that we reinstall the production server for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
- Our OS has only one paging file (16GB) on a single disk (out or an array of 6 HDDs)<br />
- Oracle is not able to save the SPFile and PFile.<br />
- initsid.ora said to have the configuration file between Ln and Oracle was changed 5 times but did not perform as per expectations.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a standard setting for OS + Oracle + Ln6.1 to work in sync and perform as expected??<br />

<br />
1) I assume with Paging file, you mean SWAP file. one SWAp file of 16 GB is absolutely ok, as long as it is simply large enough. if your server is actually makinfg heavy use of the SWAP area, then yiou should not create more swap, then you should buy more RAM.<br />
<br />
2) Not being able to save pfile and spfile? Not really clear, what you mean here. oracle never saves the pfile, but only reads it. Anyway this is most likely a simple authorization/permission error and can be fixed without reinstalling.<br />
<br />
3) As I saw, you just went life, so it is normal, that yiou need to tune the system. Maybe you should post here your number of users, HW and configuration and somebody else, who is also on AIX, can judge, whether your system is properly sized. <br />
<br />
4) In another post, you are complaining about heavy growth of your database. So this raises two questions:<br />
<br />
a. Maybe due to wrong parametrization in  the modules, you are simply creating too many transactions and therefore create a lot of load.<br />
<br />
b. If you have set your tablespaces to autoextend, then they will grouw whenever they like and whenever that happens your database will be slow.<br />
