I am trying to see what causes this variation and it appears that Baan ERP uses much more memory for the bshell than Baan IV and even 5.0b early versions.  <br />
<br />
I have observed much more memory when using the combo mode driver, as I would expect (using the &quot;d&quot; connection in ipc_info).  <br />

What is everyone else's experience?<br />
