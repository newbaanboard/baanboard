<br />
I was chatting to someone today about BAAN and Oracle security and he made me aware of this site so I felt that members here might be interested in the information on my website<br />
http://www.petefinnigan.com. I specialise in all things Oracle security related and on my site there are links to about 70 white papers and presentations about all aspects of Oracle security. I wrote quite a few of them for various security websites around the world such as securityfocus.com and the rest are by others. There are a few scripts and I am adding to the site as time allows. Please have a look if anyone is interested.<br />
<br />
Thanks and kind regards<br />
<br />
Pete</div></div><hr />
