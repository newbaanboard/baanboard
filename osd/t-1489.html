<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Lahey</div><div class="date">25th March 2002, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently running BaaN IVc4 on Windows NT4 Server with SP6 applied. We would like to upgrade the OS on the server to Windows 2000 Server using the upgrade option in the W2K installer, which preserves the registry etc.<br />
<br />
Would our BaaN IV installation carry on working without having to reinstall or relicence after the upgrade?<br />
<br />
Are there any issues with running BaaN IVc4 on W2K server, assuming that we have the latest porting set binaries installed prior to the upgrade? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding possible problems, have a look at the Baan KB [Knowledge Base, or support center website] for any windows 2000 possible problems, to see if you need to install something before the upgrade.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I wouldn't expect any problems with Baan (maybe someone that already did such upgrade can do a post with a confirmation)?</div></div><hr />

I think this was related to the way that Windows 2K handles it TCPIP stack different from Windows NT. <br />
<br />
But I have to agree with victor that you should check the knowledge base before doing the upgrade incase there is any relevant information to your system.</div></div><hr />
