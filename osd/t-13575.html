<br />
We are running BaaN IV c4 with sp10 on Win NT 4.0 and Ms-Sql Server 7 as database.<br />
<br />
Currently the system has only 1 GB of free space.<br />
<br />
Database total initial allocated is 70 GB and filled up size is 65 gb<br />
now we plan to delete some tables in a co. 230 , since that co. is no longer required or to be more precise that data in those tables are no longer required.<br />
<br />
So approximately 6 GB would be restored by deleting this data at database level.<br />
<br />
but my problem is that free space will be created at database level rather than at Operating System Level.<br />
<br />
How can i create free space at Operating System level. I tried reducing the initial size of the database through SQL Server enterprise Manager, but all in vain i was not able to reduce the initial database size.<br />
<br />
How can i achieve it. How can i delete the data in sql server and retrieve space at O/S level ???<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

The cost will be lower than when you try to accomplish what you want (cost of time and effort). For some 2 hours of work you can buy 120Gb disks ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">18th December 2003, 00:15</div></div><div class="posttext">In SQL Enterprise manager you need to run some database maintenance. I have SQL 2000 so it is slightly different but what I would do in SQL 2000 is:<br />
<br />
1. Backup db<br />
2. Under Management in SQL Ent. Mgr create a database maintenance plan for your baandb. On the optimizations tab select &quot;remove unused space from database files&quot;.  While you're at it &quot;reorganize data &amp; index pages&quot;.<br />
3.  Add a job that will run this plan - but make sure no users are on the system and especially make sure the backup is not running.<br />
4. As a guess, I think this process will take 12 to 24 hours to complete on your system but this really depends on processors etc.<br />
<br />
OmeLuuk is correct that buying more disk would be quicker in the short run but doing the above will improve performance I think.</div></div><hr />
