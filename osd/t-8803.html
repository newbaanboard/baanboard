<br />
We are currently using BaaN IVc3 with Oracle 8.0.4 and Sun Solaris 2.6 in a Sun Server. We have already decided to migrate to BaaN IV c4 with Oracle 8i (8.1.7) but questionable about the possibility to migrate Solaris 8. Has anyone upgraded successfully from Solaris 2.6 to Solaris 8? What are the possible threats for a OS migration ?<br />

We once upon a time had a migration of such kind. I think you should not expect any threats but have a full backup of your system (data, parameters and so on). You should properly organize your disk storage, install new Solaris, configure RDBMS and then restore Baan then proceed with SPs and make it become IV version. the only difference we had was not 2.6 Solaris but 7th. But i think it is similar thing.<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot, and it's good to hear that we should not expect any threats<br />
<br />
IÂ’ll contact you if something goes wrong when we do the migration.  :D <br />

warm regards<br />

Good luck, but remember that all the important things should be available as backup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">24th February 2003, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">But in my memory Baan was on Sun's 'blacklist' for Solaris 8 migrations.<br />
<br />
I believe that's what stopped us from upgrading last year.<br />
<br />
Of course with 2.6 support fading out over the next year, this issue is becoming increasingly relevant again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">25th February 2003, 08:04</div></div><div class="posttext">First we had BaanBase IV c3 working on Solaris 7, then consequentally we migrated to IV c4, then to Solaris 8 and the last thing we did last april (2002)  was Oracle 8.1.7.0 i and then 8.1.7.4. Maybe i am so much sure in details (the time had passed) but it wasn't any dangerous situations. We use our Moscow office techical support of Baan , they declare Solaris 2.5, 2.6. 2.7 8. No support for Oracle 9 and Solaris 9 yet. I guess the 9th version is OK but maybe officially it is not the time  to use it.<br />
I use myself Oracle 9.2.1.0 installed on my Linux workstation, it works with Baan tables directly (DBA studio, SQLplus and so on) and seems to be very stable.</div></div><hr />
