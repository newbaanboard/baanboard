<br />
I've got some questions I'd like to ask, ones that seem almost too stupid to ask.  I come from the school of thought that UNIX systems are unlike many Windows incarnations in that I can have a *NIX server up well over 500 days without bouncing the server.<br />
<br />
Now, the server might be online for &gt; 500 days, but there is considerable insistance that we bounce the baan software (rc.stop/start) weekly.  What is the opinion of folks here?  Are weekly bounces of the Baan software necessary for performance?  If so, why?  Are there that many memory leaks?<br />
<br />
Cheers, and thank you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">7th December 2004, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember, Baan being &quot;up&quot; simply means that its allocated some shared memory at the OS level. I've never heard of a problem with shared memory due to a leak in Baan.. <br />
<br />
If there were a memory leak, it would be in the bshell or driver processes. Which only exist for the duration of a user's login. (If you set ds_timeout_detect then even ghost ones will clean themselves up..) <br />
<br />
If you have processes that run all the time, like job daemon or openworld then maybe bouncing them periodically is a good idea, but you don't have<br />
to take Baan, or the server down to do that.. <br />
<br />
I don't know if you're just talking about Baan or the database as well. But for Oracle I prefer to keep it running as long as possible. I find that my system runs considerably slower for a few days after I bounce oracle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FriarTuck</div><div class="date">7th December 2004, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Dave,<br />
<br />
I would whole heartedly agree with you about Oracle performance after a shutdown.  The database takes at least a few days to stabilize when it's brought up cold.<br />
<br />
I must admit that in my haste to post I wasn't too clear putting my thoughts to screen.  I should say that I refer to the baan software itself, as opposed to the client apps such as bshell6.1 and api6.1.<br />
<br />
I think I've convinced myself that there isn't even a slow leak in any software since memory is freed up at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Pointers on the operating system (via glance and sar) simply indicate a system that is being used.  The database doesn't appear to be too terribly taxed either.  The word from the Baan administrator is that people are seeing a general slowdown.  There is concern that I've not bounced the baan software (ie $BSE/etc/rc.stop) for my weekly backup.<br />
<br />
Of course, Oracle is backed up in hot backup...<br />
<br />
I'm bouncing back and forth with so many things today, what I've typed is probably no use as a clarifying statement.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<br />
There are a few issues that are &quot;solved&quot; by the weekly bounce that Baan recommends. Mainly this concerns the ipc queue, hanging bshells, and shared memory corruption (Dave is right, no leaks, but it does get nasty some times).<br />
<br />
My advice is to tackle these issues rather than following Baan's unfounded recommendation. After all, curing the disease is better than curing the symptoms. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
(my emphasis above)<br />
I have noticed that after I've executed $BSE/etc/rc.stop, running ipcs -q shows a all-mighty gaggle of queues held.  Now, I could simply run through and ipcrm each one, but (wanting to take your advice) I've gone on a google mission to see how I can fix the problem.<br />

Hung bshells are nuked via kill -TERM on bshell pid (or -9 on the Oracle connector).  :rolleyes:<br />

# * Purpose   : This script will remove all unused message queues created<br />
# *		by Baan processes.  It does so by locating all message<br />
# *		queues created by users in group bsp.  It then checks<br />
# *		whether the last send and last receive processes still<br />
# *		exist on the server.  If they are both gone, it should be<br />
# *		a good bet that the queue is unused.<br />

Maybe this answer is right in front of me, but how can I determine/verify shared memory corruption? <br />
<br />
I have a thread out here somewhere on memory corruption. It shows the pains I went through to identify it as a cause and the solution. Without any indicators you can safely assume that you do not have corruption.<br />
<br />
Hung bshells are nuked via kill -TERM on bshell pid (or -9 on the Oracle connector).  :rolleyes:<br />
The newer porting sets are actually doing a pretty good job in managing (lost) connectivity and even licenses (hung licenses, another invalid reason for bouncing Baan come to think of it).</div></div><hr />

They certainly have in the past. If they changed their stance, its news to me.</div></div><hr />
