Hello,<br />
<br />
in january we've moved our database to Oracle 10G. Together we've split application and database server.<br />
Based on SSA/BaaN sizing we have no performance problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">23rd March 2006, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I love DB2. What your vendor told you is true, it's a no-nonsense small footprint, small memory usage database with very little configuration needed. and the nice thing is that it's really fast.<br />
<br />
The only downside to DB2 is that the optimizer doesn't accept hints,<br />
so it's possible to get really bad performance on large queries. But SSA usually has a workaround for that for their code - Your custom code though could be a problem though.<br />
<br />
Also you have to set LIBPATH everywhere with DB2.. so it gets a little tricky if you have crystal or other 3rd party apps. not impossible, but just something to be consious of.<br />
<br />
Now for Oracle... 9i and 10g both work fine if tuned correctly, but each new version take more memory then the last, and it's just so bloated. So it's usually good practice to upgrade your box with the DB. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />

<br />
But on the other side, the initial problems with Baan IV and Oracle 9/10 are well known by know and with the proper configuration performance is ok. Compared to oracle 7, just consider two things:<br />
<br />
a) Oracle will need more RAM (add 20%)<br />
b) Oracle did not become any faster (so add some CPU power, but this will come automatically with the new box)<br />
<br />
If you know Oracle, you paid your support and your whole environment is Oracle minded, then I would stick with it.<br />

Dear Bernd,<br />
<br />
u have mentioned that u have seperated the Application Server &amp; database server, we are also planning to do the same, could u pls help me out how u have performed the I/O between 2 Servers (thru the normal Ethernet via a network switch or thru FIBRE Channel ??)<br />
<br />
i am not able to find out the solution to increase the I/O between two servers.<br />
<br />
pls help<br />

Hello Deepak,<br />
<br />
we do the I/O from HP-UX application Server to W2K3 DB Server thru Gigabit Ethernet, handled by network switch.<br />
<br />
Environment is 130 users in 5 live companys.<br />

<br />
Why also not compare with MySQL 5.0?<br />
Today I got the information that MySQL 5.0 in combination with BAAN IV will be certified and supported by SSA Global in August 2006.<br />
If you are interested in testing this sooner I can arrange for contacts with SSA BAAN Development in The Netherlands and MySQL AB.<br />
As per June 2006 MySQL 5.0 will already be certified and supported for LN 6.1 and b50_c.<br />
You can use the MySQL database for already EUR 500 per year and pay no license fee at all. <br />
MySQL is not only cheaper but also scalable, uses very few to no resources on your server and has a very high performance.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you are interested in MySQL.<br />

<br />
If you have dual ethernet cards to your servers.You can connect both the servers through cross-cable. It will be strong enough. This will bypass your switches,  so that, if the switch goes down there will no impact of connectivity between App and DB. Also packet switching will be fast. We have applied this recently.<br />
<br />
Gigabit ethernet is one of the solution.<br />

<br />
actually i was also thinking this idea, but IBM partners were not showing the correct way. they were about to make money by addiing up some additional fiber channels and costlier equipments.<br />
<br />
thanks any way for your reply.<br />

<br />
We procured a used RS/6000 system and populated this with a copy of the BaaN application from development and a DB2 database. Exported the 000 and test company vi the bdbpre6.1 procedure and imported this data into the DB2 database via the bdbpost6.1 executable.  Yes, we had problems. This was mainly due to licensing problems.  Did not want to license the box until we have made a decision which database is appropriate for our environment.  The system runs in demo mode.<br />
The ASCII client seems to work.  The GUI client does not seem to function. The log.bshell displays the following errors (have reduced the un-necessary lines):<br />

Tried first to enter a licensed server as we do for development. Did not work.<br />

<br />
did you try the ip address of the server that is licensed?<br />
<br />
it's important that you pre/post ttiex300 and ttiex301 from the environment that IS licensed before you do anything.. <br />
