I want to learn.  I am an Oracle DBA. we have a BAAN V with Oracle 10g r2 on AIX 5.3.  I read other posts related the backup and mentioning this utility. Our is bdbpre6.2 under $BSE.  And I look around the documents I have, have not found any document include secton about this.  Thanks.<br />

<br />
bdbpre is not really a backup, but an export utility, comparable to &quot;exp&quot; in Oracle. Some baan customers use bdbpre to export the data and backup the export, the same as some Oracle customers use exp for this.<br />
<br />
But obviously this is only applicable for small setups (and as a special case for company 000). Usually you are better of by taking a normal Oracle offline or online backup with a tool of your choice.<br />

I use a combination of both.  I have a job scheduled to start at 1AM every sunday morning.  The job will run baan session ttaad4226m000 (create sequential dump of table) to export the data from our live company to disk.  This will be picked up by our tape backup system.  I often use this data to rebuld the Baan company on our test machine.<br />
<br />
In addition, since you use oracle just as I do, we schedule Oracle's Rman utility to run every night about 1 1/2 hours before our tape backup kicks in.  Rman will do a full online backup of our database to disk.  These files allong with our control file etc will be then backuped up to tape when it kicks in.<br />

Hello,<br />
depending on your installation (Application and DB on one server / Appl. and DB on seperate servers ?)<br />
Oracle backup by RMAN as described above, but don't forget $BSE and System.<br />

If you use bdbpre for creating sequential  dumps of tables (one dumpfile per table), you have the possibility to have a look at the tables contents from yesterday ... very handy sometimes. When you gzip the dumped files, you may keep several  versions for this purpose ... the complete zipped dump of all files does not even use 1GB of diskspace per day at our place.<br />
