<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">3rd January 2009, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">This is defiitely possible . Keep in mind following.<br />
<br />
1. Ensure that servers connects using gigabit lan cards and the switch if  any used is gigabit .<br />
2.  Minimize or still better eliminate transactions across companies which spans across databases . Tehcnically baan db drivers do take care off transactions , but across os different db it introduces high complexity and with possibility on unpredictable results at times .<br />
3. As a corollary  to point 2 above , do not have table sharing between companies spanning across databases .<br />
4.  Last but not the least which database 0 company will belong . If  u allocate 0 to any 1 db instance , then u will always  have primary dependency for the db of 0 company. So  I would recommend  u may use bisam for  0  company on server 3 (which is built in porting set and all u need is to have the same in validation keys) . This will ensure continuity for all companies irrespective of the availability or other wise of other db. Further bisam is capable enough to handle low volume low  growth company like 0 (appx 1-2 GB max ) and the recovery also can be faster .</div></div><hr />
