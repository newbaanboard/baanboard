<br />
As for your Baan version and database, please add them to your profile as well.  Makes life easier for those who are trying to help, and you won't get the same question for this info every time!<br />
<br />
As for the problem, still more info is needed.  For instance, what session are you referring to?  If it is a custom built session, can you post the part of the code where the error occurs?  Rather give as much as possible, maybe irrelevant, information.  At least it will help us to pin-point the error!<br />
<br />
This all said and asked for, some ideas.  It looks like this session is using dynamic SQL to retieve some database information.  The undefined sqlid could then be pointing to a SQL statement that has been generated, and parsed.  During the parsing something went wrong (returned zero as the id), but the logic of the session does not check this, and tries to execute the query regardless, sending the zero as the sqlid (the id of the parsed query).  If this is a session you are building yourself, hopefully this can point you in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

I think the error is coming when i m running the session, tcedi7205m000 which in turn calls the sub-session tcedi7200s000. In the sub-session there are some sql statements which are being parsed and execute, the error (&quot;undefined sqlid.. cannot continue&quot;) is being logged in the ba6.1.<br />
<br />
what can be the possible cause for the same.</div></div><hr />

If its a problem with the BaaN Standard code then you have to open a case with BaaN Support.<br />
<br />
But if you are interested in seeing whats wrong, refer to the link - <br />

Attached is the error from the error Log.<br />
<br />
The info i m looking for is as to why the error is being generated and is there any way i can understand as to where possible i can check as to from where the error message has being originated.<br />
