When baan tries to drop the table I get this error:<br />
Drop original table error 1951<br />
<br />
It's an informix 7.31 database on a working backup server.<br />
<br />
I added full permissions to the database (grant dba to public)<br />
In informix (dbaccess) I can drop the table without a problem.<br />
<br />
Informix error information<br />
Error -951: User username is not known on the database server. ?<br />
<br />
Any Ideas?</div></div><hr />

The database server that you tried to access does not accept either your user ID, the login name that is specified for the desired server host in your ~/.netrc file, or the user name that is specified in the USER clause of a CONNECT statement. If you are explicitly specifying your user name in the ~/.netrc file or in a CONNECT statement, check that the name is correct. If you do not have a valid user ID on the server computer, see your system administrator. This message appears with Version 6.0 and later. <br />
<br />
<br />
-951 User is not known on remote host. <br />
This statement refers to a database on another computer system, but the other system does not accept your account name. You must have a valid login identity on any computer system you access. See your network administrator about getting a login ID. This message appears prior to Version 6.0. <br />
<br />
this may help you <br />

Good Luck !</div></div><hr />

I don't have a .netrc file and I don't know the user that baan is using for the drop statement. (I logged in as bsp)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks like baan uses the user 'baan' to drop tables :rolleyes: <br />
This user existed in the database but not under the OS.</div></div><hr />
