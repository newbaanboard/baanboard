I have allowed SQL to use all resources needed. When executing a query however only one CPU is used at 100% with virtually no memory use and the other CPU carries no load. I installed SP3 for SQL Server and now (I think) both processors are used at 50% each. How can I get SQL to use more of the CPUÂ’s available to speed up querys? It should be noted that both BAAN and SQL are on the same box.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any and all help!<br />

Since each query is executed as a single thread, you will not see higher loads unless you can execute more queries through the Baan multiple bshell performance booster.  <br />
<br />
Are you running the combo driver?  This will reduce context switching and will allow the processes to run faster without switching between the driver and the bshell.<br />

My issue seems to be quite serious do to performance of SQL.  Could you point me in the right direction or do you have any information on these two items you mentioned?  I am very interested in getting more information about them.  Thank you very much for answering my post.  <br />
