<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">terryw</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious if anyone is having problems running Baan (specifically Baan IVc4) on Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft SQL 2000? <br />
<br />
From what I've read and heard, Windows Server 2003 was developed using the Software Development Lifecycle program, and security is now designed in from the beginning.  Given this, the product should be much better than Windows Server 2000 when it comes to security and the constant pain of patch management.  <br />
<br />
We're moving from a HP-UX/Oracle/Baan IVc3 environment, to a Microsoft Server 2000 or 2003/MS-SQL 2000/Baan IVc4 environment to &quot;cut costs&quot;.  I hate to load the more stable (but more vulnerable security-wise) Windows Server 2000, especially when Microsoft has published that it won't be available after April 1, 2006, which is just around the corner. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your input!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure Windows 2000 can be called more stable than Windows 2003 server.  We have Win 2000 on our Baan servers but Win 2003 on a (newer) ADC server which connects to Baan. <br />
<br />
The Win 2003 has so far been very stable &amp; in terms of windows updates there seeme to no more of them for Win 2003 than Win 2000. <br />
<br />
The major &quot;issue&quot; of Win 2003 is that you have to spend more time setting it up as many more services etc. are turned off from default - but that is the good thing!</div></div><hr />

I use Windows 2003 Enterprise Edtition for an OS on those servers.<br />
<br />
I have gone more than 7 weeks between reboots on the DB servers with no problems.  The only reason I rebooted was because of patches Microsoft released that when installed required a reboot.<br />
<br />
To put things short, it's the most stable OS I've seen come from Microsoft.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">5th December 2006, 06:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes...as said earlier windows 2003 is quite stable. We are running our production server without restarting since long time. Windows works perfectly on small to mid level organisations.<br />
<br />
Just for &quot;Cost-Cuts&quot;, its ok. But if you have 24/7 operations and distributed setup, I would recommend think it twice. Do you know, win$ows can not resist to viruses..sometimes you find antiviruses are attached from viruses...sometimes you find suddenly restarting server frequently because of viruses and at that time your business can affect. <br />
<br />
Also win$ows sometimes behave abnormal while using shared memory...you might be aware..about this famous issue.This is my own experience.<br />
<br />
Because of this..we are moving to HP-UX now...<br />
