<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kswong</div><div class="date">12th May 2004, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">We have just migrated from Informix to SQL Server and the performance is really great, an hour's run previously take only a few minutes.  It has to be because we have 4 cpus and 6 Gb of RAM. where previously it was only 1,1.<br />
However we experience slowness in the printing of reports when we send it directly to our dot-matrix printers. This does not happen when we were using the Unix Server.<br />
To get around this problem, we would output the report in a file and send it to the printer thru the 'copy' command in command prompt. This way we would get a faster print from the printer.<br />
Hope you gurus out there can help us avoid this step.<br />
have a nice day!</div></div><hr />
