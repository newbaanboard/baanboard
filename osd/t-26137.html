<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">narron3211</div><div class="date">18th January 2006, 20:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Some background information.  We are running BaaN IV with SP 11 and Porting Set 6.1c.07.06.  We are using Windows 2003 Server running SQL 2000 on network &quot;172.16.30.0&quot;.  I have a remote facility, &quot;172.16.20.0&quot;, that is connected by WAN with a full T1 line.  When the remote users login to BaaN via BW Client the SQL server creates a routing statement for each user's IP Address.  For example, if I do a &quot;route print&quot; statement from the SQL Server I see the static routes for the remote facility such as ,&quot;172.16.20.200 255.255.255.0 172.16.30.11&quot; under Active routes.  After upgrading from Windows NT 4.0 and SQL 7.0 the remote users are being disconnected from BaaN but their IP addresses still remain under Active Routes.  They cannot log back into BaaN until I manually delete their specific IP address from the routing table on the SQL Server.  Once this is done they can successful log back into the BaaN but for only approximately 60 minutes before they are disconnected once again.  If the SQL server is rebooted then the problem goes away for approximately 5 days.  Also, the users on our LAN are not affected just the users over the WAN.<br />

Thank you for your assistance,<br />
