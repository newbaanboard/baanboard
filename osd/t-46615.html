<br />
Actually this is a job of your DBA...who can monitor DB growth closely and suggest/do changes.<br />
<br />
Its recommanded to have similar datafile sizes and additional free space available in your DB to function it properly otherwise you might face hung issues.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexlow</div><div class="date">9th January 2008, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">normally physical log and logical log are set to reuse, tmp also noneed unless really not enough.<br />
<br />
only the data dbs you need to add chuck to cope the increase of data, if index dbs are use than you need to add that also. <br />
<br />
if u have archieve comp, create a seperate dbs for it and will make your life easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">10th January 2008, 03:35</div></div><div class="posttext">so i will just add baandb_dbs add additional 1GB, is it? do i create one 1GB dbs file or split into 2 x 512mb dbs files?<br />
<br />
so for the rest of the dbs, no need to add?<br />
<br />
what do you mean by &quot;archieve comp, create a seperate dbs for it and will make your life easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
i am not good in this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexlow</div><div class="date">10th January 2008, 06:41</div></div><div class="posttext">i not so sure about win base informix, but chunk is 2gb limit so is better you put the max 2gb. the ol dbs i not sure what is assign for so i won't give comment, if is use for index than you need to add as well.<br />
<br />
when your system runs for some times, eg, 5,6 yrs. you purge the data from the live company to this archieve/history company, so you live company db will be smaller and backup faster.<br />
<br />
history company you only backup when you do any update,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">10th January 2008, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">so for the ol dbs, currently is 99mb free out of 100mb. do i need to increase?<br />
<br />
are you saying move the date to another campines..<br />
<br />
eg.. production is 900<br />
<br />
     archive is 901<br />
<br />
but will it overwrite the 901 date, or does it append to it, how do i do it?<br />
<br />
so far we have 10yrs of data.. informix DB around 20GB in company 900.<br />
<br />
does create smaller chunk better or create a 2gb chunk in term for performance in informix..?<br />
<br />
is there any limit of no of chunk, i have quite a free chunk already..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexlow</div><div class="date">12th January 2008, 08:26</div></div><div class="posttext">what is ol dbs for? i think your index and data are load on the same dbs, therefore you mostly only need to add the baandb dbs.<br />
<br />
yes, archieving is normal needed to keep your live company data under control size or certain years. ease of backup and better performance. archieve session will purge the data on live company and copy it to the archieve comp.<br />
<br />
2gb better, as performance there are many factors.<br />
<br />
limitation refer to table for your version<br />
