I am going to be moving our Baan server (application and database are on the same server) to a new facility that has a different IP scheme and domain name than the current location.  I'm not an expert on Baan authentication, but it seems that the user bounces against the NT domain for permissions.  I guess my three questions are:<br />
<br />
1.  Does changing the IP address of the server effect licensing?<br />
2.  Does changing the NT Domain membership of the server effect licensing?<br />
3.  Does changing the NT Domain membership of the server effect authentication?<br />
<br />
Any experience/knowledge that anyone has on this topic would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
changing the IP-Adress is no problem for licencing. As long as you don´t change the Server´s name it will work.<br />
<br />
I think the NT domain membership will be no problem ,too. Just remember that Baan should not be installed on a Primary Domain Controller.<br />
<br />
I don´t exactly know what you mean by authentification. If you mean the login-procedure: Be sure that the user´s password on the Domain is the same as on the Baan Server.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

Thanks, that does help some.  As for authentication, Baan is not installed on our PDC, but when someone logs onto Baan, it seems to bounce off of the PDC for authentication.  Hence the PDC is where I control passwords.  Another example is if I disable an NT account for someone, they can no longer log into Baan.  I am just wondering how to point it to the PDC of the domain I am moving it to.<br />

<br />
Just make the Baan server a member of the PDC you're authenticating users to.<br />
good luck.</div></div><hr />
