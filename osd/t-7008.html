I wonder what kind of tools everyone is using here for monitoring, maybe we should have a poll (~your view Pat?)<br />
<br />
Here is a screen shot of my spotlight. :p</div></div><hr />

You can start a poll yourself so feel free. Just make sure you make into a 'multiple-select' one.</div></div><hr />

We also use Spotlight - very useful thing for administrators. My problem is that i have Lynux workstation and so i run spotlight only from other workstations. Any idea of Linux (Unix) versions of this application? :)</div></div><hr />
