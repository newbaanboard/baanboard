<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nancy Mathew</div><div class="date">31st March 2005, 01:43</div></div><div class="posttext">We have two types of users (a) Local Users (b) NIS Users. After migrating from Solaris to AIX, NIS users are not able to connect to baan using rexec or baanlogin. Rexec gives an error &quot;Can't set credentials&quot;. Baanlogin says &quot;Password Expired&quot; (I found a post for a similar issue for LDAP users but not for NIS users)<br />
<br />
The SA team found the reason as below for rexec issue:<br />
<br />
The logins needs to have a NIS group as its primary gid. <br />
<br />
uid=4778(nisuser) gid=816(baan) groups=816(baan), 125(bsp)<br />
Hence, the group &quot;baan&quot; was changed from local to NIS. Now the error while invoking rexec has gone, still baan doesn't connect. <br />
<br />
The way to test rexec is on cmd prompt :<br />
rexec &lt;server name&gt; -l &lt;user name&gt; &lt;command&gt;<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any experience with NIS users on AIX 5.2?<br />
<br />
Thanks!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nancy Mathew</div><div class="date">16th April 2005, 04:16</div></div><div class="posttext">:D The resolution was pretty straight forward, though took a while to come to it!!<br />
<br />
The rule of thumb on AIX is NIS users need to be a part of NIS group as primary. The issue was because NIS users were part of local bsp group.<br />
<br />
The resolution was to create an NIS group bsp and make NIS users part of NIS group bsp and local users a part of local group bsp.<br />
