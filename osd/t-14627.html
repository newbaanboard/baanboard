<br />
Level 1 driver has 1 &quot;hash column&quot; added to the table per index on the table, and then oracle indexes are created on the hash columns.<br />
<br />
Level 2 driver has indexes generated on the key fields.<br />
<br />
(This means that 3rd party products can insert / update values in Level 2 Tables, but not Level 1 [ unless you can figure out the hash algorithm ] )<br />
<br />
Level 1 driver is optimized for rule based queries<br />
<br />
Level 2 driver is optimized for Cost based queries.<br />
<br />
While Baan 4 was written to be optimized in Level 1, as time has gone by it is now more optimized for level 2.<br />
<br />
Baan 5 is 100% optimized for level 2<br />
