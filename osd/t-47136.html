HI Vaishali,<br />
<br />
Please specify what kind of message you are receiving at login time. and are you facing same issues at time of telnet sessions too.<br />
<br />
same problem i were facing for one of my Server.  I have tried to change PAM file But was not able to resolve the issue. There are some patches available on Infor Site related to PAM file you may try with those.<br />
<br />
else attach the screen shot of error. if you dont want to use blogin method then you may use REXEC too.<br />
<br />
