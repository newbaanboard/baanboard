<br />
In all of our Oracle db's supporting our Baan 4b and 4c installs, there are several sessions for each single Baan user session.  Our worst has a ratio averaging 1:7 (Baan session:Oracle sessions).   Others are approx. 1:4.  This is a concern re:Oracle licenses.  Does anyone know why Baan does this, or if it may indicate a configuration problem?<br />
<br />
As an example:<br />
<br />
select count(username) from v$session;<br />
79<br />
<br />
select count(distinct username) from v$session;<br />
579<br />
<br />
- same usernames are usually tied to same os process id<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
You can reduce the max number of dispatcher processes in your init.ora file to maybe avoid hitting the licence limit.  But I'd look again at your reasons for running MTS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">30th July 2002, 01:05</div></div><div class="posttext">This is normal for Baan to spawn that many sessions per user. That doesn't mean that you have to like it, since it increases the load on the database server. And, it doesn't put your Oracle license in jeopardy, so don't worry about that. You can make Baan cut it down to 1 session per user, but it isn't recommended by Baan because it causes other problems. Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
If you migrate to oracle 8 you will get a ratio of 1:1.<br />
<br />
Funny enough this will not change anything in regards to CPU and memory consumption.<br />
<br />
Again, it's normal, don't worry.<br />

<br />
Markus, our databases are version 8i.  You may have a Baan configuration file set differently for your vers 8 db's?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are right, we actually do have a setting, which could be the reason:<br />
<br />
BDB_MAX_SERVER_SCHEDULE             = 1<br />
<br />
I just think this parameter might be differently interpreted by the oracle 7 driver compared to the oracle 8 driver. But you can try this. As I said, it does not necessarily have a positive impact anyway!<br />
<br />
honestly I also had the impression, it did not have a negative one either.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate your feedback in thi sregard,<br />
<br />
Markus</div></div><hr />
