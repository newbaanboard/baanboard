<br />
We are in exactly the same situation.  See the attachment for how I solved it.  (The initial code is based on Kevin Brocks code way back when it was on baanfans.com).<br />
<br />
The non-baan scripts were originally written in shell (ksh), but we changed to using perl because we are moving platform.<br />
<br />
This code only works with bw (GUI), but we previously used samba (smbclient) to make it work with ba6.1.  I can provide details if you wish.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps - not amazing code, but it works for us<br />
<br />
Phil</div></div><hr />
