<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenix</div><div class="date">9th May 2007, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We are right now implementing ERP LN 6.1 FP3. <br />
<br />
To be able to find the right sizing of all involved components of the environment I am looking for someone who has already experience in the average growthing of the database.<br />
<br />
I do not need exact data but a rough idea if we are talking about 100 MB per month or TB.<br />
<br />
We intend to use Oracle 10g unicode running on AIX. Maufacturing will not be used as &quot;just&quot; distrubution with all related processes have to be covered within the environment.<br />
<br />
For all of you who are able to provide information on this topic it would be helpful to get it in the  following form:<br />
<br />
Hardware:<br />
OS:<br />
DB:<br />
no. of users:<br />
BaaN version:<br />
used modules:<br />
running since:<br />
current DB size:<br />
growth per month/year:<br />
<br />
thank you very much for your help in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">10th May 2007, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Your list is a good start, but remember that UNICODE will inflate some tables and indexes significant (factor 4). So please take this into consideration. Further the way Finance is implemented will be a big factor for the datagrowth. Tables like tfgld495 can easily take up to 25% or more of the whole database.<br />
<br />
Of course you need some rough figures, but is is still a difficult task to do. <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
