<br />
We are facing one major problem from UNIX side. Some times jobs get over, but the processes running at back-end are not getting over. As these processes consuming licences :mad:, we required to kill :eek: these processes mannually. This is risky as well as time consuming. Please let me know anyone know such a cases happened before and any sugesstions for resolving such a issues.<br />
