What is ARM?<br />
<br />
(Do not expect an answer from the people you need to explain this, but they may become interested once they know...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
ARM is basically Application Responce Measurement. With ARM API's configured with the Baan system, we can monitor the transaction performance. On HP, there's a ARM API which can be configured with Baan, but I am not having much information whether anybody is using it or not.<br />
<br />
On configuring this API with Baan application, the IT manager can see the performance of each business transaction (for which it is configured). <br />
<br />
I have some document on this, due to size limit I can not post it here. If you can send me your email-id, I can pass it on.<br />
 <br />
What I heared is other ERP's (like Oracle Apps or SAP) does not support this API, but Baan supports this. So I am bit interested in this.<br />

<br />
here is more info - <br />
<br />
Application Response Time Measurement (ARTM) Overview (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_artm_artm_overview) <br />
<br />
For more details, see the Application Response Measurement API guide, located at  http://www.cmg.org/regions/cmgarmw/marcarm.html <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry Avinash, I never worked with this.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if you explored more from the Oracle end to see the view/statistics info.</div></div><hr />

I know that several customers use ARM for their Baan SLA's.<br />

Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
Thanks for the information and it is really interesting to see the database activity reports. But is the output of Concord or some other software integarted with something else?<br />
<br />
What I have heared is Baan and ARM API's can give you the details of time taken by each SQL / function in the session. Using this one can keep track of SLA's in BPO market specifically.<br />
<br />
Hi Dikkie,<br />
<br />
I am not sure whether it is possible to load this document on this forum or not, but I will appreciate it if somebody helps in this regard. Is it possible for you to send me the document to askajale@yahoo.com?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help..!<br />

Have a look at the doc attached to this thread:<br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7665&amp;highlight=TRACE<br />
<br />
There are also new Baan tools that provide a more graphical interface of these types of results, such as SupportEye, and I think newer additions or generations of that product.</div></div><hr />

Dick, try again. We increased the upload limit to 3 MB</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">19th March 2003, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">ARM or within Baan ARTM is available for each platform and can be used against each ARM agent. So Baan is not dependent on HP or so in this area. Also e.g IBM delivers an ARM package (also on non-IBM platforms) so when you have BaanERP you can use this functionality.<br />

Being able to get transactional metrics at a business transaction level including average performance, number of executions and duration versus service level are very cool.<br />

I only wish it was available for Baan IV - sigh.<br />
