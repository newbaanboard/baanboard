I am bussy with the same process. I have installed RedHat 8.1,. The process to run through is:<br />
1. FTP the bw_*.exe file to your Linux home directory.<br />
2. Unzip this directory by using wine; type: &quot;wine bw*.exe&quot; <br />
3. You are asked for a directory to save the files e.g. your &quot;E&quot; directory would be something like /c/temp (this is indicated in your $HOME/.wine/config file)<br />
4. You have to install, so I expect to run:<br />
&quot;wine /c/temp/I386/setup&quot;<br />
<br />
In my case this start with the install shield but at 67% of the process I get an error message: &quot; file_set_error: No such file or directory&quot; line 2: fixme:ntdll:RtlNtStatusToDosError no mapping for 0001869f&quot;<br />
anyone able to help further great. Hopefully step 1-4 work for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just use bx6.1, if your baan is Unix based!<br />
If your server is windows based and your client is linux based, then I would be really interested, how this happened. :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">10th April 2003, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">And as 3rd option, if you get your hands on the unsupported portingset for linux (old) you can setup bx6.1 locally and avoid the overhead of the display beeing sent to your linux workstation (and this works with any server type), see running bx6.1 against NT (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1378&amp;highlight=bx6.1) thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gideon</div><div class="date">11th April 2003, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We've gone of the track a bit here. bx6.1 is only a solution if you are running Baan IVc, no problems here. Allthough I have not been ablt to get the LINUX porting set for IVc .<br />
<br />
For Baan V, there is a problem as the clients available are all MS based.  Even new developments like webtop are IE only. So my problem is to have a Baan Vc on Linux preferably both client and server, but any of the two would already be a help.<br />
<br />
Hence my trial to get BW running on Linux with help of wine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frantek</div><div class="date">21st April 2003, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">hi,<br />
<br />
well, bx is no option, i need bw to run on linux.<br />
<br />
now i've setup a new machine, now it's a bit different. now i can start the setup after extraction of files i get a empty blue setup screen - thats all, nothing more.<br />
<br />
any sugestions ?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eppesuiG</div><div class="date">24th April 2003, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest you to setup wine in order to use desktop instead of managed windows.<br />
<br />
When you ses the blue setup screen, there will be a second window openend BEHIND the blue windows. You cannot see it unless you use the desktop option in wine configuration.<br />
<br />
BW works well under wine only for baan IV. The  baanERP client doesn't work.<br />
<br />
There are still some cosmetics problems with fonts.<br />
<br />
Bye,<br />
