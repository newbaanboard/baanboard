<br />
Following average February busy column of sar command for all disks:<br />
<br />
disk1       %   1.7<br />
       Informix_Binary<br />
       Informix_Temp <br />
       Logical Log<br />
<br />
disk2       %  61.7<br />
       Data<br />
<br />
disk3       %  58.1<br />
       Data<br />
<br />
disk4       %   3.9<br />
       Baan_Binary<br />
       Physical Log<br />
       Rootdbs<br />
<br />
1.)is it sensible to move these tables to disks disk1 and disk2? if yes,which of them? <br />
<br />
2.)Which tables can we move other than tiitm001 and tdinv001 which you know get most selective hits on themselves?<br />

2) Forgot how to determine most frequently used tables but I know that tables with logical and physical log should not be loaded too much by other things than logging to keep performance acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askajale</div><div class="date">24th February 2003, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">What Baan version you are using? I assume Baan IV cX<br />
<br />
The best approach to identify the tables to MOVE will be monitor the table growth over the period of time (may be by taking row count of tables) may be once in a week for 4-5 weeks and then identify the table growth.<br />
<br />
I suggest you to include Non Finalized transaction / Finalized transaction / ILC Inventory TRX (if you r using ILC) etc tables as well.<br />

You say in your answer as include Non Finalized transaction / Finalized transaction / ILC Inventory TRX.<br />
<br />
But i want to hear the full and exact names of them?<br />
 For example, Would you  suggest ilc106,too?<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it will be better if you can quote the version of Baan you r using either in your profile or in the quote for the exact answers.<br />
<br />
I assume it is Baan ERP 5.x<br />
<br />
following tables can be included<br />
tfgld410 / tfgld416 / tfgld417 (provided you r using Baan FInance fully)<br />
whinr100 / whinr110 (if you have lot of inventory trx)<br />

 <br />
we are using Baan IV and full packages of it under HP-UX with 4 CPU,5 GB RAM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askajale</div><div class="date">4th March 2003, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
As you are on Baan IV, you should think of putting following tables<br />
<br />
tfgld102 (Non Finalized TRX)<br />
tfgld106 *Finalized TRX)<br />
tdinv100<br />
tdinv150<br />

<br />
What business are you in?<br />
Which packages do you use and how many users can you link to each package?<br />
<br />
How is your hardware configured?<br />
I see four disks. Are these logical or the physical disks.<br />
<br />
We run with a mirrorred stripe set on a Sun E450.<br />
A stripe set consists of 5 disks. The complete set of 5 disks is mirrorred on an other stripe set. Writing is done simultanously on both sets, reading is done from each set individualy.<br />
Each time aconsultant works on our system they admit that it's fast. So there must be some thruth in this configuraton.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our avarage daily  disk data increasing is about 200 MB.We have 10 physical SCSI disks ,which half of them mirrored.They are for Appl.(Baan IV) and DB(Informix) data. Apart from these disks we have  2 disks for Unix OS.</div></div><hr />
