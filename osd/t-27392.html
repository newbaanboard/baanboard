<br />
I am working now for around 9 years with Baan on HP-Ux for HP's PA-Risc platform. But anybody nowadays asking HP for an architecture proposal will get confronted with their Itanium platform.<br />
<br />
Who has experience (both good or bad) with running Baan on Itanium? I am particularly interested in ...<br />
<br />
- anything concerning Baan IV running on top of Oracle<br />
- any issues experienced during migration von Pa-Risc to Itanium<br />
<br />

<br />
i know that we were going to migrate from a PA_RISC platform to an Itanium platform but we're using QKEY and it's not compatible with Itanium.  So my experience on this is make sure that all applications running on the PA-RIasc system is compatible with the Itanium.<br />
<br />
As for Baan, i was told that i needed to install a patch on my PA-Risc server first, then transfer everything on the Itanium server (except the bin directory).  Upgrade my porting set and validate Baan.<br />
<br />
Oracle told me that they had no issues with Itanium.<br />
