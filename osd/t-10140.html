<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">26th May 2003, 10:48</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference between L1 and Level 2 is that in Level 2 the indexes are created on the columns e.g. orno and pono. In Level 1 an additional column has been added to the table with the name hash&lt;index number&gt;. This colum is not visible for the end user, but exists on database level. The content of this hash colum is more or less a concatenation of the fields orno and pono. I say more or less as the algorihm to do so is so complex that I advise not to try to update this column yourself. The real index now is created on the hash column. <br />
<br />
This is the technique for Level 1 and 2 indexeing in a few lines.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
