   As the status suggests, have you created the user in the Database using Maintain Database Users session and by clicking on Convert Users button subsequently? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryanwee510</div><div class="date">5th November 2008, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, I have done created the user in the Database using Maintain Database Users session and by clicking on Convert Users button.</div></div><hr />

If you cant then try recreating this user again by deleting him from the above session. <br />

b.t.w what is the error message you get when you try to log in with this user name? <br />
<br />
I am assuming you had taken the following steps in creating user in addition to creating user at the OS level.<br />
a)Create Baan user in Maintain User Data<br />
b) Run Convert User Data to Runtime Data Dictionary for the user<br />
c) Create db user in Maintain Database Users<br />
d) Convert User<br />
e) Maintain Links between Baan &amp; Database User<br />
f) Dump User<br />
<br />
Last but not least, is your application and database running on the same server?<br />
<br />

Maybe the first time you created the user there was a hiccup in the process.<br />

Hi guru, Thanks you suggestion,<br />
the above (a) to (f) steps is i follow and done before.<br />
in details, when i created new user in Maintain Database Users then convert user, it will appear error message: ttdba0115: Error 1 occured while execute program, ttdbad1102: Error from Database Maintain Program, Bsp -1 29009 login failed; invalid username/ password <br />
And form database user data will found the status is NOT YET CREATED IN DB<br />
<br />
after that when did in the Maintain Links between Baan &amp; Database User, after created new user, it is appear error message ttdba01103: not all users are created in database,<br />
<br />
regards</div></div><hr />
