<br />
We have been suffering a performance problem with some baan code which was forcing Oracle to use a wrong index because baan was creating a hint for the SQL.<br />
<br />
I just discovered a work-around. Our problem was on this query located inside a Baan function:<br />
<br />
        select tfacr200.*, tccom010.cuno, tccom010.eded<br />
        from tfacr200 ,tccom010<br />
        where tfacr200._index6 = {:main.year, :main.btno, &quot;   &quot;, 0, 0, :main.ttyp}<br />
              and tfacr200.cuno refers to tccom010<br />
        order by tfacr200._index1<br />
        selectdo<br />
        ...<br />
        endselect<br />
<br />
        although index6 is being used in the where clause, the order by (which is required by the later code) was forcing Baan to introduce a hint so that Oracle would use index1 for the where clause, forcing a full scan on the table. This was taking several minutes to process the query.<br />
<br />
        index1 is composed of 6 fields, the first of them being tfacr200.ttyp, this is the modified SQL that has boosted the performance to less than 0.01 secs (it was more than 3 minutes before):<br />
<br />
        select tfacr200.*, tccom010.cuno, tccom010.eded<br />
        from tfacr200 ,tccom010<br />
        where tfacr200._index6 = {:main.year, :main.btno, &quot;   &quot;, 0, 0, :main.ttyp}<br />
              and tfacr200.cuno refers to tccom010<br />
        order by tfacr200.ttyp, tfacr200._index1<br />
        selectdo<br />
        ...<br />
        endselect<br />
<br />
        i.e., the sorting has not been altered but somehow specifying field tfacr200.ttyp alone prevented baan from introducing the hint and Oracle worked fine!<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps to somebody!</div></div><hr />

- Databse hints are only available in BaanERP<br />
- As in your query the first six fields of index 6 are fixed you are able to use the order by on tfacr200._index6 as well. It is in your case giving the data exactly in the same oreder as in your situation. <br />
;)<br />

Kind regards,<br />
