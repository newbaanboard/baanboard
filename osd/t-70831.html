<br />
I have a problem within ttaad2560m000 I see a couple of thousands old records with &quot;active user data&quot; but I can't delete them. If I select the sessions for &quot;Noremal Users&quot; I get an error message when trying to terminate them and for &quot;Super Users&quot; I can't even select the terminate option. Any suggestions??<br />
<br />

<br />
KB 1683541 - Support use of BSE Services on-premise<br />
KB 1837562 - Old (not existing) Bshell User Processes shown in session &quot;Active Users&quot; (ttaad2560m000)<br />
<br />
Did you set up the BSE services for your environment?<br />
Infor Enterprise ServerAdministration Guide<br />
Document code refesag (U8854)<br />
Release 10.5.1 (10.5.1)<br />
Publication date December 9, 2016<br />
Chapter 14 BSE Services<br />
Also, refer to the section in the User Management Chapter -<br />
<br />
Active Users<br />
Running the Active Users (ttaad2560m000) session shows the list of Active users on the LN environmentThe session monitors the logged in users and refreshes the list every five seconds.<br />
Note<br />
The Active Users session is only supported when the LN Application server runs on Windows.<br />
Running the session (Windows only)<br />
The session shows these columns:<br />
▪ Login Time<br />
▪ User info<br />
▪ Bshell PID<br />
▪ Category (Background Process or User Process)<br />
▪ Description of the startup process, and the command line of the bshell<br />
Examples of Category and Description:<br />
▪ When a user logs in using LN UI, the Category is User Process, with 'UI Process' as description.<br />
▪ A bshell handling Job ABC is displayed as a Background Process, with 'Job Process [ABC]'as description.<br />
You can manually stop the bshell of an Active user with the Terminate command. The BaanLogin Daemon will stop the selected bshell. Note that when you are logged on as a Normal User you only can only stop your own processes. To be able to terminate the processes of other users you must log on as a Super User.<br />
Every bshell that is started creates a bshell.&lt;pid&gt; file in the $BSE\proc folder, containing the mentioned properties of the bshell. If a bshell process is stopped in an abnormal way the proc folder can become out of sync. The BaanLogin Daemon will remove the remaining bshell.&lt;pid&gt; files in the $BSE\proc folder when the accompanying bshells do not exist.<br />
Active Users BSE Service<br />
The Active Users BSE Service compares every minute the files in $BSE\proc to the records in the Active Users session. The BSE Service ensures that Active Users tables in the database are in sync with the files in $BSE\proc. A cleanup process is started when there is a mismatch. and the database will be brought in sync with the $BSE\proc folder again.<br />
For details, see BSE Services (p. 185) .</div></div><hr />

We use the LNUI-Admin (active Users) to monitor the users. Maybe thats the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">14th February 2018, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The Active Users session relies on a BSE which checks the contents of the directory $BSE/proc to see what processes are active, you can check what you have in that path and should be the same information that you are seeing in the session. <br />
<br />
Please do not take into account what you are seeing in BW because BW is not supported using LN 10.X releases.<br />
<br />
Once the BSE services are configured the old data should be gone.</div></div><hr />

KB 1947317 <br />
Not all users displayed in the session Active Users (ttaad2560m000) <br />
Description: <br />
TOOLS VERSION(S):<br />
10.4, 10.5, 10.6<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
&quot;Active Users Monitor Service&quot;  (ttaad2261m000)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The session Active Users (ttaad2560m000) shows only some logged-in users, but not everyone.<br />
Usually the users with a different Time Zone set in their User Data Template (ttamd1110m000) are not listed.<br />
Resolution: <br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
As of portingset 9.2a.01 (TIV 2210), the files in the $BSE/proc have an extra attribute which stores the login time in UTC long format. When this attribute is present in the proc files, the Active Users Monitor Service (ttaad2261m000) compares the value that attribute against the login time as stored in table ttaad260. When this attribute is not present, the login time is not validated anymore, in order to prevent situations as mentioned in the situation description.<br />
<br />
For the most accurate results it is therefore recommended to install portingset 9.2a.01 (expected release date is end of March, 2018).</div></div><hr />
