<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_info</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
We have following setup :<br />
baan Vc sp 3 with lot of customisation.<br />
Porting set 7.1b<br />
Operating system AIX4.3<br />
Oracle 8.0<br />
<br />
We are planning to upgrade our database to oracle 9i and operating to AIX 5. <br />
I want to know is there any issue with my existing setup with new database and operating system. I came to know that baan Vc sp3 does not work on oracle 9i. I need to upgrade it. <br />
<br />
And if I need to upgrade my system can you guide me how to manage my customisation.  What I think that I will be installing the sps in my stnd VRC and my customisation in in cus VRC above stnd. So no need to redo all the customisation again and tools object will be get updated. plz guide<br />
Thanks<br />

Ankur,<br />
<br />
I am not sure how sp3 says it wont work with Oracle-9i. This depends on the database driver in your particular porting set version.</div></div><hr />

does it mean if i upgrade my porting set and then upgrade my oracle system, it will work. new porting set will not give any problem with service pack 3.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure what are you trying to do....<br />
<br />
Before you upgrade/change the OS or Databases you have to check the compatiblity against the Porting Set.<br />
<br />
All ERP-Application code is designed to work on different OS and Databases versions (minus some compatibility issues).<br />
<br />
Even the porting set has to be tested thoroughly just as tools patches. It can have bad fixes. We had to backoff/un-install porting sets because of some serious issues. <br />
<br />
I dont think the OS upgradation should impact you to make big changes to your existing code, unless you have anything which uses any system calls/functions/executables then you need to analyze the changes in OS upgradations and fix them. If the porting set is compatible against those AIX versions then it will handle it well.<br />
<br />
In general, all service packs are meant to be installed in the update VRC and only tools patches/solutions/service packs go to the main VRC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your worries are sound, but it seems the reasons you gave are a little<br />
misguided..  to go to AIX 5 and Oracle 9i you'll need to be on at least<br />
7.1d.01 porting set, now, you could just update the porting set and<br />
cross your fingers, as all Baan porting sets are &quot;supposed&quot; to be backwards <br />
compatible. <br />
<br />
But if you run into problems - you'll have to start applying patches, which is why you'll probably want to go to just make a plan to go to the Service Pack that was released around the same time as the Porting Set.<br />
<br />
This is where your test system comes into play. Install the porting set, service pack, OS and DB and test your customizations. PMC will give you a list of customizations that might be affected by the patches - but since its a porting set and DB change, you should test all of them. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_info</div><div class="date">2nd October 2004, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all<br />
Thanks for your valuable advices. I understand that if i need to install porting set i may have to upgrade SPs. in that case, should I apply SPs and keep my customized object as it is?? any enhancement in those objects will not come into effect?? and my tools objects will be updated??<br />
please suggest<br />
Thanks<br />
Regards<br />
Ankur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">2nd October 2004, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">When you apply the service pack, PMC will spit ot a report listing<br />
all objects in your customized VRC that clash with ones its installing -<br />
you have to look to see what changed, if you want the change, etc. <br />
<br />
Yes your tools objects will be updated, but in Baan 5 i don't know of any major problems that would require a code change between different versions of your tools. they are supposed to be backwards compatible (to<br />
a point)<br />
<br />
Again - do this on your test system first, it will tell you everything you need to know.. I don't think anyone here can gide you step by step since everyones environment is different.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">i96nds</div><div class="date">5th October 2004, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that for the latest version of PMC there are a lot of improvements. <br />
If you install this first, we will be able to install ONLY the tools solutions. You will not be forced to install the application solutions. <br />
<br />
So, I think it is enough to install the new porting set and the tools solutions. It's advisable to install both up-to-date.<br />
<br />
After this you can start the upgrade.</div></div><hr />
