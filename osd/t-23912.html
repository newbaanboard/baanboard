<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">29th April 2005, 19:39</div></div><div class="posttext">The manual describes DB error 520 as:<br />
<br />
&quot;This occurs when flushing of buffered updates fails. The flushing can fails due to a lock or to a referential integrity constraint.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, locks or reference issues most likely.  What are you trying to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">2nd May 2005, 11:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi German,<br />
<br />
From your profile you are using oracle as a database. So by deducting 1000 from the baan error number, you get the oracle error, ORA 1426.<br />
<br />
On unix you can type &quot;oerr ORA 1426&quot; to get an explanation or search on metalink for it. The above command will give you:<br />
<br />
&gt; oerr ORA 1426<br />
01426, 00000, &quot;numeric overflow&quot;<br />
// *Cause: Evaluation of an value expression causes an overflow/underflow.<br />
// *Action: Reduce the operands.<br />
<br />
It basically means, that Baan tried to write a value into a table field, which did not fit to the datatype of the field.<br />
<br />
If you look into log.ora.sql in $BSE/log, you should see the sql statement and therefore the table involved. The error could be caused by several things:<br />
<br />
a) simply a bug in Baan<br />
b) You applied a patch, which changed a session but not the corresponding table.<br />
c) like b, but you did not &quot;Create runtime DD&quot; on the table<br />
d) like b, but the other way around, you changed the DD, but the session does not fit.<br />
<br />
We once had a similar error on some finance tables. After some analysing we found, that in one table, Baan had written some huge negative values in some number fields and later could not handle them anymore. The records affected were anyway corrupted or not needed anymore. We deleted them and everything was fine. Before I would do something like this in your case, I would consider talking to SSA first. <br />

<br />
I had this problem some time ago, and I discorvered that this problem happen due to &quot;float exception&quot; problem, in other words a &quot;divide by zero&quot;.<br />

Try to re-organize tables which are accesed by those problamatic sessions. This may be probably some index related problem which you need to rebuild.<br />

<br />
you are comming from an other database? And installing on MSQL at new?<br />
In that case. The tables are not imported because of an error in date field.<br />
You must correct the data in your &quot;old&quot; system dump and import it again.<br />
e.g. when you are comming from informix it happened very often. Because informix is not checking the date if it is correct. MSSQL does.<br />
