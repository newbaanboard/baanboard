<br />
We have our Baan Application on Unix. i need to restart the Shared memory but while stopping it i am getting the following message<br />
<br />
# of attaches = 113 Cannot remove ..# of attaches not eq 0<br />
<br />
I think i need to kill some processes. Some jobs were running prior to that. Could that be the reason?<br />
<br />
And how could i remove those attaches?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
killing processes is not the solution here. Instead you have to release shared memory.<br />
The command needed is ipcrm -m.  To display the shared memory segments use ipcs -m.<br />

<br />
thanks for the command. there are actually multiple instances running so how would i know which segnment belongs to the instance on which i need to release?<br />

<br />
that message usually means you have bshell's and or driver processes out there.<br />
<br />
you can just kill those processes and that will release shared memory.<br />
