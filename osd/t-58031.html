<br />
You need to have a support contract since you need a new license.<br />
<br />
Basicly you can copy the whole bse to the new server. Install latest portingset.<br />
<br />
Regarding the database you could just backup and restore. On the microsoft technet site you can find out how to copy users.<br />
<br />
Since you have a new server you can test your procedure and after everything works fine move over the data once again for a final migration.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you don't have experience than it's probably wise to hire someone who does this on a reguarly basis.<br />

Thank you for your respond. Because WK2/SQL7 to WK23/SQL2005 the gate is not too big different, I guess it is easy to solve the problem if anything go wrong.<br />
<br />
Currently my Baan System is SP9, since we need to upgrade the OS and database, can I also upgrade the Baan system SP to latest version? What is your suggestion?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">16th March 2010, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you can do that as well. Your endusers have to test the new installation so they can test the latest SP as well.</div></div><hr />

If there are customizations ( mainly source code level) to migrate , u may need lot of time to migrate and test the customizations .</div></div><hr />

Since the OS/DB is strictly on the technical side, it is usually transparent to the users; however, since an SP involves potential functional changes, it can change the way some users interact with the system.  Also, as Hitesh mentions, your customizations need to be tested with a new SP in case any standard functionality that you have customized, or that your customization may interact with, may have changed.<br />
<br />
That being said, SP 9 is pretty old, and if you have the resources, you may want to upgrade.  There are several companies on this site that can help.  If you would like to talk more about it feel free to PM me.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

So please read the Infor docs  carefully on this .<br />
<br />
If SP  upgrade is mandated , u have a choice to upgrade only tools SP and not to upgrade application SP in case ur app has lot of testing and migration to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">17th March 2010, 06:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point Hitesh...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you forgive my stupidity for a second, could you explain what different between tool SP and application SP.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">18th March 2010, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The install files for tools and application are different . So u may choose only to install tools patches of the SP . Caveat - read the release notes of the sp u upgrade to carefully before u upgrade.</div></div><hr />
