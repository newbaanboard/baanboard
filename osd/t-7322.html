Has anyone implemented a standby database for a Baan erp system?<br />

I've implemented many Oracle standby databases - let me know what you need to know.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Good day to you.<br />
<br />
If standby database is enable for Baan Erp (baan IV c4), I would like to know the following:-<br />
-  Does the archive logs need to stop when running processes like MPS/MRP, post integration to finance<br />
- Installing of baan solutions in the primary server, does it automatically synchronise with the standby server.<br />
<br />
What are other things that needs to be taken for standby database for Baan erp?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
In short:<br />
<br />
- Archive logging needs to be constantly running when running a standby database environment.  Should you need to stop archive logging, then you'd have to completely rebuild your standby database after each stop.<br />
<br />
- When you apply Baan solutions, Baan tables in the database will get updated as well as the Baan software under your $BSE directory.  So the answer of course is that the Baan Tables in the standby database will also been updated with the identical solution info.  <br />
<br />
<br />
In the event of a problem with your Production Database, you simply open up the Standby database then point your Baan environment to the standby database.<br />
<br />
Also, a common concept is to run the Standby database with say a 2hr lag behind the Production Database.  In the instance when an erroneuos Delete/Insert command is issued, it is possible to quickly recover from this situation.<br />
<br />
A small factor in standby databases is the slight network overhead while the archived logs are copied across to the standby server.  Normally this overhead is insignificant.  Also, its good to put some monitoring in place to check the standby database is always up-to-date.<br />
<br />
If you need more info then let me know.<br />

We are using a standby database as well.  However, every once in a while an archive log doesn't get transmitted to the standby server correctly.  We just get the first 1024 bytes.  Any ideas why??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me know:<br />
<br />
 * Your operating system <br />
 * Database type and version<br />
 * Method for copying logs to standby server (rcp, ftp, brarchive, arch_dest2 )<br />
<br />
My first guess is that the remote file system on the standby server would be near 100% full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">7th November 2002, 09:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen the same problem when the copy process is running against a file that has not been closed by Oracle yet.<br />
<br />
As far as the synchronization of the directories go, you can use a NFS mount for the $BSE directories, use a NetApp or similar cifs/NFS appliance for the shared drive, use rdist or other supplied file distribution tool, use a tool like Veritas Volume Replication (overkill for this application), or the samba rsync product that in my book is better than rdist...<br />
<br />
I have used all of these and they all solve the Baan directory sync problem.<br />
