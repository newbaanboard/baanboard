       we wantto implement baanIVc4 with oracle11i.can any body provide the information about which version of porting set supports this combination and which are the OS that we should use?<br />
thanks in advance..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">22nd August 2008, 08:30</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to the OS, any OS supported by BaanIV also runs Oracle11. It is mostly a question of:<br />
<br />
- personal preference<br />
- how deep your pockets are?<br />
- what other OS are you using and have admin skills inhouse?<br />
- what are your scalability requirements (ie. no of users)?<br />
- what are your availibility requierments?<br />
<br />
In the high end, you most lilely weant to opt for AIX from IBM or HP-Ux from HP. In the middle to low end you will look at Windows and Linux.<br />
<br />
And like always avoid the flame wars on these topics. It's not worth it. If somebody recommends you a specific platform, then simply ask for a reference, which is a close as possible to your own environments and requirements.<br />

We can go for any OS and we have sufficient resource for administrating  unix/linux/windows what ever it may be.But you first tell me whether it is possible to implement baanIVc4 with 11i ?<br />
If it is possible then please provide details about OS and porting set<br />
thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">22nd August 2008, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely the following answer will disappoint you:<br />
<br />
a) The only definite answer in this regard can come from Baan Support, and unfortunately Oracle 11 seems to be not mentioned anyware on their support site.<br />
<br />
b) Often the only way of finding this out, is to download the latest portingset and read the release notes.<br />
<br />
c) If you want to avoid Oracle10 by all means, then install the Oracle 11 database server and access the database via the oracle 10 client via SQLnet. That works, even though it has a performance penalty.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can not offer more here. Maybe another membe ron the forum has actually BaanIV running on Oracle11?<br />

<br />
I had the same issue with BaanIVc4 with Oracle 10G , but the master installation CD did not support - hence after installing with 9i .<br />
<br />
we updated the patches provided by INFOR -&gt;then upgraded to Oracle 10G.<br />
You can try the same-&gt; log a Call with INFOR Support for patches to 11i support.<br />

The answer they gave was that certification was planned for the latest porting sets (8.4d / 8.4c.01 / 6.1d / 6.1c.07.20) but it was withdrawn because some outstanding Oracle bugs.<br />
