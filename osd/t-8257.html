<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">28th December 2002, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">(this thread was taken from 'Baan and new Oracle features' as requested) <br />
<br />
Basically what I would like is an option to see how the driver will translate 4GL into Oracle without having to run the code.<br />
<br />
In our organization all SQL has to be approved by the DBA group before it is introduced to the system to avoid &quot;dumb&quot; queries causing unnescesary stress.<br />
Baan currently doesn't comply to this policy because there is no way to determine what the eventual code is going to look like and therefore there is no way of telling how the code can be improved before the code is actually ran.<br />
<br />
I would like to take the guess-work out of Baan SQL-development.<br />
<br />
I hope this explains my suggestion better, but please contact me if you have a need for more details. I for one really appreciate what you are doing here.</div></div><hr />

When it becomes usefull for more people we can drop our conversation in a new thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">30th December 2002, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Please ask the moderators to split this thread, because &quot;going private&quot; I think will only solve Francesco questions, but more are interrested in how the database driver does parse the offered SQL queries (to be able to write optimal performing queries and to judge the programmers skills in the standard).<br />
<br />
Since Francesco is moderator too, he can split the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">30th December 2002, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed optimizing queries is another topic with a lot of spitzfinger gefuhl as both the Baan driver and the database optimizer are improved (or not ;)) every next version. And off course there are still people running Level 1 drivers and also looking for general guidelines.<br />
<br />
For Level 2 I have an old document that explains some general guidelines. Hopefully this document is not too old...<br />
<br />
For Level 1 it is more complex as all temptations showed lots of exceptions. Maybe when I find some time in the near future I can summarize or collect these guidelines.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
