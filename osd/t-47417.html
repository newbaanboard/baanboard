<br />
Currently we have only one server where both baan application and databases are installed. Baan IV c4    DB: SQL2000   OS:Windows 2003.<br />
<br />
We are proposing to split the application logic and database on two different physical servers aiming for better performance.<br />
<br />
Will it help in improving the performace or have any negative performance. Will you kindly update on merits and de-merits of 3-tier Baan.<br />
<br />
Are there any different types of 3-tier installaions, is there a document for 3-tire installation steps.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

However the combination can probably support more users. However if you add the number of cpu's and the memory in one server than you probably have a better performance.<br />
<br />
What's the number of users you have to support?<br />

IMHO, one doesnt choose 3-tier to improve performance. Its more or less chosen to increase your server availability and provide some sort of a continuance to your operation at all times.. This however brings down your performance and the cost of beefing your 3-tier setup (for performance gain) would be enough to beef up your current server 3-4 times over...<br />

<br />
Thanks for ur update. <br />
<br />
We will have around 50-75 concurrent users per setup.<br />
<br />
We plan to connect the BAAN1 (application logic) and BAAN2 (database) servers on a dedicated switch/VLAN or using a cross cable, so that the services within these two servers do not get routed to other network traffic. Though I dont have the results of this setup, this is how we see it initially.<br />
<br />
And from the application point of view, we have a lot of automations like bulk of sales integration, shop purchase receipts heavy batch processing etc.. while these run, the regular users are not able to work with the server as the CPU usgae hits 90-100%. What we observed, by keeping the database in another server, both the servers run around 30-40% CPU; which helped the regular baan user connections work smoothly.<br />
<br />
Please, would you know of any documents available for this 3-tier install types, recommended settings, pros and cons.<br />
<br />
Will help, thanks..</div></div><hr />

   The best document (in my opinion) that could help you realize what is needed to successfully run a 3-tier setup would be Baan Sizing Tool. To obtain this, you would need to have a support contract with Infor.<br />

<br />
Wo do hv sup contract with infoR.<br />
<br />
For my query with them they have given the posrting set that is required and things like that.<br />
<br />
can you elaborate a little more on this Baan Sizing Tool, so that I can ask them.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">30th January 2008, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan Sizing Tool is a document that helps you in selecting the right hardware for your Baan Installation. Based on some caluclations provided in this document, you could come up with the right (recommended) size of the CPU, memory, storage and connectivity. As with all the other ERPs, this (Sizing tool) is the most confidential of documents and so its not easily distributed. You would have to put up a case with Infor, requesting them to send you the Sizing tool. Do also mention the environment you need the sizing tool for...<br />
