<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pwinter</div><div class="date">6th October 2003, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
I have developed a shell-script to monitor license usage. (didn't use &quot;Closeidle&quot; as I need to control things at server level). Also, due to our old porting set, had limited options!<br />
The script does the following:<br />
1. Take snap-shot of all bshell processes<br />
2. Remove any obsolete bshell.&lt;PID&gt; files<br />
3. use bshcmd6.1 to identify BaaN objects being run by each user in turn<br />
4. append to a file any &quot;idle&quot; logins (which compare to various templates I have created)<br />
5. Kill -15 sleeping bshells from the aforementioned file (should the number of users reach a defined number)<br />
------------------------------------<br />
My problem.....<br />
The output of bshcmd6.1 appends to a RUNNING bshell.&lt;PID&gt; file. Because I am looping the process to a master list, these files grow quite quickly. The Job Daemon bshell file gets VERY big.<br />
I don't really want to stop/start the job-schedule if I can avoid it.<br />
Is there a way of reducing the size of a running bshell file? (I have tried &quot;&gt; /{BSE}/tmp/bshell.&lt;PID&gt;&quot; to a test login file, only to find that it is re-created by the logic server at the next poll.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is a bit boring but the script is really useful to me.<br />
<br />
Hope someone can help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you post your script, then there maybe someone who can help you. I personally hear about &quot;bshell.&lt;PID&gt;&quot; files for the first time.  Many a funny critter seem to lurk in $BSE/tmp. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
THis would give information on when and how frequent this is happening without having to run some batch process.</div></div><hr />
