<br />
do you have log on as user root to perform the installation?<br />
(Maybe has nothing to do with the error but is a requirement)<br />

<br />
hundreds of postings in the web regarding the libc.so.6 error with Suse 9.1.<br />
Do a search on the web.<br />
<br />
But maybe first you can try it with the setting <br />
export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1 before you call install6.1<br />
That solves some user problems on installing and running of different applications with Suse 9.1<br />
<br />

<br />
1)<br />
I didn't have $BSE set or my user didn't exist in Baan or something like that.. Also check your group permissions. <br />
<br />
2)<br />
I did also see that when i tried to install it on Redhat.. I think it was set<br />
by doing some kernel tuning<br />
<br />
3) <br />
Again, on Redhat, my C libraries were too new. never got past this one, I gave up and went to SuSE 8. <br />
<br />
It seems like the linux client isn't as good with the errors as the other systems.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm on SuSE 9 now though and it works, so i'd try the first two if i were you.<br />

<br />
I agree with Dave that it seems like a problem with some kernel values.<br />
We also had this error in the past but I don`t remember in which conjunction on what OS or DB.<br />
<br />
Please have a look to this thread,<br />
Segmentation fault (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=22373&amp;highlight=segmentation) <br />
maybe you can find some starting-points regarding your problem.<br />

<br />
thanks for your help. the segmentation error desapear.<br />
<br />
but I have another problem.<br />
<br />
I will explain what I'am doing:<br />
I have install a Baan Worksation istallation (client baan) on linux, and i want to comunicate with my baan server that is in windows sytem.<br />
<br />
after the installation i have create an user in baan server (user:wpt-rmaf) and I create the same user on linux system.<br />
I set the file .profile of this user in linux with the same values as user bsp.<br />
<br />
# Sample .profile for SuSE Linux<br />
# rewritten by Christian Steinruecken &lt;cstein@suse.de&gt;<br />
#<br />
# This file is read each time a login shell is started.<br />
# All other interactive shells will only read .bashrc; this is particularly<br />
# important for language settings, see below.<br />
<br />
test -z &quot;$PROFILEREAD&quot; &amp;&amp; . /etc/profile<br />
<br />
# Most applications support several languages for their output.<br />
# To make use of this feature, simply uncomment one of the lines below or<br />
# add your own one (see /usr/share/locale/locale.alias for more codes)<br />
#<br />
#export LANG=de_DE@euro     # uncomment this line for German output<br />
#export LANG=fr_FR@euro     # uncomment this line for French output<br />
#export LANG=es_ES@euro     # uncomment this line for Spanish output<br />
<br />
<br />
# Some people don't like fortune. If you uncomment the following lines,<br />
# you will have a fortune each time you log in ;-)<br />
<br />
#if [ -x /usr/bin/fortune ] ; then<br />
#    echo<br />
#    /usr/bin/fortune<br />
#    echo<br />
#fi<br />
BSE=/usr/baan4/bse<br />
BSE_TMP=/usr/baan4/bse/tmp<br />
PATH=/usr/baan4/bse/bin:$PATH<br />
export BSE BSE_TMP PATH<br />
BSE_REM=10.211.1.1<br />
BSE_bshell=bshell<br />
export BSE_REM BSE_bshell<br />
<br />
after that I execute ba6.1 the segmentation error desapear but i have the  next problem:<br />
<br />
pt-rmaf@linux:/usr/baan4/bse/bin&gt; ba6.1<br />
ba6.1: Error 2: cannot stat '/usr/baan4/bse/lib/user/rwpt-rmaf'.<br />

<br />
if you or any one have any idea that could  help-me plese say something.<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">when using BSE_REM you have to have a &quot;remote user&quot; setup.<br />
go to maintain &quot;remote user data&quot; under User management<br />
to create the r&lt;username&gt; file. <br />
<br />
the r&lt;username&gt; needs to exist on both the thick client and the server<br />
so create it on your windows machine and copy it over.<br />
<br />
That should do the trick.<br />

<br />
I have stop with this stuff for a lot of time.<br />
But now i'm working on it again. I could not resolve the problem, because  I dont know how to create the remote user on de client system. You can gime a more specif help how to create the remote file on the client system, and what are the format of the file.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

Basically the remote users are created thru session Maintain Remote User Data and converted to runtime to create the rfiles (in the same location as the ufiles). These rfiles need then to be copied across from the server to the client.<br />
Check that session, it should be straightforward.</div></div><hr />

thanks DAVE for your help.<br />
I think that the problem with the rexec could be because the port of the conexion on the server is not port 2. Do you know how i can modify the default port that the client is use to try conect to the server.<br />
if you have any idea say somthing.<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyway, In unix(-like) systems the ports are controlled by /etc/services<br />
so you should have (r)exec listed there as 512..<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that the error message is bad and was only displaying<br />
the &quot;2&quot; of &quot;512&quot; but it's worth a look!<br />
