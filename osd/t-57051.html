<br />
Recently we have migrated our AIX OS from 5.2 to 5.3 and DB2 from 8 to 9.5. Also upgraded latest porting set. But after migration we are getting some issues:<br />
<br />
a. Few users are able to login but not others.<br />
b. In the version scan tool the OS version and porting set version is updated correctly but not Db2, reason?<br />
c. Currently BA users are able to login but the same doesnt work for BW, reason?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

For b, Sorry I am not familiar with DB:confused:<br />
For c, check that you have enabled rexec services on your server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue is already resolved.<br />
<br />
a. I came to know those users who had access to BaaaN were Power Users/Super users. So we checked and changed ownerships of few folders it worked.<br />
<br />
b. Version scan tool was taking few data from environmental variables, I set it properly and restarted DB so got resolved.<br />
<br />
c. blogind6.1 was not started, when I start, It got resolved.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
