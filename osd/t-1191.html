Does anyone has an experience working with Baan on Oracle 8i database working 64bit ?<br />
<br />
Does the application itself has the capability to work with the database with 64bit too ?<br />
<br />
Any input will be appreciated ! :)<br />

You can use the 64-bit version of Oracle but you won't get any benefits from it as Baan is still a 32-bit application. I would not even recommend using the 64-bit version as the memory footprint of Oracle 64-bit is probably bigger than the 32-bit version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">James</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, using 64-bit Oracle will slow Baan down for certain.<br />
<br />
The benefits of 64-bit functionality only come to light on applications that use very large memory sizes - not Baan.  I think memory size must be greater than 4Gb, possible a lot more, before 64-Bit starts to out-perform 32-Bit.<br />
<br />
Like Patrick says, the Baan Porting Sets are 32-Bit anyway and  I can understand Baan not releasing a 64-Bit version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used the 64 bit version of Oracle and the advantage that it has is in the ability to use memory above the 4 GB limit.  This is helpful when you have a lot of memory on a system as well as many instances of Oracle or Baan.  Since Baan is 32bit is must reside in the lower 4 GB of address space.   But, 64 bit Oracle can be located anywhere in memory.  While is it true that we typically do not have very large SGAs in Baan sites, the address flexibility is worth it (and yes I know that we can use memory windows, but 64 bit is still easier).<br />
<br />
Baan has stated that they are not developing a 64 bit version of the application.  It really makes no sense for them to run 64bit.  They have taken care of the one place where addressing and file size is an issue and that is with the bsbpre/post process splitting up very large files into smaller units.  Other than this, I see no fundamental issue pushing Baan away from 32bit.<br />

Good point, didn't think of that. Guess the habit of working &lt;4GB machines breeds lazyness :)</div></div><hr />
