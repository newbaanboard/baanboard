<br />
We are looking to replace our HPUX Baan servers with Linux ones. Whilst I have read a lot of posts on BB with regards to Baan/Linux can I ask a couple of  simple questions?<br />
<br />
1) Does anyone experience issues specific to running Baan on Linux?<br />
<br />
2) Are there any strong reasons NOT to move away from HPUX?<br />
<br />
3) What hardware platforms are people running Linux on?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

1) Nothing more specific than changing to (for example) IBM AIX.<br />
No more sam, it's called smit on AIX, on SUSE linux you will use yast as config tool.  (redhat doesn't seem to have such a tool, but I am not familiar with redhat) <br />
Likewise you will have to use another spoolsystem, but cups for linux is very straightforward.<br />
2) If you have a soft heart and can't see disappointed faces of HW vendors you should stay with the 'big' machines. <br />
The only reason NOT to use linux would be if you are unwilling or uncapable of installing and maintaining your system - but I doubt that you had someone from HP at your place in the past years to do sysadmin jobs for you. <br />
3) HP Proliant ML570 is what we use.     <br />

<br />
Scalability comes to mind. I still have to see the linux distribution, which can handle a box with 12 CPU's. And yes, you can distribute your CPU load by using several application servers. But when it comes finally to your database server, you will need a single box, that can scale.<br />
<br />
So if you run a baan shop with 600 and more concurrent users, the big boxes of HP and IBM offer the scalability, which your database will need. <br />
<br />
If not, I will dream up a new reason ... :) <br />

<br />
We moved from IBM AIX to Suse Linux Enterprise edition 2 months ago. The new linux environment system is very stable and fast. We are running on a HP-Proliant Xeon 3.0 Ghz server with 2 Gb of memory with Baan IV c4 servicepack 21 and the latest portingset.<br />
One of the reasons to stay on HP-UX could be the server platform. From support reasons it's recommended that the server you use is supported for Linux by your hardware vendor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">25th July 2007, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on your knowledge Linux versus Windows. For maintaining Baan self it does not make a big difference. <br />
<br />
At a customer site  we are no live with Baan on Linux for almost a year now, the platform/application has proven to be very stable with a great performance.  Linux therefore is a really good alternate for a windows platform with less licence costs. But again, the question which platform is easier to deploy depend on your knowledge of the OS. <br />
<br />
For your info, this server is running on Suse Enterprise 9 with a Bisam DB and Baan IV c4 Servicepack 21</div></div><hr />
