We would like to break out the different companies into different databases on the same instance of Sql Server. Does anyone have instructions on doing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">24th November 2006, 01:08</div></div><div class="posttext">As I know, it is not possible to put different tables in different databases in same instance. <br />
<br />
I think the restriction is because each user can only link to one db group. The db group is actually the database name in the instance. <br />
<br />
We have a customer facing the same situaion. They want to separate each baan companies in different database. The outcome is now they have several instances of SQL Server running together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">24th November 2006, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Tritonbaan is correct I looked at this a few years ago. The only idea I came up with was to use NDF files. It allows you seperate out your tables in to different files so you have mdf and ndf files. you can put the ndf files on different disks to improve speed it is also possible to backup and restore ndf files independantly. I was looking at it to put my archive company into a different NDF file so my production backup would be quicker as the archive company only changed once a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">genehunter</div><div class="date">25th November 2006, 01:53</div></div><div class="posttext">So why could you not just create multiple logins for users that need to access more than one company? Am i understanding that you can do this but the user can not log into another company?</div></div><hr />

The problem is because every user need to access company 000.</div></div><hr />
