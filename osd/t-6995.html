We are considering to buy a backup software (Veritas Netbackup or  Bakbone Netvault ).<br />
<br />
We wish to know following matters.<br />
<br />
1.	If the backup frequency is half an hour ,does that affect the system performance in general.<br />
2.	In case of hard disk failure, do we need to relicence Baan . <br />
3.	In case of  other hardware like CPU crash , do we need to re-licence baan if we have hard disk raw backup.<br />
4.	Does oracle have any problem with raw hard disk back (at the time of restore in case of disaster)<br />
5.	How does one restore few tables of Baan selectively in normal course without disaster. (looking for steps).<br />
6.	If we go for such software , does this eliminate the need for Sequential table dumps.<br />
7.	Any comparative analysis between Veritas and Bakbone (wrt market share , reliability , pricing etc)</div></div><hr />

1. No<br />
2. No<br />
3. Yes<br />
4. No (if offline)<br />
5. You'd need to restore to a dummy database then export/import relevant tables<br />
6. Depends why you're doing sequential table dumps<br />
7. don't know</div></div><hr />

<br />
)Depending upon the IO overhead placed on the system by the backup <br />
<br />
2. In case of hard disk failure, do we need to relicence Baan . <br />
3. In case of other hardware like CPU crash , do we need to re-licence baan if we have hard disk raw backup.<br />
If the root disk is lost, so that the inode changes, then Baan must be relicensed. <br />
<br />
4. Does oracle have any problem with raw hard disk back (at the time of restore in case of disaster)<br />
<br />
Most Oracle sites are using file systems so they can backup/move files easily.  Raw devices require RMAN backups, but this is generally the method used for hot backups. <br />
<br />
5. How does one restore few tables of Baan selectively in normal course without disaster. (looking for steps).<br />
<br />
This will require an export file, or a restore to a second instance.  You would then copy the tables from the export or the restore instance.  You cannot restore a single table from a RMAN backup. <br />
<br />
6. If we go for such software , does this eliminate the need for Sequential table dumps.<br />
No.  <br />
<br />
7. Any comparative analysis between Veritas and Bakbone (wrt market share , reliability , pricing etc <br />
Veritas has over 50% of the US backup market share.  I have never used Bakbone (or even heard of it) before now.  I have used TSM, Legato, Omniback, ArcServe, Backup Exec and Veritas.  Depending on your platform, there are strengths and weaknesses to each.  However, there is no such thing as a trouble-free backup solution.  There are always problems and the basic discipline of testing restores can never be taken for granted. <br />
