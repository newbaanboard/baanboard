<br />
I consider to separate DB (Oracle) and BaaN IV application on two servers.<br />
I consider to do that on two domain Sun machine. Is it possible?<br />
Has anyone experience with such solution?<br />
Now I have DB and BaaN on one server. <br />
Is 2-tier solution on two domain machine slower than 1-tier one?<br />
<br />
<br />

b)<br />
solution is slower than 1-tier, if you have 2 machines with same power.<br />
<br />
i always would prefer to stay on one machine, f.i. you<br />
should think about fast linux-box (baan4, baan5)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for answers.<br />
<br />
The reason for a such change is to save some money on Oracle licenses.<br />
No I've got SF3800 machine with 8 SPARC III Cu 900 MHz processors with Oracle and BaaN.<br />
I need to pay for 8 processor licenses. <br />
So I consider to exchange this machine for a new two domain machine with 6 SPARC III 1,2 GHz processors in one domain (Oracle) and second domain with <br />
2 or 4 processors for BaaN application.<br />
<br />
I wonder if this configuration could be much slower than current one.<br />
Has anybody any experience in a such exchange ?<br />
<br />
Please notice that in second configuration processors are faster and these two domains exist on the same box. <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">2nd December 2004, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Baan considers a host-mode setup (Baan and DB on same server) as a two-tier architecture and a client-mode setup (baan and DB on different servers) as three-tier. This is because they count the GUI as a display tier and it sounds better in the news!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway! If you go away from host mode, then you will most likely experience a slowdown in your job times, because of the network connection involved. This might be up to around 30% slowdown.<br />
<br />
Naturally your interactive session will have a similar slowdown, but users might not notice!<br />
<br />
If your job run more than fast enough during the nights, then you might give it a try!<br />
