What settings are you using for cursor parameters with 10.2 and LN?<br />
<br />
<br />
session_cached_cursors = 200<br />
open_cursors = 5000<br />
cursor_sharing = exact<br />
#cursor_sharing=similar<br />
<br />
Hard to achieve good parse to execute ratio...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">16th October 2008, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard to achieve good parse to execute ratio...<br />
<br />
In Oracle you can't influence the parse to execute ratio. This is determined by the application usage. The only thing you can influence is  the ratio between hard parses ((re)new parses in Oracle) and soft parses (Plan is available in SGA).<br />
<br />
For a higher ratio soft parse to hard parse you can use session_cached_cursors and cursor_space_for_time. The higher these the better the ratio and the more memory it will use. For Baan you don't have to change cursor_sharing. For a load of a company you require something like 500 open_cursors. <br />
<br />

Shared pool 3,6GB and db_cache for 8k 3,6GB. This db is almost 1T because of pure Unicode character set. Hit ratios are good, but LN/fp3 performance is not good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">makiju</div><div class="date">16th October 2008, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, for me, it looks like silly amount of queries in some of these problem sessions. Nothing takes time in db-level. In some of the cases 500000 queries in run...some are customized. Also problems with MRP, of course:)<br />
Multi-bshellling not working with this at the moment. No error messages...looking good with two bshell's, but then stops...ticks stops growing and job stays running. No message queue problems.<br />
<br />
Some of the problem-sessions:<br />
<br />
Update prod orders tisfc0101m100 <br />
Update of operations tibom1110m000 <br />
Transfer orders cppat1250m000 timing approx 5-8 minutes <br />
Release orders tisfc0204m000 timing approx 5 minutes <br />
Initiate inventory issue tisfc0207m000 timing approx 5 minutes <br />
<br />
Some deadlock issues also...<br />

Of course one big reason for slowness is pure Unicode, not TSS. Much more data to process everywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">17th October 2008, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I can image that you kept it to a high level. You have a complex environment with tons of things that can go wrong:<br />
- System setup<br />
- Oracle<br />
- Unicode<br />
- ERP LN<br />
- customization<br />
- application usage<br />
<br />
I believe these all are involved. Although I would like to help you, I think this would take a very long thread and I think you better contact support or your account manager for a session or system investigation if it is hampering your business.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">makiju</div><div class="date">17th October 2008, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course these support actions has been taken, but overall performance is just quite poor....or should these be quicker with lot's of data, I don't know.<br />
Is there anybody else running real Unicode here?<br />
<br />
What would you say if you see tkprof or CGP with half a million of same quories, which takes 30-40 secs total time  in db and rest of the time (500 secs) is spent in bshell...bad code I would say:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">17th October 2008, 11:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I would not necessary say bad code, but it could be. Oracle is not telling the real truth when you see only 30 secs there. But you run 3-tier and thus network can consume sme time etc etc. Can you provide a CGP and tkprof output on any of these sessions? And what is the system telling after the run? How much time is spent on bshell, driver and database server process. <br />
<br />
BTW. Did you know you can run in combo on your portingset? Combo has been introduced on UNIX since 8.4a.01. Since 8.4b combo has been improved even further by the removal of some internal layers. More than 10% improvement has been measured in most situations.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">makiju</div><div class="date">17th October 2008, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I have tested combo mode with MRP. It was 5-10% faster with it, but it has at least one problem with one session, causing application lock issue with ****** as header. It's solved by tools-fix, but we can't implement that at this time.<br />
Network is not a big issue. We have snapshot env. of prod, which has same issues. Packet sizes (SDU and TDU) are fixed in prod.<br />
<br />
Of course it would be faster with 2-tier and BEQ. We could save Oracle licenses this way. At least one reason for 3-tier.<br />
AIX with LPAR's in use. Not The Best option this either...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">makiju</div><div class="date">17th November 2008, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anybody heard that AIX is slower than others with TWO_TASK?<br />
We have now solved many problems by switching to beq/hostmode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">17th November 2008, 12:34</div></div><div class="posttext">makiju,<br />
<br />
The reason could me many things but in general I am not aware that AIX is better or worse than others.<br />
<br />
In general I see more and more a difference between host mode and C/S than in the past due to much faster CPU's compared to almost the same network speed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
