    We have recently migrated to a new Service Center (out-sourced) and all of our Baan Servers (PROD and DEV) along with our DB servers are now maintained off site. After this time we started to 'time out' on our bshell's after 30 minutes of inactivity. I put a ticket into Baan and their response is 'Never Seen That Before'. I talked with the Unix Admin of our new Service Center and he stated 'That He has never seen this message before' and I came here and did a search and I did find a couple of threads from a few years ago mainly talking about VPN or bad network. I really feel that there is a parameter that needs to be looked at but not sure what that would be. <br />
<br />
Question; Does anyone know what settings at either the OS, DB or Apps level would be generating this message?? <br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
