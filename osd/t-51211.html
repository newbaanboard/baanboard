<br />
 I have the following problem <br />
<br />
On some machines can not connect to Baan, all <br />
IP are in the etc/hosts, but some are not connected,<br />
which gives the error is 512, this port is well in the config <br />
<br />
When we change the ip on the other machine, its connected, the customer is the B40c73 for Baan IVC2. I dont know if a problem of networks or Unix server. <br />
<br />
if a machine is turned off for one week at<br />
turn it on and does not connect.<br />
By changing the ip achieves connect again <br />
<br />
that will be what happens?<br />
<br />
 thanks</div></div><hr />

It seems to me that is a network problem. Perhaps you are using DHCP to assign ip address to your machines. If this, check if there is a not valid range of ip address. Another thing you must check is the firewall policies. Baan uses port 512 rexec to connect via bshell. Be sure that your firewall is allowing this port.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 thanks,  yes I am using DHCP to assign IP, but all range are valid.<br />
<br />
 The port 512  is allowing in the firewall policies. Several  machines are connected using<br />
 this port</div></div><hr />

Let´s start from the obvious. Can you ping to the unix server, form a machine that can not connect?</div></div><hr />

  Thanks, yes I can ping at unix server, but not connect or login in Baan,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someday I have faced this issue, and the solution was put the ip address that can´t connect in the file hosts of the unix server, but as I see on your 1st message you have already done.<br />
<br />
How is your BW client side configuration? are you refering to the baan server as an alias or an absolute IP address?<br />
<br />
Try to add the alias to the hosts file on the client side.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
