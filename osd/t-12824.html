<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pnunes</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings to all, <br />
My Baan server and/or the baan nt manager  has had to be re-started several times in the past month in order to clear the &quot;runaway processes&quot; which have been more common these days. The problems is always the same, how to relate the dbdriver PID, the ntbshell PID, and of course the Baan user. I was hoping that some of you might have some ideas on how to deal with these situations in an easier way without interrupting the most &quot;undisturbable&quot; users. I believe that this topic has been discussed previously as the problem is not knew, so even a link to that thread will help. Also ...are there any 3rd party developments known in the software market that might help?<br />
with my best regards,<br />
Paulo</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you need to kill any user , please use bshcmd6.1 . In latest porting sets on unix there is alg6.1 utility also to send message / kill user processes. For NT also similar utilities should be available. Some NT user can correct the position for better.</div></div><hr />

Here is our case info -<br />

Case 952330<br />
Runaway ora8_maint6.2 process<br />
Case description: <br />
Periodically we are finding a ora8_maint6.2 that is using significant CPU resources for &gt; 12 hrs, after which time we kill the process. What is this process and how do we address this.<br />
Solution description: <br />
VERSION(S):<br />
B52_a<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: <br />
ora8_maint6.2<br />
ATTACHMENTS: <br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
Periodically we are finding a ora8_maint6.2 that is using significant CPU resources for &gt; 12 hrs, after which time we kill the process. <br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
Problem did not happen again, and it cannot be reproduced. Will reopen case if the problem shows up again.<br />
<br />
so we tracked the whole problem down to find that during user creations, when we enter a wrong DBA password to create the users in different databases it causes that runaway processes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pnunes</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 11:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your replies, but let me add this ...... The reason of 99% of the runaway processes that I have in my system is perfectly identified. It happens when the user emits by mistake a long report that usually takes 6-8 hours to be prepared by baan. When the user realizes his mistake he easily clicks the &quot;output to console&quot; in the option dialog window. Although he aborts the process and is freed to start again ....this process keeps on running in the windows 2000 SQL platform consuming CPU%. Imagine my situation with over 100 simultaneous users , unable to be 100% certain of which process in the task manager is this one as there is no direct correspondence in between the  dbdriver PID, the ntbshell PID, and of course the Baan user. I would not want to kill the Director's statistical report instead. This is why I will need to know exactly which process in the task manager belongs to each user, so I can &quot;kill&quot; the correct process.<br />

I can understand your problem. I am not SQL person, so cannot tell, how to kill database's session. We are using some Oracle queries/command to determine and kill the processes. The NT resource kit has a utility called 'kill'. You can integrate LICMON and BSHCMD for killing the user/process. I am giving here some already discussed topics/links:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">bshcmd6.1 also kills bshell which are silent. So if the bshell has sumbitted heavy query to database driver , it will not get killed.<br />
<br />
However there must be utilities in NT server process manager to CPU consumption (pid , parent id etc) . And with the parent id u must be able to trace the user. <br />
<br />
However output to console is not the solution.I don't know about NT and the database driver u are working. Somebody experienced in this can shed some light on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I followed one of the above links and eventually found a tool for viewing processes, who started them and when. Then you can kill processes and process trees.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/procexp.shtml<br />
<br />
The tool is called Process Explorer, in case the link above doesn't work properly.<br />
<br />
It doesn't clear the baan licence for that bshell though so you'll have to restart the licence service to do that.</div></div><hr />

       I followed your link and downloaded the Process Explorer. It really works. It is exactly what I was looking for. It is curious how this small &quot;exe&quot; can give out such important information about the processes running on a machine.<br />
Thank you very much,<br />
Paulo :)</div></div><hr />
