We replaced all our client machine with Windows 7 PC/Laptops (previously windows XP).<br />
<br />
Users are not administrators of their PC.<br />
<br />
For some text in Baan, we use the Notepad editor. Existing texts cannot be open anymore, text window does not open when hitting the &quot;Text&quot; button.<br />
<br />
When no text is present, standard Baan Message is displayed (no text present, do you want to Create, copy, select,...) if option create is used session is closed without message.<br />
<br />
The problem does not appear if text is created with the Baan text editor.<br />
<br />
Is someone facing same issue? Any solution ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first step you can try is to give full access to everyone for C:\windows\System32 directory on users machine and try again. May be permissions issue.</div></div><hr />

We just had the same situation when we went to porting set 8.9a.04. We ended up rolling back to 8.9a.03. This was IVc4 sp30 on windows 2008R2/sql 2008 r2 though so may not be relevant at all to your situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">26th August 2015, 04:36</div></div><div class="posttext">It is indeed a 'permissions' issue.<br />
<br />
It is necessary to give full read-write permissions to the folder (for example) c:\Program Files\BAAN\tmp. We did this by assigning the group called &quot;Authenticaled Users&quot; to this folder, and giving that group full permissions. (For us, the BAAN client is 'pushed' out as part of the 'image' when a new computer is set up, so usually, such intervention is required only in rare cases.)<br />
<br />
I am not sure that it will be necessary to change permissions on C:\Windows\System32 to be different from what the administrators decided it to be.</div></div><hr />
