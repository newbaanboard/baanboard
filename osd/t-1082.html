<br />
kill -9 &lt;pid&gt; will kill the process but leave a license unit allocated for the user in licd6.1<br />
<br />
kill -TERM &lt;pid&gt; will kill the process and clear the license.  Well, that sounds like the answer to my question, but...<br />
<br />
If our baan admin comes to me and says there is a user she can't 'kill -TERM' on, will normally kill -9 the oracle Net8 process.  I don't think that's such a good idea.  So I thought of a different option:<br />
<br />
In Oracle, alter system kill session 'sid, serial#'; will work, but is this &quot;safe&quot; under baan?  :eek:  If it is, then I can use alter system for any time we need to wack a user.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can also use the Baan utility alg6.1 to kill users.<br />
<br />
Most of the time we use a 'kill -9 &lt;pid&gt;' to kick out users.<br />

It seems to me that if you do an 'alter system kill session' in Oracle, you will be terminating the bshell's oracle client process rather than the other way around. Based on that I would say that this boils down to a kill -9 for the bshell unless the 'alter system kill session' allows pending transactions to be dealt with correctly.</div></div><hr />

bshcmd6.2<br />
Usage: bshcmd6.2 [options] &lt;bshell_pid&gt;<br />
<br />
-v              : Print version<br />
-p              : Show process list<br />
-m              : Show memory usage<br />
-d &lt;dbglvl&gt;     : Set DEBUG_LEVEL to (octal) &lt;dbglvl&gt;<br />
-k &lt;pid&gt;        : Kill bshell process id &lt;pid&gt;<br />
-e              : Kill all bshell processes<br />
<br />
bshcmd6.2 -k sends the same signal (SIGTERM) as kill -15<br />
<br />
FYI on the proper kill sequence:<br />
<br />
 *be careful how to kill such a Bshell. First try two or three times a<br />
 'kill -2', then a 'kill 15' and only if all else fails, try a 'kill -9'.<br />
 The first two will trigger the Bshell to execute some emergency code that (amongst other things) de-registers itself at the license server. The  'kill -9' does not leave room for de-registering, resulting in a stranded license.<br />
 <br />
In the Reger release, the current license mechanism will be<br />
replaced by the BCLM. In this brand-new license manager are many  mechanisms to clean-up stranded licenses automatically. So if you are using Reger, you will soon get a version that works with the new license manager that will solve the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">25th February 2002, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I experienced that the best way to kill a stranded bshell is<br />
bshcmd6.1 -e -u1 -w1 PID (PID = process id of bshell)<br />
The u1 &quot;wakes up&quot; a sleeping bshell<br />
w1 waits for 1 second<br />
You still may meet bshell-processes &quot;immune&quot; to that way, just keep calm and wait. (My theory is that a large sql-statement has been started, only when this is terminated, bshell regains control and can react to the kill-signal)<br />
I don't know about oracle-subprocesses, but it can be fatal to kill a bisam process via kill -9: you for sure terminate the bshell, but with some &quot;luck&quot; tbase stops completely and you have to restart it with a lot of &quot;checking tables&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course all the above refers to unix OS, I don't have any idea how NT behaves here.<br />

<br />
However, if you are looking at saving licences due to idle users you should have a look into CloseIdle.<br />

Mario <br />
<br />
The process ID is the number behind the username. In your example, 4850 would be the PID for vhaventa's bshell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should you suggest how to kill the processes of a group of users.<br />
The group may be defined by:<br />
The company they are using<br />
Or, their VRCs / Package Combination <br />
Or, their Package in use<br />
Or, their sessions in use<br />

Thank you for help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If &quot;kill -15&quot; does not work, then bshcmd normally also doesn't work anymore.<br />
<br />
Interesting in my experience the following never fails on the client:<br />
<br />
In the bw gui open the optione dialog, <br />
activate &quot;Output to console&quot;<br />
a black window will open,<br />
close this window (X)<br />
The whole gui will terminate gracefully ....<br />
<br />
This seems to work with Baan IV<br />
<br />
We teach all users to use this method, if their GUI hangs. After some time the requests to kill bshells will stop. :-)<br />
