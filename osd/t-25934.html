<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bsyeven</div><div class="date">20th December 2005, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I just spent a couple days trying to figure this one out and figured I'd share the solution here in case it might help anyone else.  There is some sort of bug between Baan (maybe only certain porting sets) and Oracle 9.2.0.6 that causes Baan connection attempts to fail with errors BDB-7413/ORA-6413 &quot;Connection not open&quot;.  I found that if I added oracle_service_name in the db_resource file, the error changed from ORA-6413 to ORA-12154 (TNS could not resolve service name) followed by a BDB-510 (Database not on), however this wasn't much better.  The errors were misleading because there was not really any problem with the database/net configuration and I was able to connect without any errors when using SQL*Plus.  I eventually found the solution on SSA/Baan's support website - solution# 200328, but it was not easy to find because even if you search for ORA-06413, which perfectly matches the body text of the solution, it still doesn't show up in the search results.  Maybe their search engine only searches the &quot;Solution Description&quot; field?  Anyway, in case you have any trouble finding the Baan solution, here is the fix:<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
<br />
To solve this problem the &quot;ipc_info file needs to be changed&quot;<br />
<br />
When you change the Oracle driver line in $BSE/lib/ipc_info from pipes protocol in sockets protocol, the connection works.<br />
This is the used protocol for the traffic between the Baan Database driver an the Bshell.<br />
The change does not influence the performance between the bshell and the driver.<br />
<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE(S):<br />
<br />
ipc_info<br />
<br />
Old line:<br />
<br />
oracle8 s 302 320 p ${BSE}/bin/ora8_srv6.1<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
oracle8 p ${BSE}/bin/ora8_srv6.1<br />
<br />
<br />
Changed line:<br />
<br />
oracle8 s ${BSE}/bin/ora8_srv6.1</div></div><hr />
