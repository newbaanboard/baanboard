let me know if you find any info related. We are considering also NetApp for various reasons</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had 1 20GB company on a slightly outdated NetApp without problems, and with acceptable performance (2-5 concurrent developers).<br />
Tried again on an old one. Nogo, waste of time.<br />

<br />
Anyway, Baan itself is not the issue here, but the underlying database. So anybodym who has a oracle or informix DB running on netapp with a proper number of users, should be a reference.<br />
<br />
I will come back later with the info ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember GE Funuc (may be wrong spelling) in US was running Baan + oracle + Netapp combination. Netapp must have removed the story from their website.</div></div><hr />

    We have been successfully running Baan and database on NAS boxes without any problems.</div></div><hr />

Is this in your production environment and with how many concurrent users?<br />
<br />
Also, what model of NetApp are you using and your disk storage capacity?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Cindy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trchandra</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Cindy,<br />
   We have our baan production environment on these netApp storage devices and we have around 300 concurrent baan users connected to these boxes.  The space on these boxes is around 1.2 Terrabyte and the version is 820C.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A couple more questions:  What Baan modules are you running, what is the number of I/0's , and what is your % of disk utilization. <br />
<br />
Also, do you have a contact number I can reach you at?  If you are open to it, I'd like to set up a quick conference call with you and a couple of the technical architecture guys I work with.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Cindy</div></div><hr />

   We are running entire baan on netApp and we have already used 60GB.  Infact this whole setup was done by SSA Baan Consulting and I suggest you to contact SSA for further detail approach for your implementation.  Can you also fill your user details like version of baan, database and location etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry to say the information about the company in the UK is lost in time. But as I see you got some good replies here on the board.<br />
<br />

Be careful on this one...<br />
<br />
Fanuc Robotics in Michigan is the company that was referenced above.  They were running with a Solaris/Oracle environment with NetApp.  No more.<br />
<br />
Another company in Ohio had a NetApp with Oracle, pulled it out.<br />
<br />
We were asked by SSA Services to work with the company in San Diego and we did get it to work and now Oracle on NetApp is a much better solution.  That company is running with MS Cluster on Windows using the NetApp for the shared storage in an Oracle database environment.<br />
<br />
What platform are you running?    I would not recommend the use of the NetApp in high IO or multiple database environments.  In smaller implementations I believe it is fine.  <br />
<br />
NetApp is an excellent solution for a shared BSE directory.  It works much better than NFS on standard hosts or most other file sharing options and the benefits of a single BSE on shared storage is much better than trying to replicate a common BSE between independent copies.<br />
<br />
