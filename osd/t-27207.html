<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
WeÂ’re running BaanIVc4 using the level 2 driver with MS SQL Server 2000.<br />
We've been noticing that in some sessions the performance was degrading abnormally.<br />
We did a little survey and found this strange behavior:<br />
When running the session tdsls3200m000 using the SQL Server Profiler we notice that function tfacr005 in a tfacr200 query the system was querying the data using the index 7 and in the script the query was wrote using index 2.<br />
This was even stranger because the optimizer was turned off and running the query in the sql server against the optimizer it suggests the use of index 9.<br />
Then we turned the optimizer on in Baan (adding NOIDXHINT in the sqlstorage file) and the problem got weirder because Baan kept querying the data using index 7 although the script stated index 2 and the optimizer suggestion was index 9.<br />
We did the tests with porting sets 6.1c.07.07 and 6.1c.07.10.<br />
Does anyone have an explanation for this?<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 21:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally it was like this:<br />
select tfacr200.balc, tfacr200.dued from tfacr200	<br />
where	tfacr200._compnr = :tfgld001.ncmp<br />
and	tfacr200._index2 <br />
inrange { :tmp.cuno, :min.ttyp, :min.ninv, :min.line, &quot;&quot;, :min.docn, :min.lino }<br />
  and { :tmp.cuno, :max.ttyp, :max.ninv, :max.line, &quot;&quot;, :max.docn, :max.lino }<br />
and	tfacr200.dued &lt;= :tmp.date  and	tfacr200.balc &gt; 0.001	<br />
as set with 1 rows<br />
<br />
I changed it to:<br />
select tfacr200.cuno, tfacr200.balc, tfacr200.dued from tfacr200	<br />
where	tfacr200._compnr = :tfgld001.ncmp<br />
and	tfacr200._index2 = {:tmp.cuno}<br />
and tfacr200.tdoc = &quot;&quot; <br />
and	tfacr200.dued &lt;= :tmp.date  and tfacr200.balc &gt; 0.001	<br />
as set with 1 rows<br />
<br />
and it got a little better but the index problem remained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">25th May 2006, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">ok - a couple of things.<br />
<br />
When you use _index2 in a selectivity statement, you're using shorthand, you're not specificing what index to use.<br />
<br />
The only way to Force an index in Baan IV 4GL is to do an &quot;order by &lt;index name&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
also, it looks like indexes 7 and up are custom, what columns do they include?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. We changed the select clause and added the order by statement and it worked fine.<br />
The indexes 9 to 13 are from the portuguese localizations. The index 7 is dued, cuno, index1 and 9 is cuno, dued, index1.<br />
What's the point of putting indexx in a where clause? As far as I can tell the programmer has no control on this? <br />
What is the purpose of NOIDXHINT statement in the sql_storage file? As far as I can tell it has absolutely no effect on queries.<br />
I wonder now how many selects are like these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad it worked!<br />
<br />
the index in the where clause is just a shorthand (i want to match all of the columns in this index...) it's the same as doing<br />
table.cuno = a<br />
table.sern = b<br />
and so on..<br />
<br />
You may be formatting your mssql_storage incorrectly, those files are very picky, and if you've got an extra space or a colon or comma in the wrong spot it might not fly.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it may be a bug - call support! =)</div></div><hr />
