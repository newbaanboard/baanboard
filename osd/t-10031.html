<br />
 Your vision is good, Technical person should think on it for better service to their organisation. You should take this as a implementaion part, probably if the OS is NT.  You can move to &quot;Disaster Recovery Plan&quot;. I faced this problem, so can give some inputs to you.<br />
 If your database and application is on same server, think to separate it, this will minimize the problems.<br />
 If you have resources why not make the whole environment highly available by seting up a STANDBY Database, I am not informix person, I don't know more on informix.<br />
 Make frequently ERD.<br />
 Imagine if the server crashed, you have to follow the following steps:<br />
 1. Fresh installation of NT (Format disks/RAID configuration is different issue)<br />
 2. Installation of NT SP.<br />
 3. Create users.<br />
 4. Installation of Informix.<br />
 5. Update last backup data or recover database upto last event.<br />
 6. Install BaaN<br />
 7. Revalidate it. (After lot of contacts to support)<br />
 8. Install SP (11 SPs in your case)<br />
 9. Install Porting Set<br />
 10. Set Environment Variables<br />
 11. Import company specific customizations, etc.<br />
<br />
 This may take 2-3 whole days. <br />
 One more way to avoid above steps is to use HP with OBDR (One Button Disaster Recovery) tape drive. I am using this from last 2 years, since no issue. And I have recovered two times entire OS. The only limitation is, you have to stop all the services.<br />
Thats it.<br />

- restoring back the Baan directories<br />
- re-installing the portingset to re-create the registry entries<br />
- relicense it</div></div><hr />

<br />
I surely agree that it would have been much better senerio in case where my application &amp; database r on diff. servers, but unfortunately because of certain resource constraints we cannot go ahead with it.<br />
<br />
Yaah i have already taken Baan, Win NT Registry as well as informix directory backup on DLT tape.<br />
<br />
Although i took Win NT , but while doing so it said some of the files could not be copied because &quot;files r in use&quot;, even closing many services<br />
<br />
i took all this backup using backup utility of Win NT.<br />
is there any other way to take NT backup ?<br />
<br />
and one more doubt i have in mind , right now my o/s NT is having services pack up to 4 , as it is advisable to have latest services pack installed (i think 6), if i install it and the server doesn't start or start with that blue screen (page fault) then what should i do ?<br />
<br />
any precuations i should take before installing these O/S service packs ? 1 is ERD and any other thing also to be done ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />
