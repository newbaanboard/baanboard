<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">30th January 2002, 22:42</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a case where a special Oracle user outside of the baan Oracle group is granted access to specific Baan tables in Oracle.  If a Baan reconfigure is preformed on any of those tables, the Oracle user outside of the baan group loses access to the reconfigured tables.<br />
<br />
Is there a simple way to ensure that the special Oracle user is also regranted access to these Baan tables like how Baan users are?</div></div><hr />

<br />
During a table reconfigure/reorganise, the table is dropped and recreated.  Thus Oracle specific table grants for the user will be lost in the process.<br />
<br />
You could make the user a member of the 'Baan' schema within Oracle - like all the other Baan users.<br />
<br />
Problem then is that the user will have access to all Oracle tables.  This maybe slightly dangerous from a security point of view.<br />
<br />
Of course, you could run a simple SQL script after each reorganise to regrant the lost authorisations.  If you use Unix scripts for the reorgs then this is much simpler.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best practice is to create a role and assign the authorizations over the Baan tables to the role.<br />
<br />
Grant the role to the user(s).<br />
<br />
This way you only have to re-grant the authorizations to the role after a Baan table reorganization which you can do with a simple sql script.<br />
<br />

The advantage here is that Baan will remove/add grants from the 'r_baan' appropriately. The disadvantage is level of granularity: it is either all tables from all companies or none.<br />
<br />
This is what James what hinting at in his reply but it might not have been 100% clear.</div></div><hr />
