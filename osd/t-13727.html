<br />
I plan to create a Oracle 9.2.0.4 database for Baan IVc4<br />
to run on. When running Database configuration assistant:<br />
If on the database features you select the standard database features tab:<br />
A window comes up with the following Quote:<br />
&quot;Select the standard database features you want to configure for use in your database. Oracle Corporation recommends that you install these features in your database.&quot;<br />
Oracle JVM<br />
Oracle Intermedia<br />
Oracle Text<br />
Oracle XML DB<br />
My question:<br />
1) Do I need to install any/all these features for BaanIVc4?<br />
<br />
Thanx Patrick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">26th November 2003, 09:44</div></div><div class="posttext">No. None of these are needed for Baan. Baan uses the lean and clean database.<br />
<br />

<br />
some people say, Baan is using oracle as a &quot;data graveyard&quot;, meaning, Baan will store the data in oralce, but is using none of it's advanced features.<br />
<br />
So the simple answer is: None of the features you listed, will be needed. <br />
<br />
If you plan to access the Baan data at a later stage from inside oracle (ie. stored procedures written in java), then I would be tempted to install the JVM. On the other hand, installing an oracle patchset was complicated, when you had the JVM installed. <br />
<br />
Hope, it helped,<br />
<br />
enjoy<br />

<br />
This will make upgrades more simple and<br />
use less memory (No java pools etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">26th November 2003, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">You will keep a java_pool_size as the default is 20000. And the minimum value to set is 1.000.000... This sounds weird, but that is what Oracle Metalink says about it. To find out the actually used number of bytes use:<br />
<br />
SELECT pool, name, bytes<br />
FROM v$sgastat<br />
WHERE pool = 'java pool';<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patrickmonks</div><div class="date">26th November 2003, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">One more question.<br />
Why would one purchase Oracle Enterprise edition <br />
when Baan does not use any of the Enterprise edition<br />
features?<br />
<br />
The only reason I can find, is if you have more than 4 CPU's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">26th November 2003, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing is clear, baan runs perfectly fine (meaning without errors) on a personal edition. I tried that in test environments.<br />
<br />
I think at least a long time ago, Baan would only support the product on oralce, if oracle was enterprise edition.  That might not be the case anymore.<br />
<br />
I think it is more a licensing and support issue, then anything else.<br />
<br />
I am even sceptical about the 4 CPU limit. This again sounds like a licencing issue.  Oracle can not prevent it's user processes from using all X CPU (with X&gt;4) anyway. The same goes for the bshell and oralce driver processes, which take a lot of load.<br />
<br />
has anybody any experience here?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">26th November 2003, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed it is all about money. Oracle EE are much more expensive, but you have to buy them at the moment you buy a box with more than 1 or 2 CPU's. Baan connects the same, so from Baan point it doesn't matter. Ok, some issues are not supported for versions less than EE. But for test enviornments this doesn't differ always.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

One reason could be the need to use RMAN and its 3rd party interface modules for backing up and restoring your  databases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that is a very good reason but not needed for running Baan. So, my answer was purely related if running on a simple Oracle environment was possible. But for backup and (many) other good reasons EE is the only solution.<br />
