   We are trying to upgrade our oracle database 8.0.4 to 10g.  We are currently on the following versions...<br />
<br />
Baan ERP : 5b (service pack 7) - For some reason, we have stopped applying service packs due to heavy customizations (Decision was made before I joined)<br />
<br />
Porting Set : 6.2a.03.02<br />
<br />
Database : 8.0.4 (level 1)<br />
<br />
Operating System : HP-UX 11.0<br />
<br />
Also we are using BCK for our web frontend<br />
<br />
objective<br />
We want to upgrade only backend (server os, portingset and database) without applying any application level patches or service packs) to avoid/minimize any changes in the current functionality.  Also part of the upgrade, we want to upgrade to level 2 driver.<br />
<br />
<br />
We got a sandbox and we restored our current environment using ignite and baan, database is configured to work.  We just upgraded OS to 11.11 and environment seems to be working without any issues.  The following are the questions that I would like to get suggestions/answers from our experts...<br />
<br />
1.  What is the best portingset that we can upgrade to support oracle 10g and at the same time has support for bshellxma (BCK)?  What is the process for upgrading to level 2 driver.<br />
<br />
2.  What is the best approach to complete this upgrade?  Our database size is around 600GB and we are using HITACHI SAN.<br />
<br />
Any help/suggestion is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards</div></div><hr />
