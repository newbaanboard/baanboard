This seems to be the same problem as in Oracle 9.2.0.6.<br />
So the bug is still not solved...<br />
<br />
If You change the BaaN Oracle driver from pipes to sockets protocol it does work again. But I don't know if this is bad for the performance...?<br />

<br />
Who knows?</div></div><hr />

that 10g is really 10.1 (with 10.2 support coming soon) 9.1 was very buggy<br />
as i suspect 10.1 is as well..<br />
<br />
Enterprise vs Standard has been discussed many times on the board - do a search.. <br />
<br />
IBM makes Informix and DB2 for AIX, either are fine options with Baan.. however I like DB2. It's smaller, faster and cheaper.<br />

Benchmarks showed hardly difference between these 2. In the past there was a bigger difference between these. Now this gap has become much smaller. In some cases hardly noticable.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
