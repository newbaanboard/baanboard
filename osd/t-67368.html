As I understand it, Baan does not actually write to the Oracle tables. This is done through a separate porting program, excuse my syntax if that's not correct. A development project we're working on has us writing to some tables that the Baan user's created. I use C# code to handle this. That works well with the following exception. If the table has 38 columns, we have to write to each and every column. No null entries are allowed. Of course using parameterized insert statements in our code one has to be very careful to get all 38 fields filled in properly. Typically, I write to Oracle, MySQL tables and just use the minimum number of columns and let the others default to null or whatever. The Baan programmers tell me there is nothing they can do about this and if so, we'll just keep filling in all columns as needed. But I was hoping someone knew of a way to allow less coding in my insert statements. For example, in this one table, I really only need to provide it with 8 or 9 columns so filling out all 38 of them is a major chore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might need to do a bit integration with Baan programming language. Basically, the idea will be to pass values to a baan program, it will insert the required values and will keep the other things as default.<br />

But, if you are directly hitting the table, you need to do what you have been doing since baan doesn't come into picture.</div></div><hr />
