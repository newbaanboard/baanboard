<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">10th August 2002, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Try putting the file name between single quotes:<br />
rm '-0'<br />
<br />
Another option you have is to move all other files out of that directory, then remove that directory including the file, recreate the directory and move the other files back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">10th August 2002, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I remembered correctly by thinking this is a question that comes up in the official UNIX FAQ (http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/):<br />
<br />
2.1)  How do I remove a file whose name begins with a &quot;-&quot; ?<br />
<br />
      Figure out some way to name the file so that it doesn't begin<br />
      with a dash.  The simplest answer is to use<br />
<br />
            rm ./-filename<br />
<br />
      (assuming &quot;-filename&quot; is in the current directory, of course.)<br />
      This method of avoiding the interpretation of the &quot;-&quot; works with<br />
      other commands too.<br />
<br />
      Many commands, particularly those that have been written to use<br />
      the &quot;getopt(3)&quot; argument parsing routine, accept a &quot;--&quot; argument<br />
      which means &quot;this is the last option, anything after this is not<br />
      an option&quot;, so your version of rm might handle &quot;rm -- -filename&quot;.<br />
      Some versions of rm that don't use getopt() treat a single &quot;-&quot;<br />
      in the same way, so you can also try &quot;rm - -filename&quot;.</div></div><hr />
