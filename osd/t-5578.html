<br />
We have to migrate the baanc3 to baanc4.<br />
<br />
We have two option with us.<br />
Option1.<br />
Run upgrade on the baanc3<br />
<br />
Option2.<br />
Install Baanc4  new and export and import all the VRC from old environment to the new environment,create PC,companies and connect the database to the baanc3data.<br />
<br />
Which option is best and Is there any steps to be taken before hand to do migration?<br />
<br />
Also upto which SP level we can safely apply?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for all the help.<br />
<br />
thanks again<br />

Installation of C4 on top on c2 was eliminated due to the number of VRC that should then be present.<br />
<br />
We have already done repetition for migration and found that we can do it in 12 hours using unix script to load baanbBinairies on the tables that have been changed (bdbreconfig6.1 and refint61.).<br />
<br />
We have only found 2 problems:<br />
a) table tfgld419 has a new field in the primary index  and contains much records.<br />
b) table tdpsc040 has a new primary key and can not be migrated automatically<br />

<br />
Thanks for the information.<br />
When you go with new installation of C4 and import all VRC' from old one. Will it mean 000'company data required from old setup or can we ignore those data?<br />
I mean user management,text,device,job management creation is enough for a migration in a fresh environment.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for all information.<br />

<br />
Company 000 must come from the c4 environnment.<br />
You need to import the following tables from c3:<br />
tttaad420000 (logical tables)<br />
tttaad010000 (companies)<br />
tttaad200000 (user)<br />
tttaad201000 (remote user)<br />
tttaad210-ttaadd230 (authorizations)<br />
tttaad300000 (devices)<br />
etc...<br />
<br />

<br />
I am also busy with a c3 to c4 migration.<br />
Would appreciate it, if you could email me any docs on this .<br />
<br />
Cheers and good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">25th July 2002, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I don't have documentation, but I can give you some information;<br />
<br />
I'm busy with the data migration. So the migration of specifcc development is done by a nother team.<br />
<br />
I'm working with UNIX and for the data migration the different steps are:<br />
<br />
1)if you have modified standard baan tables in c3 redo the same in c4<br />
2) copy new tables and new domains structure from c3 to c4<br />
3)redo in c4  domain modifications done in c3<br />
<br />
4) create a temporary package combination in c4 (ex TMPC2)and create a runtime DD for this <br />
<br />
5) copy the data dictionnary from c3 in the library (ex $BSE/dict/ddTMPC2)==&gt; after this don't a create DD on this package combination<br />
<br />
6)create the companies (linked with TMPC2)<br />
<br />
7)copy tables from c3 to these environment (don't forgot to define the logical tables if you use it) <br />
<br />
8)migrate date by change package combination for companies (long) or find all differences in the dictionnaries (between TMPC2 and the new c4 DD)and create scripts to reconfigure the tables via bdbreconfig6.1. Therefor you need to copy the modified tables and domains from the c4 dd to TMPC2 with the extension .new <br />
EX &quot;cp $BSE/dict/ddNEWC4/dtdsls/dtdsls040 $BSE/dict/ddTMPC2/dtdsls/dtdsls040.new&quot;<br />
<br />
In Unix I have create scripts that do all this automatically  <br />
<br />
9) do a test migration and control the data<br />
<br />
10) redo all above and retry until all is correct and then do the real migration. We needed three redo before all was correct (Estimated time 2-6 months depending of your tables size)<br />
<br />

<br />
We are planning to upgrade from IVc2 to IVc4ags0 in 2 steps. In first step we are planning to migrate to IVc4(suppy chain version) and then to IVc4ags0.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your detailed steps in migrating C2 to C4. Has Baan given any correction programs for migrating? If I have any questions, can I contact you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">30th July 2002, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
1) Baan say that there are no conversion needed. (but tdpsc040 key structure has changed so drasticaly that migration of data is not possible)<br />
<br />
2) I never worked with ags0 (specific USA ?) So I can't give any explanation. But the procedure that we used should be applicable for your case . Be sure to include all new/modification tables for ags0.<br />
<br />
3) I check this site every week, so if you have questions ask it here. My mail address is p.conde@creurope.be but i'm outside my company so I can only read my mail at the week end <br />
<br />
Regards:)</div></div><hr />
