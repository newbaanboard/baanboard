<br />
Some of the Baan tables are having corrupted data /garbge in tables. Due to this we are facing lot many problem in generating reports.<br />
<br />
I had already send the var/adm messages file to our h/w Maintainance contractor for h/w problem if any.<br />
<br />
Is there any method in tbase6.1 thru which I can check database consistancy.<br />
<br />
Help<br />

You could use tbase6.1 B fvr &lt;table name&gt;<br />
<br />
Another option would be to use bdbpre6.1 -r ... to try to recover the ISAM table (bypass indexes while dumping) and then posting it again with bdbpost6.1 -k -m -n -i -f ..., followed by refint6.1 -r -s ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
migrate to a real database!<br />
<br />
tbase is conceptionally flawed, here some examples:<br />
<br />
a) tbase does not honour transactions, so if a session aborts, part of an update will be done and some part not. The longer you work, the more likely you get inconsistant data in Baan.<br />
<br />
b) tbase has a locking problem, locks seem to hang.<br />
<br />
c) tbase is not actually deleting records, but only marks them as read. As a consequence a table is growing, even though you might delete now and then it's entries. Additionally in my experience due to some bug &quot;deleted&quot; records might appear again.<br />
<br />
Forget about the hazzle and change to Oracle/Informix/DB2 or anything.<br />
<br />
Sorry,<br />

Yes we had thought about the same but due to tasks that are comming up in the queue we are unable for the same.<br />
<br />
1. Few months back we had migrated to Baan IVc4  for fin integration purpose.<br />
<br />
2. Now Solaris we want to upgrade to 2.8 or higher.<br />
<br />
3. From Next month our Finance integration is going to start and we have only one server to do these things.  So we kept migration of database  as second priority.  Our preferable Database will be Oracle.<br />

Thanks once Again.<br />
