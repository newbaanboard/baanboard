I'm talking about default operating system services besides the Baan services used like the licensing service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">18th April 2002, 10:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting question. <br />
<br />
As far as I am aware Baan should run as long as the required Baan services and the database services are up and running with no other requirements (apart from those required by the OS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">18th April 2002, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I never come across any list of services because I think that Baan only uses what NT has availble for it, like, if you do not have &quot;Distributed Link tracking Client&quot; you will not be able to access NTFS filesystems on other systems, but this is transparent to Baan.<br />
<br />
The only one I can think, that Baan relies on, is the &quot;Event Log&quot; service, since Baan relies on this one to log its messages.<br />
<br />
All the others may be or not used (you can discard a lot of the network services because you can have Baan on a local workstation, not connected to a network; discard the Print Spooler if not using printers, etc.).<br />
As long as the minimum OS services are running (plus the database ones), you should be able to install and work with Baan.</div></div><hr />
