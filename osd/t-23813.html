<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th April 2005, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read several posts here and on the Baan support web site.  I think I read too much and have confused myself.  Is Baan actually certified to run on Oracle 9i?  That is the first question my DBA's asked me.  Is it also true that Baan still uses the 8i driver for 9i?  It seems the tuning and configuring is much more important for 9i for performance reasons.  So the last and final question - any thoughts on upgrading? For or against.  Any/all responses are welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes - Baan is certified on Oracle 9i (and 10g) [ Sol 163684 ]<br />
<br />
Yes there is only 1 driver, it's been modified to work with 8i, 9i and 10g. <br />
<br />
I think that tuning is always important, remember the jump between 7 and 8?<br />
Baan's just making the point (and effort) to give some hints in that area this time around. <br />
<br />
I think 9i is a great release.. tuned right, and using the right bells and whistles (LMT, UndoTbs, Automatic PGA) it's made my life a whole lot easier. <br />
<br />
Of course, given the choice, I still like Oracle 7 =)<br />

Additionally you do not really have a choice. Oracle 8i is allready desupported and so you will need to move on anyway. Naturally you can take the stand, that this is not an issue for you, but then I would downgrade to Oracle7 (also like Dave).</div></div><hr />

By 2007+, the Oracle-9i will be desupported too, better to plan to migrated to Oracle-10g (as long as you have a porting set which gives you compatibility) and also depends on the size of the database. Oracle-10g needs HP-UX-11i as prerequisite, I am not sure of the Solaris version requirement.</div></div><hr />
