Anybody facing problems with BaanIVc4 on Oracle9.2?<br />
We are using automatic undo management and still getting errors. We try to solve this by setting undo_retention to higher value. Information in Metalink is quite confusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">27th May 2004, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, its unfortunatly still possible.. remember your undo retention needs to be set to a time long enough to hold the transaction..<br />
if its a very large time, check with Baan support to see if they<br />
can optimize the session. Sometimes they can break transactions into smaller chunks to help with this.<br />

<br />
in my understanding, if your undo_retention is long enough to hold your transaction and you still get the error, than this must mean, that your undo talblespace is too small. <br />
<br />
Can you check this?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">1st June 2004, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Since 9i the possibility to get an ORA-1555 is less compared to previous versions. But still this is possible due to:<br />
- an undo tablespace that is too small or<br />
- an application that keeps a cursor open for a too long time.<br />
<br />
The last issue can be solved by:<br />
- add an &quot;as prepared set&quot; to the main 4 GL query when this query has no &quot;for update&quot; clause.<br />
- break the main query after processing e.g. 10.000 rows if the main query has a &quot;for update&quot; clause and restart the main query after these 10.000 rows. An example of the latest could be:<br />
completed = false<br />
repeat<br />
	db.retry.point()<br />
	counter = 0<br />
	select	*<br />
	from	&lt;table&gt; for update<br />
	|* Read from previous point onwards<br />
	where	table._index1 &gt; {:hold.field1}<br />
	|* Sort by on index to prevent problems<br />
	order 	by table._index1 with retry repeat last row<br />
	|* Speed up transfer of data<br />
	hint use array fetching<br />
	and buffer 100 rows<br />
	and array size 100<br />
	selectdo<br />
		update.other.tables()<br />
		|* Commit once a 50 rows<br />
		counter = counter + 1<br />
		if counter\50 = 0 then<br />
			commit.transaction()<br />
		|* When  query is open longer than 10.000<br />
		|* records, than restart query<br />
			if counter &gt;= 10000 then<br />
				|* Set all index 1 fields<br />
				hold.field1 = table.field1<br />
				break<br />
			endif<br />
		endif<br />
	selectempty<br />
		completed = true<br />
	selecteos<br />
		commit.transaction()<br />
		completed = true<br />
	endselect<br />
|* Only complete when complete flag has been set<br />
until completed<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">makiju</div><div class="date">1st June 2004, 11:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I was surprised that Oracle uses Rollback for reading because of  read consistency. We had 1555 when generating export file using export schema.<br />
So this might mean that this query got overwritten by another session before query end. I changed undo_retention to 4800 and now it seems to work. Of course tablespace area is also enlarged.<br />
So, &quot;as prepared set&quot; is not a solution for these kind of things.</div></div><hr />
