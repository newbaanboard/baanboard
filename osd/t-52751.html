<br />
While trying to start VI editor from baan application (by using Run program option and running ksh -o vi) VI editor is not getting opened.<br />
<br />
We have application scripts which use &quot;shell&quot; command to execute some Unix commands and perform the necessary steps at the OS level.<br />
<br />
This is causing application job failures on the new application server.<br />
<br />
Please help in this regards</div></div><hr />

In the script wherever we use the shell() function, it hangs. We have migratied the application from one server to another and it was file system level migration. We are not able to find out what is the change in the new server which is stopping us use of shell() function.<br />

<br />
About the Shell() function:<br />
This function is supported for backward compatibility only. In new applications, use run.prog() and run.baan.prog() instead.<br />
<br />
The function is available only for programs running under UNIX, and not for programs running under Windows NT.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leon Stone</div><div class="date">17th June 2008, 08:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using BAAN 5.0B version and it is running under HP-UX 11.11.  We made a copy of our current system and restored it on to a new Unix server.   <br />
The shell() command stopped working on the new Unix server.  I believe run.prog() works fine on the new server.  <br />
<br />
Here are our questions:<br />
<br />
(1) What system parameters or settings we need to set in order to run the Shell() command correctly?<br />
(2) What is the difference between run.prog() and Shell()?<br />
(3) When did BAAN make the switch from Shell() to run.prog()?  In our 5.0B version, we can still see a mixture of Shell() and run.prog().  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />
Leon</div></div><hr />
