<br />
In the company we have the project of implementing Baan on Linux with Oracle 9i (currently running on HP-UX).<br />
<br />
We want to start testing this environment and we have available an HP 9000 rp4440 server with PA-RIC processor for this test.<br />
<br />
First question: Does anyone have Linux on PA-RiSC processors?..What linux distribution?<br />
<br />
Second question: Does anyone have Baan c4 IV on Linux?... Can you share your experience?.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much, any response will be appreciated</div></div><hr />

For Linux on PA-RISC architecture, please refer to the PARISC-Linux (http://www.parisc-linux.org/) website.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Linux is officially supported from Infor for  the following distributions:<br />
<br />
x86 Suse Linux SLES /RedHat 3764 <br />
<br />
We have running BaanIV and ERPLn with Oracle9i on SLES9 since some years and are very satisfied with stability and performance. Hardware is HP Proliant ML570.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we are running Baan c4 (tbase) with Suse SLS8 since october 2004.<br />
We were nonplused how easy the porting went. <br />
Users called us &quot;that the system was broke&quot; and &quot;obviously doing nothing&quot;  - response times had decreased enormously.<br />
<br />
From our experiences: better port today than tomorrow :-)<br />
<br />

<br />
I have a license of Red Hat Enterprise AS 2.1, do you think it´s neccesary to upgrade to Red Ht Ent AS 5 ?<br />
<br />
I would Install Orace 9.i and Baan IV c4<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

That document describes which versions of the OS and/or RDBMS is supported.<br />

Please note that Oracle9 is no longer supported .....<br />

This year we have moved from hp9000/unix to intel/red hat (ES 4.5)  (Dell Poweredge 2950) without problems and a great performance improvement.<br />
<br />
Also moved from Oracle 9i to Oracle 10g R2. We also cut down the maintenenace cost from our servers.<br />
<br />
The ugly part: To start the migration the review and instalation of all the RPM's of Red Hats was a nigthmare, it took us 3 days to have the environment ready to migrate the production environment and the database.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

I read your document and I find it very usefull.<br />
<br />
I have some questions...<br />
<br />
You mention you installed RHEL version 4.5 (although document says RedHat v1.1) .<br />
<br />
I installed lastest version 5.4 and comparing the installed rpm´s with the document I find that most of them have a higher version than document´s.<br />
<br />
for example:<br />
<br />
Document : gcc-4.1.1-52.el5<br />
My RedHat: gcc-4.1.2-46.el5<br />
<br />
Document : glibc-common-2.5-12<br />
My RedHat: glibc-common-2.5-42 (x86_64)<br />
<br />
And as these ones, they are many with the same case.<br />
<br />
Do you think I can consider these rpm´s are done?<br />
<br />
And something else I noticed is that I don´t have none of the rpm´s that end with .rpm ... do you know what exactly are they?<br />
<br />
Thank you <br />
<br />
Sergio</div></div><hr />

Yes the RH version on my install is 4.5 ES, the version 1.1 refers to the document version.<br />
<br />
The rpm extension is a typo error. I mean, the extension of all the rpm´s packages is rpm. But when you query the packages you will see only the filenames without rpm extension.<br />
<br />
If you reviewed the metalink note, you will notice that that version is the sufficent but not necesary. This mean, if you have a higher version you can try to continue, but in my experience, specially with the C++ compliler libreries, that version its a must.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
