<br />
I am providing oracle home as it as &quot;\\server_name/server_directory_path/product/11/home&quot;<br />
<br />
and for service name, I am giving a new name as &quot;baan&quot;<br />
<br />
On next screen, asking password for database group, I have created baan user on the DB server, supplying same password for that.<br />
<br />
Asking system password, no idea about it as I did not provided any password during installing DB, any dafaults?<br />
<br />
Asking baan password, showing user as baan, providing password as baan.<br />
<br />
But it is giving error as &quot;Unable to connect to database server&quot;<br />
&quot;Oracle home&quot;.........does not exist.<br />
<br />
What exactly could be the problem...<br />
<br />
Wrong oracle home?<br />
Wrong passwords supplied?<br />
<br />
Please suggest.<br />

&quot;server_directory_path/product/11/home&quot;<br />
is the ORACLE_HOME on that server.<br />
<br />
That's incorrect.<br />
<br />
You need to do an Oracle CLIENT install on your Baan server, get TNS working, and then install baan and point it's ORACLE_HOME to the Client Install.<br />

<br />
I got it, I have installed client and I am creating a network service now.<br />
But m stuck now here, I filled in all required information in the service creation ie hostname, port, sid etc but when I test, it is giving an error.<br />
<br />
I tried changing login and tested the connection with sys user but getting same error.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Attempting to connect using userid:  sys<br />
The test did not succeed.<br />
ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied&quot;<br />
<br />
I checked tnsping which is successful that means database communication is OK.<br />
<br />
What are things I need to do at Oracle server level?<br />
Please provide any document etc for the same.<br />
<br />

can you connect to the db server as &quot;system&quot; via sqlplus?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right DAVE, I tried through system, I can not connect through system.<br />
I can not connect with system login in sql plus also.<br />
<br />
What could be the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
or just create a superuser login for yourself and handle stuff that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fine, I logged through sys and reseted the system login.<br />
Working OK now.<br />
<br />
Service is ok, the Oracle home path used is of client's home path.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help. :)<br />
