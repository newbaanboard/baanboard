At present we run baanIV4 with a porting set 6.1c13 on RHEL 5.11 with Oracle11g. The end point is to migrate the system to RHEL 8 with oracle 19c keeping baanIV4 intact. This has been tried before I took the job and was thought to have failed at the UAT level. Now question is :<br />
1. What are the technical constrains expected.<br />
2. Can this system be migrated to vm.<br />
3. Any technical flags  or no go areas.<br />
4. Any advise as regards expectations.<br />
Team is of the opinion of an impossible task, I think its doable but not painless.<br />
Please advise, any information will be appreciated. Thanks.:confused:</div></div><hr />

You will need a portingset that supports the combination of RHEL 8/Oracle 19c.  That will likely require you to use SLM for licensing (if you're not already).  If you're not using SLM, there are usually a few solutions that need to be installed to support that (depending on if you've kept solutions up to date, which isn't likely based on my experience in Baan IV environments).  You will also need to look at any integrated/3rd party products and make sure they're portable to the new plaftform.<br />
<br />
2. Yes, this should be able to run on VM.<br />
<br />
3. Need to make sure you have the expertise for the database upgrade.  Any Unix scripts you have written should be validated, although since you're staying on RHEL, I wouldn't expect issues.  Make sure you address migrating devices and jobs/cron.<br />
<br />
4.  Execute full-cycle testing - not just technical testing.  Make sure all processes work and there are no unexpected results.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th May 2023, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I know we were running on Oracle 19c on Solaris and using Solaris VM's(or what everthey call it) - can't say about RHEL.  All I know is we had more outages because of issues with the parent versus the baan system(only talking a few outages with hardware issues, nothing major I recall).<br />
<br />
To get to 19c we were told we had to upgrade the porting set(I was not part of that discussion so not sure about it)  - but that broke our billable cost records session.  At this point I am not sure what version we were on and what we went to - I am not sure we needed the portingset upgrade.   The only session I know with an issue was the billable cost reports session we use for forward pricing rates.  The only real update session we still needed - system is basically read only for everything but that financial piece.<br />
<br />
 In debugging the issue with baan they had us update the porting set again and you can see what happened here http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=73830.  Caused all kinds of issues and the solution works but is not really supported by infor.<br />
<br />
So why the update Oracle? Yeah end of life but if it works...  Can't you just move it to RHEL VM?  I think what you are suggesting will work - and it might even go easier.  If I was doing it I would probably just get current version running on the VM's.  Then try the 19c upgrade - see if anything broke.  I don't recall us trying that - just doing a porting set and oracle 19c upgrade - which started all our issues.</div></div><hr />
