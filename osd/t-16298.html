<br />
We are thinking of shifting to other database as not much maningful support is available for Informix. But before that would like to have some views / advice from other users.<br />
<br />
Is it advisable to move to MS SQL Server ?<br />
<br />
We are on BAAN C4, Windows 2000 and IDS 9.21 with 70 GB of data size. We expect the data size to increase by another 20 GB in next one year.<br />
<br />
What is the comparision between the following 3 databases with respect to Baan C4<br />
1) Informix<br />
2) MS SQL<br />
3) Oracle<br />
<br />

level 2 driver, that would make it plenty scaleable for your size database.<br />
<br />
Don't forget db2! it DOES have support and you might get a discount<br />
being an informix customer looking to migrate.. Plus it has a level 2 driver as well, its small, simple and fast!<br />
<br />
I'm an oracle guy myself, and I don't particularly like Oracle on Windows, its never been quite there in my opionion. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">17th August 2004, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">On what level you want comparison?<br />
- Performance? <br />
- Price?<br />
- Scalability?<br />
- Marketing?<br />
- Integrations?<br />
- Future?<br />
<br />
70Gb can run on all databases, but maybe you have something particular that makes the choice easier in one or another direction.<br />
<br />
For what reasons do you want to move away from Informix?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vineetu1</div><div class="date">18th August 2004, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">It is primarily based on price / performance and finally on ease of use and ofcourse reliability.<br />
<br />
But all views are open with me.<br />
<br />
Is there any particular virus related issue with MS SQL as it is a Microsoft product. What about reliability of the database.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have worked on all the databases listed above except db2. In my opinion Ms - Sql Server is the easiest to use , cost wise also it is cheaper, some people prefer Oracle because of level2, but now i belive ms-sql server too supports level 2. <br />
<br />
Informix is a good one , but gui is not strong , u can always go for ibm tools which provide gui interface. <br />
<br />
yes, if your ms sql server is not updated with sp3a or the respective patch, then it is prone to sql slammer virus. For more information about this virus, you can visit the site :<br />
