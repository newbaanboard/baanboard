<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">17th January 2003, 21:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to let people know.  Do not try to install the Baan IVc master CD on SQL Server 7 once SQL Server 7 Service pack 4 has been installed.<br />
<br />
It will give a version error because the sql server version has increased from 3 characters to 4 and Baans version checking code can't handle it!<br />
<br />
Hope this stops anyone from falling into the same hole as me!<br />

We were in fact having problem in our B5c system once we patch the SQL Server with its SP3 back in early 2002. We had to reinstall the whole thing. Good thing it was the start of the implementation. SQL Server 7 SP3 wasn't supported by then, I don't know about now.<br />

<br />
For BaanERP5.0 new media will become available very soon (based on porting set 7.1d.01).<br />
For BaanIV it will take some more time.<br />
<br />
In the mean time, use SQL Server 7 versions with a build number below 1000.<br />
SQL Server 2000 is not affected by this problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is another bug with this version of master cd.<br />
If you try to install on Oracle database, and if you set the size of tablespace all to 2GB, the installation crashed with an Oracle Error (database busy).<br />
The only way to install from this master cd with large tablespaces is to create first the database and then install ERP on the existing database.<br />
