<br />
We are running Baan5c on windows environment, and lately we have been having issues with our performance.<br />
<br />
The CPU seems to be running high, in the high 80-100% for 2-4 hours everyday and then it seems to come back down below 50%.<br />
<br />
We are trying to find out if anybody else suffers with such a fluctuation with the cpu or is this unusual activity?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check the processes on system for that duration. Certain BaaN jobs/OS Jobs could also be running for that time span. Also check those.<br />
<br />
Also, do you have any other software installed/running on the same server? That could also be the cause...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">26th October 2007, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Open your TaskManager on the server and sort it by CPU and find out what process is hogging the CPU. My money is on SqlServer. Also do detail out your Server Config and whats the user base(how many baan user license). That would give a clearer picture.<br />

<br />
It looks like it something wrong with the vertual set up and the migration of the machines.:(</div></div><hr />
