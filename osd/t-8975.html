<br />
can you help me with the following problem ?<br />
<br />
I want to do a informix Level0-Backup on a server every night. Additional the logical logs shall be written to disk (a drive that is physically on another server).<br />
I want to configure it this way:<br />
<br />
- start the continous logical log backup to disk (ontape -c)<br />
- once a day: stop the logical log backup<br />
- move the file that contains the logical logs to filename.&lt;date&gt;<br />
- start a level0-backup to tape (ontape -s -L 0)<br />
- when the L0-Backup is over: start ontape -c again<br />
<br />
The problem is, that I have to do it on a Windows2000-Machine. On Unix it would be not a big problem as I could use the commands ps , grep, kill etc.<br />
<br />
How could this be solved in a windows-environment ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Mario</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">21st February 2003, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest way to do this is by using the Informix onbar interface along with a third party tape management product.  Depending on your version of Informix and platform, Informix ships with a &quot;lite&quot; version of Legato that can be used to perform backups that do not require the ontape process running continuously. <br />
