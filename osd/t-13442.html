<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gphares</div><div class="date">29th October 2003, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently running Baan IVc3 on an IBM AIX M80 with 4 500mz processors and 16 gig memory with Oracle 8.1.7.  We are going to upgrade to Baan IVc4 soon and considering replacing our existing hardware with a Win2K solution.  <br />
<br />
1. Has anybody done any comparative analysis of the hardware requirements between the Intel and Unix platforms regarding what hardware it will take on the Intel platform to match what we currently have.<br />
2. Has anybody done any cost analysis research.  For people that have done this, has this been cheaper or more costly.<br />
3. In regards to time, what type of conversion effort would we be up againt.<br />
<br />
All help and thoughts appreciated.<br />
Thanks,<br />

There is an ongoing battle between Unix adepts and Windows adepts. There are pro's and con's on both. Imho it comes down to price versus quality. If you go for cheap: take M$, if you go for stability stick to Unix (refurbished if you want less costs).</div></div><hr />
