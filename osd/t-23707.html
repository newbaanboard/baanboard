<br />
I would like to know is it a way to trace a user's activity in BAAN and unix.<br />
<br />
What he was doing!!!!! **** To identify what record he enters :( <br />
<br />
( I really don't like to do this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)<br />
<br />
But as a system administator I need to trace this.<br />
Yes there are for purchasing , finance and store.(in Baan)<br />
Many other transactions do not have the user id column.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
In Baan IV Tools I could not find any solution and I wonder if the log-in <br />
files can be captured from Unix tables /sam application.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
My Baan dir in Unix is mixed up compared to the standard Baan dir.<br />
<br />
I am not very sure where are the files with user id and session accessed are stored.<br />
<br />
It is very helpful because i've searched  but i couldn't find it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance .<br />
<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.                 :(</div></div><hr />

Others of you do...?</div></div><hr />
