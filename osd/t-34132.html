   I have created a new user &quot;mtp1&quot; which belongs to the new group &quot;MTP&quot;.   I created a BAAN user for this user &quot;mtp1&quot;. <br />
   But when I login into BAAN using &quot;mtp1&quot; I get error as &quot;Not authorised to run as user mtp1&quot;.   <br />
   After changing the permissions of the user file in $BSE/lib/user directory,<br />
when I again try to login into BAAN it gives an error<br />
    &quot;Could not log you on to database&quot;.<br />
   But the database user is created successfully and I am able to log into sqlplus using this account.<br />
   So could anyone help in getting around this problem as this is very urgent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are two sessions you have to run/maintain in order to create the DB user:<br />
<br />
1) Maintain Links between Baan Users and Database Users (ttdba0110m000). You have to dump the user after you finish <br />
2) Maintain Database users (ttdba0115m000). You will have to convert the user after you finish.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<br />
Maybe is good idea to add user mtp1 to group bsp.</div></div><hr />
