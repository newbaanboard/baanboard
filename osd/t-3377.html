<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lvdvelde</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone experience with the installation of a packeteer / packet-shaper in a multi-site environment? I mean multi-site: several Baan-companies in a multi-logistic / multi-finance configuration ánd two locations with approx. 50 miles in between. <br />
<br />
Between the two locations we have a frame-relay connection, with a lower/upper bandwith of 512 / 1024 Mbit/s.<br />
<br />
The problem on the other end of this connection is that Baan sometimes freezes for some time. We think that a packet-shaper might be the solution, because the connection is used for all kinds of data.<br />
<br />
Second  does anyone know by which protocol the Baan GUI (BW) communicates and which port is used? It seems that the network-load is over ten (!) times more than from a simple telnet VT100 terminal emulator. Is it possible to tune the network load of BW (possibly by adjusting the packet size)?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">16th May 2002, 03:17</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, the archiving and multi-site forum is for Baan archiving and multisite configuration which focuses on the Baan functional side (if I was moderator for the SIG I would move this to the OS and DB forum).  :)<br />
<br />
But anyway,<br />
<br />
I have used a packet shaper in Baan WAN environments with some success.  WAN QOS options in Cisco routers also seem to help when the contention is caused by other network traffic.<br />
<br />
Where are the two locations?  I have seen differences based upon where the facilities are in the world?<br />
<br />
I am assuming Baan IV/5 with the BW client.  DEM, WorkTop and BA clients will be quite different.  BW uses the rexec protocol to communicate between the BW client and the application server.  I have traces of this process which I can send you if you send me an email.  Packet size adjustments generally do not make much of a difference as long as you are using a reasonably sized MTU.  <br />
Baan does not have network tuning parameters for the client.<br />

<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
1. Rexec versus BaanLogin method<br />
============================<br />
<br />
When using the BaanLogin method password information is send in a encrypted way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Short description of The BaanLogin functionality:<br />
<br />
The BaanLogin functionality provides:<br />
<br />
* The BaanLogin protocol.<br />
* A client-side interface for the BaanLogin protocol.<br />
* A daemon that will act as a server for BaanLogin.<br />
* A changed BaanLogicService on Windows/NT that supports the BaanLogin protocol.<br />
* The possibility to select between the BaanLogin- and rexec-protocol based on additional information in configuration files.<br />
<br />
To be able to accept BaanLogin-requests, the BaanLogin daemon must be started and running at the Baan server.<br />
And, at the client side, BW has to be configured to use the BaanLogin method.<br />
<br />
SERVER CONFIGURATION<br />
Windows NT:<br />
<br />
The daemon runs as a service and is implemented in the BaanLogicService.<br />
To enable BaanLogin-request configure the BaanLogic Service as follows: <br />
&gt; Start the Baan NT Manager on the Baan -NT server.<br />
&gt; Select the Logic service, and click on it with your right mouse button<br />
&gt; Select Protocol...<br />
Now a window pops up having the following fields:<br />
<br />
Listen<br />
Protocol<br />
O Rexec<br />
O BaanLogin<br />
<br />
Port ....<br />
ONamed Pipe<br />
<br />
To enable the BaanLogin protocol mark the checkbox in front of BaanLogin.<br />
<br />
Selection of the correct Port number:<br />
When enabling only Rexec protocol you have to choose Port 512.<br />
This is because the Rexec protocol is hardcoded to port 512.<br />
So, also when enabling both Rexec and BaanLogin protocol you have to use port 512.<br />
When enabling only the BaanLogin protocol the default port is 7150. You can change this to another portnumber.<br />
<br />
After stopping &amp; starting the BaanLogic service the new settings will become active.<br />
<br />
To disable BaanLogin request turn off the BaanLogin option again and restart the BaanLogic service.<br />
<br />
UNIX:<br />
<br />
The BaanLogin functionality is implemented as a daemon process: blogind6.x<br />
<br />
To enable BaanLogin-request do the following::<br />
<br />
Usage: blogind6.1 [-vV] [-d] [-p Portnumber] [-kK]<br />
<br />
&gt; Log in as root at the Baan Unix server because you must have root permission to start the BaanLogin daemon.<br />
&gt; Take care the BSE environment variables are correctly set.<br />
&gt; Start the BaanLogin daemon process as follows:<br />
<br />
blogind6.1 -p Portnumber<br />
<br />
When you start blogind6.1 without specifying any options it will default take port 7150.<br />
To run the blogind6.1 in a kind of debug mode specify the -d option, for example:<br />
<br />
# blogind6.1 -d<br />
# Daemon: listen for first connection.<br />
<br />
Daemon: Incoming connection, spawn child.<br />
Deamon: revert to listen-mode.<br />
Child: handle BaanLogin request.<br />
Child: received: user kvddool, action 1<br />
bseEnv /c1/b40c/bse/bin/ipc_boot, bseVersion 6.1<br />
Child: logon for kvddool OK.<br />
Child: pwd status = -5, message = -2005: The aging for name is turned off.<br />
Child: starting /c1/b40c/bse/bin/ipc_boot6.1.<br />
<br />
Here you see someone logs on successfully using the BaanLogin method.<br />
<br />
To stop the BaanLogin daemon execute the following command:<br />
blogind6.1 -k<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CLIENT CONFIGURATION<br />
To configure the client to use the BaanLogin method follow these steps:<br />
<br />
&gt; Start BW Configuration <br />
&gt; Select Method: BaanLogin<br />
&gt; The portnumber will be set to the default: 7150<br />
The portnumber must be the same number as the one you configured the BaanLogic Service (Windows NT) for or you specified when starting the blogind.6.x (UNIX). <br />
&gt; Save the configurarion and login Baan.<br />
<br />
When the BaanLogin protocol is selected the following entries are written into the .bwc file:<br />
protocol=BAAN<br />
portnumber=7150<br />
<br />
When the Rexec protocol is selected the following entries are written into the .bwc file:<br />
protocol=EXEC<br />
portnumber=512</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">16th May 2002, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">A clarification...<br />
<br />
While the Baan Login encrypts the password for authentication purposes, all subsequent traffic is unencrypted and continues to use the rexec protocol.<br />
<br />
The port number is user configurable and defaults to a different value between rexec and BaanLogin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">5th August 2004, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Botth the baanlogin mechanism and the rexec protocol are just used for authentication. As soon as this is done, the actual communication is a simple stream of data, to call this a protocoll is a bit of a misnomer. If at all, then it is a baan properitary protocoll between bw and bshell.<br />
<br />
But in regards to traffic load, there should be no difference.</div></div><hr />
