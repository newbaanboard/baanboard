<br />
I have BaanIVc4 (sch1) in an AIX platform (IBM Risc/6000 F40). <br />
I have some tables in Oracle 7.3, and the others in Bisam.<br />
<br />
I need upgrade the machine because they have 8 years and has discontinued.<br />
<br />
Someone knows if Baan have problems in  an Linux platform?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Paiva Barbosa</div></div><hr />

Baan does not / cannot support two databases at the same time. In a single transaction, if the transaction spans across two database drivers, then if any retry happens, Baan cannot handle. As long as the tables involved in a transaction is handled within single database driver, it should not be a problem.<br />
<br />
So, please ensure that the tables residing in Oracle and tables residing in BISAM are not inter-dependent.</div></div><hr />

We have all company specific data in oracle tables but be have &quot;tools&quot; tables in  bisam.  (not sure of why this was chosen)<br />

<br />
We have similar set-up. BaaN advised us to do so when we had performance issues with tools sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smanohar</div><div class="date">16th November 2004, 05:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Since BISAM is basically a flat file, there is no database transaction involved. It would be much faster rather than going to RDBMS and fetching the data.<br />
<br />
But splitting the application data and tools data into different databases is acceptable, because on the top of my head I couldn't think of any dependencies between them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
may I direct you to the thread 'who is using linux proting set' in the poll thread? We just switched to linux with remarkable success.<br />
Whether you have to stick to oracle simply depends on the size of your tables. Although the 2G border doesn't exist any more on OS side, tbase still can't handle data files (.bdt) larger than 2G. We are using tbase here, but as far as I know, oracle is supported under linux. I strongly encourage you to download the linux porting set from SSA support site and do a test conversion. Feel free to ask me questions ... <br />
<br />

I have many tables in Oracle (tiitm001 for example) because i have integrations with another application (when a item is created , he is copying for another app for the oracle triggers). In session ttaad4110m000 i have 2 BD ( Bisam and Oracle) and in ttaad4111m000 i have some tables defined &quot;ORACLE&quot; and all the others defined &quot;AUDIT&quot;</div></div><hr />
