I have to upgrade my Baan IV architecture from SP6 to SP11.<br />
At the moment the application is running on UNIX HP-UX server using Baan<br />
database (not databases like Informix, Oracle).<br />
I have to change the database server, I have 3 options:<br />
<br />
1) migrate the database to Oracle -&gt; I have to spend a lot of money to<br />
upgrade the UNIX server<br />
<br />
2) migrate the database to SQL Server -&gt; In this option the Baan<br />
application remains on UNIX and the database runs on a Windows server, do<br />
you know any issues about it? Are there any problems?<br />
<br />
3) Migrate everything to Windows and SQL Server 2000 -&gt; What is your<br />
experience in a Baan system running on Windows 2000 and SQL Server<br />
2000?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">19th May 2003, 22:51</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion you wrote the same text in alt.baan.com isn't it?<br />
<br />
An important question to know when you talk about upgrading is why?<br />
<br />
Option 2 is not possible as Baan doesn't have a SQL Server driver on UNIX.<br />
<br />
Option 1 and 3 are possible for a small to medium amount of users. For a large amount of users I advise to use a UNIX platform. As you are currently using the baan database I assume you are a small to medium customer so option 1 and 3 fit for you. Dependend on what you want you can choose any of them.<br />
<br />
You mentioned that you need a larger machine for Oracle, but when puting Baan and MSQL on the same box you have to buy an even larger machine. Another thing you can consider is to buy a LINUX machine with Oracle on it. Baan can connect to this machine as any other system with Oracle on it as the connection goes via Oracle.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cfasini</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly I want to say thank you for your useful advice.<br />
<br />
I'm a consultant, my customer have about 40 users on Baan and we would like to have an ODBC connection with the database in order to develop a datawarehouse.<br />
The customer IT manager told me that there are no ODBC connection to Baan database, he can only extract data in a text file, so we are evaluating to use a commercial database (but, if it is too expensive I think that I'll populate the datawarehouse loading data from text file).<br />
Think to put the database server on Linux is a good idea, are you sure that there are no problems about the connection to the database?<br />
<br />
Thank you again<br />

P.S.<br />
Yes, I wrote the same text on alt.comp.baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">As the Oracle connection is handled in via the Oracle libs in the Baan database driver is created by Oracle devilers itself, the Baan driver can connect to any other Oracle database on whatever platform.<br />
<br />
But, if only a few queries are to be expected it is of course possible to use some Baan tools to query and format the database on whatever you need.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
