It is time to refresh our hardware and we are considering Oracle RAC as a possible solution this time.  Our peak BAAN session count is 4000 - 5000.  The database size is 500 Gbyte and growing fast. Any experiences others can share relating to Oracle RAC and BAAN would be appreciated.<br />

Thanks,<br />

That is what I hear with every latest version of Oracle RAC. There evangelists seem to do good work while for 90+% of the customers who believe they can breath without RAC can live with a much cheaper solution like a standby database.<br />

This might be true if the performance of RAC scales better than without. But if users run on the same company this will become a real pain in the back with RAC. If they run on different companies I think that you most of the time can run on multiple systems with different databases as well. I know a customer that used it in the past: from 1 application server they connected to company 100-199 on database server A and company 200-299 connected to database on system B. This of course had some other consequences like multiple drivers and no 2 phase commit between company 100 and 200 but I think that is no problem for 99% of the Baan customers if you can split on functional level.<br />
