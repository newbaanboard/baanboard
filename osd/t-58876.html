<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">psivakumar</div><div class="date">21st July 2010, 21:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently, I had to recreate a test database in 10g. I have created all datafiles on raw devices and changed &quot;compatible&quot; to default which is 10.2.0 (the production it was set to 9.2)<br />
<br />
The DB was exported and imported to new database. Keep all init*.ora parameters same, the performance tanked. All sessions are taking more 3 times of the timing when compared to previous file system based db. The OS/HW are all the same. (Only differences are RAW volumes and compatible was changed from 9.2 to 10.2)<br />
<br />
Did anyone come across a similar situations? I have done everything  to make async driver work. (I could see async devices are open for each oracle sessions)<br />
<br />
I am confused and puzzled. I have done so many conversions from File system to RAW w/o changing anything. This time only compatible was changed.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
there are a few differences between optimizer behavior between 8-&gt;9-&gt;10.<br />
<br />
So that compatible=9.2 might have been intentional. There is a solution 'Important 9i/10g parameters' on the support site, you might want to read that.<br />
<br />
Other than that, did you generate statistics after your import? that could do it.<br />
<br />
And Finally, raw devices are pretty 1999, on most modern file systems (ext3 or better) and disk systems (good caching, etc. ) <br />
you're not going to see a huge gain vs raw disks. or at best - it's usually not big enough to overcome the hassle of having to use raw disks.<br />

I did a full stat on the whole database.</div></div><hr />
