<br />
I had a quick question that I was hoping someone here might be able to help me on.<br />
<br />
I'm investigating the idea of splitting our archive company (197) off to a separate Oracle server box.  A question came up when I was tossing this idea around as to the backups of these new tablespaces.<br />
<br />
Can I set 197 tablespace to read-only and have baan work?  I don't know if Baan does any internal/housekeeping in the company tables and if read-only will crash it.<br />
<br />
I do know that under Oracle, if you set a tablespace read-only you need only back that tablespace up once...<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

Other than that I think Baan is quite happy with it. <br />
<br />
The requirement that you only have to back it up once can also be potentially dangerous of course :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only issue which had to be worked around was that if users print via a Baan session rows are written to company 000 table used by Maintain Device Queue--so these would need to still be writeable.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is all from memory--let me know if you need more specifics and I can look-up and double-check if need be.<br />

<br />
why do you think &quot;The requirement that you only have to back it up once can also be potentially dangerous of course&quot;<br />
<br />
I have found while reconfiguring the archive data, baan drops the table and not able to create new to the db. <br />
If we keep it online and not backup for 6 months what problems you think can happen? What i think  if we reconfigure the restored db with current PVRC then it should make the old data good for use. If i am wrong could explain why?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
The potential 'danger' I was referring to is linked to the usual retention periods people use to rotate their backups mediums. If you let the backup medium containing the single one copy of your read-only tablespace expire and overwrite then I think it's easy to imagine what will happen if your tablespace gets lost in the database itself. Likewise many backups mediums can get worn out, damaged etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Created a Linux server (RH 6.2 512MB 4x9GB)<br />
2.  Installed Oracle 8.1.7<br />
3.  Created the tablespaces for the data and indexes of arch co<br />
4.  Created r_baan role, user accounts<br />
5.  exp'ed all the data associated with our arch co<br />
6.  imp'ed the data into newly created instance<br />
7.  Manually modified tabledef6.1 :eek: (I know, I know) to point all arch co tables to new SID<br />
8.  altered 'live' arch co tablespaces (data &amp; index) offline<br />
<br />
Seems to work okay!   :cool:</div></div><hr />
