<br />
We are on Oracle DB 10g (Current Character set : US7ASCII) and planning to upgrade to Oracle 11g ( 11.2.0.3 ), so question is which character set should I choose while doing oracle installation , we store only English chars, we do not store chinese or another other foreign language.<br />
<br />
I am confused between taking &quot;WE8MSWIN1252&quot; and &quot;WE8ISO8859P15&quot;.<br />
I think i should be taking WE8ISO8859P15, but just wanted to confirm on that. Our O/S is HP-Unix &amp; we are on Baan V c<br />

For the user in the u file it's indeed ISO-8859-1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">2nd January 2013, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to update everyone when we did a data export via oracle utility data pump ( dpexp ) on source system and brought it on target system using dpimp, we did see some characters that became garbage especially tools tables like report layout ttadv335 ... where ever the rows were having lines / box as values. <br />
<br />
Looks like oracle utility dpexp/dpimp is not the way to go for data transfer in this scenerio, baan seq. dump is the right way to go for.<br />

<br />
you could use Oracle Datapump export and import.<br />
But be shure, that the NLS_LANG setting on the source and target machine is the same when you start the export/import !<br />
(Example: when you export with NLS_LANG = AMERICAN_AMERICA.US7ASCII and<br />
import with AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8ISO8859P15 you will get garbage)<br />

Are you sure about this ? Even though our source server is AMERICAN_AMERICA.US7ASCII, but after reading your post, i tried one more time and kept NLS_LANG as &quot;AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8ISO8859P15&quot; on source and target , but unfortunately results are same. All i see is garbage in ttadv335<br />

<br />
May be i am missing something, do you mind sharing your script ?<br />

It is my understanding the US7ASCII is no longer supported so we have to convert to a different character set when we migrate to Oracle 11g.  The question is what is the least painful method?  The last time my dba's ran the analyze script(whatever it is) they found around 40k rows that would have errors.</div></div><hr />

To the best of my knowledge seq. dump is the right way to go, since we experienced issues with data pump, i might be wrong , let's see if Martin can add in comments from his side.<br />

Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
the WE8ISO8859P15 characterset ist a superset from US7ASCII, so all US7ASCII characters are included with additonell special character (like €, ü,ö,ä ....)<br />
When you export the tables with oracle you had set the NLS_LANG to  AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8ISO8859P15 befor you start the export (on Unix or Windows shell : export NLS_LANG= or set NLS_LANG=)<br />
Import the dump with the same settings and be shure, that the database characterset is also WE8ISO8859P15. If you dont set NLS_LANG explicit, the dump-utility tooks the characterset from the database.<br />
<br />
By the way, who dont support US7ASCII ? (Oracle does)<br />
If your DBA use the csscan utility to check for Characterset Migration, i think you will get false results. BaaN stores binary data in char-fiields (Report Layouts, forms,) this scenario you could not check with csscan.<br />

<br />
What I was told was that for 11g the character set US7ASCII was no longer supported and not an option.  So when we convert from 10g to 11g we have to go with a new characterset.</div></div><hr />

When you say &quot;export the tables with oracle&quot;, are you referring to Datapump utility or Oracle imp/exp. utility ?<br />
