<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vaishali</div><div class="date">26th October 2004, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We have BaanIVc4 with database Informix 9.40FC2 and O/S HP-UX11i.<br />
With porting set 6.1c.07.01<br />
<br />
we observed that for idxdbs dbspace, onstat -d comand shows status flag as &#8220;N B&#8221;.<br />
Earlier(i.e before we changed the database logging mode from ANSI to Buffered and tools and all company data was loaded thru bdbpost6.1 utility) the status was &#8220;N&#8221;. The chunks status is &#8220;PO&#8212;&#8220; for all those chunks which were added in this dbspace when the dbspace flag was &#8220;N&#8221;.<br />
Subsequently when new chnuk was added in the dbspace idxdbs, the chunk status shown is &#8220;PO-B&#8221;.<br />
We logged a query on net and we got following explanation. <br />
Big chunks/dbspaces are specified with a B in the onstat output. This B is put on the 'new' fourth position. The B on the third position is used for BLOB spaces. <br />
<br />
Recently we added one chunk of 1 gb in the same dbspace idxdbs but this chunk also shows flag &#8220;B&#8221;. Probably since the dbspace flag has set to &#8220;B&#8221; all chunks newly added will get flag &#8220;B&#8221;.<br />
<br />
We would like to know whether this will have any problem for Baan application and Data? <br />

<br />
Before version 9.4, Informix only allowed 2Gig chunks to be added to the database.  Now with 9.4, you can have a chunk &gt; Petabyte.<br />
<br />
Baan knows nothing about how Informix stores your data, nor does it care.  This will not cause a problem.<br />
