What sort of connection could i have between an application and a database server in a 3-tier architecture that wouldnt bring the performance down a lot? Right now i have both of them crosswired and achieve a 1Gbps connection. I ran a sequential dump of tables on both the 3-tier and a 2-tier environment and found out that the sesssion on the 3tier ran 45%(difference in completion time) slower in comparison. I am sure there will be some dip in performance but this was a bit too much. Therefore i am looking for an alternative connectivity options like perhaps.. SCSI..with details on its setup..<br />

I remembered those days where I played lot with this kind of things, of course in my previous company.<br />
<br />
AFAIK three-tiers are slower than two-tiers. But believe me three-tiers are best for finding and detecting what's going wrong there at App and Db side.<br />
<br />
Sort of connection -<br />
<br />
As I read your other post &quot;Quickie&quot; wherein you wrote you are using ODBC, but do you know its slow. Why not go for just TWO_TASK, not sure it works for MSSQL, I tried it on Oracle and it worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
One more thing, achiving 1GBPS through crosscable just wont work, you have to fine and tune your application, also again not sure MSSQL support it or not.<br />
<br />
Let me know, if you have any questions.<br />
<br />

We look at 3-tier as an integral part of our High Availability plan. Performance was always a trade-of when you think of moving over from 2-tier to 3-tier. But i am sure that there would be connectivity options that could come so close to a disk to disk operation which you find in a 2-tier architecture. <br />
 <br />
Regarding ODBC..since you already been to my other post &quot;Quickie&quot;, which has outgrown its title though, you would know that out of the three connection options i had &quot;BaanNet&quot;, &quot;MSQL_SERVERHOST&quot; and &quot;ODBC&quot; only the third one really worked...i havent tried BaanNet..I am still waiting for a response from Infor on a case i put regarding documentation(proper one) on 3-tier installation.<br />
 <br />
Finally, we are not going to stick with the 1Gbps crosswiring when we go live with this setup. It was just used as a temporary connection setup before we settle down with something more robust and performance oriented...Bottomline..we would like to provide high availability to our users and even tolerate a small performance dip but not to the extend that it stands out like the 45%.....<br />
 <br />
Have you heard of any SCSI to SCSI connection between app and db servers? How did you finally achieve a good connection between your app and db?<br />

<br />
Not sure how you will use 3-tier for High Availibility in terms of data refresh rate on both the server. But there are many options to achieve HA.<br />
<br />
But i am sure that there would be connectivity options that could come so close to a disk to disk operation which you find in a 2-tier architecture. <br />
<br />
I dont think disk to disk operation can be achieved in 3-Tiers. Are you talking about NAS/SAN/ Oracle RAC or common repository database etc. They are quite expensive solutions for huge databases and they are having their own limitations. Thats why we used Oracle's DataGuard Time-based, Log-based in my previous company.<br />
<br />
Have you heard of any SCSI to SCSI connection between app and db servers?<br />
<br />
No...I have not heard. But I heard IIT Kharagpur had developed this kind hardwares using IEEE standards.<br />
<br />
How did you finally achieve a good connection between your app and db?<br />
<br />
<br />
Like ODBC we used Oracles Net 8 to connect DB server and seems fast.<br />
<br />
Just curious, Are both servers having same config?<br />
<br />

Since its been done on test servers they arent that similar neither are they far apart..DB server's a G5 ML370/Raid10/3.25gb/3.2GhzDual core Xeon while the APP servers a G3 ML370/Raid5/2GB/2.8Ghz Xeon. The OS and SQL are the same and as you might have guessed the hardware's from HP. <br />
There is some misunderstanding which i want to clear as far as my previous post is concerned. What i meant by achieving a disk to disk operation in a 3-tier is to do with speed at which transactions are entered into the DB Server. If i had the two servers connected through some sort of SCSI connectivity option(which my HA solution provider promises) then i can achieve a speed thats similar to a disk to disk operation speed..<br />
 <br />
As of now the two machines are connected through crosswiring giving a speed of 1Gbps. In comparison to a disk to disk speed, it was just about 45% slower(figure arrived through). <br />

<br />
Also check with EMC2 (EMC square), they are having this kind of solution.<br />
