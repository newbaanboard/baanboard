<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomasm</div><div class="date">28th January 2010, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We are consolidating our distributed Baan physical servers out there in the world into a central 'data centre'. To keep the license cost for SQL Server down we want to consolidate all systems to run on the same database server with a single instance of SQL Server. To do this we need to have multiple Baan (baandb) databases in the same instance of SQL server. (With Oracle terminology it is called 'table space').<br />
<br />
Normally when you install with default options a database is created with the name baandb. But since we now need to have more than one we need to have different names for them. Creating a new database with the name baandb_FR is of course no problems but how do we point the Baan application to this database?<br />
<br />
During a new install there is an option to choose the dabatabase name and this is documented. But there seems to be no documentation on how to change the database name in a system that is already installed.<br />
<br />
I have found no reference to the database name in $BSE but I have found it in the registry in the data related to the portingset and shared memory. Is this the place to change the name?<br />
<br />
Or do I need to change it in the dabatase definition session inside the application? If so, what are the steps to get it to work? I have been playing around in these sessions a bit but I get stuck with error messages that data does not exist.<br />
<br />
Any advice is apreciated.<br />
Thx,<br />

<br />
A MSSQL database is closer to an Oracle Schema than it is to a tablespace.<br />
<br />
<br />
To do what you're looking to do you need to hit 2 sessions:<br />
1. Maintain Database Definitions<br />
<br />
Setup all of your SQL DBs in here (1 audit, 1 non-audit)<br />
<br />
2. Assign tables to database<br />
<br />
Assign each companies tables to the new DBs you've created<br />
<br />
<br />
Both of these sessions are used in creating the file $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1<br />
<br />
you'll see in there a list of <br />
&lt;table&gt;:&lt;company&gt;:&lt;database connection info&gt;<br />
<br />
you could edit the file directly, but that can be dangerous if you ever run create runtime for those sessions above.<br />

<br />
You are (of course) right about Oracle. It is too long time ago now... :o<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. Your description makes sense but I am unsure how to point to the new/different database, what format to use. Looking in tabledef6.1 (and in maintain databases of course) I see no reference to the database name. Currently it looks like this:<br />
<br />
*:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=0,MSQL_ARRAY_FETCH=1):N<br />
<br />
Probably when using default name there is no need to specify it? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Unfortunatly, I'm not MSSQL savvy enough to know 'em off the top of my head.<br />
do you have access to the support site? download the SQL Server Driver Manual, that'll tell you what you need to know.<br />
<br />
there's one to point to the new machine (something like svrhost) and the other is the DB name.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't help more =(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">29th January 2010, 23:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Our tabledef file looks like this (an example line):<br />
<br />
tccom001:200:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=192.168.20.2\APSBAAN):Y<br />
<br />
I think APSBAAN is the instance name of the MSSQL Server instance (we only have 1 instance though anyway). <br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />
