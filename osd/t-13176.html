I happened to be at one of the site, where the customer changed his database server date in order to post some backdated transactions, because of last day of the month problem. <br />
<br />
And again on request of his user he changed it back to current date and vice versa.<br />
<br />
So my doubt is that ........won't it create create problem with respect to logical logs, or internals working of database ???<br />
<br />
He was taking online logical log backup on the dat drive.<br />
<br />
System configurations was BaaN IV c4<br />
with Informix 7 as database<br />
<br />

I don't think, it will creates some problem as you pointed out. We did it couple of times. But it is not recommanded with respect to jobs/schedulars, access to restricted users and printing reports where system date/time are stamped.<br />

i don't thinik it will be a problem as we also do it very offenly to do some backdated transactions. but the problems comes if u have ordered some material in current date and trying to receive it in past date. most of the problem faced b'coz of changing the date are of similar types.<br />
cheers!!</div></div><hr />

Thanks for this handy info. I just had a intution that if somebody is taking continous logical log backup, then won't it create problem , when recovering that log , in case of server crash??<br />
