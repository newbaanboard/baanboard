I'll appreciate a lot for any comments that you could give us about the ORA9i env.<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
the feature of LOCAL MANAGED  is a TABLESPACE option.<br />
So, when you create the tablespace you could set this option.<br />
So this option  would not specified in the ora_storage.<br />
Please note thats a lot of work, because yout had to spefcify for all Baantables, which extent option would be specified. (small, medium or large).<br />
So you must create local tablespaces with small extent clause, with medium and with large extent clause and for each baan-table assign in the ora_storage, in wich tablespace this tbale would created.<br />
<br />
have a lot of fun.<br />

btw.<br />
could it be, that your are working some years ago in swiss (Bern) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ccbaan</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Ciao Martin,<br />
may be I was not so clear in my previous post.<br />
I know that this is a TBS option but my question is: since if you use the TBS option you don't need to specify the storage clause for each table/index how can I mangae the storage parameter in ora_storage file that, anyway, must be exists ? I think, but I would like to have a confirm, that it will use the value for INITIAL extent specified in ora_storage file but by pass the value specified for NEXT using the LOCAL MANAGED option for TBS.<br />
I hope you can answer me but, in any case, thanks a lot for your time waste for it.<br />
Best regards<br />
P.S: Unfortunately I 've never been in Bern.<br />
<br />

<br />
ok, when you will use local managed tbs,<br />
you had two options, uniform allocations or computed allocation by oracle server.<br />
So it is not recommanded to set a storage clause in ora_storage (because the storage clause come from the TBS, and always from the TBS !)).<br />
As i said in my last post, you had to assign all Baan-Tables to local managed tablespaces depending on the size of the tables, this must be done in the ora_storage.<br />

since I don't know ORA9 deeply can you explain me what do you mean with compute or uniform allocation ?<br />
If I well understood your suggestion I could also leave the ora_storage file blank or in any case without the default lines: ?<br />
<br />
#---------- Default values<br />
*:*:T:group:0214:5:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE DEFTBSDATA INITRANS 3 STORAGE (INITIAL 40 K NEXT 10 K PCTINCREASE 5)<br />
*:*:I:group:0214:5:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE DEFTBSIDX INITRANS <br />
3 STORAGE (INITIAL 40 K NEXT 10 K PCTINCREASE 5)<br />
Thank you and best regards.<br />

<br />
When using LMTS you don't have to specify the following parameters:<br />
- INITIAL<br />
- NEXT<br />
- PCTINCREASE<br />
- etc<br />
So you can leave the ora_storage to:<br />
<br />
#---------- Default values<br />
*:*:T:group:0214:5:TABLESPACE DEFTBSDATA<br />
*:*:I:group:0214:5:TABLESPACE DEFTBSIDX <br />
<br />
The other things Martin is pointing you is the usage of the extents and fragmentation that can occur when creating the LMTS with a small segment size.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
