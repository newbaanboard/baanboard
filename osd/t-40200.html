...the performance of Level2 driver on average is equivalent to the performance of the SQL Server level 1 driver.<br />
<br />
If so, will there be any noticeable improvement in converting to a Level2 driver from level1?<br />
 <br />
Has anyone worked on level1 in Baan4/SqlServer and then converted to level2 and seen any major improvement or performance gain?<br />

<br />
I have worked on Level 1 and Level 2. And I can say that the sentence which explored is correct in general.<br />
<br />
Only thing, if you are on Level 1 and would like to integrate other softwares (May be VB based) with your BaaN database, then its not possible. As BaaN uses its own algorithm to update the index in table.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suhas-mahajan</div><div class="date">8th August 2007, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">No...AFS is a proper way to perform updates in BaaNs tables. <br />
<br />
I was just pointing that ex. if you have VB based HR application wherein you would like to update salaries in BaaN finance, it is not possible.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Reports that used to take minutes and or hours now take a few seconds to run<br />
<br />
As Suhas explained it gives you alternative to integrate other applications with Baan at the DB level</div></div><hr />

So there is a noticeable change in performance. Could you also let me know how many users you have and whats the size of your database(before adopting L2)...<br />
