<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">10th June 2003, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running Baan V5.0c over an Oracle 8.0.5 database. One session in Baan is consuming excessive amounts of memory: cprrp0520m000 - Time Phased Planning Overview. A normal bshell consumes 10-20 megabytes of swap space on our AIX system. Users running cprrp0520m000 consume 100-300 megabytes of memory.<br />
<br />
We are about to expand our user capacity from ~50 to 150. This is a manageable problem with 50 users but will become a system stopper at 150 when &gt;100% of our swap space could be consumed.<br />
<br />
Baan Support says no other customer has reported this problem and, at the moment, is considering this a defect in Oracle.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else seen this and if so how did you handle it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't remember exactly which sessions at the moment tough.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fmorais</div><div class="date">11th June 2003, 02:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.<br />
<br />
I work mainly on Windows environments and I've seen sometimes users consuming 200MB or so.<br />
<br />
I noticed this happens mainly on big batch sessions.<br />
For example, finalizing batches in finance. If you have a big batch - 5000 lines or so - I noticed the memory consumption growing and growing...<br />
<br />
The problem (I think) is that after closing the session in cause, the memory remains allocated until you fully close your baan client...<br />

Due to that parameter sessions used more than 150Mb instead of the normal 20Mb.<br />
<br />
So be aware that some parameters can have these kind of effects.<br />

Right now our 2-D setting is 365 but I have no idea what that means or what the proper setting should be. The system came setup that way and no one has suggested changing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">11th June 2003, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I've found them. I made some adjustments to the parameter and the results look good so far. I'll be monitoring the memory usage to see if it holds steady at its now lower value.</div></div><hr />
