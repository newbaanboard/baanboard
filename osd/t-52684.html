<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">9th June 2008, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in the midst of catching our Baan server up on various patches and updates and am wondering about the best order for doing these. Is it better to do Baan updates before Oracle updates, or the other way around?<br />
   <br />
  The updates I plan are:<br />
1. Server      firmware and OS updates (mainly SUSE 9 security updates).<br />
2. Baan      portingset (6.1c.07.13 to .17) and service packs (SP21 to 24)<br />
3. Oracle      Updates (10.2.0.2 to 10.2.0.3) and latest CPUs  <br />
<br />
I am doing these in the order above over several weekends. I’ve done the first set already and tried to do the Baan updates this past weekend, but I ran into a problem.<br />
   <br />
  The portingset update made Baan really slow. It took 20 secs to open the item master and 30 secs to go from one end of it to the other (it has about 124,000 records). It normally takes almost no time. I switched back to the old portingset. I wonder if I should have done the Oracle updates first.<br />
   <br />
  I have installed these updates on our backup server, which has identical hardware and software. That server has no problems. Unfortunately, when I was setting up that server I did not pay much attention to the order in which I did things, so I’m not sure how I arrived at a working version of Baan. I was focused on recording the steps for doing each individual update, and forgot to records the sequence of them. <br />
   <br />
  Before I go plunging ahead with the next set of updates I want to make sure I am doing this right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually 10.2.0.3 is a little sketchy. you might wanna search the baan KB for any known issues. I believe there's a problem there. Might be better to go to 10.2.0.4<br />
