We don't want to use NIS.<br />
I think it should be unix-level script, not a program which runs in users PC.<br />
Problem seems to be that you can't put password into script.<br />
It's too complicate for normal user to change password, if cluster has several nodes!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">11th October 2001, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest way to do is to have your users change the password on the application servers and the push the critical config files (/etc/passwd etc) to the DB server using the standard rdist tool. This can be easily achieved in a UNIX shell script and you might consider it configuring that script as a service into your MC/SG cluster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have several HA sites using NIS successfully.  NIS is not too bad.  Now NIS+ is another story (run away -- run away)<br />

I just tried to use three application servers and a database server, sharing users via NIS, on HP-UX 11.00.<br />
<br />
This wasn't working at all. To have more information have a look at baan case 696255.<br />
<br />
After a more deep analysis BaaN provided a new porting set, see the new 'Special Note' added to solution 3671.<br />
