<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ciatecmx</div><div class="date">5th October 2006, 00:31</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the Oracle upgrade patch 4547817 for 10.2.0.1 to 10.2.0.2, the upgrade patch of 10.2.0.2 will apply restrictive access on many files of oracle from third-party applications. Therefore we need to run the changePerm.sh to easy the restrictive permissions. On my test environment, a RHEL3, I have not seen any problem postinstallation after the changePerm.sh. But my prod box, a AIX 5.3L, is coupled with BAAN V, and anyone has information about or experience the restrictive activity due to the Oracle upgrade process? i.e does the changePerm.sh also apply to BAAN. because BAAN uses its own communication protocol to connect to Oracle,I want to ensure that there is no problem before I can apply the upgrade.</div></div><hr />

i'm not positive about this patch, but i have seen that overly restrictive <br />
fresh installs require running that script, so i assume it will be needed<br />
in your update.<br />
