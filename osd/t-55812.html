We are looking to migrate our live dbases from SQL 2000 server level1 to Level 2.  We are looking to do the migration if possible by not doing bdb pre/post due to time constraints and favour using the migration utility sql scripts / programs which were once sold as a migration service by SSA / Infor.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of documentation on Infor365 / threads on here which talk of the 'SQL Fast Migration' Tool which may have been included when downloading specific Baan IVc4 / Baan ERP porting sets but which do not appear to be now included from our experience. We have downloaded the relevant porting set and updated the software config to level 2, but the migration tools were not present in the /bin and /lib directories.<br />
<br />
The migration files which we are looking to source are described in the documentation as the following:-<br />
<br />
Where to find the fast-migration tool<br />
<br />
The Level 1 to Level 2 migration tool comes as part of the porting set (7.1d<br />
onwards). It is available once the porting set with MSQL level2 driver is<br />
installed.<br />
The tool contains the following three files, two of which are transact SQL script files, with an .SQL extension, and the third is an .EXE file.<br />
<br />
<br />
 MigrateL1toL2.exe<br />
 StoredProceduresforL1toL2migration.sql<br />
 sp_drop_migration_procedures.sql<br />
<br />
<br />
We have a copy of the Baan IVc4 and Baan ERP installation CD's which (NOW) do not have this tool despite some posts suggesting that they may exist on the cd's. We have raised a call with Infor support, but so far they have no knowledge of this 'level 2 migration tool' and are promoting the bdb pre / post method which is not viable due to excesive downtime for the customer.<br />
<br />
If anyone can be of assistance in locating these files or providing me with a copy this would be very helpful.<br />
<br />

<br />
I've only heard very good things about it, if you can't afford the downtime to re-org this is a good option.<br />
