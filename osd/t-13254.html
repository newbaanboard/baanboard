We r running BaaN IV c4 on Win NT 4.0 with MS SQL Server 7.0 as database.<br />
<br />
If i have the total record count company wise, can i get the total size in MB/GB how much it would have taken on hard disk ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">10th October 2003, 10:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Count records ttaad4222m000 gives the number of records and physical disk space (Number of records * record width / 1000) . Number of records and record width u can see in GTM with option 0. Instead of dividing by 1000  u may divide by 1024 to arrive at accurate KB figure. Further divide by 1024 to arrive at MB / GB figures.<br />
<br />
Now this is purely the table records occupied in the disk . The indices are not included in this.Further take 0 company statistics also into account while determining overall space occupation. MS SQL table overheads are also not considered in this report.<br />
<br />
Going through Baan record counts (ttaad4222m000)  will give only approximate value .Probably SQL server commands can give more correct and appropriate disk space distribution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yaah i checked that session, i have few things to ask :<br />
<br />
1) How is row length / record length counted ? what is the meaning of Row Length ?<br />
<br />
2) I wrote the following query in SQL Server query analyser<br />
<br />
<br />
select count(*) from sysobjects<br />
where name like &quot;%550&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
that gave me 2504 as count, this means that these many tables present in my co.<br />
<br />
but which is the system table in sql server or how i get a total no. of record held by each table in this 550 company intead of giving record count of table individually, assuming that i don't want to use baan report ?<br />
<br />
In informix when we do query on sysobjects table we get the record count for each table for the specified co., I would like to know which is that table at SQL Server Level ?<br />
<br />
3) finally how do i take the record count for indexes ? All I know is that indexes are stored in some diff. table. ?<br />
<br />

1. If u press 0 at the choice prompt of GTM ttaad4100 , u get the record width and number of records. This is what is used in the count records  statistics. Row length / record length is the total number of bytes required to store a single record  ie. sum total of table fields bytes len + some ref update / delete field .<br />
2. I do not know about SQL database / informix sys objects.:o <br />
3. If u wish rough approximation, then there is no need for checking indices. U need to know the entire database size at OS lelvel . Minus this the SQL server sysobjects space. Balance apportion among all companies (including 000)  in the proportion of what u get in ttaad4222m0000. And there u have the space occupied by each company.</div></div><hr />
