it seems to work ok for the warning period (although there is an &quot;Object not found&quot; error message) but once the password expires I can't log in anymore. <br />
Basically SuSE stops me at rexecd (blogind doesn't work either)<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced this and found a way around it? maybe somewhere in /etc/pam.d?<br />
<br />
I was going to retire &quot;passage&quot; but it seems like it might still be the best option.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
