When checks are printing it will print about 20 before the garbage starts. On purchase receipts it will print 27 pages, before the garbage starts. We have not changed anything on the system, we have added a printronix printer and changed out two microline for two tally printers, but none of these are having problems only the purchasing printer and the check printer, we also have three different sales printers that are not having issues.  You can print them on another printer and their is no problem, I have changed the cabling out, have physical put new printers in place, deleted both printers in SAM and replaced them, any suggestions helpfull....</div></div><hr />

<br />
My first idea comes from your hint &quot;after many years ...&quot;. Couldn't it be that your printer is really getting old? Sometime the mechanic needs some oil and so on.<br />
<br />
My second idea is to save the spool file (unix: disable the printer, copy the d* file from /usr/spool/lp/requests/&lt;your printer&gt;/, enable the printer) to check if it is really(!) reproducible -- turn the printer off for half an hour or so and then print that file again. You could also print that file to another (identical) printer and you could have a look at that file ...<br />
