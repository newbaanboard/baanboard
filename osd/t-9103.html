My query is :<br />
<br />
What about the &quot;hash&quot; fields in baan tables?<br />
<br />
These fields are found in tdpur302, tiitm001, tdinv700, tdinv100 etc.,<br />
<br />

The hash fields are present in every BaanERP tables under SQL Server. They contain the content of the index fields in binary. If there are multiple indices for the table, then there are one hash field for each index<br />

<br />
How can I decipher the content of this field? i.e. If the field is containing a value 25166825, what does this mean?  On what logic the value in this field is built up?<br />
<br />
Basically, we are in the process of developing a custom solution as a third party tool. While storing the transactions in tdinv100, we need this data.<br />
<br />
And also how to find out the no. of indices for each table in SQL Server?<br />

<br />
The hash colums are needed for databasedrivers that run in level 1 mode. The database driver computes and stores the hash column.<br />
<br />
If you store data in sql to be used within Baan... I am not sure, but I think it is better to install the latest portingset (to be released this week) and run the database in level 2 mode... in that mode no hash columns are needed.</div></div><hr />

Say we're talking about the index 1 of customer table tccom010, and that index only contains one field; customer code. In this case, for a customer with code KAO1, the hash1 field of this row will contain 0x20204B414F31 for &quot;  KAO1&quot;<br />
<br />
The table definition session (ttadv4120m000 in BaanIV or ttadv4520m000 in BaanERP) will state how many indices each table uses<br />

<br />
I will try to do my best to understand this sequence in each table.  Basically I am interested in tdinv100, tdinv700 etc.,<br />
<br />
If I need any more help, I will come back to u.</div></div><hr />

Baan are informing me that Level 2 driver for Baan IV is not being released, despite previous documentation that suggested it would.  I (and some other users have raised this as a serious issue and are waiting for a reply)<br />
<br />
OmeLuuk - Do you know any different?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree with EdHubbard.<br />
When you ask baan for a level 2 driver for sql2000 and baan cIV they are so kind to call you and mail you saying that there will never be a level 2 driver for baan iv c4.<br />
<br />
There is for baan erp and it is the standard.<br />
Are we feeling there a little pressure to move to baan erp ?<br />
<br />
I launched on this board a call to put a call on the support off baan for a level 2 driver <br />
<br />
Perhaps when there are 20 customers asking for it they will do something<br />
<br />
For sriram<br />
<br />
I tried a work around creating vieuws on the baantables and creating indexes on that vieuws.<br />
But no luck when inserting deleting updating a record with baan the indexen in sql2000 are not updated.<br />
so you must always drop and recreate indexes.<br />
not very good indeed.</div></div><hr />

There seems to be a solution 131609 that describes this.sweetie: When you ask baan for a level 2 driver for sql2000 and baan cIV they are so kind to call you and mail you saying that there [i]will never be[i] a level 2 driver for baan iv c4.This is the statement from that solution.There is for baan erp and it is the standard.<br />

<br />
Perhaps when there are 20 customers asking for it they will do somethingI was told that the defects are going to be closed with reference to the above solution. There is no feedback mechanism from PEG to the department that decides on this matter...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">5th March 2003, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest you open a thread on the level 2 SQL driver in the Enhancements forum. This forum is monitored by some good Baan folks, though there is no guarantee that your wishes will come true of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">5th March 2003, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">As suggested, I have added a new thread into the &quot;Enhancements&quot; section.<br />
<br />
Crossing my fingers and hoping that somebody from Baan will pick it up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">11th August 2006, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, I'd have to correct myself a little bit here. The explanation I gave above seems to work fine for BaanERP running level 1 database driver over SQL Server. I just bumped into one running on Informix, and indeed the hash algorithm becomes very complicated. Please refer to the SQL Server with Level 1 indexing also for more information<br />
