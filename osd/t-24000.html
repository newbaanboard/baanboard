<br />
How much depends on a few things like:<br />
<br />
o        CPU speed.<br />
o        Network cards<br />
o        OS. Some OS have a faster network stack than others<br />
o        Amount of bytes and packages to be sent across the network<br />
o        Used database<br />
o        Database configuration<br />
<br />
In general it can be said you loose at least 15% performance. As Baan is doing lots of small requests, it doesnÂ’t matter that much if you do batch or OLTP.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Hi Han,<br />
I finally understand your message (it was screwed up by the html layout)<br />
so you are basically writing that total time changed from 1h10m to 1h30m<br />
or from 1h to 1h25m, depending from the 'combo mode'.<br />
<br />
I have another question: did you tried this on a low loaded machine?<br />
<br />
I believe that on a heavy loaded system, the total time in 'host mode' is<br />
actually more than this, because we are missing CPU power (the run queue<br />
is about 2-3 times the number of available CPUs), so we may expect as<br />
&quot;worst case&quot; your numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">11th May 2005, 10:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the messy table.<br />
<br />
The number that you mention are all compared to using client/server or not.<br />
<br />
It was a new server, not loaded at all.<br />
<br />
Your runqueue numbers sounds as if the machine is cpu bound.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Han</div></div><hr />

I expect that combo will perform even better on a loaded system. <br />
<br />
I believe that on a heavy loaded system, the total time in 'host mode' is<br />

is about 2-3 times the number of available CPUs), so we may expect as<br />
&quot;worst case&quot; your numbers.<br />
If your system is heavy loaded, You always win to move to client server mode (if the CPU's or network are not too bad). So in your case I advise to move to client server mode. A run queue of 3 times the number of CPU's becomes bad. Moving a part of the load to an application server will most probably increase performance instead of a decrease as mentioned earlier.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
