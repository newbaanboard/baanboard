Considering that there is no upgrade path it will be a sever built from scratch. It would be good to hear from other members in similar situation or having experience of dealing with such upgrade. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your input. As there is no upgrade path for windows so the server needs to be build and then we need to migrate our current environment. I understand that reinstalling SPs and all the patches is not going to be the my preference. I'll do a search for similar threads as you have suggested. <br />
<br />
Also I'll be interested to know if there are more people still using windows 2003 and their thoughts. The point is this is going to be one pure IT project with no real business benefits but a lot of risks and business time(testing). On the other hand we have a plan to migrate our ERP system anyway in a couple of years time. So I'm really trying to figure out which one is the bigger risk.</div></div><hr />

The old licensing method is not supported past a certain porting set version (which doesn't support 2008 and above, I believe) so you will have to move to SLM if you are not already.  Also, if you use DDC for anything, it is not working in 8.9a.02 and above, I believe.  Other than that, not a difficult process.  For SQL Server, you can't migrate directly from 2000 to 2012/2014.  You have to use an interim 2005/2008 server to change the database version.<br />

Thanks,<br />

We are already on SLM but we do use DDC. For SQL I'm planning to go upto SQL 2008 R2 for now. So I think to start with porting set is definitely something to watch out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">10th February 2015, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure about that version of SQL? Since the latest portingset doesn't support that anymore too.<br />
Check the platform support matrix from infor what versions exactly are supported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrinmoygupta</div><div class="date">11th February 2015, 10:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Our current porting set is 6.1c.11. It works with SLM and SQL 2000 but yes this version of SQL is no longer supported. Will use this opportunity to upgrade SQL version as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">11th February 2015, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Han was referring to SQL 2008 R2.  The end of life for that is coming up, and the most current porting set does not support it (I think).  I think you COULD go to 2008 R2 and still have a porting set that supports DDC but you may want to look at the documentation and support matrix.  You may also want to submit a case to Infor on the DDC thing.  The last thing I heard was that it wasn't fixed in the current porting set;  I don't know if that means they're working on fixing it and a future porting set will support it or that they're no longer going to support DDC.<br />

I think at this point I would bite the bullet and actually build a new VM server(test). Wish me luck. :-)  Thanks</div></div><hr />
