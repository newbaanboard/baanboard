<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">30th January 2008, 08:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
  To have an uneventfull migration, i would suggest installing a fresh copy of Baan on the new server (Win2k/SQL2k) and then restoring the sequential dump of your production company. Prior to doing this (restoring), you would have to make sure you have the correct porting set (7.1c.02 or above, i guess) installed on the new server. The downtime here would be just the time taken to restore and re-organize your production company data.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanUser13</div><div class="date">30th January 2008, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">If the porting set on the old server is less than 7.1c.02 or above should i still put the lastest porting set? Also what about the Baan folder should i move that over? Can you give me steps on doing a sequential dump properly? <br />
<br />
thank you kindly for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">31st January 2008, 08:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a mistake in my earlier post as i was referring to porting set 6.1c.07.02 and not 7.1c.. So kindly ignore that..<br />
<br />
In order to install Baan on Windows 2k or 2k3, you need 6.1c.07.02 or above. Anything below than this only works on Windows NT.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt recommend copying over the BSE folder as these  are two different OS's (and a major leap at that NT-&gt;Win2k3) and so the best option would be is to install a fresh copy of Baan on your Win2k3. Secondly, you would need to maintain the same service pack level as of your old server. With certain service packs you would need to even install a higher porting set, so watch out for that..<br />
<br />
You want to know how to create a dump or how to restore one?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanUser13</div><div class="date">31st January 2008, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">So these are the steps i should take:<br />
1. Install Windows 2003 Server Standard Edition <br />
2. Install latest Service Packs and Updates for WIndows 2003<br />
3. Install SQL 2000 and Latest Service Pack<br />
4. Install BaaN 4c4 using the latest Master CD.<br />
5. Update the Porting Set to 6.1c.07.02<br />
6. Stop Users from entering data on the Old Server.<br />
**7. Copy the old Baan directory over to the New server in the same path and overwrite the new one. (I think the previous person install baan on the C: Drive which i would like to move to a different partition if possible)<br />
8. Create a Sequential Dump ( of what) and move that file to the new server and restore it. (This is what i dont know how to do.)<br />
9. Call BaaN and relicense the new server.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
What about the customizations they have.  Will they be moved when i copy the baan directory over?<br />
<br />
If i dont copy the baan directory over then wont i loose all the custom reports and other stuff created after baan was installed?<br />
<br />
Is there anything im missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">First and foremost, copying the bse folder wont be such a good idea. For your customized reports and forms, you could export these objects using ttiex1280m000 session by selecting the appropriate VRC package your customized objects belongs to. You could also use the service of ttcon61export session to move all your user, user permissions, currency and device data to the new server (at the new server you got to use ttcon61import to import). The only issue with this session is that you got to install a solution which will update this session with range facility which wasnt there earlier. I am not sure of the solution number but you could get it from Infor or baanboard by typing ttcon61export...<br />
 <br />
Secondly, when you install Baan on Windows 2003 with the latest Baan Master Cd, it will be having porting set 6.1c.07.13 or higher. <br />
 <br />
To restore the sequential dump follow these procedures<br />
1) Open session Create Table from Sequential Dump {ttaad4227m000}<br />
2) Enable checkbox &quot;Create Table for Different Company&quot; and select the company.<br />
3) Enable the &quot;Append if table exists&quot;, &quot;Overwrite duplicate records&quot;, &quot;Disable Domain Constraints&quot; and &quot;Ignore Referential Integrity Constraints&quot;<br />
4) Enter the path where your sequential dump is and then give an appropriate name to your error log and hit continue.<br />
5) After the sequential dump is over, you got to run Re-organize tables for the company you imported in the steps above<br />
 <br />
sk<br />
P.S: Copying the BSE folder may or may not work but i based my suggestion on the fact that if problems do crop up later then you would have a handfull..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I always install my new Baan/Oracle servers by copying bse directory. By this I am sure that I have all my solutions and customisations installed.<br />
<br />
Can't help you though with the SQL-server since I am not familiar with it.<br />
<br />
The way I do it:<br />
- have a new server with os installed ready<br />
- install oracle db software<br />
- turn database off, copy db files and create a new instance on the new server using the copied database files<br />
- copy bse folder<br />
- install portingset (in order to have correct setup in registry)<br />
<br />
Since you have to make sure that the procedure works you need to perform a test migration. If your users confirm that everything works fine than you can perform the real migration.<br />

Is this a bad idea. Also i did notice that all the new server are 64 bit is this going to be an issue with BaaN 4c4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">2nd February 2008, 08:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Not too familiar with VMWare and so i cant comment on that. As far as the 64bit is concerned there shouldnt be any problem. You could install 32bit OS and DB on it. If on the other hand you install 64 bit version of OS and Db then you should have porting set 6.1c.07.13 or later installed (info courtesy Infor)..<br />
