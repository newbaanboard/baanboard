<br />
I am facing error 2116 when login to Baan. This error gives ORA-1116. <br />
Does anyone know how to solve this?<br />
<br />
This funny thing is I can enter using the root password but only face this error when using bsp login.<br />
<br />
Please help<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
The error says, that the user can not open the datafile. This is consistent with your observation, that the root user can work (because he can obviously open any file on a unix system).<br />
<br />
The cause for this is most likely the following:<br />
<br />
When the user logins, the oracle user process is started by executing the &quot;oracle&quot; binary in $ORACLE_HOME/bin. Check the following for this binary:<br />
<br />
a) It should by owned by user &quot;oracle&quot;<br />
b) it should have the &quot;setuid&quot; bit set. <br />
c) All datafiles, redologs, controlfiles etc. should be owned by oracle and read/writeable by oracle.<br />
<br />
On my system &quot;ls -l $ORACLE_HOME/bin/oracle&quot; returns:<br />
<br />
-rwsr-s--x   1 oracle     dba        /oracle/product/9.2.0/bin/oracle<br />
<br />

My oracle file already has the above mode/permissions<br />
Is there any other suggestion for me to try?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">26th April 2007, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">if the oracle binary itself is ok, what about the datafiles, controlfiles, redologs, ...?<br />
<br />
If you are lucky, you will also find in one of the dump directories (bdump/cdump/udump) and in alert.log in indicator, which specific file oracle can not open.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">26th April 2007, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">if you are not security paranoid, then just set them to 775. Origionally it should be wnough to be read/writable for user oracle and that's it.<br />
<br />
The locations of the diverse directories depends on your parameter settings. The web interface of Oracle will tell you or connect as sysdba to the database and issue a:<br />
<br />
show parameter dump<br />
<br />
The alert log is in the background dump destination.<br />

Use the &quot;find&quot; command, if UNIX, to find the alert file.</div></div><hr />

I have changed the baan/bse directory to bsp:bsp owner and with chmod 777.<br />
also changed all oracle directory with owner oracle:dba and chmod 775<br />
also changed ../bin/oracle with chmod 6755<br />
also changed /baandata with chmod 777 and owner oracle:dba<br />
also checked ../admin/bdump, adump etc all is 777 with oracle:dba<br />
<br />
still cannot get bsp to login.<br />
still can login with root<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin</div><div class="date">27th April 2007, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Permission Problem ? Don't look like.<br />
May be the permission on the Datafiles are not ok.<br />
<br />
Problem Description: <br />
==================== <br />
 <br />
An ORA-01116 is issued whenever Oracle is unable to open a datafile with the <br />
database up and running: <br />
 <br />
  ORA-01116: &quot;error in opening database file %s&quot; <br />
      Cause: Usually the file is not accessible. <br />
     Action: Restore the database file. <br />
 <br />
ORA-01116 errors are usually followed by an ORA-01110 and possibly an Oracle <br />
operating system layer error such as ORA-07368.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Problem Explanation: <br />
==================== <br />
 <br />
During regular database operation, Oracle is constantly accessing the various <br />
datafiles for reads and writes.  If at any time when the database is open <br />
Oracle cannot open a datafile, an ORA-01116 results.  This error implies that <br />
the existence of the datafile is recorded in the data dictionary and the <br />
controlfile, but Oracle cannot locate it physically, at the operating system <br />
level. <br />
 <br />
When a datafile is missing, events that typically trigger an ORA-01116 include: <br />
 <br />
- Shutdown normal or immediate <br />
 <br />
- Log switches <br />
 <br />
- Database checkpoints  <br />
 <br />
There are two main possible causes for an ORA-01116:  <br />
  <br />
1. The datafile does exist, but Oracle cannot find it.   <br />
  <br />
1.A) It may have been renamed at the operating system level, moved to a <br />
     different directory, disk drive, etc. In this case, simply restoring the  <br />
     datafile to its original name and location will solve the problem.  <br />
  <br />
1.B) You intentionally moved the datafile to a different location, but forgot  <br />
     to rename it at Oracle level. For example, you may have decided to move <br />
     the index tablespace datafiles to another disk to improve performance, but<br />
     forgot to rename them inside Oracle. In this case, you must rename the <br />
     datafile(s) from within Oracle.  Look for the Solution Reference on <br />
     renaming datafiles. <br />
  <br />
2. The datafile has been physically removed or damaged to an extent that  <br />
   Oracle cannot recognize it anymore.  <br />
 <br />
In this case, the datafile is lost and the solution depends on the type of <br />
datafile involved, i.e., on the tablespace to which the datafile belongs.  <br />
Look for Solution References on recovering from the loss of datafiles in the <br />
various types of tablespaces.<br />
<br />
<br />
Solution Description: <br />
===================== <br />
 <br />
There are two types of solutions for an ORA-01116: <br />
 <br />
 <br />
I. THE DATAFILE IS LOST OR TOO DAMAGED <br />
-------------------------------------- <br />
 <br />
In this case, the solution depends on the tablespace to which the datafile <br />
belongs.  Look for a Solution Reference matching the type of datafile lost. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
II. THE DATAFILE HAS SIMPLY BEEN MOVED OR RENAMED <br />
------------------------------------------------- <br />
 <br />
If you originally wanted to change the name/location of the file, look for the <br />
Solution Reference on how to rename datafiles inside Oracle.  If the file had <br />
been moved or renamed by mistake, simply restore it to its original <br />
name/location.</div></div><hr />

if a file would actually be missing, how would you explain the fact, that root can login, but nobody else?<br />

<br />
We solved this by going to Smitty in Aix<br />
and then we set the Soft Files settings to -1.<br />

don't know why this setting should be set that way but it works now.<br />
