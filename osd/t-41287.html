<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">v.rohatgi</div><div class="date">4th September 2007, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">We went live on 1st April 2007 and our Oracle datafiles are already in the vicinity of 40GB!!!. We are seeing a data explosion of approx. 4 GB every 6 weeks with archiving switched off.<br />
<br />
It seems slightly odd especially when our legacy system used to generate just 500MB whenever we exported the data from Oracle directly.<br />
<br />
We have also tried to copy the data from a Live company to a test company on the same server via sequential dump in Ln6.1. The time taken to restore has been approx. 48 hours!!!.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on the above???<br />

<br />
Even we had seen such a problem at one of our customers.<br />
<br />
3-4 finance tables were getting populated to a high rate. In finance parameters something like &quot;Log Reconciliation&quot; was checked &quot;YES&quot; and that was the cause of the problem..<br />
