<br />
Scenario: Unix, BaaN IV, Oracle 8.0.6 One server, same machine for Application Server and Database Server.<br />
<br />
Which is the impact for BaaN, when creating in Oracle more database than the BaaN database?<br />
<br />
The other databases are accesed through diverse programs located outside this server. My opinion is that this will impact very negatively to BaaN, because BaaN is 'hungry' with resources.<br />
<br />
Is this true? Am I right? Is this a normal situation?...</div></div><hr />

I think it will all depend on your sizing and the requirements of the new database. As long as both databases don't have to fight for resources (I/O, CPU, memory) the impact should be limited.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">9th March 2002, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't necessarily need to create another database instance for this other data. You can have other databases exist in the same Oracle instance and sharing system resources. Keep in mind that the definition of a database in Oracle is a group of related data sets. Related data sets (a database) can logically exist along side other data sets owned by other schema owners and never know about, or have interaction with each other. With Resource Plans you can control how big a of a slice of the CPU that everyone gets and when. The only down side to this is that if you need to bring the instance down, then all databases are affected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th March 2002, 00:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Gguymer is right that all your data could possibly integrated into your 'Baan' database. On the other end of the scale (integration vs flexibility), you could run 2 databases with 2 sets of Oracle binaries. Thus allowing you diferent upgrade paths etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We do what Pat said in his last post.<br />
<br />
Our pre-production server, which can get very busy sometimes, sits on the same server that we run our inventory planning application. They have their own database and set of Oracle binaries. Baan using Oracle 32bit 8.0.6 whilst the other application uses Oracle 64bit 8.0.6. Admittedly the server only gets really &quot;hacked&quot; the last week of the month but users of both applications do not experience any performance issues. I appreciate that this isn't really a solid test for having a production Baan system using the same environment but it gives you an idea.<br />
<br />
Our server is: HP L2000, 2 x 440 cpu, 4 gb memory<br />
<br />
(This is probably small compared to some of the systems you other guys are running.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">11th March 2002, 22:29</div></div><div class="posttext">My typical recommendation is to do what Pat suggests which makes moving to another server much easier.  Also, when upgrade issues arise (and they will) having upgrade independence is best.</div></div><hr />
