<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daniel5455</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">i just noticed that the transaction log for my baan database is very big (15Gig) and i need to shrink it and for some reason the backup job for the transaction log was failing. I looked in event viewer and can not see why it was failing. I restarted the sql agent and restarted the backup job for the transaction logs and its been saying executing for about an hour now. Does anyone know how i can tell if its working or how long it usually takes to run.</div></div><hr />

Is there another way to shrink the log file.</div></div><hr />
