VERSION(S):<br />
<br />
Portingset form 6.1c.x onwards<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
Baan4<br />
<br />
ATTACHMENTS:<br />
n/a<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The parsing of the &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage files takes a lot of time when a lot of lines are defined.<br />
As the functions that handle the &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage file use an algoritm of order n-square, these lines functions cause slow driver startup at sites that have specified a lot of lines in these files<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
For BaanIV there is only the &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage file. (So no _driver_param and _storage_param file).<br />
<br />
The porting set is also looking at &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage2 ( Not documented and not supported by sessions).<br />
This file has the same layout as &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage.<br />
<br />
Here is a simple program flow on how the driver reads the files &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage and &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage2:<br />
<br />
IF &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage2 EXISTS<br />
THEN<br />
idxopt, refresh time and private/group are read from &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage2. The storage part in this file is not used and can be empty.<br />
As these parameters are often the same for all tables, this file is very short. For Oracle level-2:<br />
*:*:T:group:0214:5:<br />
<br />
The storage file is alway read from the &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage file.<br />
As the storage clause can differ per table, this file can be big. Please note that the fields idxopt, private/group and refresh time are ignored.<br />
<br />
This file is only accessed during creation of tables (when the storage clause is needed). <br />
<br />
ELSE<br />
Everything is read from &lt;rdbms&gt;_storage<br />
FI<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE(S):<br />
<br />
WORK-AROUND:<br />
A frequently used work around: use the original file when creating tables, and replace it by a stripped one (just the default line) when the end users are doing OLTP. <br />
This works as the storage spec lines are only needed during table creation.</div></div><hr />
