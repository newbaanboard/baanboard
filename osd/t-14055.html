<br />
We now have a need to expand the storage. Rather than going for additional hardware for RS/6000, we plan to use standard NAS (Dell or HP) as the DB server. The NAS systems have Win 2003 network storage operating system.<br />
<br />
Has anyone implemented such a setup where the application and data servers run on different operating systems. Further will DB2 run as normal on NAS operating system?<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">27th December 2003, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Normal requirements for baan on multiple hardware is same porting set and datebase driver availability for the hardware (windows 2003).  Even though the porting set may be same , the binaries will different due to different hardware. <br />
<br />
Further u need to check with DB2 vendor to know about how DB2 works under NAS environment which typically have lower RAM and higher storage space.<br />
<br />
Further NAS  storage can be available as NFS directories on UNIX. In that case u will be running DB2 instance on unix while accessing NAS storage meaning higher network traffic between DB server and NAS . And in such case u need to get reference of other people regarding  the transaction / rollback management in such environment.<br />
<br />
U need to have highest level of RAID to provide for hard disk failures.  As  NAS systems also have separate OS / hardware , u may probably need to have a redundant  NAS to ensure business continuity in case of  hardware / OS problems. (NAS vendors claim  0% downtime and instantaneous support  due to hardware/OS failures and there are stringent SLA's for those purpose).<br />
<br />
Ideally u can ask NAS vendor to give reference of other companies using such setup and should get the broad plan of implementation vetted out by Baan support and DB2 experts.<br />
<br />
I don't have first hand experience on NAS / DB2 related issues. Hence consider the advice of others having first hand experience on this as more reliable.</div></div><hr />
