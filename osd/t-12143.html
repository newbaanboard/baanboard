HP have said as much but we are also looking for possible alternatives and find someone who is actually doing it &quot;in anger&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think it also depends on what your requirements are. If you want to be able to perform a true transparant database backup then I think your choice is more limited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are trying to find out what people with set ups similar to the one we are migrating to use</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've always used CA Arcserve for backing up our Windows servers and I know for a fact that there is an Informix agent.<br />
<br />

<br />
As a matter of interest why can't you use Informix's built in back up tools or are you just looking at alternatives ?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Neal</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had heard that Arcserve had agents but also heard that a company using Baan / Informix on NT &quot;could not get them to work&quot;<br />
<br />
We were looking for someone who might be actually doing it successfully<br />
<br />
To answer your other point , we would use onbar for both logs and backup , we were looking for a storage manager to do the housekeeping with our tape library<br />

I guess I'm one of those guys who couldn't get it to work, I bought Arcserve 6.5 and the matching Informix Agent. (couple of years ago) I had to turn to a &quot;cold&quot; backup (all services stopped), that workes without a hitch..<br />
<br />
Kind regards, Robert.</div></div><hr />
