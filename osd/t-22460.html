<br />
since a few weeks we use ORACLE instead of TBASE.<br />
Now I got a problem with report sorting:<br />
&quot;Sorterror 6: No more files can be created in this moment&quot;<br />
The Session continues correctly and the report comes out, but it isn't sorted correct!!<br />
<br />
I think this is because of null-values in a sort field.<br />
TBASE treated String-Fields without a value as an empty string.<br />
Now Oracle treats it as NULL (like every &quot;normal&quot; database should do  :o )<br />
Am I correct?<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
Is there a BAAN-Function to check a string-field for NULL?<br />
Then I could replace the NULL-fields with empty strings manually in the program script (before the record is send to the report!!).<br />
<br />
Thanks for help...<br />

It might also be a problem in the tmpspace of oracle<br />

<br />
Well, I also know &quot;isspace(..)&quot;, but this function only checks for spaces, not for a database-null!!<br />
But I solve my problem just an hour ago (call me an idiot!!):<br />
My client refered to a temp-space, that did not exist anymore!!<br />
I did not recognize this solution, because the &quot;bug&quot; didn't occur every time I run the session. Only if a wide range of records was selected!!<br />
<br />
Anyway: Thanks for help!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are getting the same error only when a large range of records is selected.  However we are running W2K/SQL2K (so different platform to above).  Any ideas?<br />
<br />
TIA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just as a hint: Baan is not storing any nulls in Oracle anyway, but empty strings. If you look at the oracle tables, then you will find, that all fields are declared &quot;not null&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think your problem is routed somewhere else: In certain cases Baan is not relying only on the sorting capabilities of the database, but sorts itself by using the sort binary in $BSE/bin. In your case he could not do this anymore, either because there was not enough space in $BSE/tmp or he could not start the sort process.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">18th May 2005, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan uses Oracle to sort the majority of its queries. All you have to do is look at the SQL generated to see that it will include an ORDER BY clause. TEMP space in Oracle is crucial to healthy sorting. Baan reports do use the native sort function of the operating system on the pre-output file that Baan reports utilize. It is used when you select Ascending, Descending, or Presorted from the Sort Mode in the report Input Fields section.<br />
