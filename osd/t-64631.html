<br />
As we are going to do the ERP LN implimentation for our new branch soon, we need to know whether the implimentation of ERP LN 6.1 FP7 in Windows 2012 Server with SQL Server 2012 environment is ok or not.<br />
<br />
We going to use the porting set (LN Porting Set (8.9a)), even though the Platform support matrix from Infor is mentioning ok , I would like to know whether any body successfully implimented on same.<br />
<br />
We also thinking of using the Add-ons from the LN server with previous version of Porting Set. Is there anything we need to take care.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion on this would be a great help.<br />
<br />
regards,</div></div><hr />

We were going to have the 2012 with both SQL and Windows, but we opted for 2008. And it went fine. A bit of network issues which I guess every OS faces. Else, everything is working quite well. And I assume, 2012 will do good too. <br />
<br />
I hope someone comes with a proper guideline for 2012.</div></div><hr />

However you use Ming.le I would stick to 2008R2, installing sharepoint foundations on W2012 is not that easy (if supported at all).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you very much for your informations. Actually we have implimented the LN 6.1.7 with FP7 in Windows 2008R2 and SQL Server2008 two years back and it was fine. Now also the same LN 6.1.7 FP7 in Windows 2012 and SQL 2012. Since the Porting set is released only few months back our consultant suggested to go with the 2008.. <br />
<br />
May be we will try in our next implimentation.</div></div><hr />
