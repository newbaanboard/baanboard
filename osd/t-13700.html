<br />
We started with baan in a Compaq proliant ML-370 server with PIII coppermine 933, 512MB RAM and 9.2GB*3 in RAID5<br />
<br />
We are currently falling short of disk space, and planning to upgrade the disk space with 36gb*3 by creating a diff. array, without any damages to baan.<br />
<br />
My questions :<br />
<br />
1.  First of all, is this kind of adding hard disks feasible?<br />
2.  What sort of problems we may come across?<br />
3.  Will this be done as an extension to the existing disk space? (i.e., If I have 2 gb disk space left for baan tables, after this addition can that be increased to 72gb?)<br />
4.  In case the extension is not possible, can I move the sql tables to the new volume, without affecting baan?<br />
5.  Will the increase in RAM or hard disk space, need the license key to be regenerated?<br />
<br />
Pls. reply<br />

                      Hello,<br />
<br />
I know the answer for that i want to know amout RAID controler card specs. we already did this activity at our side with no problem. we also have same server configuration.<br />
<br />
Bye<br />

As far as I know it is possible to expand to RAID array. (It was done to our system before i joined). Our RAID array was expanded from 5x 9.1GB to 8x 9.1GB with no hiccups.<br />
Infact we are planning to expand our Array again in the next few months.<br />
<br />
Just curious about how many users you have logged into your System ?<br />
What kind of server loading do you have?<br />
Could you please see and respond to this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=13769) ?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Normal procedure is take out disk 1 replace with larger drive sync the array. do the same again for each of the new drives. once all the drives are the 36GB the extra space is then available to the raid controller. you can then use the raid controller software to expand the volumes on the array. <br />
<br />
how many users di you have as 512 ram seems very low unless you have a seperate sql and baan app server even then with the price of ram now I would take it to a 1GB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">N. sriram</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 05:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Darren,<br />
<br />
Thank u very much for your valuable input.  I am afraid, whether this will create any other problems, since we are directly playing with all (NT SERVER, SQL SERVER AND BAAN TABLES)<br />
<br />
I can take a complete backup of all before touching the system, but if something goes wrong, then I will end up installing everything altogether. (absolutely fresh installation).<br />
<br />
Yeah, u r right.  512 MB is very less, which I am increasing upto 1gb atleast or may be 2 gb ram</div></div><hr />

We also did this type of upgradation recently. There is no need to create separate array, as suggested.<br />
<br />
1. First of all, is this kind of adding hard disks feasible?<br />
ans : Yes.<br />
<br />
2. What sort of problems we may come across?<br />
ans : Seems no problem, but always prepare for worst case. Take full verified backups at application and database levels. Also keep in mind, never put any part of your database on partition of C drive in other words keep your OS on separate hard-disk.<br />
<br />
3. Will this be done as an extension to the existing disk space? (i.e., If I have 2 gb disk space left for baan tables, after this addition can that be increased to 72gb?)<br />
ans : Depends on you, if you want to specify new drive letter for new hard-disks, you can.<br />
<br />
4. In case the extension is not possible, can I move the sql tables to the new volume, without affecting baan?<br />
ans : I don't think, there will be any problem but I am not SQL person. So no idea.<br />
<br />
5. Will the increase in RAM or hard disk space, need the license key to be regenerated?<br />
ans : There is always discrepancy from BaaN Support on this issue, but I am sure there is no need to relicence for adding RAM, Hard-disks even processors.<br />
<br />
Trust me as we are competitors.:D <br />

1.Dear N Sriram u have to increse your RAM for better performance.<br />
2.suppose u replace all hard disk with new then your hard disk spce is increased to 36*2=72 GB [ I assume 33% reserved for RAID]. u already have 18*2=36 GB in use. <br />
3. By Crettuig new array it will show next logical disk 1 [prev disk 0]. u can assign the new drive letter/letters [ depend on your partition]. No doubt performace will be slow as compared to prev. but u can not feel it &amp; their is no risk in it.<br />
4.Our Harware vendor told me that l if  change one HDD with 36 GB it willl treat it as 18 GB. but i do not know after changing all 3 HDD what is the result.<br />
