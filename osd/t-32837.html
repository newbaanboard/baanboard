The background is this:<br />
We wish to migrate our Baan system to a new server as it is getting old.<br />
<br />
We buy and installed a new Windows 2003 server. (lets call it Baan2)<br />
We installed SQL Server 2000 and service packed it up to date on Baan2.<br />
We used SQL Server DTS to copy the data, all tables and objects, from our live server (let's call it Baan1). Baan1 is Windows 2000 Server and SQL Server 2000. We have used SQL Server Enterprise Manager on Baan2 to see the data in the database on Baan2 and it seems to be all there. We copied all of the folders in the BSE (e:\baanivc3) from Baan1 to Baan2.<br />
We have used ODBC and MS Access to view data from Baan2.<br />
<br />
However, I can't log in to Baan2 using the Baan Windows client as it gives errors. I have tried logging in using the BW client from another p.c. and also using a copy of BW client on the Baan2 server.<br />
<br />
In the event viewer of Baan2 the error is:<br />
<br />
Event Type:	Error<br />
Event Source:	Baan<br />
Event Category:	Msql7_srv <br />
Event ID:	1000<br />

<br />
I can't find any reference to what error 1014 is. Shared Memory service on Baan2 seems fine also.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
<br />
If you can look up in the manual of your database server, it should give some direction. Look for error code 14 or sqlstate 08001 in your manual.<br />
<br />
As far as the BAAN Errors manual is concerned, error code 14 has following meaning:<br />
<br />
<br />
14 EFAULT Bad address<br />
    The system encountered a hardware fault in attempting to use <br />
    an argument of a system call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">19th March 2007, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like Baan is trying to connect to the database through ODBC rather than a named pipe.<br />
Although that should be possible (never tried it), it's not the preferred method and there seems to be a problem with your ODBC settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">25th June 2007, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of the solution was the tabledef file. &quot;tabledef6.1&quot; was incorrect as we had just copied it across to the new server. With multiple MS SQL Server instances it should look like this:<br />
<br />
tisfc001:200:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=192.168.0.99\INSTANCENAME):Y<br />
cpcom000:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=192.168.0.99\INSTANCENAME):Y<br />
*:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=192.168.0.99\INSTANCENAME):N<br />
<br />
Where INSTANCENAME would be something like BAAN1<br />
<br />
Hope this helps anybody migrating to a new server.</div></div><hr />

Does it mean that if you have multiple instance on the same server, each line in the tabledef6.1 has to be repeated for as many instances(including the last line)?<br />
 <br />
Whats the last line mean anyway?<br />
*:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=192.168.0.99\INSTANCENAME):N<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">23rd July 2007, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Per Baan instance (BSE) you have to indicate what database to use. (I'm not using the word instance there to avoid confusion. lol)<br />
<br />
In the file tabledef you can additionally point specific (groups of) tables to a different database.<br />
<br />
So in  a real heavy-duty-big-boy environment you could store your financial administration on a different server than your sales data.<br />
<br />
Tabledef should always end with that last line. In most situations it is the only line you'll ever need. It simply meanse to store all tables (*) from all companies (*) in the SQL Server instance named INSTANCENAME on the database at 192.168.0.99.</div></div><hr />

One last question. The file tabledef6.1 is created when you run the session Create Runtime Database Definitions(Tabledef) {ttaad4113s000) after Maintain Database Definitions {ttaad4110m000}, isnt it? There have been cases, for instance Ed's scenario, where you had to manually update the file tabledef6.1 to point to the right server. Now the question, once this is set.. is it important to run the above mentioned session(CRDD) or any other runtime sessions once you log into Baan ?<br />

When you login into Baan after you manually change tabledef6.1 you have to correct data in Baan tables using session Maintain Database Definitions. After that run session ttaad4113s000 and check if new tabledef6.1 is same as this manually created.</div></div><hr />
