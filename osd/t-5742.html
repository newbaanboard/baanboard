I am seeing this when I print a report (or for that matter print from Unix) for a particular printer.  Is this an 'lp' command line option or is it some internal setting on the printer that needs to be modified.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
Either your configure your printer to accept PCL or you use the &quot;dump&quot; driver.<br />

<br />
These codes are PJL (Printer Control Language) and PJL (Printer Job Language) standard (at least for HP Laser-printers, but probably for others also), and are used to control the overall properties of a print job - i.e. no. of copies to be printed, paper-type, paper-source, duplex or not, collation and so on. It's normal to send them before (to set required attributes) and after (to reset) a report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">15th July 2002, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I knew these were standard, but I didn't know if something wasn't being sent (e.g., &lt;Esc&gt;%) or if the problem was on the printer end.  It turns out that the printer was incorrectly configured.  I guess it could be set to emulate other printers and the wrong one was chosen.  Thanks for all of the replies.</div></div><hr />
