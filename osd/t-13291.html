<br />
Does BaaN keep a log of all failure login attempt from users? I have search the forum but unable to get any related thread. Maybe I am searching the wrong keyword?<br />
<br />
Can anyone show me a way to read those log file if possible or point me to the correct thread. Thank you very much.<br />
<br />
Server info:<br />
BaaN IVb4<br />
Sun Solaris 5.8<br />
Portingset 6.1c.06.07<br />
BW B40c.62</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan you have to distinguish between Baan an Portingset... OS specific tasks are performed by the portingset.<br />
<br />
When connecting to Baan it a client server issue. The client process (bshell) is running on a server and passing information to the client. But before information can be logged by client connections you need a connection to the server to start the bshell process there as an authorized user. <br />
<br />
In this case Baan does not log who fails to login because the login is done on OS level, not in Baan.<br />
<br />
(Domain login) Baan Server login - Baan login (license issue etc, log.licd6.X) - working in Baan.<br />
<br />
Failing logins should be logged on OS level see the logfiles there. On (HP)Unix you can use command lastb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yeoea1</div><div class="date">15th October 2003, 03:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is that for users who use GUI client, the OS dun register it as a login and so nothing was log under the command &quot;last&quot;<br />
<br />
Currently I got one suggestion from BaaN that we are still reviewing but I am still open to suggestion.<br />
<br />
Thank again.</div></div><hr />

This does not work unless users is using BaaN as a telnet session. If using GUI mode such as BaaN client, nothing is log by the OS.</div></div><hr />

Not sure why to say as to why your system isn't logging anything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">16th October 2003, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Use man -k btmp to see if your Solaris Unix manual pages find any keywords relating to btmp.<br />
<br />
Look to see if you the following file exists:<br />
/var/adm/loginlog<br />
<br />
If not, create it (or have Unix sysadmin do it) so recording of failed logins is enabled:<br />
touch /var/adm/loginlog<br />
chown root /var/adm/loginlog<br />
chgrp sys /var/adm/loginlog<br />
chmod 660 /var/adm/loginlog<br />
<br />
Once this file has been created, failed logins should be recorded in this ascii file according to a google search I did on &quot;Solaris btmp&quot;.<br />

utmp &amp; wtmp database files are now obsolete by solaris 8. u may check with utmpx &amp; wtmpx in /var/adm.<br />

Yes, those are the 2 files I have checked but found nothing.<br />
<br />
I have also check the loginlog but found nothing log as well. I guess the OS does not log any failure by program that do not directly login to it.</div></div><hr />
