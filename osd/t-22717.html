<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mostrightfuture</div><div class="date">29th December 2004, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi friends,<br />
<br />
I have copied the complete Baan environment from one Live server to another Test server, did following:<br />
<br />
Installed SQL server database<br />
Installed BaanERP <br />
copied BSE folders (Applications, dict, tools)<br />
copied all td* files from BSE/lib to new server<br />
<br />
Now I try to start the Baan on the new Test server, I am getting the following error:<br />
<br />
bdb_errno 510 on ttadv999<br />
Error 510 (Database not on) on Select<br />
Can not continue in ottstpstdlib (mess)<br />
<br />
Let me tell you one more thing, the database location on the Live Server and Test server are different. On Live Server, SQL server is installed on &quot;D&quot; drive while on the Test Server, SQL server is installed on &quot;H&quot; drive. <br />
<br />
How could I change the location of the Server?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">11th January 2009, 08:00</div></div><div class="posttext">As Dick says, check your $BSE\lib\tabledef6.2 file.  Also, you may want to check your $BSE\lib\defaults\db_resource and $BSE\lib\bse_vars files (neither of these files is required to exist, so you may not find them) to see if there's anything in there that may be affecting this.  Also, make sure your database IS on... ;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th December 2018, 23:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I just know everytime we do a full clone (copy application directories) versus just refreshing the data I get a new set of challenges.  From making sure tabledef6.1 is correct to making sure ora table spaces are correct.  I do not know about windows but we also have some $BSE/etc startup files that we have to make sure are correct - like rc.set_vars.  I am not even sure that comes into play with this issue.  Since you cloned from prod to a test you might just try search all the $lib files (and sub directories) for anything that might be lingering with something pointing to production.<br />
<br />
Not sure about your setup but our tabledef6.1 has stuff like this in it.<br />
<br />
trwoc000:701:oracle8(ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME=oracleinstancename):Y<br />
tssma000:701:oracle8(ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME=oracleinstancename):Y<br />
ttaad200:000:oracle8(ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME=oracleinstancename):Y<br />
tuxch001:701:oracle8(ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME=oracleinstancename):Y<br />
*:000:oracle8(ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME=oracleinstancename):N<br />
<br />
Some company 000 tables are specifically spelled out.  I am not really sure why.  But we also just had a case where we cloned for years and years (company 000 is shared with production and simulation company).  But we could not get the sim company to work -  for some reason we had a table in sim company pointing to production instance(it worked on these years) but now it does not.  The table was also an empty parameter table for a module we do not use.  Like I said each clone or copy is an adventure here lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">12th December 2018, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, we were able to started it. It was an issue with the user at the DB level, DB admin recreated the user in MySQL and matching the password with the prod server and we were able to login. I still not sure if all works but for now we have access to the system.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all your help!</div></div><hr />
