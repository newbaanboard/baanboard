<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ranias</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
We are planning to upgrade the Oracle database 8.0.5 to 8i (8.1.7).<br />
Baan Version: BaanERP 5.0b<br />
Porting Set: 6.2a.03.03<br />
OS: HPUX 11.00<br />
I know that porting set should be upgraded to 7.1c.02, but other problem details about the Oracle upgrade are missing.<br />
<br />
Does anyone had experience in doing this upgrade ?<br />
1) Is there any bugs revealed after the updrade process which requires installation of Oracle/Baan patches ??<br />
<br />
2) How can I change the Oracle database definition to connect to the new database? is it through the utility &quot;ora8_inst6.2&quot; ??<br />
<br />
Any input in this question will be appreciated. :)<br />
<br />

<br />
We have only done a test environment upgrade so far for 5b from 8.0.6 -&gt; 8.1.7. Unfortunately, the environment has been deprecated right after the upgrade - doh! - so none or only few tests have been performed on it.<br />
<br />
1) portingset: I don't know if it is mandatory to upgrade but we kept the 6.2a.03.03 porting set.<br />
<br />
2) patches: there are several Oracle patch sets but you may not have to apply them. For Baan patches, I have no idea.<br />
<br />
3) Your database definition should be changed in the session Maintain Database Definitions. Do not forget to convert to runtime!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ranias</div><div class="date">20th February 2002, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Patrick,<br />
thanks for your message, I was wondering why was the project disapproved, is it because of the problems encountered ??? :confused: or just a management decision?<br />
<br />
1) Regarding the porting set, it was Baan Support requirments to upgrade it, because they surely know that this porting set is working properly with Oracle database driver in Baan. <br />
<br />
2) in the case of upgrading to another version the Oracle home directory will change and then I won't be able to run Baan therefore the way to connect the Baan to Oracle after the upgrade, is through the Baan binary file though Unix command(ora8_inst6.2) what do you think ?<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<br />
1) It was a management decision. <br />
<br />
2) You must switch your database definition before you run the Oracle upgrade, not after!</div></div><hr />

On HP-UX the results have been mixed.  Some sites upgrade without problems and others when going to 8.1.7 have inconsistent execution times for queries.  We are working with 4-6 accounts and Baan support (US) on attempting to isolate what causes these sites to have performance issues.  <br />
<br />
We have some sites running successfully on 8.1.7 -- just make sure that you test your batch processes extensively before going live to make sure optimizer related code issues are resolved in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ranias</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 13:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Jim,<br />
I was searching Oracle KB in Metalink and found some articles related to performance issues, but Oracle didn't give any direction for the reason of such a phenomnon after the upgrade.<br />
<br />
But I have noticed that the problems mentioned for performance were related to Baan IVx not BaanERP, what about the sites you mentioned facing the same performance problem what Baan version they are running ?<br />
<br />
Besides, Just after reading other users experiences about performance problems faced in this Oracle version I noticed the connection between the Baan version &amp; porting set.<br />
Do you know such an enviroment with the following configuration have faced such performance problems:<br />
<br />
1) BaanERP 5.0b<br />
2) Oracle 8i<br />
3) Porting Set 7.1c.02<br />
4) HPUX 11.00<br />
<br />
In addition to upgrading the Baan porting set some other users really recommend to install the patch the Oracle to the latest level in order to aviod such problems. <br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />

we've done for testing purposes an upgrade 806 to 817 on AIX.<br />
Just check with Metalinks's analyze script, if sys-objects are without block errors.<br />
After upgrading oracle, change tabledefinition as said before , and everything should work fine,but:<br />
see more memory used per user process (about 1MB)<br />
eventually execution plans are different cause of the (different)CBO.<br />
We use 7.1c.02 on BaanVc.<br />
If you have access to latest baan sizing guide, you will get probably more information on usage.<br />

Thanks for the message, could you pls give me the metalink article number for that? I just didn't get to understand the connection between the analyze script with the upgrade procedure ?? :confused:<br />
<br />
If you have Baan sizing document, could you send it to me please.<br />
<br />
Thank you, <br />

Did you attached any file with the message, cause I didn't find any appendix with your message, where is it ??? :confused:<br />

Most of the problem sites have been running Baan IV.  I am unaware of sites running Baan 5 that are having any of the &quot;mystery&quot; driver problems.  But, there are still a number of general HP/Oracle issues that must be resolved by installing the latest patch set.  <br />

<br />
Baan made a switch to Chrystal Enterprise for financial reporting and now requires you to purchase (yes, purchase, on top of the cost of recreating a few dozen financial statements) this software if you want to upgrade your porting set, which is a requirement for upgrading Oracle to 8i.<br />
<br />
Vertex is another example. It is very particular about it's database/OS combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bherkend</div><div class="date">5th March 2002, 11:44</div></div><div class="posttext">francesco,<br />
what will &quot;happen&quot; to the Safari clients if pset 7.1c.02 is used in Baan ERPVc ? Which binary you think does not work anymore ?<br />
we do have a running environment without problems.<br />

Interesting. I could not get my udmsd server to chat with Baan anymore (or vice versa, not sure). <br />
Since I read something in SP11 (5.0b) about switching to a Seagate engine for FSR and then read about the switch to Chrystal Enterprise in the 7.1c.02 specs,  I was not really surprised when it did not work after the upgrade.<br />
<br />
However, when I questioned the compatibility issue with Baan Support, they told me they were sorry but that was the harsh reality. Even my bit....talking to our customer representative returned the same result.<br />
<br />
If you are telling me that you have a working safari with 7.1c.02, we need to talk (well, I do. lol).:confused:</div></div><hr />
