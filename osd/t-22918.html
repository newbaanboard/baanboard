<br />
Is there a similar environment variable or configuration in Windows NT/2000/etc that would set TZ per user when they log into the server?  If so how can it be done in a commandline or batch file type process?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdbailey</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">The timezone environment variable can be set in any batch file (perhaps attached to the user login script) with the following syntax:<br />
<br />
set TZ=tzn[+|-]hh[:mm[:ss] ][dzn]<br />
<br />
tzn - the Time Zone Name (i.e. Eastern Standard Time is 'EST')<br />
hh - hour difference from GMT (EST is a 5 hour difference)<br />
mm - minutes difference (in case they are in a &quot;half-hour&quot; time zone such as in Newfoundland)<br />
ss - seconds difference (I am not aware of this actually being used anywhere, but it is there if you need it)<br />
dzn - used if that time zone observes day-light savings time (i.e. Eastern Daylight Time = 'EDT')<br />
<br />
So, if I were to set this for a user in my time zone I could use:<br />
<br />
set TZ=EST5EDT<br />
<br />
This variable could then be polled for later use.<br />
<br />
To make things easier, you could just create your own environment variable and assign a number to it (i.e. set MYTIME=5).  You could then do your own math when polling the variable.<br />
<br />
Each user profile in Windows NT/2000/2003 allows you to set up a user login script.  That script could contain your environment variable setting so each login would set their time zone.<br />
<br />
I am not sure of your exact situation so I can't really make any suggestions of how to proceed, but this might help with the environment variable part of the problem.</div></div><hr />
