<br />
We are using BaaN c4 with Oracle 8.1.7 as a database on two different server both server using Sun Solaris 2.8, connectivity in between apps server and db server is sql connectivity. Due to performance problem we are planning to change db server (currently E250 with 1 GB RAM).<br />
<br />
Could any one suggest me how we can shift all data of DB server  from old server to new server with minimum down time, we have around 80 GB of data.<br />

I think one way of doing it would be to duplicate or clone your database using the RMAN backup/recovery tool. You can restore your production database to your new host and bring the database up-to-date with the archive logs from the original one.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you take a look on Oracle Technet (http://technet.oracle.com) for detailed information on this.</div></div><hr />

You will have to be careful with control files, directory paths, etc. but this is commonly done in large environments running FC disk.<br />
