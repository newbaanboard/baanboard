i also ask the Infor this question :<br />

Did Infor tested Oracle 19c on porting set 9.3c internally ?<br />
Event Log Notes:  We tested Oracle 12.2.0.1. We don't test every bug fix batch from Oracle. Only major releases are tested.</div></div><hr />

Interesting notes on that release information - I think some else here said the same thing.  We have a request into infor on this question, but it sounds like we can use 19c.  All they can do at this point in our system is run reports.<br />

Thanks All.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vnarisetty</div><div class="date">25th September 2019, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently over database is Oracle 11.2.0.4 and porting set version is 9.2b . <br />
Do you recommend to upgrade oracle database to 19c and upgrade porting set or upgrade porting set to 9.3c first and then Oracle database to 19c. <br />
<br />
What is the recommended way ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd September 2020, 00:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I missed this - we were told that we needed upgrade the porting set before it would work with 19c.  We are just now working on this - lots of issues, right now not related to porting set or database upgrade.  Right now we were just asked if it used a PDB or needs a standalone.  So working thru lots of issues with this upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vnarisetty</div><div class="date">23rd September 2020, 00:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you having issues with database upgrade or porting set upgrade ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd September 2020, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">It is hard to say at this point.  The problem was were having issues with the porting set upgrade, had to get unix group involved to install libraries, finally got the porting set upgrade complete.  So for the next 3 or 4 weeks it was trying to figure out what was going on with the license server.  Then when we thought we might have that fixed, we when to login - and the dba's had updated the the database to 19c using the wrong character set(surprise).  So now he is now trying to recover the database from backups.  So we keep working with infor on the various issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vnarisetty</div><div class="date">23rd September 2020, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Does Infor recommending new database character set or you DBA chosen wrong character set while he install oracle 19c database instance?<br />
<br />
When you import data with wrong character set in Unicode environment may be the data is not loaded properly on database tables. You may also see some performance issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th September 2020, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">They chose what they are using as a standard(AL32UTF8), so the second go round was to update it to 19c and the same character set(US7ASCII).<br />
<br />
So right now when you try to login you see like login with license information, the then it goes blank, and says no license to start the bshell anymore.  So working with infor on this right now.  The slmclienttest works, but when logging in we get the following error in slmclient log.  The file is out there and everything looks correct around the slmclient.so.<br />

No when we go live on 19c we will upgrade the license server, the porting set and the database.</div></div><hr />
