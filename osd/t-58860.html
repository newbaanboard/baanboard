We need some help on the case of BISAM database, specifically on the limit of the database.<br />
<br />
Our client have installed the baan IV c 4 on the IBM AIX 4.0 since 1999 and now the table size almost 2GB, which is from my knowledge the limit of the table size.<br />
<br />
is there any way to handle this situation? i already proposed the archiving method, but if there's any more way to reduce the size, please advice.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

Hello Roy,<br />
I've been in this situation on one of our B-IV Systems in 2006.<br />
I've switched the DB from tbase to oracle.<br />
On an other B-IV System i reduced the tbase tables (FINANCE) with archiving.<br />
This are the only two ways, i know, table reduce could be done.<br />
<br />
Don't wait 'till the 2 GB size for a tbase table is reached. Company stood still !<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obvious alternative is to upgrade hardware and database if possible .<br />
<br />
Another option could be to start a new company with opening balances of inventory &amp; GL balances and open PO/SO  and open items .  This company can also be in the same multi-comp group and all future trx linked to new fin companies.But that requires extremely good planning and execution on the part of users and technical doing this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
thanks for the answer.<br />
<br />
@bdittmar,<br />
<br />
How do you migrate from tbase to oracle?is it using the seq dump?<br />
<br />
@Hitesh Shah<br />
<br />
I've tried to purge the data of baan once(it's on LN though) but the data came back again. is there any more step to delete the intergration data? like deleting the transaction also?<br />
<br />
sorry for asking too much, i really have minimum knowledge on bisam and the baan IV c4<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

Else u need to write code to delete not for fin records from tfgld418 ,tfgld410,tfgld417 , tfgld415 and tfgld412 . <br />
<br />
For sales invoices records do not exist in tfgld417 .</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
I will pass this information to the customer, and tell them to do it at their own risk<br />
<br />
I pray nothing goes wrong after they deleted the data!!<br />
