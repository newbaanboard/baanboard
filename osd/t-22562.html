<br />
Long back, We have customised &quot;Purchase Register&quot; print session, for that, we have added two indices in tfgld410.<br />
<br />
Recently, we have upgraded SP's and localisation, results, two indices are removed, and our &quot;Purchase Register&quot; is stopped.<br />
<br />
I can add, that two indices again, but my worry is - the table size is too big now and 7 companies, earlier it was small, it may take long time, which we cannot afford down time.<br />
<br />
Is there any alternate of &quot;Reconfigure Table&quot; so that we can avoid down time?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">8th December 2004, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, there is a way. I've never done it by myself, but our database freaks using the way:<br />
<br />
Very First: BE SURE YOUR BACKUP (database and Baan complete) IS OK!!!  <br />
<br />
1) Add the indices in Oracle (with Oracle tools) and reconfigure the table<br />
2) Add the indices in Baan<br />
3) Convert the baan table to Runtime DD without reconfigure!!<br />
4) Move the DD.new file(s) by yourself to the DD.old file(s) and keep backups of the files.<br />
5) Remove the reconfiguration Indicators in the ttaadxxx tables (500, 501, 502 or 503. Actually I don't know, but this are the tables I ever check before reconfigure)<br />
<br />
Normaly it works fine.<br />
<br />
Hope, I didn't forget a step<br />
<br />
If you try it, it is at your own risk.<br />

Looks like your SQL Server... If you're level 2, then you can probably use the same method as csecgn does in oracle.. But if you're level 1<br />
then you need to generate the hash columns, which means that the<br />
only option is a reconfig.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">8th December 2004, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">If reorging a single table takes too long, I would say you have more than that to worry about. But to stick to the issue at hand, there is another method of speeding up the process.<br />
<br />
Dump all your data from the table using SQLPlus. Delete the table with everything in it. Create it again after making your changes to the DD and (again using SQLPlus) reload your data.<br />
<br />
This is essentially the same process that a Baan reconfig does, but it will safe you roughly half the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">8th December 2004, 20:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops, I saw &quot;Win2k&quot; and thought SQL2k.. so I think the &quot;alter table method&quot; is the best. That's what Baan now does for Baan 5, and there's no reason (for a simple index) that you can't do it that way.<br />

<br />
csecgn,<br />
Right now, I am working on your reply on our dev server by forcefully dropping and creating indexes. And Yes, I know all that reconfig info. tables.<br />
<br />
naabi0,<br />
I am sure, they are gone?<br />
<br />
Francesco,<br />
Your thinking is right, single table should not take that much time, but it is tfgld410 with 7 companies with billions of records. And Definitely our database is healthy. <br />
Our database is multiplex archived, reloading data generates lot of arc files, I am thinking to avoid it. I am just curious, will reference allow to delete that table? Yes, I am agree, database import will take half of time compare to BaaN.<br />
<br />
Dave,<br />
Altering table/index, is not that much easy,it has to specify tablespaces.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">10th December 2004, 01:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, how about this then:<br />
<br />
(assuming you have tfgld410 setup in your ora_storage (ora_storage_param) file modify the table def in Baan. <br />
convert to runtime w/o reconfigure table option. <br />
move the .new in place<br />
<br />
create a script<br />
notepad gc1.txt<br />
#1 tfgld410 TCRI &lt;index number&gt; -p 0<br />
<br />
gcommand gc1.txt &lt;company number&gt;<br />
