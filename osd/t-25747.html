<br />
I am wondering if anyone has set a &quot;live&quot; Baan company up where they have split the Baan tables into separate Unix defined directories.  There is a Baan session ttaad4115m000 Maintain Table Directories that leads me to believe that splitting some tables would be okay.  However, I can see where it would become very time consuming if all the tables would have to be specifically defined.<br />
<br />
My problem is that I consult for a company that has their entire live company (Baan IV c3 - Unix - Bisam) directed to one Unix directory.  This directory is at 99%.  I have a Unix consultant asking if I can split their companies tables up into different chucks.  I'm assuming it's not easy to just give the directory more room.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />

Thanks,<br />

Do you have any instructions as to how I would do this?  <br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
based on your hardware configuration (UNIX) assign new harddisks to your volumegroup and extend the size of the volume(s).<br />
<br />
vgextend [volumegroup]<br />
lvextend [logical volume]<br />
<br />
