<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">legatosummers</div><div class="date">11th January 2012, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Guys, i have a ba6.1 running on my aix server and wanted to know what baan process i can use to efficiently monitor baan availability. right now i have a script where it checks bshell process in the server, it emails me if there's no bshell process runnning but this is not reliable since no bshell doesn't mean no baan application working.<br />
<br />
do you have any suggestions on what process should i monitor to guarantee if baan is running on the server or not?  does running &quot;ba6.1 -v&quot; guarantees that the baan application is working properly? thanks in advance for your suggestions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">11th January 2012, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a couple of things you could monitor:<br />
- shmtimer<br />
- blogindaemon running (if used)<br />
or rexec port512 available<br />
- license daemon<br />
or slmserver running<br />
- database up?<br />
- number of licenses used compared to valid licenses.<br />
<br />
If you have converted too SLM it's good to check the log of SLM to make sure that your licenses are not expiring (think about the maintenance license e.g.)<br />
<br />
The ba6.1 -v is not enough, that doesn't really uses your database. Better would be running a small job e.g. each minute and see if the output is generated.<br />
Another thing could be running a small query with qptool, but I am not 100% sure if that's good enough, could be that it requires less than an actual ba/bshell.<br />
<br />
Besides this you of course need other 'standard' checks of you OS which can perfectly been done with open source tools like nagios or zabbix. (but these tools can be used too for checking if a particular process is running)<br />
<br />

<br />
I was also thinking of monitoring the shmtimer but i read somewhere that baan can run without it to quote him:<br />
<br />
&quot;The timer takes care that all users read the time from shared memory instead of doing a more expensive systemcall. So, if the timer is not there, it will do the system call. Beside that you have a performance penalty, there should not be any issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
I will now start creating a script to monitor the license or the one that will generate a small job.<br />
<br />
Thanks again Brinkman! ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
is it possible to check ERPLN job execution with Nagios? If yes, how?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">8th December 2014, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure. You can use the qptool command which is present in $BSE/bin. Write the right query and let you script return the code which you can monitor in nagios.</div></div><hr />
