Baan 5c can be loaded on Oracle 8i.  But they state that 5b can not be upgraded, nor can it be a new install on Oracle 8i.<br />
<br />
I have a need to upgrade 5b to 8i.  Has anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">29th August 2001, 00:12</div></div><div class="posttext">We have done 2 upgrades from 7.3.4.4 to 8.0.6 for BaanERP 5.0b. I don't see any reason why an upgrade to 8i should not be possible. The Oracle upgrade itself from 8.0.x to 8i is not a major one and I expect any portingset that works well with 8.0.x to also work with 8i. FYI, we followed a same approach to upgrade BaanIVc4 installations as well as BaanERP 5.0b environments.</div></div><hr />

I need to go a step higher with 5.0b and thought I would look for any notes first.  I was suprised to find that only 5.0b was the only version that Baan stated could not run on 8i.</div></div><hr />

Hi Hans,<br />
<br />
What sort of problems did you get with the Oracle8 driver?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I submitted the question to BGS and their reply was that our portingset was compatible with Oracle 8.i<br />
<br />
For what it's worth.</div></div><hr />
