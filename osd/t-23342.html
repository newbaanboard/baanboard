<br />
We are currently using Baan IVc2 application(heavily customized) in a client-server environment. Both the application and Database are on HP-Servers. We need to move to IBM Servers(since they are recent ones, they are much faster) to get performance improvements.<br />
<br />
As a result of the Operating System change (From HP-UX 10.2 to AIX 5.2), we will have to change the DB version and Baan's Porting Set version. Here is a summary of where we currently are and where we want to move to:<br />
<br />
Current Components <br />
-----------------------<br />
Baan Application version - IVc2<br />
Database - Oracle 7.3.4.2 <br />
OS - HP 10.2(App server), HP 11.0 (DB Server)<br />
Porting Set - 6.1c.05.02 <br />
Hardware - HP 9000 Servers<br />
Tools Set - c1<br />
<br />
Future Components<br />
-----------------------<br />
Baan Application version - IVc2 (same as current)<br />
Database - Oracle 9i<br />
OS - AIX 5.2 (both App and DB)<br />
Porting Set - Whatever works (try latest one - 6.1c.07.06)<br />
Hardware - p_series (p650, p670)<br />
Tools Set - c1 (or higher if c1 does not work)<br />
<br />
Since the number of unknown variables are large, the complexity of the project is high. I am trying to determine if our intended(and desired) combination will work or not(especially since we are on IVc2 and not IVc4)? Do you know if anybody has used (or is still using) Baan IVcx on AIX operating system with Oracle 9i as the Database? Do you know if anyone is using Baan IVcx on AIX 5.x Server at all? If Yes, will you please provide details as to what combination (OS version, DB version, Baan version, PS version) they are using.<br />
<br />
Any guidance will be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Suresh</div></div><hr />

That will also give you the performance improvement, due to new servers, and your delta is much smaller (especially for peripheral subjects like printers, ...).<br />
<br />
Also if you do not have high availibility requirements to justify a cluster, you should strongly  consider a host mode setup, where DB and App run on the same server. This will speed up your jobs by around 30-50%. With the currently available HW from HP (and naturally also IBM), you can easily run 800 and more users on one server.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. Staying on HP is not an option I currently have. We have been thinking of switching to Host-mode. The application currently has about 100 plus concurrent users. I am also estimating that the performance of batch jobs will improve significantly(I am somewhat conservative that it will be around 15% or so). However, we are not sure how much negative impact it will have on the On-Line-Transactions(estimates range from degradation of 5 - 10%). <br />
<br />
Better hardware(new IBM hardware is about 5x faster than our current HP hardware...) will make for all the loses.<br />
<br />
I am trying to establish if anyone is using the combination of OS, DB and application to determine the feasibility(or plan for problems). Both SSA (Baan) and IBM say that the combination will work but none of them are able to tell if someone is using our desired combination (Baan IVc2 on AIX 5.2 and Oracle 9i).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
We are currently using Baan IVc4 application(heavily customized) in a client-server environment. Both the application and Database are on IBM Servers.<br />
Current Components <br />
-----------------------<br />
Baan Application version - IVc4<br />
Database - Oracle 10 g<br />
OS - AIX 5.2 (both App and DB)<br />
Porting Set - 6.1c.05.02 <br />
<br />
<br />
and is working fine here . so i suggest you to go for this best combination<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">5th April 2005, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">best is certainly a very absolute statement here.<br />
<br />
by the way, I am a bit sceptical you got the portingset right. If I am not mistaken, then you will need something like 6.1c.07.x to run Oracle 10g, even on AIX.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wavila</div><div class="date">6th April 2005, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Two months ago i did some similar to a customer in Venezuela.<br />
<br />
They were using a Digital server with True64 OS, Oracle 7 and Baan IVc2 very customized.<br />
<br />
New servers are IBM with AIX 5.2, Oracle 9i and the same Baan version and last porting set for AIX. I can say that it works fantastic!<br />
<br />
Migration was made in 7 days!!<br />
