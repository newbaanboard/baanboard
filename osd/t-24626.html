<br />
we installed Baan ERP on a Windows 2003 Server in combination with an Oracle database und transfered the data from an older computer on this new machine.<br />
After that no user execept our admin user is able to access the baan environment. What's wrong?<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

<br />
You have transferred the data from an older machine to new one and admin can access BaaN means there is no issue related to connectivity.<br />
<br />
The symptoms shows, it could be problem of permission. Please check user permission. Also check/post event viewers message. So that it helps to understand/diagnose your problem better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ranadz</div><div class="date">21st July 2005, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">W2003 has some more restrictions than W2k, which makes Baaninstallations a little bit more difficult. In my point of view it is not advisable to make all users member of the admin group. Create a new group like 'baanuser', make all baan users member of it and give them permission on the baan and oracle directories.</div></div><hr />

Putting the users into a local admin group on the server works. But putting the users into a non admin group with permissions on the oracle and baan doesn't work.. But I don't think that it is a good idea to put all baan users into an admin group. Is there another solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">21st July 2005, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">At least the BaanIV gui uses rexec to connect to the baan server and therefore all Baan users need the &quot;local log on&quot; policy right. This is most likely the same for BaanERp and Win2003.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can create a new group and put the users in that group but the same group should have a rights of administrator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">2nd August 2005, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a weird idea to make all Baan users to local administrators on a server. I guess most Windows administrators would object to this. There must be a better way of doing this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iulmer</div><div class="date">6th December 2006, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">1. you must add the Baan users group to the &quot;Allow Local Logon&quot; Policy in Win 2003 Server<br />
2. Set read/write permissions for the Baan users to the BSE directory (D:\Baan or whatever) . I don't know why this is needed, but it seems that the Baan application access the application files under the users permissions. <br />
<br />
This worked for us on BaanIVc2. I think for BaanIVc4 only the local logon policy is needed.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure there are some guidelines available from Infor, but from the top of my head I would say we can narrow it down a bit as follows (coorections welcome):<br />
<br />
- collect baan users in a baan group<br />
- baan group needs read rights in $BSE <br />
- baan group needs execute rights in $BSE/etc in order to log on<br />
- baan group (probably) needs execute rights in $BSE/bin<br />
- baan group needs read/write permissions in $BSE/tmp in order to print, sort and logon<br />
- baan group needs read/write permissions in $BSE/log (for logging obviously)<br />
- baan group needs read/write permissions in $BSE/audit (for auditing)<br />
<br />
For security's sake: NO execute rights in tmp, log and audit. NO write permissions in lib/users.</div></div><hr />
