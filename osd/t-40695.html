<br />
I am pretty sure there is nothing wrong with the AIX set-up,  and with Oracle 10g Diagnosis, it points to a lot of idle SQL*Net message from/to Cleint (meaning the Baan).  By the Oracle documents, it points to the problem of network.  (some mentions the array fetches and inserts)<br />
<br />
How can Baan  provide the evidence that there is proper connectivity (or transactions) between Baan and Oracle?  I know there is a Oracle driver and db_resourceÂ´s parameter.  But to analyse them.  ( I know little about Baan)<br />
<br />
Please help me out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
search on the Baan support site for Keyword &quot;Oracle10&quot; and you will get a solution, which specifies the Oracle parameters to set for a halfway decent performance. <br />
<br />
Some of them are hidden parameters, so a cautious approach is suitable here.<br />
<br />
I tested the given parameters with Orlacle 10.0.2.1 and performance was good. After upgrading to 10.0.2.3, I had to remove the one about complex view merging. So do not take any of the ideas in that solution for granted, but it is a starting point.<br />
