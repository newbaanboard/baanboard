There is no BW for CE.<br />
If your server is a Windows type, then you can setup terminal server. If it's a UNIX type, then use a telnet and run the ASCII client.<br />
I think there may be a BI client, but no sure how it will work within the IE CE version though...<br />
<br />
This has been discussed on other posts, search on Windows CE...</div></div><hr />

You could use the standard vt100 emulator supplied with CE and connect via a middleware application such as...<br />
www.arcgateway.com (http://www.arcgateway.com) <br />
in my experience, you wouldn't really want to run a full Baan client on a handheld - it becomes too cumbersome especially in a shop floor environment.  Best is a streamlined version of the standard session with the minumal inputs required.<br />
<br />
Symbol do a nice rugged CE device with a built-in barcode scanner as well as options for GSM/WiFi connections. Other hardware exists where you don't even need CE, simply running vt100 alone.  It depends on where you intend to use the device.</div></div><hr />
