Hello,<br />
<br />
520 <br />
 EBUFUPD <br />
 This occurs when flushing of buffered updates fails. The flushing can fails due to a lock or to a referential integrity constraint<br />

translates to ORA-1632<br />
<br />
which is max extents reached for index.<br />
<br />
so look in your log.oracle8, it should tell you what index.<br />
but it's obviously one on tfacr902100 .<br />
<br />
so you need to fix the index to continue. rebuild, increase the max extents, increase initial/next... any one of those.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renita</div><div class="date">11th March 2010, 07:37</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a table of which two indexes.<br />
index1 is composed of Transaction type,document number,line<br />
index2 is composed of only one field called &quot;refr&quot; which is of multi byte String type<br />
<br />
I'm trying to insert records by using index2. Is this issue due to multi byte string in index?</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's due to the fact that you have reached the max extents allowed for that index.<br />
<br />
In oracle you can set a maximum # of extents or set it to unlimited.<br />
<br />
It appears you have set it to a number, and you've reached that number.<br />
<br />
try something like<br />
SELECT segment_name, extents from dba_segments<br />
where segment_name like '%acr902%'<br />
<br />
to see what i mean<br />
