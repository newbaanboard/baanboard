Presently our system users are not able to access data which is stored in Informix DB.  After our migration, will system users have access to data in MS SQL db for adhoc reporting and query.  We do not have a report writer and all our reports are BaaN reports.<br />

Pros?  Cons?<br />

Our current setup is identical to yours in respect of running IDS and not having a report writer and Baan only reports. I suppose the question to ask is whether you actually want your users to do adhoc queries etc. I've seen various demos where users can access SQL data directly but it always requires technical assistance of some sort. The last demo I saw was by somebody using Microsoft reporting and alerting tools which I'm pretty sure is included in SQL, again this person was from the IT department. I've also seen the Cyberscience tools quite recently and they look pretty impressive. I suppose the question you need to ask yourself at this stage is &quot;Do you want a report writer ?&quot;<br />
