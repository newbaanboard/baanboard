I need to execute a Baan session (3GL session) when a trigger of our machine is activated. There is any command we can use to execute the session?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
bshellx.x o&lt;package&gt;&lt;module&gt;&lt;object code&gt; <br />
<br />
works, e.g. bshell6.1 otccomo999<br />
<br />
Make sure that env. variables like BSE and BSE_TMP are set.<br />

this will work assuming you don't have too fancy of a form.<br />
<br />
If you don't need to specify different parameters each time you run the<br />
session, you can just make it a job and kick it off via rc.startjob<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you. The session we want to start don´t have any form and don´t have parameters. Only read a table and then create/modify a Sale Order.<br />
Now we have the session in a PC every day running and it takes a lot of resource of the machine.<br />
<br />
That we want to do is that with an external program activate a trigger (when it is was necessary) in our machine that start the session that now we have running everytime. We think this can be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">18th May 2006, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">ba6.2 would be fine then.<br />

<br />
<br />
What if i had to run a Create Runtime Session in baan through Unix? Can i do bshell6.1 ottadv5210?<br />
<br />
And the second question is what if i have to set some parameters to run the session, How do i set?</div></div><hr />

The ottadv5210 is not a 3-GL program. Yes, you setup the session ttadv5210m000 in a job, however it might not be recommended as sometimes there are questions or error messages flashed during that process and end up with fatal run-time errors.<br />
 And the second question is what if i have to set some parameters to run the session, How do i set? <br />
You have to setup the standard Baan environment variables in the batch/shell scripts that activates the jobs.</div></div><hr />

Also note, you need to create the job in 000 company.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the answer NPRao. I appreciate.<br />
<br />
So let me understand it correctly. If it is a 3GL script only then can i run the Baan Script from Unix or the OS and if its a 4GL i cannot run the Session/script from the Unix?</div></div><hr />

Correction - I was stating that the ottadv5210 is not a 3-GL program in the context of the discussion. Any print/process session with 3-GL or Type-4 script can be added to a Baan Job which can be triggered by any scheduler (Unix or Windows). if you want to trigger a session from command line or shell script then yes, it has to be a session with 3-GL script.</div></div><hr />
