<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">17th November 2005, 09:04</div></div><div class="posttext">My preferred method is this:<br />
<br />
Enable History for all users in the user management. This will log for each user, when he started and finished any session in the file $BSE/lib/TIME.HIS.<br />
<br />
You can easily analyze this file after a month or so, with the following command (in Unix):<br />
<br />
cut -f 2 -d &quot;|&quot; TIME.HIS | sort -u<br />
<br />
The cut will select the user names only in the file and the sort will return a unique list of users. <br />

<br />
So if you manage (i.e., keep history) your log files when they roll, you could get the information that way as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we find-out using licmon6.1 the users logged-in to baan.<br />
<br />
1) certain times we want to delete the user log-ins; we used bshcmd option but it fails to delete if the user log-in is registered but the user did output to console and he no longer runs any process actually. But the user did output to console and not connected to baan, license count still appears for his log-in. How to delete this log-in and have the license released..?<br />
<br />
2) sometimes when a process started by an is hanging, it is taking a lot of time to kill all the user processes using bshcmd. It appears bshcmd also tries to get in to user terminal; It takes the same time as the Option Dialog-&gt;Start Shell option in the event of a long running/hanging process. Is there anyother way to kill such hanging processes and release license.<br />
<br />
thanks for ur help<br />

VISHwe kill the license daemon and restart it. The users that are logged in will still remain active and the license count will correct itself</div></div><hr />

after stopping the license server and started again; it resets the license to 0.<br />
<br />
then as the users start a session then the license count is incremented per user.<br />
<br />
here I had a problem:<br />
there are some automated processes we have (sessions are called automatically; let us say sales order lines created now the license count became 0 and other users captured the license by starting session; my this automated session when it calls for the next session Generate O/B, it runs out of license and throws fatal error.<br />
<br />
is there a way to reserve license after restarting license server...!<br />
<br />
if you have a clue pls<br />

You can write a simple shell script that checks the number of users logged in <br />
licmon6.1 -u and if you have 20 licenses total you can write if licmon6.1 -u =19, message, No more license, else bshell6.1.<br />
Change the ipc_info so your bshell now points to your script. When a user logs in, the script will check if the user count is less than 19 and allow that user to login, if it is = 19, the user cant login, keeping a free license available for your automated job.</div></div><hr />

nandan : clearing the hung license for a particular user helps<br />
Itannous : tks on your help in setting the total license<br />
<br />
infact the licmon6.1 the options I learn from you guys.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have a list of support options for all exe in $BSE\bin, this will help, very often I am stuck at this point<br />
<br />
tks have a nice day<br />

<br />
nearly all executables in $BSE/bin accept the option -U to show valid parameters. There are exceptions, but usually these commands show the switch for help if -U is invalid.<br />
I never found an executable that did any harm when started with -U.<br />

Its a good idea. But is it possible to do it in Windows to write what you suggested. <br />
<br />
instead of a shell script  <br />
&quot;licmon6.1 -u =19, message, No more license, else bshell6.1.<br />
Change the ipc_info so your bshell now points to your script. When a user logs in, the script will check if the user count is less than 19 and allow that user to login, if it is = 19, the user cant login, keeping a free license available for your automated job&quot;<br />
