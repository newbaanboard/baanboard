<br />
One of the points we are trying to figure out is how to print to a printer at the 3rd party location.  We use the FXPress package from Optio Software to create documents (B. of Lading, etc) and the user needs to have the paper output.<br />
<br />
We are running on HPUX 11.0.  We are working with Citrix support but I wondered if anybody on this board had figured this out already?<br />

Also the client is using Citrix to conect to BaaN.<br />
<br />
If that's so, then, as far as I know, you have to setup the client printer in Citrix Metaframe.<br />
However I don't think BaaN will have a problem with that. Citrix needs configurations.<br />
<br />
I have a similar problem so if your Citrix support manage to install a local printer at 3-rd party site please give me some &quot;clues&quot; how they do it. ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks and good luck.</div></div><hr />

But you should keep one thing in your mind that the driver of printer should be compatible and should be installed in Citrix server.<br />

I have to use the Citrix web interface and metaframe for unix with bx6.1.<br />
<br />
It is looking pretty good.  I set up a Baan device to print to the remote client's print using Citrix command ctxlpr.</div></div><hr />

Years ago I implemented a solution that works with Streamserve and Citrix. Streamserve is a similar product to Optio. Here is how I did it.<br />
<br />
Baan running on a Unix server and Streamserve on a Windows server. I see your Baan install is on Unix. How about the optio server? Is it on the same server (life would be very simple if it were)?<br />
<br />
- Create a device in Baan called DSS (Display Streamserve :).<br />
- Send the ASCII output of Baan to the Streamserve server.<br />
- Have Streamserve convert this file to PDF and place it in an folder that is beneath the ftp .<br />
- Retrieve the pdf file as part of the process that did the print.<br />
- Transfer the pdf file to the client (this would be the terminal server that is running the BW in your case and presented via Citrix) - use server2client()<br />
- Launch the PDF file using appstart()<br />
- Citrix can be setup to autocreate printers (do it for the default printer - speeds up the process of logging into citrix).<br />
- User hits the print button to print to the default printer.</div></div><hr />
