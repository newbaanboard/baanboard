<br />
What actions do I take to boost BaaN performance. Is table re-org one of it? If it is, how often do I do it and what table to re-org.<br />

<br />
In your case, Mok, you need to do a little research on performance issues in general, and if needed come back with a more specific question.<br />
<br />
Baan's new perfromance guide, available for download in one of the threads on this board, is an excellent starting point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to recommend that you get a copy of the Oracle Press book titled: Oracle Performance Tuning 101 by Vaidyanatha, Deshpande, and Kostelac published by Osborne Press. It will give you a lot of insights not only for Oracle, but also the OS and hardware.  What does this have to do with Baan? Well, the book contains a wealth of information on understanding applications and their relationship with Oracle and how to make them work better together. And, its fun to read.<br />

<br />
I think a word of caution is in order here.  The Baan software does not work entirely according to the Oracle standards.  For one, it has many more tables than Oracle expected any application to have, especially when you have multiple companies in Baan.<br />
<br />
On one of my conversion projects, we had a performance guru from Oracle UK (who was in the country at that time because he was giving a workshop on performance :p ) tune the database prior to the conversion.  We did a trial conversion, and Oracle didn't perform.  Thus I tuned Oracle according to the (then standard) Baan guide, and the next trial worked so well that my changes are now permanent at this site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">25th June 2003, 01:53</div></div><div class="posttext">There are still folks out there that think you should base Oracle performance on hit-ratios, and re-orging tables to a single extent. This book de-bunks this old information. Please read it before passing judgement on the performance tuning in general. Yes, Baan has certain performance tuning standards that can be used, but so does Oracle. <br />

True this book is available, but the chapters are being parceled out a couple of chapters a month. Currently it is only up to chapter 10 with 3 more chapters and 3 more Appendixes to go.</div></div><hr />
