The system has slowed down considerably and the users are complaining.  We have about 3.6 million records in integration table after archiving 3 years of data (1998-2000).<br />
The maintain receipts, invoice matching and posting are very slow.  Our database is Informix and it is in raw device.  Our full backup is 3 tapes (4Gb compressed to 8GB per tape) and took about 6 hours to backup. Our processor is 180 Mhz and memory of 1 Gb.<br />
<br />
We are thinking of moving to a faster machine using SQL Server as the database.  What configuration would you suggest.  We have been using HP system for a long time and we would prefer a HP model. We are in the manufacturing sector making car stereos, etc. <br />
<br />
Your input is greatly appreciated.<br />
TQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you already mastered HP-Ux, then I wouldn't switch to any Windows based system. Nothing to gain here.<br />
<br />
For 30 users, just exchange your current system with an HP A-class server with 2 CPU (750 Mhz).  It sounds like a DDS-4 DAT drive would be enough for your backup, which uis the smallest available nowadays anyway.<br />
<br />
Most likely considering your HW support cost, the new A-class will cost the same and gets support for some years included.<br />
<br />
Just my personal opinion, of course. Also just my opinion: throw away informix and get oracle.<br />

Search this board for more opinions on replacing Unix for M$... also my opinion: stick to Unix.</div></div><hr />
