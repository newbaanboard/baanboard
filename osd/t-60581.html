<br />
We currently have BaanIVc4 with Windows 2003 and Oracle 10.2, and we would like to move to Windows 2008 with Oracle 11.<br />
<br />
At the moment, there is no 64-bit porting set for BaanIV for this combination. So we think about the option to run with the 32-bit porting set.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone that uses this configuration:<br />
- Windows 2008 64-bit<br />
- 32-bit porting set for BaanIV<br />
- Oracle 11g 32-bit, or 64-bit on a separate database server?<br />
<br />
If so, how does it perform?<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could we use the combination 32-bit Oracle client with 64-bit Oracle Database also if Oracle and Baan run on the same server?<br />
<br />
If so, do you know how performance is in that case, is it (much) better than running with Oracle 32-bit?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">26th May 2011, 09:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes that's possible.<br />
<br />
The advantage is that you can give Oracle a lot more memory to use which is pretty cumbersome with 32-bits version.<br />
That should have an positive effect on the performance.<br />
<br />

<br />
That sounds great!<br />
As you said, using more memory would be a major advantage.<br />
<br />
Do you know customers that already use this combination?<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />

<br />
I don't think the two tier configuration is supported if you are running Oracle 11g x64. At least, on the technical notes of the latest porting sets there are footers indicating that that combination is supported only in a three tier configuration.<br />
<br />
Have you done an implementation like that in a two tier configuration?<br />
<br />

<br />
I talked with a collegue about using both 32-bit (Baan) and 64-bit (Oracle)  applications on one server.<br />
<br />
A possible issue could be memory usage: the 32-bit-application (Baan) can only address the first 4 GB of memory, operating system (Windows) and database (Oracle) do not have this restriction.<br />
<br />
So, one question is, if you can setup Windows and Oracle in such a way, that they do not consume too much of the first 4GB of memory...<br />

You can easily implement it by connecting Baan to a 32 bit Oracle home which connects via sqlnet to a 64 bits Oracle version installed in another Oracle home on the same machine.<br />

Today Infor support gave us the confirmation, that the setup:<br />
- Windows 2008 R2 64-bit<br />
- Oracle 11g 64-bit<br />
- BaanIVc4 with Porting set 15 32-bit<br />
is a supported setup.<br />
Seems to me like a 3-tier setup where application and database are on the same server.<br />
<br />
We also heard, that there are installations in Germany running with this setup.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<br />
We Are going to move to this configuration and I'd to ask you if you are running 11gR1 or R2 on your windows 2008 R2 properly .<br />
<br />
Any answer would be appreciate<br />

<br />
We use Oracle version 11.2.0.10.<br />
<br />
Our system is operational since two weeks, so far we had no problems.<br />
System performance is not as good as we would expect from the hardware differences, may be a 64-bit porting set will make a difference in future...<br />
<br />

<br />
That 64 bit portingset is available, 8.7b.01 can be used too for BaanIV. With that you can do without the 32-bit client and connect directly to oracle.<br />
<br />

Han</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is good news, thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
Do you know if there are BaanIV-customers that are already using this porting set?<br />
<br />

There are, it was first limited available during which it was tested by some customers (I don't know who).<br />
I am currently migrating one to use this portingset, hope to know more in a couple of days.<br />
