Baan has a document which exactly describes how to install it. Furthermore it works very well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We migrated from a Sun/Oracle single server to W2K Cluster/SQL2K.<br />
<br />
Performance is not any better and the quality of the Baan software on Cluster leaves a lot to be desired.<br />
<br />
The 'recommended' porting set at the time (Mar 01) destroyed our cluster and forced us to rebuild from scratch - Cluster would not start otherwise!<br />
<br />
We are currently running on 1 half of a cluster (the Baan services will not fail over onto the 2nd node, despite assistance from Baan support).  My recommendation based on the experiences gained in this project (we went live in August) would suggest that Baan IV on MS Cluster in not an advisable combination.<br />
<br />
However, I am certain that other Baan customers are getting on OK - otherwise you would hear a LOT more about it.<br />
<br />
For the record, our cluster config is 5 x XeonIII 700Mhz, 6Gb RAM and 150Gb of SAN-attached storage.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.  I know that when we were looking for reliable info, it was hard to come by.</div></div><hr />
