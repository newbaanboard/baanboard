What exactly do you mean by 'logging'?</div></div><hr />

I meant the database logging status. When we were using baan on NT our database (informix) was using unbuffered logging but now on Unix buffered logging . I asked this to our local baan office . they said that buffered logging is used on unix and unbuffered on NT for better performance. <br />
Is this what baan recommends. are all the baan users on NT using unbuffered logging and on unix buffered logging?<br />
<br />
Where can I find documents about  baan/unix and baan/informix administration?<br />
<br />
Below is a part of database logging subject  from informix administration document .<br />
The Database-Logging Status<br />
Every database that the database server manages has a logging status. The<br />
logging status indicates whether the database uses transaction logging and,<br />
if so, which log-buffering mechanism the database employs. To find out the<br />
transaction-logging status of a database, use the database server utilities,The database-logging<br />
status indicates any of the following types of logging:<br />
* No logging<br />
* Unbuffered transaction logging<br />
* Buffered transaction logging<br />
* ANSI-compliant transaction logging<br />
The last three items in this list refer to different log-buffering mechanisms.<br />
information that the database server manages passes through shared<br />
memory to disk. Logical-log records are no exception. Before the database<br />
server writes logical-log records to the logical log, which is on disk, the<br />
records must pass through shared memory. They do this through the logical-log buffers,<br />
In one sense, all the database server logging is buffered because all log<br />
records pass through the logical-log buffer in shared memory before the<br />
database server writes them to the logical log on disk. However, the point at<br />
which the database server flushes the logical-log buffer is different for<br />
buffered transaction logging and unbuffered transaction logging.<br />
<br />
+ Unbuffered Transaction Logging<br />
If transactions are made against a database that uses unbuffered logging, the<br />
records in the logical-log buffer are guaranteed to be written to disk before<br />
the COMMIT statement (and before the PREPARE statement for distributed<br />
transactions) returns to the application. The database server flushes the<br />
records as soon as any transaction in the buffer is committed (that is, a<br />
commit record is written to the logical-log buffer).<br />
When the database server flushes the buffer, only the used pages are written<br />
to disk. Used pages include pages that are only partially full, however, so<br />
some space is wasted. For this reason, the logical-log files on disk fill up faster<br />
than if all the databases on the same database server used buffered logging.<br />
<br />
+ Buffered Transaction Logging<br />
If transactions are against a database that uses buffered logging, the records<br />
are held (buffered) in the logical-log buffer for as long as possible; they are not<br />
flushed from the logical-log buffer in shared memory to the logical log on<br />
disk until one of the following situations occurs:<br />
* The buffer is full.<br />
* A commit on a database with unbuffered logging flushes the buffer.<br />
* A checkpoint occurs.<br />
* The connection is closed.<br />
<br />
+ When to Buffer Transaction Logging<br />
If a database does not use logging, you do not need to consider whether<br />
buffered or unbuffered logging is more appropriate.<br />
ANSI-compliant databases always use unbuffered logging. You cannot<br />
change the buffering status of ANSI-compliant databases.<br />
Unbuffered logging is the best choice for most databases because it<br />
guarantees that all committed transactions can be recovered. In the event of<br />
a failure, only uncommitted transactions at the time of the failure are lost.<br />
However, with unbuffered logging, the database server flushes the logical-log<br />
buffer to disk more frequently, and the buffer contains many more<br />
partially full pages, so it fills the logical log faster than buffered logging does.<br />
If you use buffered logging, and a failure occurs, you cannot expect the<br />
database server to recover the transactions that were in the logical-log buffer<br />
when the failure occurred. Thus, you could lose some committed transac-tions.<br />
In return for this risk, performance during alterations improves<br />
slightly. Buffered logging is best for databases that are updated frequently<br />
(when the speed of updating is important), as long as you can re-create the<br />
updates in the event of failure. You can tune the size of the logical-log buffer<br />
to find an acceptable balance for your system between performance and the<br />
risk of losing transactions to system failure.<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
Sorry I can't help much here, I don't know enough about the Informix-Baan combination. But the additional text will make your case clearer to members who might be able to help you.<br />
<br />
Just 2 comments though: <br />
<br />
a. regardless of what buffering mode you use on database level, you will always have your data cached on OS level in the file system/buffer cache unless you use raw volumes (for your logs)<br />
<br />
b. I know that in alot of Informix environments the logical-log information is directly sent to a tape device. In that a scenario I think buffered logging would be preferable because then the log data can be streamed in bigger chunks to the tape, ultimately helping I/O performance.</div></div><hr />
