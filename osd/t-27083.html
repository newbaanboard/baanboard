At the moment we are in decision making of switching to Oracle or still remain on Informix.<br />
Are there any known problems regarding Baan IVc4 and Oracle? Any problems with the migration? We are planning to move on a new server with the new database. <br />
We are grateful for every small reference.<br />

Thank in advance,<br />

<br />
First all all congratulations to this decision. Without starting a big Informix vs. oracle discussion here, my experience tells me, that Oracle is the right database for Baan.<br />
 <br />
Some thoughts here:<br />
<br />
a) The &quot;migration&quot; will actually be the process of dumping the data with bdbpre and loading it again with bdbpost. There is no other way to do this.<br />
<br />
b) The main problem of the migration will be the time needed. bdbpre and bdbpost tend to be around 4 times slower than for example exp/imp of Oracle.<br />
<br />
c) You can improve a bit the bdbpre/bdbpost performance by setting high values for the variables SSTS_SET_ROWS, RDS_FULL, ORA_MAX_ARRAY_FETCH and ORA_MAX_ARRAY_INSERT. You have to experiment a bit with them. You can start with a value of 100 and increase it. If the value is too big, you export/import might crash with an error.<br />
<br />
d) Otherwise you should not expect any other problems, but you might want to study other postings discussing general Oracle performance issues.<br />
<br />
I hope this helped,<br />

<br />
Do you also have plans to switch your Operating System?<br />
Right now you are using AIX and I would recommend SuSE Linux 9 instead.<br />
This will allow you to save a lot of money on the yearly maintenance and the combination SuSE Linux 9 with Oracle 10g is very powerful.<br />

<br />
we also have recently migrated from MS -SQL 2000 to Oracle 10G,  on AIX5.3, the performance is very good, and users are happy. as the markus had explained u have to use bdbpre/bdbpost only for migration, is the right way to go ahead.<br />
<br />
other wise the database on AIX is stable and reliable.<br />
<br />

Thanks for your references. I think we will bring up both databases on the new server. Then we will do the bdbpre/bdbpost stuff and I hope it will work fine. There will be no time problem, because of doing it on a new system. The old ones will remain running until everything is ok with the new system. <br />
<br />
@Edwin<br />
<br />
Sorry, there are no plans to switch to Linux with this new system. There will be several virtual machines on the server, all powered by one AIX OS.<br />
<br />
@Deepak<br />
<br />
It is good to hear that the database is stable and reliable. That is want we want to have. <br />
<br />
So I am looking forward to the new system, not ordered yet, but I think the move to Oracle is inevitable after 10 years with Informix on BaaN.<br />
<br />
I still be grateful for every small reference,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">15th May 2006, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">the run times might still be an issue, because during the time auf dumping and loading, your users can obviously not use the old system and change the data.<br />
<br />
Wether this is critical or not obviously depends on your amount of data. If your have around 100GB, then a normal weekend is allready too short. If you have much more, then your might need to spend some brainpower to get it done.</div></div><hr />
