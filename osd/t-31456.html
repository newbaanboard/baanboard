<br />
I have to to buy a new Baan server and I am thinking to install W2003 x64 in order to improve performance ( memory addressing limitations ).  <br />
Has anyone installed baan in a 64 bits environment ?<br />
windows 64 bits ?<br />
sql 2005 64 bits / sql 2000 32bits ?<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />

  Yes Baan would work on 64 bit environment but dont expect it to fly. Baan4 still and will remain a 32 bit application, as per baan support. Now to make Baan4 work on a 64 bit environment or SQL 2005 you would need porting set 6.1c.7.13, this again courtesy baan support. Thats the only requirement from Baan.<br />
<br />
Check out the other threads regarding 64bit for more info...<br />

In a 2-tier and 32 bit architecture I have  only 4 GB of real phisical addressing. In the user mode portion I have only 2 GB of process adressing  ( without  /3GB), in this 2 GB must fit Baan and SQL server ( database buffer can be above with AWE ).<br />
With a  64 bit hardware and Windows I can have for example:<br />
a ) more than 2 GB for kernel  ( I think 2 GB it´s enougt )<br />
b) 4 GB,  only for baan ( 32 bits ) <br />
c ) another 4 GB only for SQL 2000 ( if I don´t want sql 2005 64 bits )<br />
d ) 20 GB for db pages ( AWE )<br />
<br />
With this environment I have eliminate the b and c  bottleneck.<br />
But,  has anyone prove this solution, and/or with sqlserver 2005 64 bits ?<br />
<br />
Many times the theory fails, ...<br />
<br />
thanks everybody.</div></div><hr />

just  read your comments about that-we are in the same situation and it would be nice if you can tell me if it works  (64bit both windows and sql server) and if yes how about scalability/performance?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joseurib</div><div class="date">11th December 2007, 20:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I´m going to install it definitely in 3-4 months.<br />
In some test it seems to run well but I haven´t test the performance because my test machine was only a PC with only 4 GB of Ram.<br />
<br />
If you have high pagining activity it has to improve the performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">29th January 2008, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">hi,<br />
could you install and any bench marks...any better performance...<br />
<br />
beacuse we too are on the same boat of migrating few baan servers.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of 2003 64 bit, sql2005 64bit...<br />
<br />
can you please update your experiences, it will help.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I´m very sorry but we have delayed the migration because now we are going to hire the machine and Baan maintenance instead of buy the server.<br />
I think my &quot;Baan Provider&quot; is going to ask for the new server on february and they will finish the migration at the beginning of may ( 2008).<br />
I still can´t say you the 64 bits performace.<br />
sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruce21</div><div class="date">3rd February 2008, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
we made some tests to compare the difference between Oracle/Sql Server on a windows-machine. For SQL-Server we installed Win-Server 2003 x64 with the newest ERP LN-Portingset. Everything works as expected (installation, executing of sessions). <br />
In my opinion if you want to install ERPlN on a SQL-Server DB you should always use the x64 version as you don't have the 4GB-memory limitation - and  it should work therefore faster. <br />
However in comparision to Oracle 9 x86 the SQL-Server x64 was slower (Oracle has been tuned very heavy-and Oracle 10 is slower than version 9)<br />
<br />
-hope that helps martin</div></div><hr />
