<br />
We are about to port Baan ERP from Win NT 4 to Win 2003 Server. I believe, this combination is supported(?). What surprises should we expect?<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

But seriously, make sure you don't have any issues with printer queues when printing reports in job mode.</div></div><hr />

We had to set some special folder permissions on some BAAN folders for end users, because of the fact that W2003 standerd has no acces (and NT4 for folders all permissions).<br />
For us stability on  NT 4 was OK and still is OK on W2003.</div></div><hr />

No problems at all - you need 1-2 days. Don't forget to apply SQL 2000 service pack. Also, check you current Baan porting set</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your repies. I am just trying to figure out the sequence of steps and amount of work needed to physically move Baan from one machine to another. Could you check whether I see it right?<br />
<br />
1. Which Baan environment files are to be copied to new machine?<br />
2. What adjustments are to be made in paths in fd6.1.* files on the new machine? How many are they?<br />
3. When I backup the database on old machine and restore on the new one, can I use some elegant import/export facilities instead of dumping tables with bdbpre and bdbpost?<br />
4. I understand, all SQL users should be recreated and have the same password on the new machine. I just came across (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=22591)<br />
user authentication problems with the same names/passwords on new machine. Could you possibly comment on this? Do I have to set up the users in baan under sql with mixed authentification?<br />
5. Do we have to re-validate and adjust the registry keys on the new machine?<br />
6. What adjustments are to be made in the application: package combinations, VRC's, and isamdef? How many are they?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
