<br />
If you do, let your VAR know this, post your VST info to the Baan site, and post a reply here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 21:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes folks, untill May 1999 I managed a system running Triton 2.0 with a BISAM back-end on a AIX (don't remember the version) powered RS-6000 from before the turn of the century (the past century that is) set up as a mainframe with....SERIAL TERMINALS!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Those were the days.<br />
<br />
Baan had given up support on Triton 2.0 long before I got to that company, but if it hadn't been for Y2K issues in both Baan and the OS, they would probably still be running that same set-up today. Steady as a rock.<br />
<br />
What I'm saying is that, although it sucks when you are left out in the cold by your software vendor, it's not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
If your system is stable now, who needs the aggrevation of Service Packs and PS upgrades anyway?<br />
The only thing I'm thinking is that sources should be made available at the moment support is discontinued, so companies have the CHOICE to either upgrade or maintain the software themselves.</div></div><hr />

Been running pretty well. We did have few issues like cannot re-print the final invoice but other than that it was very solid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we still have SCO, but we are going to change to Win 2000 with SQL.<br />
<br />
Bye, Volker</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my contry there are some customers using BaaN IV on SCO with tbase. As I know, they don't have any SCO specific problems for now and the system preform quite well. We made some speed tests: first we installed Baan IV on SCO family Unix (curretly it is Caldera Open Unix 8), then we installed on WinNT with MS SQL on the same machine. With SCO some procedures ran up to 8 times faster...</div></div><hr />

<br />
We run BAAN on Unixware since 1996 (today with 150 concurrent users on IVc4). The system is very fast and stable, so normally no need for us to go to another OS.<br />
<br />
If its true that BAAN will stop the support for Unixware, then....???<br />
