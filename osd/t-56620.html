I know most of the answers but am uncertain about a few.  I hope someone can help me.  We run BaaN and Informix on a single server.  We do not support any remote sites.<br />
<br />
Question 1:  Database Owner?  When I run onstat-d, there is a column that is titled &quot;owner&quot; and listed in the column is informix.  Am I looking at the correct resource for the answer to this question.<br />
<br />
Question 2:  Database user name?  I think the answer is bsp.  How can I confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">28th August 2009, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: Yes!<br />
<br />
Question 2: It depends - take a look in session ttdba0515m000, as bsp is the default user, you can say that this is a database user (one of many I guess)<br />

<br />
My sysadmin / dba has informix set up so that it is accessible only through BaaN.  Now, we are considering using a report writer, ECQ.  They have supplied me the questionaire and are requesting read-only access to informix.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that I need to create a new userid within informix but I have notes that my dba configured informix with no role seperation.  What does this mean?</div></div><hr />

<br />
$BSE/lib/informix/inf_users<br />
<br />
Usually this file is filled when you create new users in Baan or edit user settings in Baan. The first entry is the DB user name and the last entry in a line should be the DB group.<br />
