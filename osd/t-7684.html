<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">17th November 2002, 00:39</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to pedro's Problem about database, Why doesn't Baan allow secondary Indexes to be on a field other than the primary Index,(when duplicates are not allowed) just for search capabilities.<br />
<br />
Like say if i have three fields in a table <br />
Customer<br />
Item<br />
Quantity<br />
<br />
Why can't we have two indexes <br />
Index1........... Customer,Item<br />
<br />
Index2........... Quantity<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now Baan doesn't allow such a combo, because it violates Primary key if duplicates are NOT allowed. <br />
<br />

<br />
Also Troll meaning in Oxford dictionary:<br />
<br />
trolling<br />
<br />
Surfing, or browsing, the Web.<br />
<br />
Posting derogatory messages about sensitive subjects on newsgroups and chat rooms to bait users into responding.<br />
<br />
Hanging around in a chat room without saying anything, like a &quot;peeping tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess I didn't do any of this.:)<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">23rd November 2002, 13:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you did. Read your Oxford dictionary description again:<br />
<br />
'..bait users into responding...'<br />
<br />
You deliberately posted the earlier message to try to get an answer for your post. Please don't do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">23rd November 2002, 20:43</div></div><div class="posttext">But please note that Troll still doesn't mean just baiting, but by posting derogatory messages about sensitive subjects , which I didnt do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan is &quot;normalized&quot; which means that its tables have to adhere to certian rules. (look in your DB theory books for more on this, I'm too rusty with it to tell you off hand, this may even be one of the basic rules of 1st normal form..)<br />
<br />
But part of the rules are that, if you have a Key that could be a Primary Key (unique index1) but isn't, that key should be broken out &quot;normalized&quot; into its own table.<br />
<br />
So in your example (which we all know doesn't really work)<br />
Item<br />
Customer<br />
Quantity<br />
<br />
Item, Customer is the key because that's the smallest value that we can logically make unique.<br />
All 2ndary unique keys have to include that index. <br />
<br />
If Quantity was allowed to be unique to itself it should be in its own table.</div></div><hr />
