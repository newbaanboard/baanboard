I sympathize and agree, even though HP is loosing several deals at the moment to IBM.<br />
<br />
Anyway here is the procedure:<br />
<br />
a) Copy Baan (mainly $BSE) to AIX<br />
b) Replace Portingset <br />
c) Install Oracle on AIX<br />
d) Export Data on HP-Ux<br />
e) Recreate Users and roles in Oracle on Aix<br />
f) Import Data on Aix<br />
g) Revalidate Baan<br />
<br />
That's it. Pretty staright forward. Obviously you will need to care of some nitty gritty details, like Oracle settings, printers, etc.<br />

I migrated systems from Digital to HP and from Sinix to HP. No need to reinstall on a Unix platform, just copy.<br />
<br />
It is a different story on Windows. Here you want to reinstall at least a so called fat client to get the registry entries for the services etc.<br />
<br />
On Unix it works like a charm. Copy it over, adjust your kernel to be Baan suited, replace the Portingset and you are ready to go.<br />
<br />
The only thing you can not just copy over is the actual oracle data files. An Oracle data file on Hp-Ux is not compatible to Aix. So you need to go via export/import.<br />

My porting set is already 6.1c.07.05 (almost updated). Do i still have to replace it? How's the procedure of replacing it, the usual way of updating porting set or there are other ways? <br />

<br />
The process is the same as usual. Even though if you are not familiar with this &quot;low&quot; level of Baan, then you might search for external help.<br />
<br />
Actually I had unfortunately a similar case of IBM snapping up a HP customer and actually IBM paid somebody to get this done in order to win the customer.<br />
<br />
it's easy, but let them carry the burden! If your IBM rep canm not provide a person to do the job, then this should make you think twice, wether they know what they talk about in regards to Baan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">8th June 2006, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
unfortunatrely I know the error, but it might have several causes. The actually interesting error message is:<br />
<br />
Could not load shared Oracle library<br />
<br />
<br />
Oracle works with shared libraries, which the client process is loading at connection time. This is a bit of an ugly topic. The library in question is &quot;libclntsh.a&quot; and the path it is looking at is &quot;/baan/usr/bse/lib/ora/oracle_home/lib&quot;. <br />
<br />
As you notice this is not an oracle directory, so the oracle library will not be there.<br />
<br />
If you are lucky, then you can solve this by typing: &quot;ora_update&quot;. This script is part of the portingset and copies the &quot;required support files&quot; of oracle to the right destination.<br />
<br />
If this does not help, then you better start working on some environment variables, which influence the search part of the dll loader. Unfortunately I can not help you here much, as this is OS dependent. Sometimes the variable is called &quot;LIBPATH&quot;, sometimes it is called SHLIB_PATH. You will find this in the OS specific documentation of your oracle version.<br />
<br />
But I think you are on the right track,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">8th June 2006, 14:11</div></div><div class="posttext">In 6.1c.07.10 Baan doesn't deliver it's own client libs, you have use oracle's<br />
<br />
so ora_update will remove $BSE/lib/ora/oracle_home and update the db_resource to point to the real $ORACLE_HOME<br />
<br />
that may solve the problem.<br />
<br />
also &quot;relink all&quot; as oracle (with oracle down) may help as well.<br />
<br />
otherwise you may need to make sure you're LIBPATH is set so that you're pulling the $ORACLE_HOME/lib32 instead of $ORACLE_HOME/lib (assuming you installed 64 bit oracle.)<br />

the behaviour of listener.ora and tnsnames.ora are very inconsistent. I've done all the possible modifications and restart the listener but still the listener hungs and never start. Anyone who encountered the same problem in AIX? ou inputs will be very much appreciated. Thanks<br />

<br />
regardless you should use ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME if you are in a 2 tier setup. if you're in a 1 tier setup (which it looks kind of like you are..) you should use ORACLE_SID and not use a listener at all.<br />

Here a list of locations, which might help you, but is most likely not complete:<br />
<br />
a) central profile: /etc/profile<br />
b) user specific profile (depends on shell used)<br />
c) $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1<br />
d) in any file in $BSE/lib/defaults<br />
e) in $BSE/lib/env.local (not 100% sure about that name though)<br />
f) in a so called bshell wrapper. Check $BSE/lib/ipc_info where the entry bshell is pointing to, then check wether this is the origional baan binary or a script.<br />

As I said, there might be even more ...<br />
