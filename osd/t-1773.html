<br />
  Good to have such a nice forum to discuss things. <br />
<br />
  Right now I am stuck in a problem of creating a database user which is linked to a baan user. I have tried to create the user in the following ways.<br />
<br />
  1. through baan dba module.<br />
  2. by inserting entries in ora_users file , using encrypt6.2 &amp; also creating the corresponding user in the oracle env &amp; granting it the connect role.<br />
<br />
 3. using the ora_admin / maint scripts.<br />
<br />
All these methods  lead to one error 514.<br />
<br />
My current baan env is <br />
<br />
version baan erp 5.0b<br />
Os - solaris<br />
oracle 8 on unix<br />
<br />
I have to deliver the installed servers by tommmorow. anyhelp in this matter is appreciated.<br />
<br />
thanking you in advance<br />
<br />
regards<br />
max</div></div><hr />

1.  Edit the Ora_users file.  Copy a line in the file and edit it to reflect the new user you are adding.<br />
bsp:bsp:encrypted_password:baan_group<br />
to<br />
new_user:bsp:encrypted_password:baan_group<br />
<br />
2.  Check out authorization into Oracle.  Make sure the baan_group is in Oracle.<br />
2.1  Make sure the new_users is in oracle and has authorizations to connect, and has the role/membership of the baan_group.<br />
2.2  Make sure the encypted_password is equal to the password in Oracle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maximus</div><div class="date">22nd April 2002, 05:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have checked the following things in the current environment.<br />
<br />
1. the user is present in baan &amp; unix.<br />
2. using the dba module in baan I an not able to create a entry in the ora_users file. It fires an error Invalid username / password. Error 12705. This error is logged in the log.ora8_maint.. file.<br />
3. I have tried creating user &amp; grp at oracle level &amp; then in baan &amp; then trying to link these two. But the I get the same error. <br />

Any inputs will be helpfull.<br />

Is your $BSE/lib/ora/ora_groups properly configured? Is your baan 'group' user able to logon to the database? e.g. you can test this by creating a dummy table using the session 'create tables'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maximus</div><div class="date">22nd April 2002, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes my baan group user is able to logon to the oracle db.<br />
<br />
Thruogh baan as well as through oracle sqlplus.<br />
<br />
But I still could not get the baan user converted to db user.<br />
<br />
I am still facing the NLS parameter issue.<br />
<br />
If any other info might be usefull in resolving the problem please do write back, I will be happy to provide the info.<br />

If so, the $BSE/lib/ora/ora_users file should contain:<br />

To add a new user to existing group copy and paste the previous line would do but the new group is difficult.<br />

When you cut and paste make sure the carriage returns and properly done in places.</div></div><hr />

I had to shorthen your post because the layout was, well a bit messed up. The NLS character set choice depends really on your application needs. You could still use US7ASCII. The important thing is that you keep the NLS settings compatable on database, server and client level. The index out of dims error is caused by updating the tables ttadv334/ttadv335/ttadv364 with conflicting NLS settings. Reason for that is it messes up the binary 'layout' fields of these tables.<br />
<br />
For characterset my recommendation however would also be to use WE8ISO8859P1 or similar.</div></div><hr />

Its NPRao ;-)<br />
<br />
and thanks for formatting the post.<br />

Can you please explain the cause and effect, background info about the different NLS settings. I didnt get any much info from BaaN on this topic, perhaps you can share your knowledge here.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

  Right now I have manually added the required users to the ora_users file. I am not very sure when the user might face a problem becasue of this. I have about a week with me to get the right solution so keep you thinking caps on &amp; pour in your ideas. I will try out the NLS config suggested . <br />

  If any other input is needed from me on this problem please post a message &amp; I will get back.<br />

<br />
Copying ora_user is a standard procedure recommended by implementation partner to non baan administrators and no problems in last 12months!<br />
<br />
Only thing no information stored in dba tables for this addition and next time do the same to link a baan user to db user.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing to keep into account is that you should make a choice as how to add/delete users: either you use the DBA module in Baan and convert to runtime - or - you manually manipulate the ora_users file each time. You will definatively get problems when you switch between both methods.<br />
<br />
NPRao, I will see if I can dig up a document that describes the NLS issues very well.</div></div><hr />

  I will stick to the current method of editing the ora_users file. I wanted to check that if I edit the ora_users file, do I still have to male entries in the baan dba tables. Are the entries required. The entries seem to be useless as these entries cannot be converted to the db users. But I have still maintained the entries. All the entries are with status &quot;Not yet created in RDBMS&quot;. Does the porting set or the tools version have a effect on this problem.<br />
I have 6.02a.03.03 installed on the servers. Do I need to upgrade the porting set or the tools<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ericthomas</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">You can modify runtime files and keep system running.<br />
But the rule is stick to one method. <br />
<br />
Remember to keep copy of these run time files.<br />
Remove from menu these sessions so no one attempt to create.<br />
<br />
Recommended practice is to follow inserting entries in tools table and do convert to run time files. You have two places where it stored. <br />
<br />
I joined a company where Oracle DBA was handling the baan admin and he opted to modify unix files and now no option(easy) to follow him!<br />
<br />
If you run any tools from baan VST or IBaanSupportEye tools then<br />
that will pick all these omissions to baan support.<br />
<br />
Even then filling the information on tables would solve that!!<br />
<br />
Give more information on OS,DB and Baan Version so we can recommend the portingset levels. <br />
6.1c.06.02 is stable and 03 introduce restriction on refers to.</div></div><hr />

I think the entries in your DBA tables are indeed useless if you stick to the direct method of changing the ora_users file. You can automate user maintenance to a good degree using UNIX shell scripts. I have always found the Baan DBA module in its current incarnation to be absolute useless.</div></div><hr />
