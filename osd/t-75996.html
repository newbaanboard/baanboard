<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jshanks</div><div class="date">23rd October 2023, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently changed our nls_sort setting to UCA0700_DUCET_VN based on recommendation from Infor (KB: 22853480). After this change, we are seeing performance degradation when running queries directly in Oracle. We are observing queries going for full table or full index scans instead of an avaible index. This is happening in our LN databases where the index type is &quot;function-based&quot;.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this kind of behavior?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jshanks</div><div class="date">1st November 2023, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we followed the process Infor has published. <br />
<br />
We escalated this to Infor and they have acknowledged that it might be something to do with function based indexes. Even though it was developed in partnership with Oracle, it was not benchmarked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">makiju</div><div class="date">4th November 2023, 23:44</div></div><div class="posttext">How was nls_sort before the change?<br />
And yes, this function based index -setup makes whole LN slow..there isn't way to fix it.<br />
You need to check how indexes are in Oracle...do they match with db_resource.<br />
Sometimes you can play with NLS_COMP -setting and also some parameters with alter session in db_resource.</div></div><hr />
