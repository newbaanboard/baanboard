We are running BaaN and SQL Server on Server 'A' with domain name as 'B', we would like to change the Domain name of the server to 'C'.<br />
<br />
<br />
B -----&gt; C<br />
<br />
Any suggestions / comments ... i am suspecting :o that probably SQL Server wont start once i change the domain name of the server ... is my guess correct ? If yes, then what are the steps that probably i may need to follow to make server run on new domain. As a precaution i have already taken BaaN and Sql Server backups ?<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried searching on google about Ms SQl Server domain name changes, but couldnt find much help on that. Any help/tips/suggestions would be appreciated. :confused:<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

Dont think this would affect the SQL Server. A SQL Server is server name specific and not Domain(to my knowledge). Just to make sure, check what name is present in the field &quot;Server&quot; in the SQL Server Service Manager. Ideally it will be just the server name instead of [servername.domain] or [Domainname\Servername] formats.. <br />
As far as your Domain name change is concerned, all you have to do is to have a user that has administrative rights on the new domain you are joining. <br />
Secondly, i am not sure you could directly make it join another domain from the existing one. Most probably you would have to take it off the current domain and make it join a temporary workgroup(called &quot;Workgroup&quot; for e.g.) and once it joins this workgroup and restarts, change from this workgroup to the new domain. Most probably you wouldnt have to do it this way but, in case you get an error &quot;You cant join this domain at this time&quot;(while changing the domain), then you could use the step i mentioned.<br />
 <br />
Do let us know how it goes..<br />

AFAIK, you will loose desktop data of server and your clients PCs, if your users are connecting to server B. So before doing it, take desktops backup and also all data backup of your server A.<br />

All the best!<br />

Thanks for the reply, i believe even BaaN licencing wont be affected since licencing is dependant on computer name / ip address and not on the domain name.<br />
<br />
Anyways thanks for the tips guy, will share my learnings with u once i complete this task. <br />
