<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">6th September 2004, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">in one of our installation,<br />
<br />
we have the SQL error reported frequently on table  tfgld106<br />
&quot;the table object cross linked with another table object  tdsls051.&quot;<br />
&quot;index corrupt&quot;.<br />
<br />
while finalisation or while creating sequential dump etc..<br />
<br />
temporarily we resolve it by re-organising it.<br />
<br />
sometimes the table itself becomes not accessible from within baan; <br />
it happens to other tables as well; like tdilc301, tdsls041 etc...<br />
<br />
what to doubt:<br />
Hardware<br />
SQL installation<br />
Harddisk<br />
<br />
Baan says it is SQL problem<br />
Microsoft checked and says it is not a SQL problem<br />
IBM checked the hardware and says hardware is ok<br />
<br />
what might be the problem.<br />
the database size is around 90 GB; We are on SQL 2000 Standard and not enterprise. Is enterprise edition mandatory....<br />
<br />
have u faced or any clues guys<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
In MSSQL 7.0 Standard Edition there was a limitation that baandb could not be greater than 10 GB. As far as I see you do have a larger database. Is there no such restriction on SQL 2000 ?<br />
<br />
Can you please let us know if you managed to solve the problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">6th October 2004, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">hi guys,<br />
<br />
we set the following things:<br />
<br />
1) paging size <br />
   (virtual memory was wrongly set as 2GB; it was increased to 6GB)<br />
<br />
2) concedentally users frequently complained lost connections with the server. While we checked Event Viwer too it was registered with lots of lost connections every now and then. Finally we removed a second network interface card and the lost connection problem is not there.<br />
<br />
After these two things for the past one month we dont have the above SQL problem. I dont know how the above points have relation to this problem. But seem to have worked.<br />
<br />
thanks guys<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">6th October 2004, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Do I see correctly that SQL complains about a link between tfgld106 and tdsls051? SQL should not be aware that these tables have a relation, So, I wonder if you or someone in your company made this relation. Can that cause this problem?<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
