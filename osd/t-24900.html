I know this is not the right fourum to post this message, but i m in deep trouble, could some help in installing the Oracle 10.1.0.2 (10G) on AIX 5.3, i had done the basic pre requisite as mentioned in the installation document provided by BaaN, but while running the runInstaller the system is throwing the following err.<br />

<br />
<br />
telnet (himalaya)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
$ ./runInstaller<br />

Problem is, oracle 10g is released for the newest version of HPux and AIX, but the installer doesn't know about it and fails during the OS check.<br />
<br />
If you are sure, you have the right media, then you can try:<br />
<br />
./runInstaller --ignorePrereq <br />
<br />
this will skip the check and worked for me nicely.<br />
<br />
The above installation glitch is only one of many, which I experienced. Another nice one is this: Once you install the current patch set, you can not add any components any more from the origional installation CD. So you have to choose from the very beginning everything you might need in the future.<br />
<br />
Also funny is this one: The Oracle RDBMS server needs about 900 MB on disk, the Oracle rdbms client needs 1100 MB. :-)<br />
<br />
And another one is this: If you need to install anything, which is on the companion CD, like Pro-C, then you can only install the whole CD, no selection possible.<br />
<br />
After two weeks installation and configuration nightmare with 10g, I was really looking with kind eyes on the good old Oracle 7 days.<br />

I agree. My installation succeeded in a few hours. Same problems, but with Google and Metalink I fixed these easily. On some systems tuning is easy, but we also have another testbox that behaves very weird: the first run is slow, the second as well and during the third run the system finally starts to perform. All have same excecution plans, but perform different. Oracle 10 should be self tuning, but I prefer the do-it-yourself days as we had in the good old 7 days.</div></div><hr />

I have to admit in these two weeks we did a bit more,then just install Oracle 10g, like consolidating 4 application servers to one, configuring clustering with MC/SG, configering DB control and enterprise manager in the cluster, setting up and automizing a logical standby database and integrating the unix authentication with windows domains.<br />
<br />
Without Metalink and Google we would have to give up somewhere in between and Oracle 10 was quite a pain. Around half the time was spent on Oracle 10 related issues.<br />
<br />
Anyway we have to live with the software they throw at us, I guess.<br />
