<br />
Can anyone suggest some software working like windows spotlight but for X terminals (particulary in Linux box)?  It's rather useful for RDMBS monitoring especially when baan is running. Searching in Internet didn't succeed yet. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 10:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Spotlight.exe is a very useful utility for DBA admins. It shows RDBMS state in colors and moving indicators - you can clearly see alerts, problems, heavy sql etc. It's a pity it is only windows running</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest. I hate these kind of products more and more as the user interface is so easy that even novice DBA's intend to be smart ;) . <br />
<br />
But seriously: These products have good parts but don't let these products take away your own interpretation of the environment.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

I think you're right. But newbie DBA never helps the situation whether he looks at 'spotlight' or not. Checking your own settings periodically of course is much better and reliable. I don't have any spotlight till now. Such a curious thing - windows users use it and Linux not. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps you could try that.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm not a fan of Spotlight or OEM.  Though both do have major features in certain areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">OEM and dbastudio are things we use every day. Sometimes it is worth to have the whole picture that spotlight can give but of course there are enough products which can help in administering data.</div></div><hr />
