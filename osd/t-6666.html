They posted some examples of Solaris/Unix exams (sysadmin certification) there. It was useful to look at the grade you are receiving after testing. But some strange thing i couldn't understand.

Everything except this was absolutely Solaris-looking like. Was it a joke? Undelete in Solaris? Undelete what? Can anybody say smth. upon a matter? The site is unofficial although.<br />
