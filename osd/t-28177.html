<br />
Is there any comparison document between Windows UNIX and AS400 specific for BaaN ERP?<br />
<br />
We have BaaN5.0c on Win 2000, with 100 user. If we move to AS 400, is it over kill solution for us?<br />
<br />
Needs your advise...<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />

<br />
i5/OS is not definitely an overkill, but you need to buy at least other hardware. The sizing guide (that your reseller or hardware vender should have) can help you in this.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
I do not wish to repeat myself .... but can't refrain from it.<br />
Did you know that linux is available as OS platform for Baan?<br />
You can buy a very cheap hardware which still is oversized and will give you excellent performance.<br />
This is NOT a neird or linux-freak opinion, it is simply the truth.<br />
If you are in need of a stable and fast system, do not exclude a linux based solution from the alternatives available.<br />
<br />

<br />
People buy i5/OS for other reasons than costs to buy. There are plenty of reasons why i5/OS can be a better solution than Linux. And vice versa of course ;) <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
Thanks for reply.<br />
<br />
Yes currently we are on Win 2000, but thinking to move to UNIX or I5.<br />
I have sizing guide and comparison between those OS from hardware vendor. I posted this inquiry because I need more objective feedback from the experts. :)<br />
<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Windows can scale to the largest of install bases. SQL on windows<br />
is probably the most cost effective solution available (excepting <br />
a linux based one...)<br />
