We are planning to upgrade to Baan ERP LN from BaanIVc4. The current environment of BaanIVc4 is running in HP-UX11.xx and Informix 11.50.XX. We will setup a new environment for LN with new hardware. If you have any experience on LN project, please let us know.<br />
1.	Which operating system is best suited for ERP LN?<br />
2.	Which database should we select for the ERP LN?<br />
3.	Anything advises would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

we went from MK 8.1 (quite similar to Baan 1V) to ERP LN FP5 a couple of years ago. MK ran on ISAM.<br />
We are quite a long established Aix user so for LN it was a fairly easy choice to stay with Aix. We run Oracle on the same server.<br />
It has been a pretty solid setup.<br />
hope that helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">17th January 2013, 02:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless you have a specific need, I'd recommend going with what most people are using because that gets the highest level of testing and attention/support from the vendors.<br />
<br />
For NT seems like that would be SQL Server.<br />
For Unix (AIX, HP, Linux) seems like that would be Oracle.<br />
<br />
I say seems based on my own past experience and postings as to what combinations most ERP-LN customers seem to have.  So although Informix is as good an RDBMS as Oracle (won't debate that here), there don't seem to be as many people running ERP-LN on Informix as on Oracle.  Again, I don't have hard numbers hence the word seem.  You could talk to your Infor rep and perhaps they could give you numbers or post a survey here or attend an Infor conference and ask around.<br />
<br />
See the notes regarding the latest porting set for ERP-LN and the RBDMS and Operating System notes along with any Infor Roadmap documentation (as well as general IT trends) and they will give you a better idea of support now and in the future.<br />
<br />
Again, try to avoid having a unique combination (hardware, OS, RDBMS, ERP) as that causes support issues.  For example in the 90's, I knew of a company that had 3 groups make selections separately whereby they picked from their sole perspectives the best hardware &amp; OS, the best RDBMS, the best ERP and when it all came together (with no final, summary review) they had something totally unique (Sequent, dynix/ptx, Informix (using level 1 driver), Baan IV) that apparently no other Baan customer had.  Turned out to have performance issues (not to mention support issues).  They subsequently migrated to Oracle (level 2 driver) in just a few months after going live.</div></div><hr />
