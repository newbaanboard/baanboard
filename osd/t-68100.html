We have migrated (yes, right now 2015) from an HP-UX environment where Baan IVc4 was running with Oracle 9i in the machine to a distributed environmente over Linux SLE9 (VMware virtual machines). <br />
So, we are experiencing performance problems with any task that can take long over 1 minute. As we thought, the new environment should give us an improvement of performance but just the opposite is what we've got. <br />
So tasks that were done in 10 minutes now delay for 30 or more minutes.<br />
We have deploy the system into two VM's:<br />
- One for Baan Application, 24GbRam, 18cpus, 4NICs<br />
- One for Oracle DDBB: 72GbRam, 24Cpus, 4NICs<br />
<br />
So, have you any tip for the kernel, baan, Oracle or any other configuration than can help to improve the performance? I think that the main problem is that the procesess in Baan machine have a lot of delay waiting for something I don't know. <br />
<br />
Please, can anybody give some light on this?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

<br />
are the Oracle versions of source and target system identical ? Is the $BSE environment a 1:1 copy ?<br />
<br />
If not, I would investigate the differences in spfile/init.ora and db_resource.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if Oracle 9 already has the html-based  enterprise management console, if yes and if the tuning pack is licensed, the tuning advisor might give some hints.<br />
<br />
For overall Oracle 9 parameters check Infor Support, KB815643.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<br />
After hours and hours of tunning worked out by a group of 5 technicians I think that the key was in the configuration of the Oracle VM. <br />
A the very first moment we reduce the number of cores of the VM from 24 to 6 if started to give us a very acceptable process times.<br />
For sure we changed all that can be changed to improve performance in Baan and Oracle that maybe have helped but the main milestone was the number of VM cores in Oracle.<br />

changing the cores on oracle db also affects licensing cost, in this case, you would probably get licensing benefit. Talk to your Oracle sales rep.</div></div><hr />
