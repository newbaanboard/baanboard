<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gameover</div><div class="date">3rd July 2003, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We have migrated the BaaN server from RS6000 (AIX O.S.) to an H.P server in W2000 O.S.<br />
<br />
Now all BaaN conections must be in BW, and are O.K.<br />
<br />
But we have an application that must connect to the BaaN server W2K in BA mode (ascii terminal). It is a Barcode Trakker with an Ascii emulator, that do the Warehouse Receptions.<br />
<br />
I think, I must to use that conection across the RS6000 where I have defined the User, and the remote User.<br />
<br />
In the AIX .profile of the user I use this<br />
<br />
DS_AS=se-svbaan1!bshell   <br />
export DS_AS              <br />
<br />
It run perfect, but the problem is that I can't print. When I do this the session is inhibited.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me.<br />
<br />
Excuse my english<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

Then you can really switch of the RS6000. :(<br />
<br />
As for printing, just one question jumps to my mind: can you print to that same device from another (windows) client?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can consider printing to a file on disk using a ASCIT like device (maybe with a printer definition file...) and have &quot;at&quot; schedule a print *.* del *.* command on the directory where you put your printfiles into...<br />
<br />
It is just a conceptual idea, I have not tested this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I can print from a BW client in a Zebra printer with CodeBar.<br />
<br />
I think the error is that in a BA Session there is not a BWPRINT to manage ReportSend between W2K Spool and local Terminal.<br />

For  OmeLuuk <br />
 <br />
