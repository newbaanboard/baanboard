<br />
<br />
We did the migration to Solaris 8 and Portind Set 6.1c.06.04 but couldn't connect with Informix.  We get the next error:<br />
<br />
# finderr 25572 <br />
 -25572 Network driver cannot bind a name to the port. <br />
<br />
 A system call has failed. The sqlexecd daemon or database server cannot <br />
 access the network port that is specified by the servicename in the <br />
 sqlhosts file. This situation might occur because the network port is <br />
 already in use by another sqlexecd, database server, or other <br />
 application. Use a different servicename on the command line (prior to <br />
 Version 6.0) or in the sqlhosts file (beginning with Version 6.0). <br />
 Contact your system administrator for assistance<br />
<br />
 -- We tried to resolve the problem, but we couln't resolve it. We also install informix on the application server and it could connect with the Data Base Server.<br />
<br />
 --  Thanks for you help<br />
<br />
 -- I like to know if someone have this configuration and if had some troubles with the migration.<br />
