<br />
We use Windows NT 4 as our primary server. <br />
For BaaN (BaaN 50c), we use Windows 2000 advanced server as our secondary server.<br />
<br />
When users login into BaaN (on the secondary server), they use the same username and password with their network username and password.<br />
All informations about username and password are stored in the primary server.<br />
<br />
Now, we want to use Windows 2003 as the primary server. For BaaN, we still use Windows 2000 advanced server as the secondary server.<br />
<br />
But when we trial this new system, users cannot login into BaaN with the same username and password as their's on network.<br />
We have to create new username and password first for each user in the secondary server. Our users can login into BaaN only with this new username and password. <br />
<br />
Why this problem occur ? Did we miss some settings on our server and BaaN ? Any solutions ?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Marsel</div></div><hr />

Baan (in Windows) receives its authentication from the domain of which it is a member.  I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
