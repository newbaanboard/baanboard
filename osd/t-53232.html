Therefore I've checked the onconfig-file and maybe found the potential reason for the poor performance - the parameter RA_PAGES is set to 0 and RA_TRESHOLD doesn't have any value. Because we're using IDS 10FC5 which is not recommended to use with our portingset the mentioned parameter is set as described. On a former portingset we didn't even set this parameter and the system was running fine and fast enough. <br />
<br />
Am I right that the RA_PAGES and RA_TRESHOLD parameters can influence the overall performance of a system which is using a huge DB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">5th August 2008, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I just checked our new live system which is Informix 10.00.FC5 (but level II) and porting set 6.1c.07.17 (because we're on IVc4), but our onconfig has RA_PAGES 64 and RA_THRESHOLD 48. Our informix admin must have set these values. (There is another file onconfig.std which contains RA_PAGES and RA_THRESHOLD without values). The performance of that system is okay so far, even with lots of data. But remember: I'm no Informix admin and we're on IVc4 - so be careful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">5th August 2008, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting. I wonder why Infor says this DB version shouldn't be used (or at least with the mentioned parameters left empty) as it works fine. It would be interesting to know if there is someone who uses similar configuration/combination (LN+FP3+Informix).<br />

Edit:<br />
<br />
We have run &quot;Update Statistics&quot; on Informix what dramatically improved performance. Some sessions still remain slow, so the option with RA_PAGES/RA_TRESHOLD may still improve the performance.</div></div><hr />
