Would it be better to have LN6 running on a separate application and database server or is it faster running on a combined application/database server. At present we are running on a combined server but as we are going to migrate to new hardware we are wondering which is the best setup.<br />
In case of two separate servers the link between the servers would be of course be made with fibercables.<br />
<br />
Our current environment is single logistic multi finance. and our database is currently approx. 150 GB<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onceuponatime</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">There are tradeoffs. Having the application as well as the database may definitely give better performance, but you run the risk of losing everything in Baan (application and data) if something goes wrong with your server. Besides, since your database size is large, it would be a good idea to use a separate server for the database. It will also help your Baan administrator and database administrator to work on their own in case of problems. However separating the servers would complicate things a bit, setup wise. In the end, you call the shots.</div></div><hr />

having all one one box will perform the best if CPU's are of same speed and you are not CPU bound. This as you eliminate the network. The network can be fast, but it is always slower than no network. <br />
<br />
Deciding to use 2-tier vs 3-tier is something that you don't deside in 5 minutes. There are a dozen of reasons to think about when you discuss this topic. You can read a lot on this topic on this board.<br />

Our current setup is 1 server with 8GB ram 4 Dual Xeon processors and a SAN box for storage. This server is running both the application and the Database and as mentioned earlier the database is currently approx. 150 GB and rapidly growing. The numbers of concurrent users are 100 give or take a little.<br />
My concern right now is that I seem to be able to get better performance on a much smaller server running on local disks. Are we perhaps outgrowing the MS platform and need to move to a different platform?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">10th October 2006, 10:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Measure is my first idea. To elaborate this a bit more:<br />
- measure how much your CPU utilization is. If it is less than 95% on peak level 3-tier will not benefit you.<br />
- measure if your database is preforming optimal. Even if you have fast disks, reading from disks is slower than from memory<br />
- measure if your baan environment is not having issues.<br />
<br />
100 users on a 4 way dual xeon box is not bad in general. 150Gb is nothing for a well tuned database. But the application can maybe have some bad parts that give you the idea that you outgrow your server.<br />
<br />
let me know if this is sufficient for you or that you need some more help. At least this link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7665) can help you I assume.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
