<br />
I have recently written a paper on row level security in Oracle for<br />
publication by security focus. This paper is a two part paper and the<br />
first part is published, the second part will be published later this<br />
week.<br />
<br />
part one introduces row level security, talks about the various names it<br />
has and also why you might want to use it with listed advantages. I go<br />
on to talk about how it works and how to implement a simple example<br />
working through the various steps with example code. I then go on to<br />
test the example with differing scenarios to check it performs against<br />
the business rules defined. I talk about a couple of issues and tips.<br />
<br />
part two goes on to look into how to explore the database looking at<br />
what row level security settings are in use or indeed if it is in use,<br />
by querying v$ views, I also discuss how to use the dictionary views to<br />
understand the setup and then go on to explore how to derive the SQL<br />
including predicate from the database and also how to see if row level<br />
security is in use by inference. I also discuss some of the issues with<br />
its use. As usual I also throughout make suggestions about protecting<br />
what configuration can be read from the database.<br />
