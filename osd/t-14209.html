<br />
I am currently using a Unix script to prevent user from multiple login thru baan client (GUI). I use the shell() command in baan to execute this unix script.<br />
<br />
However recently we make a change on the client where the login method is change from &quot;Rexec&quot; to &quot;Baanlogin&quot;. Now I found that my script is running without those &quot;if&quot; statement being check.<br />
<br />
Anyone encounter similar situation or can provide any suggestion to this problem I encounter?<br />
<br />
Thank u very much.<br />

<br />
Instead, why don't you direct your ipc_info line to your unix script and then start a bshell only if the user meets your criteria?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yeoea1</div><div class="date">30th January 2004, 01:31</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, you are right. I test for multiple bshell session using &quot;licmon6.1 -w |grep $LOGNAME&quot; to check if more than 1 session and kill off the current session if more than 1. I have found out that the reason my script fail to work. <br />
<br />
It seem that if we using rexec method, the $LOGNAME variable in Unix is the users login ID. However if we use the baanlogin method which require blogind6.1 to run in the server, the $LOGNAME of all users become &quot;root&quot;. I suspect that the ID is related to the blogind6.1 running in the server. Currently I have change the $LOGNAME to $USER for it to work.<br />
<br />
Regarding this ipc_info line, where can I find it and how do I do that? I am certainly interested to try it out.<br />
<br />
Thank again.</div></div><hr />
