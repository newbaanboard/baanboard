<br />
rexec is the client program for the rexec daemon running on the server (service), but I think there is no way to run a program on the client initiated from the server...<br />
<br />
There is a special thing about rexec on the AIX... something with ports... AIX has some kind of security feature that causes problems. Also discussed here before...</div></div><hr />
