<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexpreyer</div><div class="date">8th December 2009, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Since we're started running Baan on SLES 10 and Oracle 10 we have one or two times a month an issue. Users try to login to Baan and get only the Baan logo on screen. On the server an ora8_srv6.1 process is started and running with 100% of CPU usage for each user trying to login. Restarting the database or the Baan services on the server are without success. Only restarting the whole server where the Baan Services are running helps (we have the Baan application running on a different server than the Database). There's no need to restart the database server. Additional we have on our Database Server also the Baan application installed for emergency cases. At the moment our user normal working with Baan, but on the database server, the Baan application has the issiue. Both, our users and the emergency Baan installation, working with the same database. Also, when the issue appears, normal sql scripts run normal without errors, only Baan gets no connection to the database. Had anyone such an behavior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">8th December 2009, 22:54</div></div><div class="posttext">but you could try to find the cause by using DBSLOG=077777 as soon as the problem occurs again. Perhaps the dbs.log file in your home directory can point you in the right direction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexpreyer</div><div class="date">9th December 2009, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried your sugesstion and compared the dbs.log from the server where the issue appears and the working server. On the &quot;issue&quot; server the log ends after the list of all users in group &quot;baan&quot;.<br />
The working dbs.log show afterwards messages from the oracle client. It seems that Baan is not able to set up a connection.</div></div><hr />

And your sqlnet logs on either side do not contain any information about what's going wrong?<br />
<br />
Guess you have to log an inquiry so Infor can assist. I don't have a clue right now what's going wrong.<br />

There's no trace on Oracle side showing that Baan has connected. So I hope Infor can help.</div></div><hr />

That's what I've done some weeks ago. The problem is, I cannot get the Enterprise Manager for the web browser run. And the Infor supporter only will help me when he can use this tool.<br />
Anyway, meanwhile I also analyzed together with an Oracle expert which proofed me that no communication from Baan to Oracle exists. Other services and scripts are running normal. So I suppose one of the portingset components which are neccessary for connecting Oracle are hanging.</div></div><hr />

For what reason do they require this tool? This makes no sense to me.<br />

If it is the bshell or the driver, then we have a ps issue, if it is the server process, it is an Oracle issue. <br />

The name of the process ist ora8_srv6.1. It's definitly no Oracle issue, because on Oracle side there's nowhere a sign from Baan. Not in the listener.log and not in the sqlnet.log. It seems the Baan driver doesn't find Oracle. We had this issue on our fallback server for some weeks now (fine for analyzing) but today the issue dissapeared what never happend before without a restart. So, I cannot anymore analyze the problem :-( Bthw. this monday we had the issue on our life server again, but there we have immediatly to restart get get it work again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that actually sounds like an oracle client libraries issue.<br />
<br />
Are oracle and baan on the same box? <br />
<br />
If so, what version of oracle? if not what version of the client-libs are you using?<br />
<br />

Our productive Baan System is on a seperate server, but on the database server Baan is also installed for emergency cases. We had the issue on both Baan installations, the remote and the local installation. In case of the issue only one of the systems is affected and the other one can work normal.</div></div><hr />

Oh sorry, I forgot. I'm using Oracle 10.2.0.1. What do you mean with client libraries?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">25th January 2010, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, there were some issues with 10.2.0.1 if i remember correctly.<br />
<br />
10.2.0.4 i think is the safe bet.<br />
<br />
the client libaries would be the oracle client install that you did on the Baan server to allow baan to talk to oracle.<br />

To go to 10.2.0.4 I planed as next step. I've heard also about problems with 10.2.0.1. Hope that helps.<br />

Our SLES 10 does not know the getenforce command. I also had a look at the log (/var/log/messages), but there's no entry you described. I set my hope on upgrading Oracle now.</div></div><hr />

Let´s try the obvious. Have you tried to logon on the application server when the issue appears?<br />
<br />
Perhaps, the login service (or rexec service) is down and that´s why the users can´t logon. If that is the case, you not need to reboot the server, reexecuting inet.d services file is enough.<br />
<br />
Again, if is that the case, the problem may be caused by killed baan sessions or SO patches or kernel parameters (my best shoot).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
