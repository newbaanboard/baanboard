<br />
I am planning to install LN6.1 in a 64bit Operationg system. (Can be windows 2k, 2k+3, XP or Vista). What are the advantages and disadvantages of the same ? Need I to perform some additional steps while installing ?<br />
<br />
I have gove through the compatibily issues of 3rd party softwares documentaed on microsoft site. But don't no about BaaN.<br />
Need help to take a decision for buying the new OS with SQL.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You can use Windows-Server 2003 and SQL Server 2005 in 64bit mode with no problem. (i have tried it out).<br />
you should do that because of the 32bit memory-limitation (especially for sql-server). The ERPLN Application itself will run in 32bit mode with no remarkable performance gains. <br />
<br />
hope that helps, Martin</div></div><hr />

The advantage is that your database can take more than 3 Gb of memory. This is required for some users. Disadvantage for the Oracle 10 users (don't know about Oracle 9) is that no 32 bit client libraries are delivered with the 64 bit installation. You have to install the a 32 bit Oracle client on the server as well. So it is not possible to connect via pipes/BEQ. Only a connection via the network layer can be done. This gives less performance. But if you run Client/Server, this is no problem, just make sure you install the 32 bit client on the application server in that case.<br />
