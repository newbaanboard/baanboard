<br />
We've got one at 116 million rows, and two others at 50 million.  Performance is really dragging on sessions hitting those tables.<br />
<br />
Seems like we would partition on T$TRDT, but I need know if the SQL that Baan generates puts that column in the &quot;where&quot; clause.  I'm wokring with teh DBA and Baan admin to try and grab that SQL, but I thought I'd throw the comment out to the community and see if anyone has some insight for me.<br />
<br />
700GB database on EMC CX3-20, Dell poweredge quad CPU, 16GB ram is specs of the database.<br />
<br />
Thnaks Much.</div></div><hr />

It will be 10-20% of the original size, which means much less reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">10th February 2010, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">So here's my concern with partitioning.<br />
<br />
Baan almost always sends a HINT clause with every query, that HINT specifies an index.<br />
<br />
In a partitioned setup the index names change, I'm not sure if oracle is able to behind the scenes, translate <br />
HINT ttfgld410100$IDX1<br />
to<br />
ttfgld410100-TRDT-IDX or whatever the slices index name is.<br />
<br />
how do partitioned tables handle that?<br />
<br />
Without hints baan performance is frequently horrible, so you buy some performance in one area and it becomes horrible in others.<br />

<br />
Hi, <br />
<br />
Does Baan Oracle drive handle Oracle Partitioning? we are considering to implement Partitioning, Oracle 11g with ASM. <br />
<br />
Please clarify. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Oracle partitioning is done for better tuning/maintenance. I don't see any problem with LN application in using Oracle Partitinong of LN Tables. <br />
However if any table is reorged( i.e. table is dropped and recreated) from LN then the partition needs to be recreated from Oracle.</div></div><hr />
