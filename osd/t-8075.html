<br />
We use 4c3 and Oracle 7.3.3 (it contains full patch set). Our system is SGI Irix Unix and porting set is 6.1c.02.02. <br />
<br />
We want to upgrade from 7.3.3 to 8.* on Unix. Is it possible? How can we do it?  Does our porting set support this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I do not have any personal experience with Irix/SGI.  But I would check on the Baan support web site for the latest porting set support for your platform.  From 7.3.3 to 8.17 is a multi step process which I have gone through on Sun and HP, and it works fine on those platforms.<br />

Thanks for interest, But we didn't solve our problem. We wait to other suggestions.<br />

- Newer version of database request newer version of database driver (database engine is mainly backwards compatible, but if you want to use enhanced functionality of higher versions, you need to update your engine as well)<br />
- Newer database driver is delivered in a newer portingset<br />
- Do you ever install newer software in the Baan system (solutions)? So why no update on the portingset.<br />
<br />
If you buy a new car, I assume you do not replace the new engine with your old engine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, thanks for your information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you do no porting set update?&quot; is good question. We asked to exist newly portingset from Baan at 2000, but Baan closed office in our country. Now, we haven't support agreement since 2 years. We must update our porting set but how can we get newly porting set ? Can you do it for Irix or Linux? (We are using Irix enhancement for 7.3.3.6.64) Or Would you say other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because Baan closed your home support office doesn't mean that you can't renew your Service contract!<br />
<br />
If you can't update your porting set then install Oracle 8i (or 9i) on your Linux box and move to a 3 tier setup. The impact of the Oracle 7 driver will be less of a problem because the DB communication will be handled by Sqlnet.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

Better wait some more months (I suppose) for the Linux portingsets to be delivered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">14th December 2002, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">From the information of bug fixes from the portigsets and the download ftp location, the last postingset for SGI was 6.1c.05 and this one was the first portingset to include support for Oracle8i (8.1).<br />
This is your only change to go to Oracle8i in SGI but you should however confirm that this is correct with Baan itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would you tell me which FTP location (Or TCP/IP) and user_name?  If I upgrade my porting set,  must I have new license key? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anthono</div><div class="date">16th December 2002, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The latest porting set for SGI (BaanIV) is<br />
Portingnr        : PA.1965<br />
Portingset      : 6.1c.06.03<br />
Date               : Fri Mar 29 13:59:13 CET 2002<br />
<br />
This porting set only contains an oracle7 and informix database driver. Baan never shipped  Oracle 8 support for SGI.<br />

Please contact Baan support for further information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me that no matter what, you will have to establish some kind of service agreement with BGS (Baan Global Support).<br />
<br />
Notice the Global part. lol<br />
<br />
Although you probably won't be able to benefit from the services of BGS (some might ask: What services?), you need access to their website and ftp site in order to obtain upgrades to your current system.<br />
You might also need a word of advice from the people who know what is actually in the database drivers.<br />
<br />
Finally of course there is the option to change your unix flavor (and face it, that might be your only option).<br />
<br />
You're in a jam my friend, which is not uncommon in this line of work. I would suggest you first look at all your options, price them and come up with a proper cost analysis.<br />
Then make a feasibility study and see what options are open to you.<br />
After that, get a hold of BGS and work something out with them (I'm sure you'll find them most helpfull, if not, make sure to post your experiences here on the board).<br />
If by this time you have not yet committed harakiri in your back-office, it is time to develop a project plan and get on it.<br />
<br />
Just remember, its only Monday.</div></div><hr />
