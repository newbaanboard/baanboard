<br />
I have this weird problem,<br />
<br />
I have migrated to a test server with the above config, win 2003, oracle 9 and baan 4c4.<br />
<br />
Everything is ok. I tried adding a new item group and a new contract and save them. There is no problem.<br />
<br />
The problem is when i add a new SO or a new PO, and click on save, error msg appears 'update cancelled'. That's it, and the new order is not saved.<br />
<br />
What is wrong? What must i check as i cannot save any new SO and PO now.<br />
I am guessing the problem lies in oracle. What must i check in oracle?<br />
<br />
Thanks n regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
'migrated' means moved a functional company or are we talking about a test company?<br />
If the latter is the case, then I would guess that some parameters have to be set ...<br />
What do the Baan logfiles say? Oracle should have its own logfiles, but I can't tell you where to find them. But on a M$ system one can at least search for files called *log* :-)<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

Once a similar problem I had when migrate from Informix  7.31 to DB2, on my case the problem was at the configuration of the database engine, there are some parammeters on the file configuration that were overwritted when the migration occurs. So in a similar situation of upgrade, maybe, this happen to you! So I suggest you compare the startup configuration of your Oracle.<br />

Good luck!</div></div><hr />
