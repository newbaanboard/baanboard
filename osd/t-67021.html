<br />
Does someboy have a tool to 'clean' a testing environment?<br />
Such like only keep the parameter, setttings, however, only clean the dynamic data (purchase order, sales order etc).<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

You can go for Data Archiving in case you need to back the data and then delete the data.<br />
<br />
Follow the archiving documentation provided by Infor.</div></div><hr />

Data archiving is a huge work load for this requirement.<br />
Espicial for during the test period, I think maybe some script to truncate the table should works.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks a lot for your reply.<br />

 <br />
I can only give you some thought how we started with Baan. We kept parameters in a different company. When we decided to start a new test from scratch, we completely removed our test company and created that company new. So all tables were empty at that moment. Then we copied the basic tables from our parameter company to the test company (btw. with database tools, not with baan tools).<br />
 <br />
Another note: Removing might take very Long, because the database can check references!<br />
 <br />

Run the session count records by table (ttaad4222m000) to get a list of all tables that contain data. Then edit that list to include only the tables you want to keep. Save that list as a file and run bdpre from a command prompt specifying that file. You will get a dump of just the tables you want. Then delete all the tables in your test company. Then import the dump back into your test company and finally run create tables to create the remaining empty tables</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we refresh our test companies we take a dump of the prod companies. To make it take less time we only dump tables that contain data.<br />
Actually what we did the first time was to split the list into multiple files based on the size of the tables and run the dumps in parallel.<br />
<br />
For our situation we keep all the tables that have data.<br />
For the OP's scenario I would delete all tables except the &quot;static data&quot; tables. Obviously you would need a pretty good idea of what references there are between tables to keep your referential integrity intact.<br />
I have never done this so it was just a suggestion but I do not see any reason why it would not work.</div></div><hr />
