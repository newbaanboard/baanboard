<br />
I don't think and never seen, Tool Tips are available in BaaN IV.<br />
<br />
If I am not mistaken, Tools Tips are the small tips occurred when you point to windows component. Is it? <br />

I think the baan has provided this facility in another way, if you want the help on any field then you can take it by pressing question mark sign on button bar &amp; release it over that field. After all baan is used by experts who don't need such help. I think baan has concentrated on functional aspects rather than designing. <br />

<br />
The reason for the lack of tooltips is a totally different one.  The BW is not a true Windows application if compared to other Microsoft products.  It was a quick porting of an X-windows interface to the MS platform. Moreover, it had to stay fully compatible with the BA as well as the BX interfaces.  Baan only moved away from this when they dropped the BA interface in BaanV.<br />
<br />
Actually, the BW is a dumb interface.  Let me explain this statement a bit more: In BW, a form is built on the fly, from instructions received from the bshell.  After that, all actions taken on the form, have to be sent back to the bshell for processing.  The BW (in BaanIV) does not even know what a field's name is, nor what kind of data the field is expecting.  It only knows the top, left co-ordinate, the width and height, and whether the field is left or right aligned.  There is no intelligence whatsoever. (That is the reason why it was so difficult to create a  web-based (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10116) version!)<br />
<br />
Further, in the form designer tables (ttadv30x), there is no comment line which could be filled and maybe displayed as a Tooltip.  Baan isn't going to modify this, since BaanIV development is long time over.  An alternative would be to export the corresponding field labels, although it would be a bit cryptic sometimes!  But again, Baan isn't going to change it.  The change would involve modifications of the (nt)bshell(6.1/.exe), ba6.1, bx6.1 and bw.exe, because the field-message logic would have to be changed to include the tooltip.</div></div><hr />
