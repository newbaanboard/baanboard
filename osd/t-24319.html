Backups are done using ontape -s (daily) logs are currently backed up to tape.<br />
I wish to set up another identical server to act as a test environment but also to act as a Disaster Recovery server, i.e. I will locate it in another site on the network and recover &quot;live&quot; data to it as needed. (I do not wish to mirror the servers) Has anyone else used this approach?</div></div><hr />

U can do the replication either at OS level or DB  level. U need to have extra Baan environment installed at the new server . Ur runtime objects , dictionaries also need to be replicated to the order server . U need to revalidate ur baan environment to have network licensing  from SSA.</div></div><hr />

In the event of a problem with the live server I would expect to restore the /baan/* filesystem on the standby server from a recent backup of the live, then do a cold restore (ontape -r) of the data and logical logs.<br />
<br />
I believe the only problem would then be the BaaN license validation.<br />

If u have the same hostname as the original one (in the event of problem with live server) , and have brand file also copied to the backup server , it should work. <br />
<br />
In the same LAN , it wont be possible to have the 2 servers with same hostname.</div></div><hr />
