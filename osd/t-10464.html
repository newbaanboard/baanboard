<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">22nd June 2003, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We used to be on NT4, SQL 6.5, 4c3MCR.  <br />
We found SQL 6.5 really unreliable and migrated to SQL7 around 6 months after going live in 1999. SQL 7 was much much better than SQL6.5 - I am surprised you are still using it!<br />
<br />
We migrated to Win2000, SQL2000 &amp; 4c4MCR just over a year ago. All are on improvement on what we had before but the biggest improvement was the move from 4c3MCR to 4c4MCR. It is so much more of a stable system and then the benefit of PMC on top.  <br />
<br />
If you can i would advise going the extra mile to 4c4MCR if you can.<br />
<br />
We actually bought another server to do (and test) our upgrade. It was the same spec. as our live server but being 2+ years old was pretty cheap. We actually migrated on to it over a weekend.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I do not know all the tools steps involved in the migration but i think it was quite straight forward, just time consuming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've migrated from SQL7.0 to SQL 2000 a few months ago.<br />
Followed the Baan migration manual carefully...and had a few problems because of that.<br />
<br />
So, my advice is be carefull if you change parameters in tabledef6.1 and db_resource. Some of those refered in the manual do not work on some portingsets...<br />
<br />
One of the the problems I had was error 305...which is referred in this thread...<br />
