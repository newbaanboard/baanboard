Does anybody know how to force ufsdump utility to work under the script control. The single problem is that after making the dump (just OK ) the utility asks whether to restore files privileges and owners ? Yes or no? And waits for interactive input. The script stops and waits also. It has -y (yes) option but it concerns another case, not file privileges. What is the correct way of getting the standart &quot;y&quot; input and make it work without using keyboard.<br />
It is SunOS 5.8. Solaris 8.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Pat, first of all i had misspelled utility name - of course i was asking about ufsrestore. The problem is that it asks for input twice - the volume number (some positive digit) and only after it y or n for stamping file permissions and owners. Any idea of echoing twice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally the 'yes' command will output a 'y' repetively so it should not matter how many question ufsrestore is asking. Did you try:<br />
<br />
# yes | ufsrestore &lt;options&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that ufsrestore asks DIFFERENT questions and you have first time type '1' and then f.e. y</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh oh my fault, I did not read your post correctly :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
What if you put the all the answers - if you know them - in a text file, then redirect the file into the command?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Pat , i put all the output in text file (corrected in vi),<br />
maybe the solution is quite simple smth. like two pipes with 1 and y.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmm, maybe the tool requires hard terminal input to work. I don't have a Solaris box here but I see that the ufsrestore command has the '-rsf' switches for non-interactive/non-verbose mode. Have you tried playing around with them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of the options make effect at the problem. Even worse- Solaris began to ask more questions :)<br />
The solution we found out was very simple. Here is line we used at last :<br />
 echo &quot;1\ry\r&quot;|ufsrestore xvf /dev/rmt/1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Now why didn't I think of that? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Pat, maybe because it turned out to be too simple :)<br />
One more question i am asking for a while but still having no result. Where can anyone order and buy new version of Knowledge Quest Folio? Our contractors also have only 1997 issue. Baan had changed since that time.) I don't think it costs a lot.  Can you prompt? :</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Old Vens, <br />
<br />
I have no idea. I would not be surprised if the KQ CD is not supported/updated anymore. Maybe one of our Baan members can shed some more light?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 12:32</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a pity then.<br />
Unfortunately nobody prompted me about KQ. Some don't know about it at all. And yours version also dated by 1997? Maybe KQ indeed got ruined?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 13:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, my version is ancient.</div></div><hr />
