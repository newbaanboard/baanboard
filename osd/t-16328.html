<br />
BaanIVc4 SP15<br />
Portingset 6.1c.07.02<br />
Informix 9.40 - using Level2 drivers<br />
running on Solaris 9<br />
*<br />
We have implemented most of Baan performance  recommendations for Informix with level 2 drivers; kernel tuning, db_resource  settings, onconfig etc<br />
*<br />
... until we got to the bit regarding update  statistics<br />
*<br />
For level1 drivers it simply says &quot;run update  statistics low&quot; which is fine, but for level2 it says that update statistics is  vital for performance before stating a confusing combination of recommendations  regarding some 'high', some 'low' and some 'medium'.* Can anyone recommend  a general setting we can apply to all tables?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">triton45</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 00:22</div></div><div class="posttext">For more in depth suggestions from Informix, you should read the performance tuning guide at: http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/informix/pubs/library/<br />
<br />
I think in general you are safe running Medium on the table and indexes.<br />
<br />
I use a script called 'dostats'.  It is part of a collection of scripts called 'utils2_ak' and can be found at: http://www.iiug.org/software/index_DBA.html.  This script creates the sql for the statistics commands according to Informix recommendations for all tables in a database.<br />
<br />
I am running 7.31 with level 1, but I have put indexes on certain tables to help with reporting.  An example of statistics sql from dostats for table tdpltc006150 with an index on t_mcno, t_dtof, t_tmof<br />
<br />
UPDATE STATISTICS MEDIUM FOR TABLE tdpltc006150  DISTRIBUTIONS ONLY;<br />
UPDATE STATISTICS HIGH FOR TABLE tdpltc006150 (t_mcno) DISTRIBUTIONS ONLY;<br />
UPDATE STATISTICS LOW FOR TABLE tdpltc006150 (t_mcno, t_dtof, t_tmof);<br />
<br />
On a side note, how is 9.40?  How is level 2 on 9.40?  We are looking at moving in the next year.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
FROM IVC4-SP7 /Informix 7.30(level 1) TO IVC4-SP15/Informix 9.40(level 1). <br />
<br />
We are also planning to move database to new server along with upgradation. Do you suggest any faster way for data migration apart from Baan bdbpre-&gt;Ftp-&gt;bdbpost ?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the replies. I will update this thread on a regular basis as we progress. <br />
<br />
We are currently running the table reorg for our new company which is extremely time consuming. The import also consumed more disk space than we were expecting so we obviously need to do some investigation into why this occured.<br />
<br />
On the issue of the quickest way of transfering data we are using the Baan bdbpre-&gt;Ftp-&gt;bdbpost technique.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">triton45</div><div class="date">2nd September 2004, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I would definitely suggest using Informix tools for the migration.  During our last upgrade (IVb2 -&gt; IVc4 and new boxes), we were able to move and load 120G of data in under 6hrs.  This was a mix of high performance loader, dbload and some heavy scripting.  You can also use dbexport and dbimport which will unload and load the whole database.<br />
<br />
If you are not as familiar with the Informix tools, I would suggest visiting www.iiug.org (Informix User Group) and browsing the software available, especially myexport.<br />
