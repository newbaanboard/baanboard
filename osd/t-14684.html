<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmeddeler</div><div class="date">3rd March 2004, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, we are forced to migrate our stable SCO OpenServer environment to another. At the moment we are running Baan IVc4 with the bisam-database on a 4 proc. Intel-machine.<br />
<br />
So, what are the options when we want to migrate with minimum costs, effort and user-disturbance? If possible, we want to keep our server. In that case, is Windows 2000 the only option?</div></div><hr />

According to this post SSA is testing a portingset with Suse linux:<br />

<br />
maybe it's worth to ask SSA for the status of this project.<br />
<br />
I am afraid there are no other alternatives if you want to keep your system.<br />

Gerhard, I know you are close to the source so this can only mean that SSA is going to launch a Linux offensive! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmeddeler</div><div class="date">10th March 2004, 23:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I know a Linux-portingset is coming and is probably ready-to-use in summer 2004. Of course, that is not an option for us. You do not want 60 users to depend on something that new!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile I have spoken to several people. I think I have three options: <br />
1. upgrade the current server with a lot of memory to use Windows 2000 with SQL server (performance and stability will go down)<br />
2. buy a new server with HP-UX and keep the current database (it will cost some Â€).<br />
3. keep the current server and database and be careful with updates. The chance of non-working updates because of the old porting-set is minimal and acceptable.<br />
<br />
So, dear people, what do you think?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">11th March 2004, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Well people know my opnion on this matter: Windows is NOT an option in my books. But why only consider HP-UX? Why don't you perform a comparative analysis for HP-UX, Solaris and AIX platforms. Just one word of caution: I would not consider Itanium under any circumstances though I am not sure if Baan is supporting the platform or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">15th March 2004, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends how much is changed for getting the portingset to work. I actual have ported the bshell a few times in the past and getting to work on  a different unix platform did only take a few days or even less. <br />
<br />
So I wouldn't think of it as completely new... <br />
<br />
I personally would use/test it for about half a year to get the serious bugs out, than convert your SCO server to linux.<br />

<br />
I just got word that the first Baan customer is live with BaanIV on Linux, as a beta, switching from SCO UNIXware.  So at least one customer depends on something that new :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, I do not think you look at it with an independent view, seeing where your workplace is ;)</div></div><hr />
