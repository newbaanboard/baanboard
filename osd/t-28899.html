<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chadwickh</div><div class="date">13th December 2006, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">We have created Oracle privileges for some Baan tables for an Oracle web app user (such as select privilege on the baan.ttiitm001100 table). Whenever these Baan tables get modified with a new column (I just love how Baan reconfigures tables), this user loses the privilege and it has to be regranted back. As you can imagine, the script doesn't get executed sometimes. Has anybody gotten around this problem? I'd like to set up a database trigger or something. Maybe when the schema is altered to check the privileges on certain tables and grant privileges on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gary_Shaw</div><div class="date">14th December 2006, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I've wrestled with this problem also.  I used to keep a script with every grant I had made on BaaN tables.  I would then rerun the script after the table reconfigs.  Unfortunately, I would often forget to run the script.  <br />
I adopted a new strategy.  I now create Oracle views of all the tables that I want to access from outside of BaaN.  I grant permissions on the view.  When the table is reconfig'd, the view remains as do all the permissions granted to the view.  Of course, if you added new fields to your BaaN table, you will need to add the fields to your view.  ...but outside applications that access the BaaN data will continue to work after the reconfig.  I think this has worked out better.<br />
<br />
The views should be created in the schema of the oracle user that owns your BaaN tables.</div></div><hr />
