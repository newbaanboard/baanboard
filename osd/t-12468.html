Can anyone tell me as to how and when is an error which occurs during the execution of a program is posted in the error log.<br />
<br />
Also, as to how can we find as to from where the error is generated by just looking at the error log in case there is no session name mentioned in the errorlog.<br />

The info i was looking for is &quot;HOW&quot; is the error logged there. <br />
The errors/exceptions in a program are handled by the BaaN Standard program/4-GL engine. <br />
Refer to - Flow of 4GL engine (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_4gl_features_flow_of_standard_program)<br />
<br />
Post the log file here or give more information for others to help you out.</div></div><hr />
