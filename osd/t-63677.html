Now as soon as we reboot memory usage goes to 50% on this process and just keeps growing until usage is around 90%.<br />
 Before this was normally around 16%. Has anyone come across this? I have an identical server and process or this query aren't there, so no issue.<br />
Need to run query but wondering if could limit memory, it is dragging my baan application.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about the cpu usage though, other than to say it will take a lot of cpu when booting up but then reduces % when it has loaded what it needs to.</div></div><hr />

All of a sudden appeared one day.<br />
MS has pages on limiting memory usage but was curious if anyone used.<br />
<br />
Was used to 2000sql with server 2003. New to sql 2008 and server 2008 just trying to figure what triggers it. Memory never goes down after reboot like it did in 2003 server.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
