<br />
If I run queries on SQL Server EM system almost always ends up with a timeout error. There are also some queries that system doesn't finished on Query Analyzer - &quot;system is low on virtual memory&quot; (192MB on workstation). <br />
Does anybody know how to optimize system or query?<br />
<br />
More info:<br />
Timeout property is set to 0 (no timeout),<br />
Select * from tfgld410 ends up with low on virtual memory.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.<br />
Regards<br />
Anna</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Can't you perform the select for a specific fyer?<br />

There are about 3,5 milion records in tfgld410. <br />
I select year and account. None of these fields are keys.  <br />
I tried to make a few queries to limit number of records, but it didn't help.<br />

Sorry but I haven't used MS-SQL very often and I don't have a version working over here.<br />

<br />
I think that the reason for your problems is that your query has fields from several tables, not only from tfgld410. We had the same problem when we tried to get the description of the item.<br />
<br />
tfgld410.item --- &gt; tiitm001.item ---&gt; tiitm001.dsca<br />
<br />
 The relationship between these tables is not in the Baan DD.<br />
<br />
 You have to be sure that you do not make a join between these tables, which might cause the calculation of the carthesian product. <br />
<br />
 For example, if you write<br />
<br />
 tfgld410 - 1 million records<br />
 tiitm001 - 10.000 records<br />
<br />
 ...  where tfgld410.item = tiitm001.item  .....<br />
<br />
will create a temporary &quot;table&quot;  with 10.000 million records and only then will extract the data. ... etc..... ( Baan only has level 1 driver for SQL Server. Moreover, Baan + SQL Server does not use a temporary tablespace, like Oracle does). Since SQL Server uses the memory for sorting, this is the reason why you get the error.<br />
<br />
  Suggestion:<br />
 Take the script of the query and put it in a Baan session where you will be able to write:<br />
<br />
 .... where tiitm001._index1 = {tfgld410.item} .....<br />
<br />
 This will work much better. You can also do this in Tools/SQL Queries, but only using the text Manager, not the wizard.<br />
<br />
