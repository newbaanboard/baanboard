Can anyone tell me the name or number of the docu.<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

Only customers who signed a non-disclosure agreement could have one. So, please go via the partner or SSA sales channels to get a sizing (guide).<br />

What's the reasoning in keeping the Sizing Guide as a well kept secret? Is it a matter of vendors being afraid to show that their server is faster/slower than the ones of their competitor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a couple of reasons. One of them is the problem that you don't want to put this document in the hands of a beginner. Other reasons have a more political reason (the same reason as you can't find a SAP sizing guide). But when signing a non-disclosure agreement it is no problem to get one. So it has nothing to do with keeping the magic away from experts.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
