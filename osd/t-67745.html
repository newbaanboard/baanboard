<br />
Can any one have experience of using  Oracle as database for Infor 10.   Presently it is on SQL  and  we are planning to change the back end database to  Oracle. <br />
<br />
Is there any documents / write-ups available  to differentiate those two environments ?<br />
<br />
Does any one have experience in using Oracle and SQL  for BaaN or Infor ?<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards.<br />
Noorul haq.</div></div><hr />

So this can be a cost issue. <br />
<br />
With oracle the optimizer sometimes decides to use another strategy to retrieve the data after the tables are analyzed. <br />
Furthermore in Oracle 10/11 you need to install a infor 'code' page to be able to use unicode. <br />
<br />
It's often also a political choice: if your company has a DBA with knowledge of one of these it' s probably more logic to use that RDBMS.<br />
<br />
As far as I know Infor has no document to describe the differences. You can find, probably sponsered, information about the differences between Oracle and SQL-Server.</div></div><hr />

This questions it is almost in the line of religion. I have been working with Oracle and SQL (2008R2) and I can tell you that Oracle beats by far SQL, specially in tasks that involves large querys.<br />
<br />
So If you are on the position to choose which db you will use, take this in mind.<br />
By the other hand, Oracle it is much, much expensive than SQL. This is another parameter to take in count when you do a cost-benefit matrix.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
