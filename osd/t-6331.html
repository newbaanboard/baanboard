We had a spell where the tfacp1110s000 session would freeze and then time out with socket errors.<br />
<br />
A combination of upgrading the client to Win 2k, the latest bw and improvements to our network seemed to clear the problem.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Can you advise what BW version you upgraded to ?<br />
<br />
Because of cost we are limited in upgrading to Win 2000 <br />
<br />
<br />
Regards <br />

<br />
I'm currently running B40c65. There may be a later release on the support site. It would certainly be worth trying a newer BW on some of your more troublesome clients.<br />
<br />
It may also be worth checking your portingset.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<br />
Have downloaded BW 066 and see if this assists , although Baan support did not suggest this !!<br />
<br />
Porting set is at latest version already</div></div><hr />
