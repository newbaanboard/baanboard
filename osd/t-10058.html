In this case, look for: Oracle9i Baan<br />

Your BaanIV product comes with an Oracle installation manual. If you have problems *after* reading that, then come and ask your specific questions here.<br />

An answer can not be satisfactory if your question is not satisfactory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">28th July 2003, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe Jeffery is referring to the known problem with the basic Baan Install disk.<br />
<br />
I have a similar issue.  I'm setting up a new hardware environment for Baan and it would be nice to create a Clean new install instead of moving my present install to new hardware.<br />
<br />
The Install CD I have, I know will not work with oracle 8i let alone 9i.  It's possible that Baan has released a new CD that has a build in porting set that will allow the install to complete using an Oracle 9i database, however without the new install CD (If it exist), there is no way to create a New Install of Baan without starting with an older (Obsolete) version of oracle and then upgrading your Oracle to 9i.<br />
<br />
This will not leave you with a Clean 9i environment however.<br />

<br />
I confirmed it with BGS ( BaaN Global Support ) about Oracle 9i, they said Oracle 9i is not supported, but Oracle 9.0.3 is supported, so if u plan to install BaaN IV C4 with Oracle 9i, then first install Oracle 8 or 8i, and then later migrate to Oracle 9i through Oracle Migration Utilities.<br />

<br />
ok, may be i can say u have much more recent information that my local BGS, anyway i would like to know one more thing, although i tried first searching it on baanboard, but couldn't find the required post.<br />
<br />
Since i have already installed BaaN IV c4 on Oracle 8i with Win NT 4.0 as O/S , I have few doubts......<br />
<br />
1)How can i migrate it to Oracle 9i ?? will there be any problem for updation ??<br />
<br />
2)is there any doc which talks all about this ??? <br />
<br />
3)should i do it before validating the system, so that i do not need to re-request for validation licence key incase of server crash ??<br />
<br />
<br />
In a day or 2 i will be validating the system with the licence key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) 2 ways really. use oracle's migration tool. or export / import the data. <br />
Make sure you're character sets and NLS_LANG are the same.<br />
<br />
The migration tool works, I've done it that way. But there has been some worries in the past about it fragmenting system tables (which, in theory, could cause poor performance)<br />
<br />
2) There is an ok Baan doc on it, ask your local support center to look it up for you!<br />
<br />
3) Validate away, Oracle 9 uses the oracle 8 driver, so there is no difference to Baan.<br />

<br />
I am trying to obtain the latest installation CD form BGS since more than a month. They still did not sent it.<br />
<br />
So I had to try other ways to install BIVc4 with Oracle 9i. <br />
One possible option is to install 8i and migrate...<br />
<br />
The one I did was to create the Oracle 9i Baan database  manually and then point the Baan installation to it.<br />
<br />
We are now testing the new environment in order to migrate the data.<br />
