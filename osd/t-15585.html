<br />
Can anybody tell me whether it is possible to run BaaN IVb under HP-UX in Trusted Mode (shadow, mandatory regular password changes, kernel-auditing)?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
there could be a lot of problems in detail, but from my understanding:<br />
<br />
a) Shadow passwd should be no problem<br />
b) mandatory password changes are a problem. As soon as a password expires, the GUI will not start anymore and will also not allow the change of password. No problem, if you are using ASCII interface here.<br />
c) kernel Audits should be ok<br />
<br />
But I think, trusted mode is more than these three issues??<br />
<br />
In spite of (b) some customers still use password aging, but they have to make sure, that the user has some way of changing their passwords outside of baan or before the passowrd actually expires.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkahler</div><div class="date">7th June 2004, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been using Trusted Mode on our IVc4 system for close to 2 years without too many problems. The password expiration can be a problem, as the GUI will not warn, nor will it allow changes without signing in/creation of a special session to run the passwd command.<br />
<br />
However, you do have the option to selectively add the password expiration feature in the trusted mode, so if you wanted the trusted system for shadow passwd or some other feature like user deactivations (a nice feature to keep the auditors at bay)...you can do this without the expiration feature. The menus inside of SAM will help quite a bit. <br />
<br />
We actually use the password expiration for our non-baan users on the box to force automated changes, and then manually change the baan users. <br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />
