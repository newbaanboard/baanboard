In BaanV in informix database environment, after login to informix you can key-in inf_admin6.1 command to allow creation,editing,deletion of user password for informix. However  in LN6.1, this command inf_admin6.1 is not workable anymore. <br />
<br />
This editing of user password is important because in LN6.1 in Maintain User, there is a new &quot;Convert SSA ERP user to SSA Database&quot; (e.g. informix).<br />
So in order for a user to use a new password, we must besides changing the Unix password for that user, we also need to change the new password in the INFORMIX thru inf_admin6.1 (BaanV can do but LN6.1 not available?)<br />
<br />
Note also that the inf_admin6.1 only availble in Baan because the command do not appear in google search .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also I have found the RDBMS Administration &gt; Database Users (ttdba0515m000)and Links Between SSA ERP users and DAtabase(ttdba0510m000) to solve the problem of when users need to change their password. I can change the users password for informix in the ttdba0515m000.However this method is not desirable. <br />
<br />
At the User Data (ttaad2500)&gt;Specific&gt;Convert SSA ERP User to Database User (ttdba0915m000),I tick the &quot;use system logon for Database User&quot;. It converts but looks like the system logon for database user is not functioning.<br />
What is the system logon for database user means?<br />
<br />
what is my objective?<br />
During our previous BaanIV(without Informix database), user get notification while using Baan if their password is say more than 3 months. So I put a session with unix:Shell program type  and process: passwd in the menu for them to change their password themselves.<br />
Is there a equivalent informix change password command (like for unix password: passwd)?<br />
Now with Informix database and LN6, the unix password is ok but  how am i able to let user change themselves in user Informix password(i.e without calling me to change password for them in the informix)?<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you please advise ?</div></div><hr />

I found a forum on similar case but need to test it out.<br />

<br />
You can use the session - ttdba0915m000 to do that.<br />
<br />
Refer to the screenshot.<br />
<br />
My Q - Why should the users change their own database passwords? Did you enable database password aging? If they already have the database access when they know the database password, what is the purpose of trying to implement Role Authorization System/Security/limited access to GTM etc. <br />
I dont see a reason why the users need to know the database passwords, they should not care what is the underlying application database as long as the application sessions are working, unless they are Application Developers or using Datawarehouse reporting tools etc.</div></div><hr />
