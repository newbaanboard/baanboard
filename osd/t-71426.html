<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">19th October 2018, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">In our always on environmet (sqlserver) we experience the fact that the statement dbcc opentran('name of the database') reports active transactions which can be days old.<br />
The problem is that due to this the transaction log can't be truncated/shrinked.<br />
<br />
With other statements we can always pinpoint the bshell that's causing it, after closing it is solved.<br />
<br />
The transaction reported always is exactly started on the hour (e.g. 9:00:00:xxxAM) which is weird. <br />
<br />
I have never seen this in other sql server environments. <br />
<br />
We have been discussing it with infor but they don't think it's a bug in their driver. Our sql server is patched up to the latest software. We have reported this to microsoft, haven't received an answer yet.<br />
<br />
Anyone else seen this?</div></div><hr />
