Is those versions are supported?<br />
Is anyone done this upgrade without upgrading the Informix?<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Win2K is supported by Baan at SP2 and above.  For an Informix environment, I would not recommend any version below 7.31 (latest TC version).  The porting set should be at least 6.1c.05.03 and I would suggest that you try and get on the 6.1c.06.03 or latest version.<br />
<br />
You could TRY the Win2K upgrade without the Informix and porting set upgrades, but I would discourage the combination myself and would bite the bullet and do it all at once (hopefully you have a new server to test this on in advance).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

I also agree with you that we should test it on testing machine first. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IÂ´m problem with message &quot;Error ORA-3114 occurred during commit and ORA-03114: not connected to ORACLE and dbs_errno = 0, Error 522 occurred&quot;<br />
<br />
This error is happening after we migrated to Oracle 9 g, BaaN is suing and always returns to the beginning of select as if you were entering the function again, if I run the commit transaction for each changed record or rendered non of the error.  <br />
<br />
I don't know where to look for or where to parameterize but all indications are that either parameter or configuration problem.  <br />
<br />
I look forward to return.  <br />
<br />
Grateful.<br />
