<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">7th January 2002, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear BaaN comrades,<br />
<br />
Our BaaN server (B40c4 / SQL 7 / NT)  has: <br />
  Partition 0 :   OS<br />
<br />
  Partition I  :   application logic(%BSE%) <br />
<br />
  Partition II :   sql data.mdf<br />
<br />
  Partition III:   sql trans log.ldf<br />
<br />
Let us say I take <br />
  1) NT backup of complete %BSE%   (Partition I)<br />
  2) SQL full backup of baandb  (Partition II &amp; Partition III)<br />
<br />
If the server crashes,  <br />
  1) New server with same partition, OS &amp; SQL installed<br />
  2) without reinstalling the BaaN software, <br />
  3) if I restore just these two above backups in the new server<br />
<br />
  WILL IT TAKE ME TO A DEMO BAAN (14days), <br />
  with all my live software and data restored<br />
  then I will obtain the  licence code from BaaN &amp; validate.<br />
<br />
Please sugeest, throw lights ... thanks very much in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

If I am correct the demo mode depends also on how old you portingset is.<br />
<br />
You need to install the baan logic server again from the master cd, then upgrade it to the version you did use.<br />
<br />
You should have a copy of your licence key avalaible. With the brand command you can install them again.<br />
<br />
You can also check the quick guides regarding licencing on the Baan support site.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">7th January 2002, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">One point is that your old information cannot be used anymore and you will have to re-license.<br />
With a new server you will have a new NIC, thus invalidating any try to input the old license information.<br />
In case of a disaster like that, Baan will provide you with new license keys in a couple of hours.<br />
<br />
In case Baan refuses to start in demo license, you can always remove your current object information and that will defenetely give you enough time untill you re-license it (session ttiex3228m000, runnable from the command line).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your are right if he uses a new server but that wasn't stated in the post. If you keep running the old one, your old key should work as well.<br />
<br />
I have positive experiences with the guy that provides the key, we had to upgrade lately two servers and within half an hour we had the new keys!<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
