<br />
The question is:<br />
<br />
If I apply a company dump maked just a few hours (backup) after the lost of data, Will i recover all the data lost without lost the new data maked after the dump?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">if you use the -A option it will append..<br />
<br />
that will take a long time if this is live.. <br />
<br />
if a baan session drops records from a table, then that table<br />
can usually be rebuilt by the same session...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pitfloner</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Where is this option?<br />
<br />
In the session ttaad4227m000, I don't check the field owrw.yeno, because I think I just append the new record, not to modify the existing records, ok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpvdgiessen</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed with the -A option you can append the records.<br />
But also very importent what tables are to be restored (only historical tables?) <br />
<br />
Some general rules for restoring data:<br />
1) make first a backup of the data, if something is going wrong you can restore this last backup without creating new trouble.<br />
2) is it possible to do the restore without users logged in. It could be much simpler.<br />
3) make a logbook of every action you are doing, if you make a mistake, you can see where it is going wrong and what kind of decisions you have to make.<br />
4) don't get in a stress</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pitfloner</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 23:23</div></div><div class="posttext">This option is called into a shell by, e.g., a telnet connection?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 00:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe they are referring to the bdbpost6.1 command, with the -A option.   The session just runs the same, with some overhead, and gives you the ability to check the options instead of knowing the command.   The command line options are great for better flexibility, but if you are not familiar, you better read up (start with $BSE\bin\bdbpost6.1 -U), or just use the session like you were about do to.   <br />
<br />
The -A option represents the 'Append' flag in the session.  The 'Overwrite' is different, and I think you are right, you don't want to overwrite if your data is older than the current contents.<br />
<br />
Please backup before you do either!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpvdgiessen</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">ttaad4227m000 has the same functionallity as bdbpost6.1<br />
but with bdbpost6.1 it is easier to make some control over the data.<br />
<br />
For some clients I use bdbpost for importing (read adding/overwrite) tables like tccom010/tccom020 etc., because these data are maintened in other applications.<br />
<br />
Further it is very easy after a bdbpre from tables of company 'xxx' to change the files names (ttccom010xxx.S to ttccom010yyy.S) and to import these files in company yyy<br />
<br />
Read the documentation of bdbpre and bdbpost.</div></div><hr />
