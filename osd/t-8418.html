<br />
We use triton 2.0d only as an archive to lookup production  and sales history. Because there are no more maintainance contracts  on our IBM we want to move it to a Sun Solaris 2.6 machine.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if a port for Sun has existed or has it still running ?<br />

I have tried this before here on your case: see here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8269&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=). The same portingset is is there for Sun too... but noone dared to try it on triton2.0...</div></div><hr />

I tried to use the oldest porting set i could find for triton and SUN Solaris. (port 5.0.0010) <br />
The problem i experience is that i can't seem to get shared memory loaded. It can however be created.<br />
I think it isn't going to work cause our data is also in CISAM and with this port there is no cisam5.0.<br />

<br />
Which portingset does the company from which Willem is coming use? If I remember well they came from AIX as well and went to Solaris. <br />
<br />
On the other hand moving data from c-isam to b-isam shouldn't  be a problem. <br />

Moving from c-isam to b-isam may not be the hard part. In fact i have to move from tools 4.3 to 5.0 and i heared that there are great differences. Probably with data dicts, objects etc.  Any experience with that?<br />
