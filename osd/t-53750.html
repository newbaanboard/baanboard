<br />
While some users try to login , they get error &quot;Couldn't look up address for your host&quot;. But they can login to server via telnet.<br />
<br />
I couldn't find any errors in the log files.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Make sure there's not a typo in the hostname?  Also, can they connect if they use the IP instead of the hostname?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esrasezgin</div><div class="date">22nd September 2008, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">We don't use hostname for Baan connection, we use IP address ( in bw configuration)<br />
Everything is correct.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
So here a first guess: Baan requires a reverse lookup; so check that e.g. nslookup host gives ip, and nslookup ip gives host.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">28th October 2008, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">we had the same issue: it has to do with windows DNS &amp; the aging interval of the different zones on a WAN network.<br />
In our case the aging interval was set to 24 hours ('scavange stale records'). So when a user logged in on a zone different from the one where the baan server was located it took 15 mins (our sync interval) before his dns record was added to the dns zone where the baan server is.<br />
Since (HP) unix only looks at the first dns server it finds it thinks that the pc is not available since it is not yet in that dns zone and therefore gives the error. After 15mins the error would resolve itself since then all dns zones have the same info.<br />
We fixed it by changing the scavanging parameter.<br />
<br />
Later I also found solution 6443 on baan support site which says you can disable the reverse naming lookup for rexecd. This might be easier to change depending on your specific situation.</div></div><hr />
