<br />
This is what our customer wants to know. <br />
They are using windows NT 4.0 server and oracle database with Baan5.0b. <br />
Their system is runnung 24 hours, but the operator is not working for all day long. <br />
They think the time, from am 2:00 to am 4:00, is the best suitable backup time, but the operator is not be able to do the system backup everyday due to working time. And they also have concern about the duration time for backup, because their data is increasing so fast.<br />
<br />
So they want to know how other customers(including global customers) are doing the system backup and are there any utilities or 3rd party software and so on ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are running Baan on Unix, so we are using shell command for taking backup on off times.<br />
<br />
And as you people are on NT, what I think is you can take backup by job managment.<br />

I am not on Oracle, but like SQL, there must be some feature in Oracle to schedule different types of backup.<br />
Also, advice them for cold backups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gundab</div><div class="date">9th December 2002, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Oracle need not be brought down for doing a backup.  Online backup of database can be done during the slack time of the operation.  <br />
What is the Oracle version ?<br />
If Oracle is 7.3.x then you have to use custom scripts to do backup.  <br />
If Oracle version is 8 or 8i, you can use 'RMAN' to do backup.  RMAN (Recovery manager) is a Free utility provided by Oracle for doing backups.<br />
  If you wish to backup to tape, then you have to use some Media Management software (such as Brightstor (or ArcServe), Netbackup from Veritas) which integrates with RMAN to do the backup.  If these Media Management software is used, then it will have all the scheduling also.  So, the backups can be scheduled to run during any time of the day unattended.  However, if the size of the database is more than the size of the tape, then you need to use a tape library for unattended type backups.  You can also use RMAN to backup the database to disk.  After the database is backed up disk, those files can be backed up in any traditional method.  For backing up the data to disk, you can use combination of scripts and schedule the scripts using Windows Scheduler.<br />
<br />
   ArcServe (or Brightstor) can backup Oracle database with or without using RMAN.  <br />
<br />
ArcServe (or Brightstor) is from Computer Associates and<br />
Netbackup is from Veritas Software.<br />
<br />
   I hope this helps you.</div></div><hr />
