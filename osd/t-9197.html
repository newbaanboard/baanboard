<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IKGPAT</div><div class="date">10th March 2003, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">We currently run Baan iVc4 on SQL 7.0 with two NT 4.0 SERVERS.<br />
We are going to create a newer server with sql 2000 and win. 2000 and try to install on one box.<br />
   Can anyone tell me pros and cons of running on one server versus two servers. Also my current DB is about 20gig, any recommendations on Windows 2000 server specs for running this.<br />
Looking at 4 1.9ghz processors, 8gig,memory and raid 1/5 scenario.<br />
             Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">10th March 2003, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't tell you much in practical terms about 2 versus 1 server(s) as we have just 1.<br />
We only have 25 - 30 concurrent users but our database size is similar to yours so it may tell you something . Our 4 year old Proliant 6000 with 4 x 400 Mhz 1MB Xeon processors, 1.9GB RAM &amp; RAID 1 &amp; 5 configuration works pretty well. <br />
We have used SQL Server 2000 &amp; Win 2000 Server for approximately 8 months and they are definitely an improvement on NT4 &amp; SQL7.<br />
<br />
p.s. If you intended on using a level 2 database driver at some point, Baan have recently informed us they are not developing one for SQL 2000 with Baan IV - please log a case to protest against this decision if you feel disappointed. There is also a poll in the Baanboard Enhancements section as well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IKGPAT</div><div class="date">11th March 2003, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the input - I was reading yesterday about level 2 driver and was going to open case today. Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweetie</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We are working now on unix bisam and migrating to w2k sql2000 on 1 proliant dL580 4 proc 2 GB mem connected with fiber 2 Gb switches with an msa1000.<br />
<br />
Importing the data we had a little problem.<br />
The parameter in sql for space allocation is set on automat.<br />
When filling the tabels sql2000 saw the he did not have enough space, started taking some space but the import of baan did not wait until this proces was done.<br />
The import crashed.<br />
We changed a parameter saying when you have a lock baan has to wait some time.<br />
<br />
Concerning the performance we did some test.<br />
After some discussions with HP we came to this conclusion<br />
instead of using several raid 1 use raid 10 (we had 1 raid 1 with soft and 1 raid 1 with log and 1 raid 5 with data)<br />
spread your raid over as many scsi-channels as possible<br />
the stripe size has to be 10-15 times the formatsize (for the data we formatted on 8 KB)<br />
<br />
When you are interested in performancetesting results troughput to an msa1000, send me an email.<br />
<br />
As mentioned in the other replys : the missing level II driver is big shi..... <br />
Accessing the db from outside baan is not so difficult, but there are no indextables.<br />
So when you plan to do some datawarehousing on tdsls051 or tdsst tables then you can go to make some caffe, drink it, go to the toilet, do a little discussion with others ......<br />
Ni bene, ni bene...</div></div><hr />
