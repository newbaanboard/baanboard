The number of these processes is different from the number of oracle process and also different from the oracle8 processes.<br />
<br />
What are there for ?<br />
oracle 7201 1 0 14:52:45 ? 0:07 oraclebaan (DESCRIPTION=(LOCAL=YES)(SDU=8192)(TDU=8192)(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=beq))<br />
oracle 12637 1 0 16:11:02 ? 0:00 oraclebaan (DESCRIPTION=(LOCAL=YES)(SDU=8192)(TDU=8192)(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=beq))<br />
...<br />
Furthermore, for other applications (not BaaN),  there are other process with LOCAL=no which stay on the server after abort of the connexion. The kill of the oracle-session doesn't kill the process, but a kill -9 does.<br />
<br />
Kind regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
These processes are you Oracle client processes that will connect to the Baan database driver processes. From Oracle8 on it is normal that these processes have no PPID. They did have a PPID in Oracle7.<br />
<br />
As to the processes with LOCAL=NO, they are Oracle processes that connect remotely via the Oracle listener. I am not sure that it is normal that they don't die off automatically after a while...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here. We also have these LOCAL=NO processes that we need to kill with -9. (sometimes they die, sometimes they don't)<br />
In our case these processes come from our application that runs on wireless guns in the warehouse.<br />
<br />
So it seems a normal 'feature'.</div></div><hr />
