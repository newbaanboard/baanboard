are you using compression on your rman backup?<br />
also what is the size of your oracle datafiles - we used to limit the size to 6GB.<br />
<br />
hope that helps<br />

The backup script was written by consultant in the way that <br />

Based on your screenshots - <br />
How big is your database? did you ever purge/archive/shrink/compress? <br />
<br />
I am not an expert Oracle DBA, but refer to the links. You can set the maxfile sizes in the archive backup and split into multiple files.<br />

if you backing up the entire backup volume group then how about using Aix savevg command instead of tar;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">29th June 2016, 02:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on your initial post, seems like you are getting this error when doing tar on big file.<br />
<br />
You can use section size of Oracle RMAN to split big file and then do tar on small files.<br />
<br />
An example for Section size would be let's say .. you have a file which is 10gb, and if i have a section size of 100MB defined , then it will create 100 Oracle backup piece with 100MB each. As a Oracle DBA, you don't have to worry on joining these RMAN backup pieces together , it would be RMAN responsibility to do that, if you ever end up using RMAN restore command.<br />
<br />
Backup Datafile 10<br />
RMAN&gt; backup as compressed backupset datafile 10 section size 100M tag 'Individual_file';<br />
<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Backup entire Database<br />
RMAN&gt; backup as compressed backupset database section size 100M tag 'Complete_DB';</div></div><hr />

Thanks Bob, Prashanth Rao, Learner.<br />
Before that I know nothing on RMAN. Now at least I know a bit from your help. Information is very useful. <br />
<br />
I tried to use 'savevg' to backup to tape. Very straight forward. It worked.<br />
<br />
In RMAN script, <br />
before : allocate channel t1 type disk; <br />
after : allocate channel t1 type disk maxpiecesize 8G; <br />
It worked also but size of data file &gt; 9GB is split to 2 lines see attached log. Tar to tape is ok (limitation to max 9GB only). <br />
<br />
Is this okay ?   <br />
<br />

To me it seems perfect. I don't see any issues in this. <br />
<br />
If you really want to verify , you can connect to rman and specify following command<br />
<br />
RMAN &gt; list backup ;<br />
<br />
This will list the backupset and backup piece that are known to RMAN for restore &amp; recovery and you should be able to find both the files in that output.<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to above rman command, you can create a Test Tablespace with let's say 1 gb datafile and specify maxpiece size as 250mb which effectively will create 4 pieces and then you can drop the data file , perform a restore and recovery. <br />
<br />
<br />
Note : Do not perform above steps mentioned in bold on Production db. Try this on a test server. The steps seems fairly simply but you need to learn a bit more about Oracle database. If you are not very comfortable, you can ignore the statement that i mentioned in bold.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
By the way your rman script is a bit obsolete, i did notice that they are doing archivelog switchlog which is not really required since RMAN does it automatically. Nevertheless, it's not really hurting to have that extra work, so you are safe.</div></div><hr />
