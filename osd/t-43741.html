<br />
I am looking for people who have experience with Baan and Database servers running on different operating systems.<br />
<br />
We run BaanIV now on AIX Unix, with Baan's TBASE/BISAM.<br />
We want to move the database to Oracle or SQL-server, whoever we do not want to change the operating system of the Baan-server.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to couple a Baan-server on AIX with a Windows-Database-Server running Oracle or SQL-server?<br />
Is it a reasonable option? Any experiences with performance?<br />
<br />
:confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
If you trust your DB to windows then you might as well trust baan to it as well, since the DB does most of the work. <br />
<br />
What most folks would do is Baan on Windows and DB on a Unix box.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
since january 2006 we have BaaN on HP-UX and Oracle 10g on W2K3 Server without problems.<br />
<br />

For SQL-Server the problem is that there is no Unix-porting set that has a driver for this database.<br />
<br />
A theoretical option would be to create a second Baan application server under Windows that communicates with the database, however, for performance reasons this is no option.<br />
