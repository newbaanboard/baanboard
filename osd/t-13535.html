<br />
Do you have any monitoring tools that will allow you to see what's going on in the system.<br />
<br />
When you say the system is slow is that when accessed from a client over the network? Could there be extra network traffic between this time, backups on other systems?<br />
<br />
What batch jobs do you have running? Things like the planning engines can have a big impact on system performance.<br />
<br />
Do you have any database/print queries being scheduled to run over night. A poorly written query could also cause these sorts of issues.<br />
<br />
If the time is always between 6PM and 10PM then that tells me there is something running on a schedule somewhere.<br />
<br />
These are the areas I would look at, you've probably already done this.<br />
<br />

thanx for replying..<br />
i have tried every thing u said. at that time network works fine but the system is as good as dead. i have rescheduled sytem and database backup and no batch job runs at that time. even system monitoring is not helpfull. not getting even a single clue about the origin of problem..<br />

<br />
I've noticed that you've done an upgrade from SQL7 to 2000 did it conicide with this upgrade.<br />
<br />
I don't know SQL2000 but are there any internal 'housekeeping' processes that it runs that may cause this issue?<br />
<br />

In that case maybe it is indeed the housekleeping of the OS that is not optimal. Maybe the saying &quot;A reboot a day takes your problems away&quot; should be rephrased to &quot;Twice a reboot a day takes your problems away&quot; ;). I understand that this is not workable but maybe you can try it for a few days at least to see if this is the problem.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
Walk over to the server, start the Task Manager, check your &quot;Processes tab&quot;, click &quot;Processes&quot; to see what process the system is executing. Than at least you have a clue... if the process is unknown... try to google it, if it is known, try to determine why it is running now and what it is doing.<br />
<br />
See if you can see disk activity, network activity etc...<br />
<br />
No virus involved?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Do you have  a screensaver on your server?  <br />
Long time ago I have see  that some complex screensaver can give a very high  processor load.<br />
<br />
2) if it occurs after 6PM is is not possible that some people connected use an output to console to close baan and that some process are then phantom process using a lot of resource --&gt; check your DB<br />
I have see this on some unix system with DB2, I'm not aware if this can be present on microsoft windows+ SQL 2000  but ...<br />

<br />
Are you autogrowing your datafiles at that time?<br />
<br />
How about virus scans?<br />
<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shuklan</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 07:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Friends<br />
Thanks for your replies. i'm checking all of these options. i will get back to this forum after monitoring it for sometime. Dave i have closed all the activities which were taking place at this particular time. no anti-virus checking no autogrowing, absolutely nothing. i'm still exploring the system. so hope to find the loophole in next couple of days.<br />
thanks and regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shuklan</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi friends<br />
can anyone tell me what is the role of file &quot;$BSE\lib\db_resource&quot;. I was told to update that by baan support.<br />
Nishant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 13:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Nishant,<br />
<br />
The db_resource can be used to set parameters for the database driver. So, if support found that the defaults of the driver are not usefull for you, you can change them in this file. The meaning of each of the variables is database specific and can be found in the driver tech manuals.<br />
<br />
I pubished a document in the Performance and Tuning section and described there for Oracle and DB2. SOme of them are generic so take a look at it to find help on the generic ones.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
