January our division got sold and our System admin got replaced.  Now we have two options, either buy our old server from our old company (which me and my co-worker want) or get a new server and switch to a 2000/sql base system (what our system admin wants).  We are looking for pros and cons of the switch to 2000/sql.<br />
<br />
We currently have 60 concurrent users and our database is 60 gigs.</div></div><hr />

(with 2000 you never know what could be happening)</div></div><hr />

If you do not have teh HP-UX skills or do not have a competant sys admin, life might start getting bad for you if mistakes are made on the sys admin side.<br />
<br />
I would look for hard costs in the migration like changes to code to accomodate the SQL environment, data collection custom routines written in PL-SQL, etc.  that will have a cost associated with migration.<br />
<br />
But getting away from Oracle terrible licensing may be a plus if you have to acquire licenses in addition to the server itself.  <br />
<br />
You might want to consider a new HP-UX model since the one you have been running with for six years is probably outmoded.<br />
<br />
We are assuming you are on Baan IV -- otherwise the L2 argument will not hold.<br />
<br />
So many ideas -- but I have so little brainpower to absorb them :) <br />
