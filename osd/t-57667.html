<br />
We have baan Live server is running Baan IV C4/oracle 9.2/win2003 Sp2.<br />
We want to preprae a new server with BaanIV C4/oracle 10G rel2/win2003sp2.<br />
new server will be work as live server after testing. I am thinking that following step will help me.<br />
<br />
1. Prepare New server win2003 sp2 with Oracle 10 Rel2 Patch set 3.<br />
2. Install Baan Master IVC4 with gud porting set (6.1c.07.20/21).<br />
3. take export of a perticular baan user (which hold all ban data) on new server (for backup purpose).<br />
4. take oracle export from live server &amp; import to new server.<br />
5. copy some specific bse folders from live to new server.<br />
6. Share the license with live server.<br />
<br />
Just want to know whether it will work or not. Please provide me your valuable suggestions to acheive this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Abhinav.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably it will work however how are you going to make sure that both baan environments with customisations/solutions will be exactly the same?<br />
<br />
I'd rather clone the baan environment. Clone the db too and upgrade it at the same time. That's the quickest way IMHO.<br />
<br />

<br />
First..thanks for your remarks.<br />
<br />
customisations/solutions will be exactly the same because i am replicating the database &amp; imp. folders of BSE. I do not want to upgrade the live server. Once testing will be over then we will move the data again &amp; new server will make it live server. I do not know what I am feeling that  i am missing something that i want to know from baan experts.<br />

<br />
I faced something like that before wiz a customer... BaanIVc4 with d481 extension.<br />
<br />
Look..<br />
(( GLOBAL VARIABLES, INSTANCE NAME, SERVER NAME, OPERATING SYSTEM, BSE...etc SHOULD BE SAME ))<br />
1- Start the Installation on the new server<br />
2- Compress the BSE and DB from the live server<br />
3- move the files to the new server<br />
4- use SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE to shut down the DB Instance for the new server<br />
5- Stop the Logic, Shared memory, SLMServer and ASM services.<br />
6- Now decompress the folders on the same locations<br />
7- start the DB and the services<br />
(( The Application should be the same typical as the Live one )) tested</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done this a number of times.<br />
<br />
1. change all the paths in tools to ${BSE}/application etc<br />
   and then convert to runtime.<br />
<br />
2. Create the user baan on the new system.<br />
<br />
3. copy ${BSE} from disc to new machine.<br />
<br />
4. export import database including company 0<br />
<br />
5. Install the binaries again even on windows.<br />
   This will install the SSA/Infor manager<br />
   Do NOT install the BW first as this will set the BSE wrong in the regestry.<br />
<br />
6. Check the lib/ora files for user &amp; group passwords and db parameters + tabledef<br />
   In the database you need not only dbuser, dbgroup but also roles r_dbuser, r_dbgroup<br />
The dbuser does the data changes so needs insert, update delete etc. The dbgroup does the object changes so needs create table, delete table etc. You can look on the live machine to see what rights these users and roles have. <br />
<br />
7. Create the other users on the new machine.<br />
<br />
This also works for a copy from windows to linux etc<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

<br />
Have you consult Infor365 for the licensing?<br />
On my understanding, if the Hardware has changed, you are req to req for new license or it will not work on new machine.<br />
