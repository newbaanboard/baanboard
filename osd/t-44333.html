<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skheeb</div><div class="date">12th November 2007, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently running Oracle 9.2 and are planning on upgrading to 10g.  We have a Datawarehouse system that is running 8.1.7.  We export data from 9.2 to 8.1 on a regular basis and they are compatible.  Can anyone tell me if an export from 10g will be downward compatible with 8.1.7?  Just need to know if we need to add an upgrade of our Datawarehouse to the mix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">13th November 2007, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">10g export is not compatible with previous versions but you can do the Oracle export of the 10g data using the export (exp) tool from the 8i installation without the need to upgrade the datawarehouse. If this is not possible, then you need to upgrade your datawarehouse to 10g also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skheeb</div><div class="date">13th November 2007, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently we are using PL-SQL exports to pull the data from our production system to staging.  Do you know if there have been any functions related to PL-SQL that have been obsoleted within 10g.  Also, are there any issues that you know of with database links from Oracle 8i to 10g?</div></div><hr />
