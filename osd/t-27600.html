<br />
I am not a Baan user (literally). But would like to get over the following problem.<br />
<br />
I have a need to connect to a Baan Informix DB thru JDBC. Version of Baan system is triton  3.10 b. When I contacted baan admin to get information required for JDBC drivers, the person was not very knowledgable and does not know how to provide the information I am asking for.<br />
<br />
Basically, I need following things:<br />
<br />
port # - port that database is running on<br />
InformixServer<br />
Database name<br />
<br />
Since the so-called admin has no clue about the above settings. And I am pretty confident the baan was setup using default values. Hence, I would like to take the boards help to know what would be the defaults for the Baan triton 3.10b?<br />
<br />
Also, can any one provide me steps/procedure for finding these values? I can provide the same to the admin, so that I can get the values from admin, if they are different from defaults.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

You may wish to know that Informix on Triton will not have any<br />
useable indexes on the tables for your program. Triton uses a &quot;level 1&quot;<br />
database driver, which has a field that containts a &quot;hash index&quot; of which<br />
the informix indexes are built on. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sjeejula</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info dave. But I have new information about the baan system. It does not use informix as I thought earlier, but uses inbuilt database - TBase 6.0.<br />
<br />
With the new piece of information, I would like to know if I can connect to this database thru JDBC? If yes, are there any drivers available?<br />
<br />
Is there any other mechanism to talking to the database other than baan application?<br />
<br />
Any info regarding this is very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Open Architecture suite. Except that it does not work with Triton.<br />
