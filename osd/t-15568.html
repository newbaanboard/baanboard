<br />
I am trying to install Baan4 on sql 7.0 &amp; XP.<br />
<br />
I installed sql7.0 server and baan =&gt; <br />
         importing tools tables  : failed<br />
         importing directly by bdbpost : failed with error 1229 on each table<br />
I installed SP4 for sql7.0 server and baan =&gt; <br />
         importing tools tables  : failed<br />
         importing directly by bdbpost : failed with error 1017 on each table<br />
<br />
if anyone has a clue...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheBurniou</div><div class="date">4th June 2004, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I still have an error 1229 and not 1017 because the server was not well registered in the server group.<br />
<br />
I assume that it is a SQL error 229 (1229 - 1000 because the error is given by a baan exe &quot;bdbpost&quot;) witch means &quot;permission denied when updating&quot; <br />
<br />
Any idea ?</div></div><hr />

I must tell U that With the first version of MSSQL7 Server I used, I had a &quot;not compatible OS version&quot; error. I tried other versions of MSSQL7 to make it work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">21st June 2004, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Any chance you used the SQL desktop edition? I tried installing SQL 7 on XP on a laptop. There are three choices on the SQL installation disk (SQL server standard edition). As far as I understand it, the desktop version is the only one that can be installed on a &quot;non-server&quot; operating system and I wasn't sure if Baan 4 and Baan 5 would work with that. I don't know what the differences between the desktop edition and the full edition are and I can't try it because I don't have enough space.<br />
<br />
I'm in the process of buying a new Laptop but can't find a newer model that comes with NT drivers, so when I read your post I was wondering if installing a combination of XP Pro + SQL desktop edition + Baan 4 + Baan 5 would work if I would want to install a simple test and demo system without much data on the new laptop. <br />
<br />
I appreciate your input!<br />

Not extremly fast but enough for what i need.<br />
<br />
I modified the dates so I have more than 30 days with the demo licence. I hope it will work fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that I don't need to look for NT drivers anymore, I can go out laptop shopping and buy the newest fanciest model *smile* ... <br />

Thanks!<br />
