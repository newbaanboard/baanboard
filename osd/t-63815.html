We would like to add an index to the SQL Server table for finance table ttfgld842 (integration transactions) so that we can improve the response time of external SQL SELECT queries. <br />
The fields in question are Financial Year (fyer) and Financial Month (fprd).<br />
Currently when we select on these fields the SQL takes 4 mins to process and has a big hit on disk io of the server. We presume this is because the table is not indexed on the fields. There are &gt; 50,000,000 records in the table (archiving is not currently an option !)<br />
<br />
Is the adding of additional indexes to a table in the RDBMS likely to cause problems for the Ln application, or will such actions have no impact to Ln's workings as it does not address the database tables directly?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />

Ln will delete your index if you perform a re-org (i doubt you would). test everything first on a test server, including the performance of your sql query. if it doesn't do much, or if the performance improved for a little bit only, then it's not worth the effort. if you are using SSRS (you should since you are in SQL server) you can run a snapshot of the report early in the morning and the users will use it throughout the day. the downside is it's not realtime but something to think about for long-running queries.</div></div><hr />
