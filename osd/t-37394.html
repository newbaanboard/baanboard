<br />
Running Baan in ASCII mode, trying to set the stty values.  If I set them in HPUX as follows, everything works as expected:<br />
<br />
$ stty<br />
speed 38400 baud; -parity hupcl<br />
min = 1; time = 1; intr = ^C; erase = ^H; kill = ^U;<br />
swtch &lt;undef&gt;;<br />
werase = DEL;<br />
brkint -inpck icrnl ixoff onlcr<br />
-iexten echo echoe echok<br />
-echoctl -echoke<br />
<br />
It appears as if these values are being overridden when ba6.1 is called, as the keys do not function as expected (and tested at the unix level):<br />
<br />
When I shell out and issue an stty, I see totally different values:<br />
<br />
bshell6.1&gt; stty<br />
speed 9600 baud; -parity hupcl clocal<br />
intr = ^C; erase = ^H; kill = ^@;<br />
swtch &lt;undef&gt;;<br />
-inpck -istrip icrnl onlcr<br />
-iexten echo echoe echok<br />
-echoctl -echoke<br />
<br />
Does anyone know where these values are being (re)set so I can make the corrections needed?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">15th June 2007, 10:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I just used stty -a and checked the differences before and during ba6.1 so I think that ba6.1 sets the following entries: kill character &quot;off&quot; (control-@), suspend character &quot;off&quot; (control-@), cread, clocal, -brkint, -ignpar, ixon, ixany.<br />
<br />
But: Function keys in the ascii environment have alway been a problem. I guess that you do not have a real terminal; you're probably using a terminal emulator.<br />
<br />
So you should do some checks:<br />
1. What is your $TERM (vt100? =&gt; PF1 to PF4 only! vt220? =&gt; PF1 to PF4, F6 to F10 but no F5 because that was the Break key on those terminals ...)<br />
2. What settings does your terminal emulator allow for the function keys?<br />
3. Check what your keys send on each key stroke; I normally use 'od -c', then press the function key and an enter and control-d to stop the od.<br />
Eg. <br />
0000000 033   O   P  \n<br />
0000004<br />
means: Function key FT1 gives &quot;ESC O P&quot;.<br />
4. There used to be two different ways on UNIX systems to define that: termcap and terminfo. <br />
* termcap uses a flat file (e.g. /etc/termcap);<br />
* terminfo uses pre-compiled files; run 'infocmp' to get the readable version for your current $TERM.<br />
Eg.<br />
        ...<br />
        is2=\E[1;24r\E[24;1H, kbs=\b, kcub1=\EOD, kcud1=\EOB,<br />
        kcuf1=\EOC, kcuu1=\EOA, kdch1=\E[3~, kf1=\EOP,<br />
        ...<br />
Here you see kf1=ESC O P.<br />
<br />
Hope that gives you some ideas!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm testing out PuTTY, in vt100 mode (going ssh from telnet).<br />
<br />
Everything, including the function keys work as desired, when compared to our existing telnet client.<br />
<br />
The only thing that DOESN't work correct (rather, as desired) is the delete key.<br />
<br />
This is what I'm trying to manipulate.  Right now it forces a carriage return, that's it.<br />
<br />
If I set the &quot;Backspace Key&quot; setting to Control-H, the backspace key works as desired.  If I set the &quot;Backspace Key&quot; to Control-?, the backspace key works as I'd like the delete key to work.<br />
<br />
Ideally, I'd like to set the Backspace Key to Control-H and the Delete Key to Control-?.  <br />
<br />
As I mentioned in my previous post, I can set this using stty, but these values are &quot;overwritten&quot; at some point during the bshell init.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">15th June 2007, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, I see. So could you first check what happens if you change the settings by stty from within ba6.1 (run shell, change stty settings, continue working with ba6.1).<br />
<br />
If that works, you could think about &quot;tricks&quot; such as making a shell script ba61.new like (untested!):<br />
<br />
#!/bin/sh<br />
(sleep 5; ssty ...) &amp;<br />
exec ba6.1 $*<br />

<br />
Because of this I'm willing to bet doing it via a ba6.1 shell script probably won't work either.<br />
