To replace our 7 years old server with a faster one, I was on the way to do the install on a Windows 2008 SP2 with Informix 11.50 when Infor told that this combination is not supported anymore (only version 11.1 - and this has to be requested). <br />
It looks like that Infor is discouraging customers from using Windows/Informix combination.<br />
Now facing this, weâ€™re considering moving from Windows to Linux (SLES 11 SP1) with Informix 11.50FC8 on 64 bits platform.<br />
Moving to Linux though, can be a big challenge with unforeseen results.  <br />
Does anybody have feedback or bad experiences with this scenario?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's not that Infor wants to discourage you but it's more a matter of what the market requests. Personally I don't see a lot of informix sites anymore although it's a good RDBMS. <br />
<br />
If you just use the plain rdbms you can use oracle or sql-server as well. However you probably have to sell new licences which can be costly.<br />
<br />
The portingset 'hides' the OS for the application so the move to linux or another OS can be done pretty easily. Especially if you have used relative paths for you package combination, directory path for the components, pmc setup etc. It's always wise to use the ${BSE} variable!<br />
<br />
Furthermore find out if you have used paths in your own software. <br />
Next thing that can be an issue are custom interfaces.<br />
<br />
If you are not familiar with linux than make sure you have someone at hand to assist, it's a complete different OS. You probably need to configure the kernel before being able to run a RDBMS.<br />
