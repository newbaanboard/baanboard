<br />
most obviously the server is terminating the connection.<br />
There is a parameter you can set to influence the servers behaviour when a client is idle for a certain period of time.<br />
<br />
Do a search on the board for &quot;idle&quot;. You could test this hypothesis by putting <br />
-- -set session_timeout=0 <br />
as an option in the GUI - if the problem doesn't occur any more for this user, you found the reason. <br />
<br />
good luck and welcome to baan board :-)<br />

There may be a mandatory connect time limit on the router.  I once had remote warehouses that would time out every two hours.  We were not able to disable it, but were able to change it to 10 hours to cover a shift.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
that, to me, looks like there is a firewall between the sites and it is terminating idle connections.<br />
<br />
you may be able to disable timeouts on the baan port in the firewall, or you may need to find a way to do a keepalive.<br />
<br />
edit: if it was session timeout it would/should say &quot;session timed out&quot; in the log file.<br />
so i think it's more of a hard disconnect.<br />
