<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IKGPAT</div><div class="date">27th December 2006, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking to put my English and spanish versions of baan IVc4 on same server, i realize because both db's need to be called baandb i need to create 2nd instance, also i need to keep seperate baan directories due to modification issues. Has anyone done this and if so, how is processing time and any other issues? I only ask because baan tells me they don't recommend doing this on production server, they say can be used for test. Just not recommended on production - Any thoughts greatly appreciated.<br />
                      Thank you</div></div><hr />

As you have to reconfigure your licence anyway, I advice to contact Baan for this.<br />

<br />
why are you separating the two instances.<br />
<br />
You can build a vrc structure containing both englisch and spanish localisation within one instance?<br />

B40Uc4stnd<br />
|-------------------------|<br />
B40UK (Cust)       B40Lc4iber (Spanish localisation)<br />
                                  |<br />

(i had one project: german, spanish, uk and usa was working on one server within on instance in 4 different companies.)</div></div><hr />

Only problem I have every now and than is that shared memory starts complaining when I have 3 or more environments on one system.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">27th December 2006, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Separate instances has nothing to do with different languages. You need separate instances when you need to be able to stop and start one environment  while the other one remains in whatever state you needed it to be (up or down).  Or in the case of having T&amp;D and PROD in the same box you can create a small env with its own DB &quot;small&quot; instance for Dev and a bigger one for PROD.<br />
However if both your Spanish company and the English one are PRODUCTION you DO NOT NEED separate environment/instances. You can have just one with both languages, both localizations and both sets of companies. Is there going to be any integration between the different languages companies? That as well is easier to accomplish if you have them all in the same environment.<br />
<br />
Going back to your questions:<br />
<br />
Yes it can be done.<br />
Yes it has performance impact although how big of a problem this is, depends on the server's size.<br />
<br />
My advice: Stay away from it.</div></div><hr />

Didn't want to keep as one since if i need to take one down, need other to still be running.</div></div><hr />
