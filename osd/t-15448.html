<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fahqueue</div><div class="date">24th May 2004, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to point a single Baan application server to multiple Oracle 9i databases.  One database will hold our 000 and Production company data (about 20% of current DB), the other database will hold the test company data(the other 80% of current DB).  This is an effort to improve the overall performance of the production DB and environment as a whole.<br />
<br />
We ran into a problem upon implementation in that after the change, the tabledef file went from roughly 15k to 637k.  This caused a significant increase in the time it takes a client to connect and also the utilization on the Baan server.  The changed worked in regards to pointing to the 2 databases, but failed in that it caused so many more problems.  Our Baan server which routinly handle a hundred connections was failing after less than 20.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any tips on how to make this setup more efficient?</div></div><hr />
