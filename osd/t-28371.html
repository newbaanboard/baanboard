I would install BaanIV on window2003 Server and had decided to use oracle10g. But there are three edtions:Standard Edition, Standard Edition One, and Enterprise Edition. I wonder which is the best one for BaanIV and what's the distinctness. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Another good forum to search is the Oracle Technet site - http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/pdf/A76962_01.pdf<br />
<br />
Oracle8i is available in four standalone versions:<br />
Oracle8i, also referred to as the standard edition delivers unprecedented ease-of-use, power, and database functionality for workgroup or department-level applications. It includes core features for most Windows NT and UNIX applications.<br />
<br />
Oracle8i Enterprise Edition adds several high-end features and options for mission-critical OLTP and data warehousing applications. Oracle8i Personal Edition is a single-user development database for Windows NT, Windows95, or Windows98, that now includes all Enterprise Edition options and features.<br />
<br />
Oracle8i Lite is a lightweight mobile Java database that easily synchronizes laptops and hand held devices with corporate databases. It is not discussed in this book.<br />
<br />
The Oracle8i database is available as Oracle8i, Oracle8i Enterprise Edition, and Oracle8i Personal Edition. Not all features and options are available with all editions of the Oracle8i database.<br />
<br />
Refer to Chapter 5 for detailed information: Oracle8i Feature and Option Availability<br />
