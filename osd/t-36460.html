SQL backup is fast and has less of a drag on the system resources and can be taken hot and cold compared to the baan sequential dump. Depending on how your business is setup, whether its a 24/7 operation or something else, you would have to decide on when to run what...<br />

SQL backups are faster and so can be taken at a regular intervals and it helps in scenarios wherein the database gets corrupted. <br />
<br />
As far as sequential dumps are concerned, its best usefull when you are trying to upgrade your server or in some cases restore a mighty crash that makes it necessary to install everything all over again. This is my way of seeing it. There could be others with a different turn to this.<br />
<br />
Yes you need to have the same solution at the time of backing up and restoring. Along with it you could backup 000 (tools) company which will help in reducing recovery time. You could save the users/authorizations etc using ttcon61export tool and you could export your customized objects (form, reports) of all packages using ttiex1280m000 session.<br />
<br />
Finally, you could get in touch with baan support on the /BSE folders that needs to be backed up which could aid the recovery process and cut the recovery time considerably...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">24th September 2007, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">That would depend on the size of the company you are backing up. If its in excess of 100 gb you could take a weekly sequential and a daily incremental. The above is also applicable if you are a 24/7 co and you cant accomodate offline time for your baan co..<br />
