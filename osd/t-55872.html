<br />
can somebody help me with the relation between baan's remote user and the ora_users file?<br />
<br />
Let me explain what i want to do.  I have 2 hp servers (itanium).  One for baan called ap (baan4c4) and one for Oracle called db (10g).<br />
i've created user blanchap in Baan and on unix of my ap.<br />
i've created user blanchap in the Oracle database.<br />
i've created user xblanchap in unix of my db.<br />
<br />
now in Baan, my remote user should be what blanchap or xblanchap?<br />
and my ora_users should be xblanchap:blanchap:password:baan?<br />
<br />
Why i want to do this is because i'm installing HP msservice guard and i want to keep my password file seperate.  Why? I want to make sure that the user does not login on my db server.<br />
<br />
I just need to understand the relationship between baan user, baan remote user, unix user, ora_users and oracle user.<br />
<br />
Can somebody help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
PB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a Baan &quot;remote user&quot; is only for a thick client install, which you do not (need to) have .<br />
<br />
<br />
Just setup a unix and baan user blanchap on AP <br />
create oracle user blanchap in Oracle<br />
<br />
user logs into Baan and uses SQL*Net to log in as blanchap in the DB.<br />
<br />
your ora_users would look like<br />
blanchap:blanchap:&lt;encrypted password&gt;:&lt;group&gt;<br />
<br />
The user never has to log into the database server itself. (as no users should ever log into a DB server...)</div></div><hr />

I'm using Baan.net but i think i'll convert into sql.net.  Everybody (including Baan support) is saying that my life will be less complicated.<br />

<br />
If it's currently working i wouldn't mess with trying to get that secured. <br />
<br />
I'd just look to getting SQL*Net up and running.<br />
