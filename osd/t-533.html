Is there any &quot;easy&quot; way to block users from logging onto Baan but still keeping the system up?<br />

We run 4c4, Oracle805 on HPUX11<br />

Thanks<br />

Afterwards you only need to do a chmod 770 on $BSE/lib/user to allow them to access the system again (we use this a lot!).<br />
<br />
If you need some users to be able to login, you can move the ufiles from $BSE/lib/user by greping on their package combinations - usefull if you need to create RTDD and keep particular users off. I'll post a script here afterwards that does that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">4th December 2001, 11:40</div></div><div class="posttext">This is one of the advantages of the wrapper script that I implement on the sites where I am responsible for the administration. I just simple create a file in the ${BSE}/etc/ directory, this blocks the user and shows the contents. In that way you can simply prevent users to login in and you provide them a way to see why they aren't allowed to login in.<br />
<br />
In that same script you can also easily prevent them to logon more than once etc.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
Han - Your wrapper script sounds interesting. Can you explain what a wrapper script is? Could you post the contents of your script?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">5th December 2001, 09:40</div></div><div class="posttext">another way if you want more than just bsp to be able to login is to backup the ora_users file and to use a different one only containing say the superusers/users you want to access the system at that time. you can create the first one by copying the ora_users file and remarking out the users you don't want to be able to login. when finished put the original ora_users back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
touch $BSE/tmp/nologin<br />
<br />
after the work is done<br />
<br />
delete the file &quot;nologin&quot;<br />
<br />
thats all.</div></div><hr />

i simply change the rights of $BSE/lib/ipc_info if only one user must logon.<br />
<br />
chmod 400 $BSE/lib/ipc_info<br />
 chown &lt;user&gt; $BSE/lib/ipc_info<br />
<br />
if more than one user has to logon i change bshell (or whaterever you use in ipc_info) in ipc_info to something different and tell the users to change that in the bwclient:<br />
bshell          s    0    0  p  ${BSE}/bin/bshell6.2<br />
<br />
to for example:<br />
bstest          s    0    0  p  ${BSE}/bin/bshell6.2<br />
<br />
This is a quick and diryt method..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dgajewsky</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Create a role in oracle that you can assign to the users that will allow them access (i.e. weekend_users).  Grant the necessary access to the tables for this user (i.e. insert, update, select, delete on all baan table objects) then create a pl/sql procedure that will revoke the standard privileges from the users (i.e. baanuser_role) and when the users not in the weekend_users group attempt to login they will get an error because they do not have the necessary privileges to read the tools tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have ever installed Baan, and had the install crash, you will find that you can not login to Baan, but during the install it actually will ask for the username and password.  The installation can then login.  So how does the install script login, when you cant from another session?<br />
<br />
Baan removes the bshell6.x login program and uses bshell6.x.install.  It's the same program, but by removing the bshell6.x baan successfully locks out everyone else.  If you look in the ipc info file you will see both names in the file.  You need to change your client profile, or create a new one to use the bshell6.x_install.  The works for interactive login and install scripts, however it may not work for Jobs.</div></div><hr />
