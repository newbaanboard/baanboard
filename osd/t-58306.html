<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jbrozul</div><div class="date">23rd April 2010, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I belong to an organization in partnership with Infor ERP LN and IBM.<br />
One of the task assigned to me is to produce the specifications of the hardware needed by a certain customer who is migrating to this new ERP solution.<br />
<br />
- The customer has group of companies in multiple remote sites but a single site houses the main application server.<br />
- They need a user access of not less than 50 employees but not greater than 100 employees.<br />
- They prefer using MS SQL Server 2005 as the database running on Windows Server 2008 Enterprise Edition.<br />
- Projecting that the capability of the machine will be good for 5 years.<br />
- Expected growth factor is 10% per year on data and user access.<br />
- I need to know which IBM machine/model will be most suitable for the requirement.<br />
<br />
I hope you could help me on this.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

How about if i prefer a X3650 M2, which is a rack-mounted type...what could be the best specification of its components to meet the given load of the application?</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
Thats an article from ZD-NET (March 2009):<br />
<br />
Inforl and IBM recently  completed  a benchmark to analyze  the performance of the Infor ERP 6.1 solution  with LN DB2  Universal Database  V8.1. and Linux on the POWER5+ architecture. The benchmark was run using the standard Infor ERP benchmark kit. The tests included  an analysis  to determine  Infor ERP user role behavior, memory requirements  per user and a general rule of thumb regarding  the duration and resource  consumption  for batch  jobs. This collaborative project also resulted in enhancements and tuning to the application software, configuration, database and operating system that in total, delivered significant scalability. <br />
