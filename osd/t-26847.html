This problem is reported by users when they didn't find the existing data in reports. <br />
<br />
It is Baan 4c4/SP 18 with Informix database.<br />
<br />
None of the logs (reconfig, informix) etc show any trace of these missing records. Unfortunately these tables are not audited.<br />
<br />
We are trying to restore the data from the backup.<br />
<br />
Can any of you help us in analyzing the probable data loss. Even if user deletes it could not be to this extent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you customized the tables with additional indexes and these indexes are unique, then Baan will discard the duplicate records without warning durig reconfig.<br />
<br />
This could be one reason.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">10th April 2006, 21:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, the index change can easily cause this problem and not give an error.   Please check the logs of the reconfigure after the SP upgrade, and check for your tables.  It should have a count of records before and after the reconfigure - does it not?<br />
<br />
If the table would not reconfigure, or there was some error in the process, then you should have gotten errors.  In that case, your missing records MAY be on the system as R.t(tablename)(comany number) files.  In Windows these will probably be in the TMP direcory.  These are data files during the reconfigure.  If they exist for your tables there are commands to bring that data back.  Check the boards for 'reconfigure' or post back if that is the case and you need the commands to restore.</div></div><hr />

I was told that this is known problem in informix. after reconfig (may not be always)  The record won't be fetched by select , previous or next. <br />
<br />
There is a no data loss.  After CRDD and reconfig the reorg is required.<br />
In our case we did reorg of all relevant tables and users could see their data.</div></div><hr />
