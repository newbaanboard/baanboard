I think the only 'official' choice you have is to go for Oracle 8.0.x in which case 8.0.6 would be the highest available version. Some of this was discussed in the following thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9). <br />
<br />
I haven't tried the workaround  that was proposed in that thread yet myself.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, you are right. It has been some time ago that I did a fresh install so I don't know if the Baan installation procedure does support that. The older versions didn't.</div></div><hr />
