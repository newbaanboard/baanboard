<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">petefinnigan</div><div class="date">22nd September 2003, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I have been having recent discussions with two of the guys who post to this board who about how to implement single sign on or central user management with Oracle / unix and baan. My suggestion is to look into LDAP with either Oracle OID or MS Active directory as the directory server. I am not a baan expert so don't know of the baan side.<br />
<br />
The second much simpler option is to put together a Unix script that will create Baan, Oracle and Unix accounts in one go.<br />
<br />
So two questions please.<br />
<br />
1 - has anyone any experiences of using LDAP with oracle / unix and baan - good or bad. - or any documents.<br />
<br />
2 - Does anyone else feel a unix script is worth putting together to create and change user accounts and passwords - or does anyone have one already? if not I will put one up on my site (after its written of course). If people are interested then i will come back to you for common requirements / privileges etc...:-)<br />
<br />
thanks <br />
<br />
kind regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FriarTuck</div><div class="date">20th December 2004, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We are presently moving from using a central script utility to add/delete/modify users for UNIX/Baan/Oracle.  Although the script worked wonderfully, we ran into several issues pertaining to the recent Sarbanes-Oxley fiasco (US legislation to avert more Enron debacles).<br />
<br />
Since we have both a UNIX/Oracle guy (me) and Baan people we are no longer able to do this sort of scripting since it requires knowledge of root/bsp/oracle passwords for individuals who no longer are authorized access to passwords/accounts not directly related to their job (ie only the unix guy knows 'root').<br />
<br />
For account administration, we've had to break the tasks into their respective teams.<br />
<br />
We, too, are looking to do single login and are presently investigating KRB5 and LDAP.  This is no easy task if you consider your normal work load plus the added time necessary to investigate the options and test.</div></div><hr />
