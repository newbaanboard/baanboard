  Is there any specific reasons why you would want to shift your db to another server?  <br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sally2112</div><div class="date">10th September 2007, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">The customer buy a new server as database server, and I do not want to install baan again,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">10th September 2007, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">So its your decision to have database on another server or did the customer require such a change?<br />
The reason for asking you this is because you are moving to a setup called 3-tier which has its pros and cons and that needs to be studied before venturing into it. More so, you would also need to check with the Baan sizing tool which gives you more information of what to expect from such a setup with hardware that you have at your disposal..<br />
This much is assured that the sessions that you work with, for e.g time taking process like integration posting, batch finalizing, jobs, in short querying the database and writing would take longer time than it would have taken on a 2-tier system(App and Db on one server).<br />
 <br />
There are many cases that are opened here(Baanboard) on this regard, and i would advise you to go through them before going ahead with the seperation of db from app server...<br />
 <br />
Good Luck!!<br />
