<br />
We have BAAN Vc, porting sets 7.1d.12, oracle 9i, AIX 5.3. <br />
<br />
We are using crystal report 11 and everything was going fine.<br />
<br />
We upgraded our database to 10g, after this step crystal was still working, till we upgraded our porting sets to 8.4a.02 then crystal stopped working giving errors (Logon Failed, Version of client versus server not correct!)<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea how this can be solved?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Baan is no longer supported by crystal: See last post here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=28827)</div></div><hr />

We had issues (not with Crystal) and Infor had to re-issue this portingset to correct problems. It may help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mnakkach</div><div class="date">1st April 2008, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">We booked BAAN infor case and they provided the solution.<br />
<br />
They sent us http://secure2.support.baan.com/ftpdownload/updates/port/8.4a.02/  file and downloaded the shdbapi.dll file and overwrite it in c:\Program Files\Business Objects\Integration Kit for Baan 11\Native\bin\SSA_BaanERP50c<br />
<br />
Now new porting sets work fine with crystal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our main problem was the Baan Sales Statistics reports were out of alignment and we had incorrect reports per Business Partner - total had dropped down to the next BP</div></div><hr />
