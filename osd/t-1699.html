<br />
And why does it need changing?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">15th April 2002, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">opps! Nasty. Well changing the password is the same as changing a user password, but it can have effects on the way baan works (you have to change the password but can get yourself into a problem, ie, when do you change it. Before and no access, after and... no access!). So can be a problem very quickly, easy and far less complicated would be to just take any form of SQL editor off the users who are causing the problem.</div></div><hr />

As far as I can remember there was nothing else to do, I certainly had no problem after changing it.<br />

You might need to check that the password is not being used for report packages using iconnect on PC clients.</div></div><hr />

No wrong, you must also update the encrypted password in your $BSE/lib/inf/inf_groups file. You can do this using the utility $BSE/bin/inf_admin6.1</div></div><hr />
