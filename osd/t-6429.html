I am working on Baan IV c4 SP9 and more later on SP10 and after Baan V.<br />
The OS is Windows NT with Oracle databases (8i)<br />
In all the Baan script we use the &quot;select&quot; like that:<br />
select tfgld205.*<br />
from tfgld205<br />
where.........<br />
selectdo................<br />
..................<br />
I think it's a good way of programing when we are with Bisam,<br />
but it's really a good way of optimization with Oracle ?<br />
What do you think of the different ways of programation of SQL Baan ?<br />
Thanks<br />
Kind regards</div></div><hr />

2. trace your select by using TT_SQL_TRACE=0200, by this you can check which select statement performs best.<br />
<br />
Basicly your statement is fine. Of course you can optimize a bit by naming only the fields you need however in print programs its common to read all fields of a table. Be sure to use an index in your where clause if possible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">27th August 2002, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Selecting index in the where clause is not enough when you run level 2 database. The database driver leaves choice of index to database, even when in the where clause the index is obvious used (like in select tfgld205._index1 = {i.cono, ... i.ccur}), the RDBMS can choose index 3 to read from. This is overruled with the &quot;order by&quot; clause.<br />
<br />
So if you want to read under all conditions with index_1, add order by tfgld205._index1.</div></div><hr />

Quote out of the before mentioned document:<br />
<br />
Choosing the index<br />
Problem<br />
It is important to know how the driver will define an index before it parses a query.<br />
Solution<br />
The database driver will create index hints to the RDBMS. These index hints are<br />
defined as follows:<br />
First, the where condition is evaluated to define which table fields are checked.<br />
After this evaluation, the number of index parts in each index (from 1 to the number of<br />
indices) is compared with the number of matching fields used in the where condition.<br />
The index number with the highest hit rate (most matching) will be taken as index hint<br />
to the database.<br />
If there are equal numbers of fields in the where condition that match the index fields,<br />
the index with the lowest number is taken.<br />
There are two solutions to force the hint generator to give the correct index hint to the<br />
database.<br />
n<br />
Implement order by table._index?.<br />
n<br />
Implement index hint in 4gl program. (Available from the Verdi release).<br />
See chapter 3, section 10: Index hints.</div></div><hr />
