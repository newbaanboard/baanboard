<br />
The implementation of the ERP LN is under process and going quite well in my company. I am approaching towards creating a Backup Policy for management of the ERP Database when we go live. I wanted to know, if you have any information regarding the same.<br />
<br />
Please provide me with a good backup policy for the same.<br />
<br />
Ln Version- 10.4<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No single backup policy can meet the needs of all users. A policy that works well for a system with one user, for example, could be inadequate for a system that serves one hundred users. Likewise, a policy developed for a system on which many files are changed daily would be inefficient for a system on which data changes infrequently.<br />
<br />
Whatever the appropriate backup strategy for your site, it is very important that one exist and that backups be done frequently and regularly. It is difficult to recover from data loss if a good backup strategy has not been implemented.<br />
<br />
Only you can determine the best backup policy for your system, but the following general guidelines might be helpful:<br />
<br />
    Make sure you can recover from major losses.<br />
<br />
    Can your system continue to run after any single fixed disk failure? Can you recover your system if all the fixed disks should fail? Could you recover your system if you lost your backup diskettes or tape to fire or theft? If data were lost, how difficult would it be to re-create it? Think through possible, even unlikely, major losses, and design a backup policy that enables you to recover your system after any of them.<br />
    Check your backups periodically.<br />
<br />
    Backup media and their hardware can be unreliable. A large library of backup tapes or diskettes is useless if data cannot be read back onto a fixed disk. To make certain that your backups are usable, display the table of contents from the backup tape periodically (using restore -T or tar -t for archive tapes). If you use diskettes for your backups and have more than one diskette drive, read diskettes from a drive other than the one on which they were created. You might want the security of repeating each level 0 backup with a second set of media. If you use a streaming tape device for backups, you can use the tapechk command to perform rudimentary consistency checks on the tape. For more information about these commands, see restore -T, tar -t, and tapechk.<br />
    Keep old backups.<br />
<br />
    Develop a regular cycle for reusing your backup media; however, do not reuse all of your backup media. Sometimes it is months before you or some other user of your system notices that an important file is damaged or missing. Save old backups for such possibilities. For example, you could have the following three cycles of backup tapes or diskettes:<br />
        Once per week, recycle all daily diskettes except the Friday diskette.<br />
        Once per month, recycle all Friday diskettes except for the one from the last Friday of the month. This makes the last four Friday backups always available.<br />
        Once per quarter, recycle all monthly diskettes except for the last one. Keep the last monthly diskette from each quarter indefinitely, preferably in a different building.<br />
    Check file systems before backing up.<br />
<br />
    A backup made from a damaged file system might be useless. Before making your backups, it is good policy to check the integrity of the file system with the fsck command. For more information, see fsck.<br />
    Ensure files are not in use during a backup.<br />
<br />
    Do not use the system when you make your backups. If the system is in use, files can change while they are being backed up, and the backup copy will not be accurate.<br />
    Back up your system before major changes are made to the system.<br />
<br />
    It is always good policy to back up your entire system before any hardware testing or repair work is performed or before you install any new devices, programs, or other system features.<br />
    Other factors.<br />
<br />
    When planning and implementing a backup strategy, consider the following factors:<br />
        How often does the data change? The operating system data does not change very often, so you do not need to back it up frequently. User data, on the other hand, usually changes frequently, so you should back it up frequently.<br />
        How many users are on the system? The number of users affects the amount of storage media and frequency required for backups.<br />
        How difficult would it be to re-create the data? It is important to consider that some data cannot be re-created if there is no backup available.<br />
<br />
Having a backup strategy in place to preserve your data is very important. Evaluating the needs of your site will help you to determine the backup policy that is best for you. Perform user information backups frequently and regularly. Recovering from data loss is very difficult if a good backup strategy has not been implemented.<br />
<br />
Note: For the backup of named pipes (FIFO special files) the pipes can be either closed or open. However, the restoration fails when the backup is done on open named pipes. When restoring a FIFO special file, its i-node is all that is required to recreate it because it contains all its characteristic information. The content of the named pipe is not relevant for restoration. Therefore, the file size during backup is zero (all the FIFOs closed) before the backup is made.<br />
Attention: System backup and restoration procedures require that the system be restored on the same type of platform from which the backup was made. In particular, the CPU and I/O planar boards must be of the same type.<br />

<br />
Thanks for a response. Its almost 10 months that I posted this ;) Anyway, we have prepared a proper backup policy at our end.<br />
<br />
A short description would be:-<br />
<br />
1. We take application and database backups daily between 1am  to 3am in the morning using bat file for application and SSMS for Database.<br />
<br />
2. The database backups are taken into 3-4 slots daily which will be differential backup.<br />
<br />
3. The backups are stored at 3-4 places for security purpose.<br />
<br />
4. We went for Portable Hard Disks for storage as Tape Drives costs heavily.<br />
<br />
5. We also take a system backup up in case of any system failure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Back up seems appropriate , once again - back up policy differs for different criteria .<br />
<br />
i happen to come across this thread today by email notification for SPAM , hence posted guidelines for the same .<br />
<br />

<br />
I guessed that :) Anyway, thanks for your post. It will help others as well entering into Baan World !</div></div><hr />
