I recently upgraded a system from level 1 driver of sql server to the level 2 driver.<br />
The performance improved a lot but now when I query a table like tfgld410 or tfgld106 (tables with millions of records and indexes composed by a lot of columns) using the ttaad4100 session the performance is terrible.<br />
Im searching the records using the first index of the table (clustered index) and when I was using the level 1 driver the system displayed the result immediately.<br />
I also did a test querying the same table with the same parameters using the query analyzer and the system also displayed the result immediately.<br />
Im using porting set 6.1c.07.07.<br />
Does anyone know anything about this issue?<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

Using other indexes the performance is acceptable (not fantastic).<br />
I suspect that its doing a table scan when using the clustered index.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 21:29</div></div><div class="posttext">you probably haven't set your db_resource parameters correctly<br />
or your mssql_storage. <br />
<br />
Look in the SQL driver manual for how to change them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">We upgraded to Level 2 year and a half ago and the improvements in performance was great. Didn't had problel with ttaad4100. (We are on 5c though)<br />
Couple of ideas, You may want to run a re-org on those tables (this could take a while). Probably you may have a corrupted index..<br />
Also did you run db optimization in SQL ? That may help too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">14th February 2006, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Im not having problems with performance. I can even say that the performance increased a lot. Im having problems with session ttaad4100 in tables that have more than 10 million records and indexes with a lot of concatenated fields. I also noticed that searching data using the first index (clustered) is even worst than using any other.<br />
I suspect that the problem has something to do with the initialization of environment variables on the db_resource file but I didnt found any literature that deals with this issue deeply.<br />
I found a reference to a manual called Technical Reference Guide for Microsoft SQL Server Database Driver (U8173 US) but after the upgrade of the SSA support site Im not able to download anything from there. It seems they upgraded from horse to donkey (nothing against donkeys).<br />
Now Im looking for a common SQL server level 2 db_ resource file to compare with the one I have.<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look for U8173C US<br />
<br />
BTW: On my first step to the site, I didn't find anything. After configurating my profile it worked much better. What is your problem with the site? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">15th February 2006, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">My problem is now solved. Some good soul sent me the &quot;Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Driver Level 1 to Level 2 Migration Guide&quot; manual where I could find the correct parameters for the db_resource file.<br />
Talking a bit about the support site what's happening is when I look for some document (using the number, keywords, etc) the new page that's opened is always blank. Another thing is that the support people close the cases without the acceptance of the customers. I think that the &quot;Solution proposed&quot; disappeared.</div></div><hr />
