I am not a windows specialist, so probably I am overlooking something.<br />
<br />
We work with 5b/5c on windows2000. We use the task schedule of W2k to schedule our jobs. The jobs are setup to run as a specific job user.<br />
<br />
We notice that sometimes printjobs failes, i.e. they leave a bpf file in the tmp directory instead of actual printing the thing. At these times you can find an error in the eventlog saying 'No valid printer in your setup'.<br />
This can be solved by using the default printer setting in bw (portingset 7.1d.03 and up). However I want to be able to make use of specific printers not just one. So I configure my printers in the devices make sure that they work. <br />
<br />
Still on about 1 of 5 prints it fails with the error message above. SSA is telling us that they nobody else is having this problem. <br />
<br />
If we keep the console logged on as the job user than the problem doesn't occur.<br />
<br />
Any clues about what could be wrong?<br />
<br />

<br />
I just started to look into an issue that we are having here with &quot;hanging&quot; jobs.<br />
There is an inconsistent pattern of jobs hanging (showing the vtemulator as active process), but when ran from the console (or even when running them again) they execute just fine.<br />
<br />
I have strong suspicions towards ottstpconv but I don't have enough data yet to support my case.<br />
<br />
I do have a case open with Baan, although I have not shared my suspicions with them yet.<br />
<br />
Drop me an email and I'll be happy to share what I have for analysis so far.</div></div><hr />

Although I'm running 4c4, I also am have issues with hanging jobs.  I've discovered that my hanging jobs all used ASCIF (Rewrite Plain Text File) for it's output.  I got a runtime error from stpconv.  Changing the device to F output to file (No Conversion) allowded the job to complete.  I have a case logged with support but I'm not having any luck getting things done.<br />
