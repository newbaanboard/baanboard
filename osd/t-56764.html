Is there any solutions to avoid problems with Float decimals?<br />
I have a problem with  one customized table which has datatype &quot;float&quot;.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
-37.253900000000002<br />
<br />
When browsing...this will conflict with other row, which hasn't got that much decimals. But when I try to shorten this, it will not work. I can't make it shorter like -37.2540. It will always be with this kind of crazy value.<br />
Bshell handles these as rounded and this brings problems because it's not rounded in DB. Can only be seen by using unload from dbaccess (or bdbpre).<br />
<br />
Database is Informix on AIX (baan4c4)<br />
<br />
bdbpre/post is not a solution. This problem happens even when inserting new row via GTM.</div></div><hr />

with functions like &quot;deccvasc()&quot;<br />

Here's my response to the other person in case you missed it.<br />

<br />
you can't index float fields, don't even try. I suspect that's why you're getting wrong row returned.<br />

Yup, you'll notice that Baan never indexes a float field. and that's why.<br />
