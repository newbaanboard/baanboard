I am trying to send a mail after the backup has finished and then i want to mail logfile of the backup.<br />
so far nog problem, because i can do that with a simple commandline command.<br />
BUT... the logfile-name changes everyday.<br />
now i am trying to create a batchfile to find the correct filename and execute the command for that filename. <br />
Hmm.. that's where the problems begin.<br />
<br />
When i execute the command &quot;dir /b /d /o-d&quot; i get a list of names. I now need the first name in my command to send te mail.<br />
<br />
some suggestions or maybe a better wat to accomplice this?</div></div><hr />

Exactly for this kind of 'questions' I am trying to convince my company to use linux/unix as OS instead of windows.<br />
Batch scripting in dos is not so easy (but I have to confess that it depends with wich os you grew up ;-)  ). For sure someone can tell us how to do this in a batch script.<br />
<br />
If you are familiar with unix scripting you could install windows services for unix (from MS), or use similair free products like cygwin on your server in order to use a very simple shell script to solve your problem.<br />
<br />
I don't want to start another flame around windows/unix but for me the windows services for unix makes my live a lot more simpler.<br />
<br />

They will give you some of the UNIX functionality from within your windows environment.<br />
