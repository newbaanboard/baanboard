<br />
we are tryint to do two things with our BaanERP 5.0 c running on Oracle 8.0.5<br />
<br />
1. We are going to take a Full export of Oracle DB (all baan tables - tools and data) and import it back after re-organising some filesystem and table space issues(Database guys do this).If we at this point import the DB back at Oracle level, will it work??Will we be able to get Baan Back to the Original State??<br />
<br />
2. We are trying to get all production data into test basically.If we take a Full export Oracle DB of Production(all baan tables - tools and data) from production environment and put it on test Environment (Empty Database of Test DB instance)will it work??Will there be any licensing issues.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your comments.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Number 1: Will be ok for sure.<br />
<br />
Number 2: Would be ok for sure in baanIV. I am not 100% sure for BaanERP as the licence mechanism is different, but I think so. <br />
<br />
If you rebuild the database from scratch, than obviously you need to make sure, you will also recreate users/roles etc.<br />
<br />
If you are not sure about, what you are doing, than do step 2 before step 1!!<br />
<br />
enjoy<br />

What kind of re-org of file system are you referring to. Just changing the mount points or directory structures ? Changing the mount points for failovers/high-availability would not affect. But if you change the $BSE paths and the directory structures below it you can have issues as the Package VRC paths are defined inside the tools tables - ttadv1115m000 - Directories of Software Components.<br />

To do a production to test clone you have to do both the database/OS clones to keep the objects/source files in sync. But your steps are not clear. If you need production data why are you copying tools database ? I assume the production data is located in a different company and database than tools in that environment. If you like to copy only the production company/database then the DD have to be in sync.<br />

Will there be any licensing issues.<br />
If you are on BaaN-ERP then you have to validate the ASM, BCLM information.</div></div><hr />
