<br />
I don't think it's anything to do with pam.conf as we have another Linux server that works with baanlogin and it has nothing in pam.conf.<br />
<br />
Below are errors from the Linux logs perhaps this will shed some more light?<br />

can you do a<br />

<br />
I've run the ldd blogind6.1 as suggested and the output is below. I must admit I'm not sure what this is telling me. If I run this on another Linux server where blogind is running without issue I get the same results.<br />

<br />
So that looks ok.<br />
<br />
So i'd focus on these guys<br />

Nov 7 17:01:12 teeis10baan01 blogind6.1: PAM [dlerror: /lib/security/added: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory]<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is blogind6.2/PAM unable to open that directory? does it exist / is it readable on the system that works?<br />
<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />

<br />
The /lib/security directory exists but there isn't anything, file or directory. called 'added'. However, this is the same on the server where blogind6.1 works. The /lib/security directory and files underneath all have 755 permissions.<br />
<br />
I have sent Redhat support sysreports from both servers and they tell me that both have the same versions of PAM running and that security set-up is the same on both servers. So they are telling me it's the Baan application where the issue lies. So it looks like I'm in for a game of 'ping-pong' between Redhat and Baan.<br />
<br />
Your help is appreciated as I'm getting nowhere fast with the 'official' support channels.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
doesn't make sense that if the same vesion of software (blogind) worked on box X but not box Y that it would be the software that was broken...<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you compare your /etc/pam.d/ directories across both servers?<br />
<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />

<br />
In /etc/pam.d both servers have the same files with the 'broken' server having a few more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As extra (you never know), I once had strange errors with PAM when my groups and passwd were not synchronized with their shadow's. Check also these (pwck and grpck to make sure that they are ok).</div></div><hr />
