<br />
We are trying to use triggers in an SQL Server database (in an ecollaboration one). The thing is that we try to update the value of a field after the corresponding ecol dll have inserted the record on that table... we have tried some theads, but they donÂ´t work as well as we would like... The field in the record updates OK, but some other fields in that same record that without the thread were filled with data get null whenever we activate the thread. Does anyone have an idea why this happens?...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance... regards</div></div><hr />
