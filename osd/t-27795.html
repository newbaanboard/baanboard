<br />
Considering if we have 100 Baan licenses wich are concurrent, how many Informix license should we be having ? (for Informix 9.21)<br />
<br />
Whether there is any differentiation between Workgroup as well as Enterprise versions of Infomix.<br />
<br />
Is there any document from IBM or BAAN which explains this ?:( :confused:</div></div><hr />

In the Workgroup flavor, the licences are per seat. In this case you should buy many Informix licences as baan licences you have. <br />
<br />
In enterprice flavor, the licences are per processor. In this case you should buy many Informix licences as processors you have.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, it means that if I have 100 Baan Licenses, then I should be having 100 Informix licences in Informix Workgroup edition<br />
<br />
While I should be having only two enterprice  licences of Informix (as we have 2 processor server) of in case of Informix Enterprise edition ...right.<br />
<br />
But, there are separate server licences and client licences. So how does it work for Server and Client licenses ?<br />
<br />
IS THERE ANY DOCUMENT FROM BAAN OR IBM WHICH DESCRIBES THIS  ?<br />
If I could get the requisit link for this then it would be really helpful.</div></div><hr />

I have recently found out that the informix licensing may be based baan session, not baan user license.  This would mean you would have to have an informix license for every allowable session of Baan - as controlled in the Baan User maintenance.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Confirmations?</div></div><hr />
