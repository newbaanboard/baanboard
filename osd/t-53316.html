<br />
This is my first post and I am not a BaaN or ERP guy.<br />
<br />
My customer has implemented BaaN over TBase database, I don't have exact version of any right now, but can ask if needed.<br />
<br />
Requirement : How to connect to TBase? Somebody said that you cannot connect to TBase over SQL and must use some kind of text file for reading data from TBase. I anticipate an expert comment on the best method to connect directly with TBase using either .NET or JAVA.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">13th August 2008, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Many years ago, there was a product called &quot;Safari Report Writer&quot;. This came along with an ODBC driver, which could handle tbase. You could have used this to connect via Java/.Net directly to tbase.<br />
<br />
But I am not sure this product is still around. It's a long time ago and tbase is a long time ago. Always interesting to hear, there are still customers using it, as it has so many problems associated with it.<br />

<br />
I never came across an ODBC connector to Baan tbase<br />
Despite this fact we successfully implemented several solutions where tbase data had to be accessed from outside Baan.<br />
2 fundamental questions have to be answered:<br />
1) is write access required?<br />
2) which response times / which level of actuality is required?<br />
If you only want to provide ODBC access for report functionality and yesterdays data is ok, then it's a piece of cake to dump all tables at night and for instance populate a mysql database with these - we use this for many intra-/internet applications.<br />
Another way is to write a session which always runs in a bshell and processes requests transmitted in files or pipes, answering via files if necessary.<br />
There is also the possibility of using qptool6.1 in a scripting solution, but we only did basic testing with this way. qptool is an executable found in $BSE/bin and was build to test DB connections. It is capable of writing too and gives access to any DB supported by the portingset with the full syntax of Baan sql as used in Baan programs. I would bet that this &quot;Safari&quot; thing was using qptool :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">13th August 2008, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">True, there is no ODBC connector for Baan . As suggested by others , one needs to write a session in Baan and transfer flat files to .Net  / Java application . This is how we used our third party apps when we used tbase .<br />
<br />
Within Baan environment, we use dynamic query in Baan 4gl to construct queries on any baan tables .<br />
<br />
All these however require baan knowledge . I remember an Infor sales rep promising a connector for tbase for cognos reporting. Probably u should enquire with Infor for these purpose.</div></div><hr />
