In a 1-2 months we will have a migration.We are changing our Informix 7.3 FD5 database with Oracle 9i and also changing <br />
our HP L2000 server with IBM p630.<br />
<br />
In our Baan IV c3 platform we have 4 separate active company and their finance package is common,which is on the first company.<br />
<br />
Our new server combination will be at cluster structure (one for database,and the other is application, Baan) with 200 Baan clients.<br />
<br />
At migration process, we want some users can access and use Baan (especially RF barcode users) and the others cant access to Baan, means that we want to put a restriction on users. For example, the users at planning department and barcode RF users at company 1 and 3 can access the Baan at migration , but all users at company 2 shouldnt access the Baan.<br />
<br />
How we can do it with ipc_info? should we use 4 different ipc_info for each company to manage it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ipc_info is not a setting based on company.<br />
<br />
Refer to the thread - <br />

How can I count users?  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8785&amp;highlight=ipcinfo) <br />
<br />
Having different bshell tags for different set of user does the trick of restricted access. You just need to edit and remove the entry during migrations to block from users from getting into the system/environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Move all the $BSE/lib/user/uxxx of the users you dont want to login into temp folder. Then you can move the files back when they allowed to login.<br />
