It almost sounds like windows permissions for that user. I believe that<br />
the baan user needs to be a local user (not a domain user) and be a local administrator. <br />
<br />
Also: &quot;192.168.0.**'bshell&quot; looks a little strange. what do you have for the host field in the bw config?<br />

<br />
don't know whether this will be of help, but on unix systems I usually get exactly this error, when the client computer trying to connect via GUI is not listed in /etc/hosts.<br />
Does the user that wants to connect exist on the server? Perhaps adding the IP and name of the client in {WINDIR}/system32/hosts will help?<br />

<br />
In MMC (Ms. Mgt. Console) t saw that the Port in Baan Logic Service change to 256 not 512 this monday morning. fyi in Baan NT Manager Menu the port number is 512.<br />
Until saturday the port still 512 and on Sunday the electrycity was down off for a day. And this morning the port change to 256 when the baan server up.<br />
How comes ? (is ti coz. the virus ?) and how to chnage it.. I tried to change but the system asking the account and password. pls. help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I remmember the default port for the Baan &quot;Rexec&quot; service is 512. You login on the server with the Administrator and try to cahnge the port number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beniabdullah</div><div class="date">31st May 2005, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mr.,<br />
<br />
Correct I agree that the port is default. One thing that I do not understand how comes it happend ??.<br />
I can not change the port in Ms. MMC even I used the Admin. User, it's always asking the account that I never know.</div></div><hr />

let's hope it isn't a virus.. Baan has enough problems, if people start writing Baan specific viruses we're all doomed.<br />
