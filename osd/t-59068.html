<br />
I am looking for advice on a couple of things as we've never done an upgrade of this sort.<br />
<br />
We have an existing LN FP2 that we are thinking of going to LN FP6 and we are on Oracle 10.2. runing on AIX 5.3<br />
<br />
Issues<br />
1) We're out of hardisk space on our machine<br />
2) How to go about maintaining existing data and copying it into FP6<br />
<br />
In terms of harddisk space we can get a storage drawer and plug it in but my concern is the migration of the rootvg, ERPLN FP2 application and the Oracle DB and engine. I'm not sure the history behind the machine but for some reason we have hdisk0=osdba (Standalone 73.4 GB) , hdisk1=rootvg (Standalone 73.4 GB), hdisk2=osdba (This is 3x 134.8GB Raid 5 array containing the Oracle table space and indexd space. There are multiple extents splitting data across the different drives inside and outside the RAID so I think this is a disasterous set up.<br />
<br />
Current Hardware<br />
1 x 73.4 GB (Non Raid,VG=osdba)<br />
1 x 73.4 GB (Non raid,VG=rootvg)<br />
3 x 136.8 GB (Raid5,VG=osdba) <br />
<br />
Proposed<br />
1 x 73.4 GB (Raid1,VG=rootvg)<br />
1 x 73.4 GB (Raid1 Mirror,VG=rootvg)<br />
3 x 136.8 GB (Raid5,VG=osdba) <br />
4 x 450 GB (Raid5,VG=osdba) <br />
<br />
To migrate of all the FP2 data,Oracle Tablespace and Index into the 450GB harddrives and also to install in the FP6 into the new 450GB Raid5 array. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any comments or Ideas on if this would be a good way to do things or would not be a good idea? Would appreciate any feedback on this.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

ERP applications are normally heavily I/O based so using only a few spindles will definitely going to hurt unless you are talking about a few users.<br />
<br />
Normally it's better to get the smallest disks you can get and get more spindles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks.. We probably will look into just adding additional hard drives and increase the logical extents instead of rearranging the RAID despite that being the best practice.<br />
