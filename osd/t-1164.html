If it's truth, what is the minimun porting set ?.   What version of Baan (4c, 5b, 5c) is Required and what version of SQL-Server (7 or 2000) is required ?.   <br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

The driver Level II is still in tests.   It isn't available yet.<br />
Maybe in 5 months we will have it.<br />

 <br />
 Do you have more information from Baan about the version of Baan (4c, 5b, 5c)  and the version of SQL-Server (7 or 2000) ?<br />
<br />
 I have a feeling it will work only for Microsoft SQL Server 2000.<br />
<br />
 Waiting for updates,</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I have been told is that it is already in tests.<br />
<br />
I think the driver will work on SQL-Server 2000 also, but maybe it will be available for both (7 and 2000) hopefully.<br />

        Level2 is available only for SQL Server 2000.  It has not been tested with SQL Server 7. (An enthusiastic attempt might show u that level2 works with SQL Server 7 too, but never do that.... it hasn't been tested... means don't use it).  <br />
 <br />
        Level2 will be available for BaanERP5.0c and BaanERP5.2a onwards.  BaanERP5.2a is GA now.  So level2 driver is available already.<br />
<br />
More Details:<br />
<br />
  (level2 is not yet released for BaanERP5.0c.  It is under a beta customer program and can be released any time soon!)<br />
<br />
       BaanERP5.0c -  SQL Server 2000 - level1  and level2<br />
                                SQL Server 7 - level1 only<br />
     <br />
       BaanERP5.2a - SQL Server 2000 - level2 only</div></div><hr />
