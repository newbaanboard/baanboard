<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wrobins</div><div class="date">9th November 2009, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">When you use the Create Sequential Dump session on a large table, it breaks the export into multiple files.  The first file will end in .S and the second will be .S.1.  The second file will begin with the Date string, but not include the #$!pre-dump!$#00037cv record that was included in the first file.  What I need to know is if the first file has anything at the end of the file that tells the import session that there is another file to read.  <br />
I've written a script to generate a file in the same format that Create Sequential Dump does and I'm using this to move data from a 5c instance to LN.  However, I don't have an editor that can handle a file as big as these files, so I can't see if there is a something at the end of the first file telling it to look for a second file.  When I try to use Create Table from Sequential Dump session, it processes the first file, but not the second.  Can anyone tell me if there is something I need to do in the first or second file to make this work?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
