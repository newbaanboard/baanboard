<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wvholland</div><div class="date">9th July 2002, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that there was a recent post on Baan and Linux, but what I'm interested in is why our customers want Baan on Linux. I'm the product manager within Baan ERP, among others,  responsible for OS flavors<br />
<br />
What is the driving force behind people asking for Linux. Is it to reduce the cost of ownership? What flavor of Linux are people expecting, RedHat, Caldera, Suze, or waiting for United?<br />
<br />
Do people expect the support from Linux from the hardware vendors, like IBM, new HP or even SUN? Or do they expect a one box solution, like RedHat on a IBM xSeries (zSeries) with ERP 5.0c on it as one offering.<br />
<br />
Please provide some of your feelings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th July 2002, 22:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Winfried,<br />
<br />
A couple of things of the top of my head why Linux is key and why Baan should make it a supported platform.<br />
<br />
Cost of ownership<br />
This is most certainly the biggest pro, in comparison with the other commercial UNIX flavours. Alot of smaller customers (SME) are forced to choose for the Wintel platform because of budget constraints. Yet I don't believe in Windows as a good platform for any type of ERP application. Sorry NT lovers, but NT is an administration nightmare. And too often the NT version of a software component is still an inferior port of the original UNIX version (ie. Oracle). So where to go else on the cheaper Intel platform? Linux.<br />
<br />
Open-source<br />
Some may take this a disadvantage but I'd like to see it as a strong point of Linux. Linux is  a platform developed by thousands, tens of thoudands of people across the world, incorporating new features at a very fast rate. Some of the innovation may not always progress in a 'stable' way but it will get there in the end. The stronger and bigger the Linux community and server market share will become, the faster this innovation process will take place. Eventually Linux could be a frontrunner amongst all the other UNIX versions.<br />
<br />
As to the Linux flavours: I think the major branches should be supported: RedHat, Suse, Debian. I wouldn't put all my eggs in the United basket just yet.<br />
<br />
As to support: best thing to do would for HW and SW vendors to team up and deliver a combined solution, either fully out-of-the-box or a looser model. Support price models can steer customers in either direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">9th July 2002, 23:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Winfried,<br />
<br />
First of all, let me say that it's a pleasure to know that Baan (you) is reading this board and is listening to what is being said here.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Let me add some arguments to this thread here.<br />
<br />
- Linux is no longer an obscure little OS, carried by a couple of freaks and geeks. It is a mature and growing OS that has numerous advantages (and disadvantages) over other systems.<br />
As such it should be added to Baan's arsenal, if only to maintain that 'full flavor' status.<br />
- Because of the low cost of Linux and the relative low hardware requirements that it has, it is ideal to use on test boxes, development machines and in training situations. It is perfect to set up fast and easy simulations and sandboxes without having to dig deep into the budget.<br />
- Other than server based, Linux would make a much better client to a unix server than MSW will ever be. I think some of the discussions here were on Linux as a client, rather than a server. Of course it will be a long road to replace all desktops, but having crucial applications (Baan) available will help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">James</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Winfried,<br />
<br />
There's no doubt that Linux is going to be a major presence in the future.  In fact its already a major presence now within the new upcoming technologies.  Baanboard runs on Linux, so does Google and many other websites, and even PDA's are now using Linux.  The opportunities are just so much more.<br />
<br />
Two factors are certain for the future: Internet Technologies and Cost Reduction.  Linux is right in the middle providing both these factors, and doing it well.<br />
<br />
As for Baan, the bottom line is that more licences will be sold.  There are markets around not broken into yet that can be exploited if Baan get the software and cost right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Winfried,<br />
<br />
as it was already said above: It's very good to know some of you Baan people are reading this board. Probably that's the nearest way to your customers and the consultants that implement your product that you can find. <br />
<br />
From my perspective working mostly for SMEs I can add one point of view: In small companies there are commonly two or three people in the IT department: One for the Hardware and MS Products, one for CAD, and one for Baan and all the rest. The BaaN Server maintenance (Hardware, Operating system and Database) is usually sourced out, if it's UNIX-based, because none of those guys dares to deal with that (vendor-proprietary, very specific, hardly documented, never-before-seen) environment. I have a customer where anew 40 GB hard disc for the Baan database comes to 5000 EUR all together, until it's installed, mounted to the OS, and made available to the database by external consultants.<br />
<br />
On the other side, server maintenaince can be done and usually is done by the Windows guy, if it's an NT system. NT Systems are cheaper in hardware maintainance. But they are very expensive in license costs. <br />
<br />
Now: The windows guys mentioned above slowly build up Linux (not Unix!) knowledge: In every SME I have worked with there was at least one Linux box running (by the way, here in Germany it's mostly SuSE) and maintained inhouse, either for fun-and-test purpouses or Internet related stuff (Web server, Gateway, Firewall...).<br />
<br />
To get to my point: Baan running on a Linux server would be cheaper for SMEs than running it on an NT server, but more stable. Linux boxes are Unix boxes that can and will be maintained inhouse.<br />
<br />
Baan did grow with &quot;micky mouse&quot; unix boxes, because they were cheaper than mainframes, especially for the SMEs.<br />
Baan did the jump from UNIX to NT in 1996 (I think) because of that reason: NT systems were cheaper, especially for the SMEs. Probably it's time to jump again to Linux for the same reason: because it's cheaper, especially for the SMEs.<br />
<br />
By the way, PostgreSQL is a freeware database with all features a database needs... ;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, just look at the current evolution, even within the proprietary OS/HW vendors:<br />
<br />
- IBM jumped in the wagon<br />
- Compaq/HP also jumped in<br />
- Intel is also actively supporting Linux<br />
- Oracle supports Linux<br />
- Even the other major ERP vendors jumped in...<br />
- ...<br />
<br />
There's no doubt that Linux is growing fast in the SME's (and even in bigger ones) and most companies are intersted in having cheaper Linux solutions and even because they can now split their current standalone server into a webserver, an ERP server, a DB server, etc., beeing able to bring redundancy and esay administration, a thing that only big OS/HW vendors could provide, at a huge cost.<br />
<br />
[I think the reasons are too many already...]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vizion</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see BaanERP on Mac OS X and XServe. It takes a lot less time to setup and has capacities of up to 360GB (Raid 5) in a 1U form factor. Database selection can be Oracle 9i/Sybase 11/MySQL.<br />
<br />
With a lot of patches, binaries, service packs, it is often necessary to test them on several servers. Mac OS X can have you test Baan sessions right away and move them directly to the live XServe box.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">11th July 2002, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Little to add to the above.<br />
<br />
One of the issues is that SCO (that was the Unix on cheap intel hardware) is degraded to B-platform, so no ongoing support anymore.<br />
<br />
For SME's running that platform, there is no alternative except for NT. If they liked NT, they did choose it in the first place, but they did not.<br />
<br />
Another point is said before but I feel the need to make it more explicit: Because a lot of IT people do something with Linux, the knowledge on that platform in general is more spread. This makes it more likely that people can handle their own systems.<br />
<br />
It is like on NT. Because the look and feel on Windows is known to many, it is assumed that a NT server is easier to manage. Although it is mentioned not to be true, still it is common thinking. That is one of the reasons why NT is big in SME. Even without knowledge of Baan you can more or less do management on NT.<br />
<br />
I still feel that particular in-dept Baan knowledge will and should be available from outsourcing companies. Because of its technique an ERP system is quite different from a native web server.<br />
<br />
What flavour of Linux? I think a consortium will be a good guess for the future, but indeed, they still have to prove their quality. If big players like RedHat do not join, then what is their power? But I think we have gone beyond the point where (too) small companies run a distribution that have a good quality product but a unsecure chance to survive.<br />
<br />
The selection of platform should more be done on thecnical grounds (suit for ERP, stability, ease of portability), so in my opinion should be left to Baan itself. As long as it is common available, it is ok.<br />
<br />
I think for test and demonstration purposes too Linux would be a good platform.<br />
<br />
One more thing: Please Do!</div></div><hr />

<br />
one more issue has to be seen. Linux will also come as a client system. See some of the government organizations starting to decide to drop Microsoft products and to start with open source client machines like Linux. Baan has for Baan4 the X-client but what about Baan5? Till now there is no client for non Windows clients.<br />
<br />
Please also think about this situation and build a client for the non Windows world.<br />
<br />

<br />
I see several lines:<br />
[list=1]<br />
 iBaan ERP on Linux will help Baan on the SME area. Where the only alternative currently is the Windows platform. Linux seems to be cheaper in tco than Windows. Linux knowledge is starting or growing in SMEes, cause they are using Linux now for there webservers, firewall, etc.<br />
 iBaan ERP on Linux will reduce your tco for test, development and training machines.<br />
iBaan on ERP <br />
 There is not one particular favorite Linux flavor, some are asking RedHat, others Suse, Debian. Be careful with the United initiative.<br />
 Linux support might be done inhouse, from the hardware vendor, or from a one-stop shopping from Baan (Harware, Linux, ERP)<br />
 There are request for non-windows clients (Linux Clients, I've seen requests for Lindows in another thread, Mac OS, etc)<br />
[/list=1] <br />
By the way I'm already convinced that Linux is not any obscure little OS. The only problem I face is the amount of different flavors.<br />
<br />
Can somebody there provide me some more data on the TCO with respect to the Windows platform. I'm thinking of hardware, licenses, stability, support, etc? I'm currently not sure if the Linux distribution and support that you want for ERP can be made cheaper than on Windows. Only if there is enough Linux knowledge in house, and that still starting for the SME market.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I want to do first things first, and park the discussion on other iBaan ERP clients over here. <br />
At this moment I cannot see a business case for iBaan ERP on MacOS, but we might start another thread on that need? <br />
<br />
Feel free to react on this, because it's only my opinion and summary of the posts you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">In terms of tco it is almost as important to have a client running on linux than the server (refer to MS license policy). Normally there are more clients than servers, so for licence fees thin clients with XServers are supposed to be cheaper.<br />
<br />
Any client running on a Xserver should be ok. This can be (I suppose more ore less) flavourless.<br />
<br />
Although, a client that can use Xserver must be connected to Unix Xserver... or Linux indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Omeluuk in terms of cost savings on the client side. However one needs to keep into account the other practical uses the average office worker has with his/her desktop Windows PC in which BW/BX is only one of many. The question then is of course whether people would be willing to convert their Windows environment to an all or nothing Linux PC, dropping many of their accustomed Windows applications.<br />
<br />
A solution for this may be that with the advance of WINE, many Windows based applications can be natively run on Linux as well. Q: has anyone ever attempted to run BW in Wine?<br />
<br />
If a choice is necessary, I would put my eggs in the server basket first, then think of the client opportunities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Or reversed, there is a Linux desktop that runs under Windows (Windux??). Not very practical in my opinion, but definitely a way to introduce users to Linux one step at a time.<br />
<br />
Winfried is right, I think, when he says that currently the TCO for Windows or Linux clients is not all that far apart.<br />
<br />
There is also a steep learning curve involved (both for users and administrators).<br />
<br />
The best bang for the buck can be made on a server level, but personally I can't wait to run Baan on my trusted Linux box (Red Hat btw).<br />
<br />
I'll give WINE a try one of these day, Pat.</div></div><hr />

we set up a test environement with a Linux Server (SuSE) with Baan IV (Linux Portingset) and we used the BW on a Linux Client (SuSE with Wine). Both worked fine and we are prepared to use such a combination in real life (but then with a &quot;real&quot; database and not with the TBase). We are requesting an offical supported Linux portingset since ages from Baan. I am really glad that Baan is now moving forward.<br />

Linux, in its various distributions, is a fine UNIX-like platform.  Let's face it, though, the awful array of flavors of Linux &quot;icing&quot; (ala distributions) is killing me.  I can't move from one dist to the next without having to learn, essentially, a new OS (filesystem layout, admin tools, rc vs. sys5 init scripts).<br />
<br />
All this wondeful development in Linux is great, and a fine display of programming skill.  But I see feature creep, bloatware, and versioning slide making its way into our happy pasture.  The plagues of past and present versions of Windows, and the schism between SVR4 and 4.xBSD is being seen within the Linux playground.<br />
<br />
:mad: I cannot speak for other dists accurately, but Red Hat makes me go non-linear.  I've been using Linux for years and have seen the problems.  Die hard Linux nuts in my circle of friends are switching to FreeBSD or OpenBSD because they can't bear another core/critical library getting hosed because the bleeding edge is the Linux way!<br />
<br />
Sorry for the soapbox but these are points to keep in mind.  Having said them, I want to say I do, in fact, support a Linux version of Baan.  If I can get the same performance from an Intel based Linux box, why should I pay through the nose for HP, Sun, etc?  :eek:<br />
<br />
If you aren't a hardware junkie, UNIX admin, DBA such as myself (and many others) you can rely on your vendors for support of their products (Dell for example supports Linux on their servers, Baan would support Baan, etc).<br />
<br />
I don't see the death of &quot;big iron&quot; any time soon.  Linux, while a great platform, still has growing pains.  If I have to compile and install a piece of software, please don't make me rely on bleeding edge libraries, tools, APIs, or system calls.  If my server crashes because of that I'll be mad!<br />

Hey, how about a native (non-Linux binary compatibility) *BSD port?  I'd love to see Baan in the ports collection on www.freebsd.org!  :cool:</div></div><hr />

Oops, not quite what I meant!  Sorry, I meant to say that I &quot;support the idea of Baan on Linux&quot;.  Although I've been successful at installing and running (limping?) with Baan on Linux I'm not running it for production.  I've since removed it from my workstation (too much space).<br />
<br />
FWIW:<br />
<br />
Red Hat 6.2<br />
2.2.14 kernel (no mods to shm settings)<br />
Oracle 8i (8.1.7)<br />
Pentium II - 450MHz - 256MB RAM<br />
I have no idea about which portingset</div></div><hr />

I know of a portingset for Linux, but that was a very old one already when I saw it for the first time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know enough about how the baan code works/looks to know if this is easily possible, but an updated Linux/BSD portingset (even if unsupported) would be a &quot;good thing&quot;(tm).  It would give Baan Co. a feather (&quot;Hey look we can also do Linux/BSD!&quot;) and it could give us a feather also (&quot;Hey look Linux/BSD can run with the big dogs!&quot;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Porting set : 6.1c.03<br />
Port no.    : TD.PROTO<br />
Date        : Mon Jul  6 11:50:20 MET DST 1998<br />
<br />
I recently tried this (old) linux porting set on both an old Suse with tbase and Debian with oracle9.2. It worked very good with tbase and not-so-bad with oracle.<br />
<br />
I think that porting baan to linux is a matter of will. Tecnically speaking you need to support two major distributions and *listen* to all linux users.<br />
<br />
I think that linux users are always a community that would send patches on every kind of shell script they would have to chance to see (rc, sysV, alg6.1, ...).<br />
<br />
So I believe that the better method is to say: this is the porting set for linux. We support the X and Y distribution in this first release and we encourage all our users base to send comments and patches to us. We will then decide what to do with other distributions, based on our user base feedback (distribution used, patches received).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juergen</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">To restart the discussion of Baan and Linux enclosed the answer from the Management of SSA Global to the DbuG (German Baan Usergroup) regarding the Linux porting set.<br />
<br />
Q:<br />
Which platform strategy does SSA Global pursue: Will Baan give<br />
equal support for Unix (which Unix versions, and what about<br />
Linux?) and Windows, or will there be a preference?<br />
(To date, some iBaan suite solutions have only been made <br />
available under Windows.)<br />
<br />
A:<br />
The technical architecture of SSA Baan ERP will remain to be multi-<br />
platform and multi-database. The platforms and databases that<br />
will be supported out of the box are determined based on the<br />
demand of our customers.<br />
Thus far customers demand was not concrete enough to have a <br />
clear business case for investing in a Linux port. Customer<br />
demand will be closely monitored. Any concrete input is welcome <br />
and can be directed to Bram Pieterse (bpieterse@baan.nl).<br />
Linux support at the client (BW, Worktop) is not being<br />
considered, since the strategy is to only support Windows on the <br />
client.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">8th December 2003, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope that Baan sticks to W3C standards (standard HTML, etc) for webtop so that it can still be accessed via mozilla.<br />
<br />
I am sure that with somebody like CodeWeavers (www.codeweavers.com) would be able get a Win32 worktop/bw working to a satisfactory level, as they currently do with MS Office, when there is demand for it. <br />
<br />
If I were Baan, I would keep developing a Win32 front end and ensure that web access was fully standards complicant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As businesses are still looking to cut costs, linux is once again a hot item. How hard can it be for Baan to port BW to linux? For that matter, I asked a Windows CE client for Christmas (but all I got was this lousy t-shirt).<br />
<br />
A web based client is great, but is (IMO) not a generic solution for every situation.</div></div><hr />

i have had  2 hours ago a demonstration of ERP 6.0 by the director of presales in germany. He also gives us some statements by SSA for Linux :<br />
<br />
Baan IV  will be supported Baan IVc with SUSE Linux (and only IVc for the first time !)<br />
<br />
The first installation of an beta release is the next week for one customer in germany.<br />
