The question regarding using a win2003 with MSSQL server has came up and I thought I could check with you guys if you have any negative/positive experience with this setup?<br />
There will be approx 150 simultanious users.</div></div><hr />

   We have implemented Baan LN on MSSQL for one of our customer and we didn't have any problems except that you loose the flexibility of dividing indices and data into different table spaces in Oracle by company for better management of data files.  Other than that everything seems to be working fine and you should not have any problems for 150~ concurrent users.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">16th February 2007, 12:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess it will work. However if you have done some shell scripting around your current unix/baan installation be prepared that this will not be so easy any more on the windows platform.<br />
There are some threads regarding the advantages of windows, have a look so that you as admin are prepared.<br />

No problems I am aware of, other than, as Han mentions, the lack of OS scripting.  You can actually emulate tablespaces to some extent using file groups on SQL Server.<br />
<br />
I also have a customer that will be migrating their HPUX 11/Oracle 10 install to Windows/SQL after their implementation, so it is becoming a popular option.<br />

Now I´m thinking to migrate my main server to a 64 bits architecture in order to improve the performance. I have posted a threat about it. Now It´s a pity to install a 32 bit environment. But the question is , has anyone installed a 64 bits arquitecture yet ?</div></div><hr />

I have done some basic scripting in unix as well as VB scripting . VB  scripting too looks  comprehensive. Are there any known things VB scripting and batch files can not do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are probably correct, however unix scripts are sometimes nothing more that performing some commands which are not standard available on a windows server. Things like find, ps etc. were not standard available. You needed to install additional software. I always have to convince my sys admin that I need tools, on [li|u]nix its seems to be more common to have all these tools available. With each newer version of windows server we seem to get more tools available in a standard installation. (like taskkill)<br />
<br />
E.g.: I had to automate a download of a file from the internet into our server. The software supplier gave me a tool which I can use to automate mouse clicks in IE but all I need is wget ....<br />
Another example: ever tried to change a sequential table dump with the standard editor of windows ....<br />
<br />
Is a VB interpreter/compiler standard installed on a Windows 2003 server?<br />
<br />
Now it's going to look like another discussion about the pro and con's of windows. Lets' not do that. If you want to discuss it contact me via pm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">22nd February 2007, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Han for quick reply . I too would not like to digress from the original topic and get into legthier meaningless discussions . It's of academic interest to me to know  about the differences .<br />
<br />
I too have not found an equivalent of powerful unix commands like cut , awk , ps , grep  etc with various return value posibilities . However I found something like  keyboard sequence generator (the way u found ) in VB scripting for which I do not know  unix equivalent.<br />
<br />
VB scripting interpreter is available in win2k &amp; win2k3 all editions . All u need to do is create .vbs  file in notepad with valid vb scripting command sequence . I still do not know how to debug / compile that . I am still a beginner. U can also use command line cscript.exe to run .vbs file.<br />
<br />
I dont want to draw any conclusions as to superiority / inferiority of any scripting. If that were the case , I would vote for shell scripting , bcos I have experienced  the tremendous power of the same.<br />
<br />
Rather it's knowledge gaining exercise to find the strengths / weaknesses of the different scriptings (which of course is useful to me bcos I need to work in both envrions) . In that spirit , if u or anybody contributes to enrich everybody's knowledge, it is great (either in this thread or new thread) .</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have such live system with high volume (specially on manufacturing and warehousing), i'm very interesting !<br />
<br />
We have very slow queries, even with only 1 user on the system. For example, backflush for one order take 3 to 5 minutes (20 to 30 lines per BOM, not so much !). I suppose the driver or some setup are not correct, but we work hard to identify the reason without succes after 2 weeks...<br />
<br />
thanks a lot for any experience</div></div><hr />
