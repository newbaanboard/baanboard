<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yyyark1</div><div class="date">13th October 2003, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I have a program that is ran in batch and occassionally a &quot;core&quot; file is created in the Unix directory when it is running.  The core files is not created every time, it varies.  I cannot determine why some times the &quot;core&quot; file is created.  Since this file is so large it usually kills our job and we cannot run it again until we remove the &quot;core&quot; file.  Does anyone have any idea why the core file gets created?  Is there any way I can prevent this from continuing to happen?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

It happens when something goes wrong in unix. There are legends :confused: that this kind of files can be used by some unix guru to give responses about the cause of the error, but I never encountered such a person, so I simply delete it from my space when it happens that I found in my system :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 12:33</div></div><div class="posttext">There are indeed ways to trace a core file. You need a debugger (which is rather OS specific). Then you need to restart your binary with specific options using the core as input...<br />
<br />
Strings on a corefile may also help to determine the cause because at least you can tell what binary has crashed on you. Better is to view only the first part of the corefile, because further on there is binary information of the memory content, but that is way too specific info - handy for the debugger, not for laymen.<br />
<br />
If you find that one of the portingset binaries cause the core file, log a case with Baan.<br />
<br />
You can also prevent corefiles to be created or have them made in /dev/null, but that is never a solution... they should not be made at all.</div></div><hr />

I delete them out.<br />

Is there a setting in unix where I can specify that I do not want core files to be created ???:confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a setting CORE= in the bshell, but that does not prevent a core file to be made....<br />
What you can do is:$ ln -s /dev/null core<br />
$ ls -l core<br />
lrwxr-xr-x   1 user1    bsp         9 Nov 11 11:11 core -&gt; /dev/null</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vahdani</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 23:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
it is my understanding that a core dump indicates an internal error in the Unix application, in our case the Baan porting set. Baan programs run on top of bshell as a kind of Virtual Machine and don't access Unix directly which means they can not cause a core dump due to any programing errors. <br />
<br />
So by any core dumps either open a case by Baan or try installing a new porting set when available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">13th November 2003, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">On the one hand side you are right,... but on the other hand... in the mean time between logging a case and having it solved, it is nice not to have the system get full with core files on all user home directories...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpvdgiessen</div><div class="date">17th November 2003, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I shouldn't (symbolic) link a core to /dev/null because if there is a real problem a core dump has valuable information.<br />
<br />
I delete them once a day via the cron with the following command: find / -name core -exec rm -f {} \;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">17th November 2003, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if you set CORE=0 in your environment a core will not be created... <br />
<br />
One other things, Usually, in Baan, if a core gets created, its becuase the bshell or driver ran out of memory.. check your ulimits (ulimit -a [this differs from OS to OS]) for that user, pay attention to these:<br />
<br />
data(kbytes)         1000000<br />
stack(kbytes)        51200<br />
<br />
If you're getting cores try bumping these up some and see if that helps. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">18th November 2003, 09:26</div></div><div class="posttext">JP Core contains valuable information for those who can read it, all others have problems with the core files being created. When logging the case, you can save one core file (if they need it, mostly don't).<br />
<br />
The CORE=0 setting did not prevent my bshell to coredump after kill -3 &lt;PID&gt;<br />
man kill:<br />
   3     SIGQUIT   Quit            Terminate with core dump; can be trapped</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try <br />
<br />
ulimit -c 0<br />
<br />
Instead.<br />
<br />
This differes based on the OS, but most of 'em will allow it.<br />

How can the same be obtained on HPUx11? (other than symlink?)</div></div><hr />
