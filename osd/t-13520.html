Our Baan user count is 30 concurrent.<br />
<br />
For those of you already running in this environment,  are you running Windows 2000 Server or Windows 2000 Advanced Server?  <br />
<br />
Also, are you running MS-SQL Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition?  <br />
<br />
I'd also be interested in hearing about any &quot;gotchas&quot; from anyone who has already accomplished this type of conversion. As always, your input is greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have Baan IVc2 running on Windows 2000 Server and SQL2000 Enterprise Edition running on Windows 2000 Advanced Server.<br />
I cant give you accurate info on why we did this kind of setup but from what I remember Baan Support recommended to install Baan on Win 2000 Server.<br />
The gotcha was we cannot install Baan directly on SQL 2000, which means we have to install SQL 7 first and then upgrade. We didnt really have any issue besides that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible to install Baan IVc4 directly onto Windows 2000 Server, you just need an up to date installation CD.<br />
<br />
For only 30 users you will have no problems using Windows 2000 Server and standard SQL Server. I would not imagine that you need more than 4GB of memory that W2K Advanced Server grants, or more than 2GB of memory that SQL Server Enterprise endition grants.<br />
<br />
We're running on W2K Server and SQL 7 Standard with 64 users without any problems.</div></div><hr />
