<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">10th March 2010, 23:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been using OKI Data Microline models 590 and 591 to print Interleaved 2 of 5 barcode using the following escape sequence.<br />
<br />
\E^PA^H^C00^D^C^A^A^A\E^PB^H<br />
<br />
This is working on models 590 and 591 but we need to migrate to OKI Data Microline 395 and the above escape sequence does not work.<br />
<br />
I think the problem lies with ^C00.  Using the command &quot;od -xc filename&quot; I see that the above 00(s) are octal code 30, not 00.  <br />
<br />
Using vi, how do I put a null into this escape sequence?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help. - Joy</div></div><hr />

I'm running on unix and using vi editor.  I don't think you can insert a null character using vi.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you'd have to insert a meta null into a file.. that would really stink.<br />

The first line sets and formats the string we want to print in the barcode and the second sets the escape sequence including the string to print and is then the field that is put on the report<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
this is the barcode functionality from Quick Guide 1310 &quot;Barcode Printing &amp; BWprint&quot;<br />
<br />
I think is should be the barcode script in $BSE/printinf/barcode ?<br />
<br />
There are the scripts for PCL printer barcodes located.<br />
<br />
Am i right Joy ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">15th March 2010, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">We have established font13 for the data we want to print in bar code format. Font13 is defined in $BSE/lib/printinf/e/filename in the following manner<br />
<br />
pfont13=\E^PA^H^C00^D^C^A^A^A\E^PB^H,<br />
<br />
The latest examples look like program code.  Is this in the report script?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomasm</div><div class="date">15th March 2010, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is correct. It is in the report script. We do nothing with the font, just put this 'escape sequence' including the data to be printed directly on the field in the report.<br />
<br />
But, after I did my last post I realised that maybe what we are doing is working only on the Windows platform. Can somebody confirm?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">15th March 2010, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the null character is causing problems.  I have tried the following escape sequence:<br />
<br />
chr$(27) &amp; chr$(16) &amp; &quot;A&quot; &amp; chr$(8) &amp; chr(3) &amp; chr$(0) &amp; chr$(0) &amp; chr$(4) &amp; chr$(3) &amp; chr$(1) &amp; chr$(1) &amp; chr$(1)<br />
<br />
Collectively there are 12 characters but the length of the string is 10.  It dropped the nulls.  I can see the string contains &quot;\e^PA\b^C^D^C^A^A^A.&quot;<br />
<br />
I may try a bar code that does not require the null character.  But not today.</div></div><hr />
