<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">3rd June 2003, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">BRU is a unit of measure used to express how 'heavy' a certain area of functionality in Baan will weigh on your system. For e.g. if a user working in the TI module may represent 3 BRU's and a tools user 1 BRU. These figures are just an example. You always have to look at the sizing guide for your platform to get the correct numbers.<br />
<br />
I am sure DikkieDik can explain this much better :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caner.B</div><div class="date">3rd June 2003, 12:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there sizing guide where I can find the BRU values of each package.<br />
I am really interested what our total BRU is now, because we will renew our Baan Server in a few months and buying it in a few days.<br />

You should be able to get a sizing guide through your Baan contact channels. Make sure it's a recent one that covers the hardware you are interested in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caner.B</div><div class="date">3rd June 2003, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">The only Baan contact channel we have is Baanboard.<br />
We don't have a support contract with our local support center.<br />
<br />
We are interested in IBM P650 Series and HP RP5470 , if it has no legal restrictions I would be very greatfull to recieve some of that documents from anybody<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Baanboard is no 'official' channel so we can't really help you in that regards. Hopefully one of other members can come up with a szing guide?</div></div><hr />

I know Baanboard is not an official channel but I got much more help from baanboard and all the members  than our local support .<br />

<br />
Indeed a BRU stands for Baan Reference User with is a standard load factor on the system like we have a meter or inch to measure length. <br />
<br />
During a benchmark a system will be tested with several profiles all with a different load. In the sizing guide several load factors are published that give a rough estimate of the load (compared 1 BRU) you can expect on the system.<br />
<br />
Doing a sizing is not something you do on the back of a yellow note, but you really need to know what you are doing. Therefore the sizing guide is confidential. I advise to go to IBM or Baan and as they are partner, they can get a sizing guide and advise how to use it. If this local party can't do this to your opinion, they can contact there collegues (in the Netherlands) who have done this more often.<br />
<br />
At least don't do it by yourself the first time, but let  your configuration be checked else you probably buy a much too expensive system or a system that is already fully loaded when having half the number of users on the system.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
