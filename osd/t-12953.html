<br />
Is it possible to  have multiple schemes in a database ? :confused: <br />
From the session ttdba0520m000, it appears that multiple groups (schemes) are possible.<br />
<br />
If we create a new schema baan1, baan2... with multiple companies. How does BaaN identify the mapping for a company belonging to a different schema in the same database.<br />
<br />
Your ideas are welcome and appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Its based off of the user. Each user can belong 1 and only 1 group<br />
so in the ora_users file you'll see<br />
<br />
id1:dbid:&lt;password&gt;:group<br />
id2:dbid2:&lt;password&gt;:group2<br />
<br />
So if you have company 100 in the &quot;group&quot; schema<br />
then all users that need to access company 100<br />
have to be in &quot;group&quot;<br />
<br />
Baan will create the tables based on the user you are creating them as. So in unix you could do like<br />
USER=group2user bdbpost6.2 ... <br />
to add tables to that 2nd group.</div></div><hr />

The background for my Q was we noticed a lot of performance degradation when we created 4-6 companies (each with 5000 tables) in Oracle-8.1.7.2. I am not sure how the behaviour is in Oracle-9i. So we create 4-6 companies per database and then move the next set of companies into another database instance.<br />
<br />
So I was exploring options if we can create a new schema in the same database and then create the companies there so that we dont need to get a new database instance. <br />
<br />
Did you ever implement this kind of setup ? <br />
<br />
One more question - if I create 2 database groups for a database how can I specify which scheme has to be used for a  company to be created ?<br />
<br />
I referred to some of the manuals/documentations which do not have any information about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have implemented it, the only real downsides are the lack of flexability that you have in that setup. For example<br />
you cannot take one environment down to work on it while another one is up...<br />
<br />
Remeber the schema isn't associated to a company, its associated to a user. So for example &quot;bsp&quot; would be assigned to baangroup1 while maybe bsp2 would be baangroup2.<br />
<br />
They cannot cross over, so to create tables in the 2nd schema, you would have to use a &quot;baangroup2&quot; user...<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />

Did this help solving your performance problem?<br />
