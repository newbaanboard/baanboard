For Baan on Win2K or NT?<br />
<br />
(For Some people removing anti-virus software from their Baan system resolves the problem, other people it hasn't. )<br />
<br />
I'd like to know if you are or aren't having the problem, and what type / speed disks you have. <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
That's a good conversation. But this isn't an Oracle issue.<br />
<br />
If you run a TT_SQL_TRACE=02200, an ORAPROF=1 or a<br />
SQL_TRACE=true and tkprof you'll see that the query is<br />
as good as it can get, the parse and fetch times are fine.<br />
<br />
But the session still takes a horrible amount of time to start.<br />
<br />
I've found using a utility called &quot;filemon&quot; that the ntbshell<br />
reads a lot of DDs from disk at first session startup (opens and closes but doesn't read the contents)<br />
This is what is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
I'd like to get an idea of the number of customers who are experiencing this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">11th March 2003, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I tested this on our live system:<br />
Open BW = 3 seconds<br />
Open first session (tiitm0101m000) = 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
Bw client version = 068<br />
<br />
I do vaguely recall some time ago when we hadn't updated our standard program for quite some time that it took ages to open sessions.  Could be worth installing a newer one?<br />
<br />
What about shared memory - our live package combination is in shared memory + all tools objects (+ as from today a few heavily used applications as well - but not tiitm0101m000 !).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan is reading the DDs from shared memory (for example if you do a -dbgsrdduse it will show them all coming from SHM.)<br />
<br />
I haven't checked the tools standards, it could be!<br />

<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
