<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">triton45</div><div class="date">21st July 2003, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently running Baan IVc4 on HP-UX 11.11 with Informix 7.31 as the database.  <br />
As we look to the future of our database - it begins to look a lot like DB2 as the end of the Informix upgrade path.  Is anyone running Baan IVc4 / HP-UX and DB2?  Any experience/ thoughts would be helpful.  We are looking to migrate from Informix, but definitely stay on the HP platform.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
But there are also other options: after dumping the database to flatfile by bdbpre, you can upload the data in any supported database on HP.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

I wasn't aware that Baan had a porting set for DB2 on HP, in fact I thought that it was only with the lastest version of DB2 (version 8?) that it was even supported on HP-UX.<br />
<br />
You will probably be OK on Informix for the short term...the next 2-3 years, as I don't see it going anywhere in that time, and unless you are going to move off of IVc4 or need level II drivers. It might make more sense from a $$ standpoint to wait for Gemini and see what options are available for DB choices then...DB2 might be a more attractive/more stable option at that point. <br />
<br />
Or perhaps that ever elusive Linux port will open even more options....but that's another post.</div></div><hr />
