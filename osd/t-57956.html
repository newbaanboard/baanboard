I want to know - <br />
<br />
1. If I can upgrade and migrate to Linux on my current server without any major hardware upgrade.<br />
2. If yes, which Linux distribution (I have read REHL and OpenSuse supported currently).<br />

MySQL is not supported with Baan IV - it is with LN.<br />
<br />
Cheapest option is BISAM - but if your 40 GB is in a single company, not sure you want to fall back on that - depends on your number of users etc.<br />
<br />
Next cheaper option will be Informix - you will get quite a good deal there - much better than Oracle.<br />
<br />
Oracle on Linux also offers better deals than Oracle on other platforms.<br />
<br />
You can also save costs on the user desktops by moving that to Open source platform like Ubuntu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are worried abt Database  + OS Costing with Minimum users then Try for Windows Small Business Server .<br />
<br />
It comes with many other Applications along with SQL SERVER (Inbuilt).<br />

<br />
1. If I can upgrade and migrate to Linux on my current server without any major hardware upgrade.<br />
No problem seen on your current server configuration. Perhaps you will need more RAM. But it depends on the sizing that INFOR will perform for your migration project.<br />
<br />
2. If yes, which Linux distribution (I have read REHL and OpenSuse supported currently).<br />
Both distributions are supported by INFOR. I have migrated from HP-UX/9000 to RHES/INTEL successully. So I recommend RH.<br />
<br />
3. Database - Which database is compatible, Can SQL server be utilised, what about MYSQL, will it able to handle 40GB database size, I need low cost ownership for my BaaN setup, if I go for oracle it will addon heavy license fee, low cost database option available?, disadvantages etc.)<br />
<br />
SQL can be used. MYSQL is not longer support by INFOR. Oracle and DB/2 also. Even Bisam. The big question is: which fits best? On my experience, If you are satisfied with SQL, continue with them. <br />
<br />
Oracle is the Rolls Royce of the DB, but expensive. On my case, it worth the cost. I don´t have big problems with the database, performance and stability are great. I have published my path to RHES on the board. Maybe you can take a look.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express/<br />
<br />
the only downside is:<br />
DB2 Express-C may be run on any sized system with any amount of processors and memory, however DB2 Express-C will limit total resource utilization as follows:<br />
Processor: 2 cores<br />
Memory: 2 GB<br />
Operating Systems:<br />
Linux (32bit, 64bit, POWER)<br />
Windows (32bit, 64bit)<br />
Solaris (64-bit Intel)<br />
Mac OS X (64-bit Intel *beta*)<br />
<br />
But if you're whole DB is 40GB you probably don't need much more than this:<br />

<br />
As per your comments, migration looks possible.<br />
But as per Infor, SQL server is not supported on Linux platform.<br />
Can you make it sure how can we use it, do we need to install any package etc to make it compatible.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Look at the technical notes of the portingset for BaanIV, it contains a matrix what databases are supported.<br />
<br />
You can use Oracle or Informix. If you can live with the disadvantages of bisam than you can use that too. However if it's still a production server than I recommend to use Oracle (informix is used less and less). If it's only used for archiving you could spare money by using bisam and also by using a non enterprise version of linux although these linux versions are not supported officially by infor. <br />
