<br />
Are there many of you out there who use SQL Server with your BaanERP? Is it any good over long run? We found a case where SQL Server was happily serving BaanERP for 3 years until the company data get to 35 Gigs and SQL Server starts giving out &quot;consistency error&quot;.<br />
<br />
We have since advised the client to put its old data on archive, thus reducing the database size to around 18 Gigs. After that, we haven't received any new &quot;consistency error&quot;<br />
<br />
For you guys who are using SQL Server:<br />
 what is your database size?<br />
 how many years have you been running your BaanERP company data over SQL Server?<br />
 do you archive or put everything on the live database?<br />
 is SQL Server reliable through all the years?<br />
Thanks, guys<br />
<br />
Rgds,<br />

May not be a good example as they are only a small site 20 seats</div></div><hr />

There probably aren't that many companies using SQL Server, huh? I'm starting up a poll on DBMS powering Baan, since no such poll has been started before. Please take part in the poll too. It'll be interesting to find out how many (or few) people use SQL Server :) . p.cole, my client is on SQL Server 7 too<br />

<br />
There are quite a few companies using SQL Server. From some statistics<br />
I heard at SSA U MSSQL is 2nd behind Oracle in the baan world... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">16th October 2005, 00:59</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I have noticed with SQL 7 it seems to operate better if the memory usage is allocated rather than dynamic seems to stay up longer, less reboots required once I turned of dynamic memory usage. I am planning to upgrade them to sql 2000 then I can use the Level 2 baan driver which will save space and hopefully speed it up a bit as it will pass the work of maintaining the indexes to the DBMS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bob Freedman</div><div class="date">20th October 2005, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been using SQL Server for almost 7 years on both Baan IV and Baan LN. We currently use SQL Server 2000, enterprise edition. Our databases are 59gb and 99gb respectively. <br />
<br />
It works, is very low maintenance, we have had so few issues over the years that it's hardly worth talking about. I verify the dumps every morning, and it runs itself.</div></div><hr />
