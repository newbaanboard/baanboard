Can someone help me out on this one, i have few questions regarding the installation of BaaN on Oracle database.<br />
The first question is, Can we install BaaN on Oracle 7.1.3 ?<br />
<br />
The second question is, can we use Oracle 8.0.3 for Novell for BaaN IVc4 installation?<br />
<br />
Thirdly what would be the procedure, as i suppose that one cannot directly install the Oracle 8i and then install BaaN on it.<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance<br />
Jericho</div></div><hr />

Yes, sure.<br />
<br />
The second question is, can we use Oracle 8.0.3 for Novell for BaaN IVc4 installation?<br />
I wouldn't recommend it for larger systems (# of users), because of possible scalabilty issues, or rather lack off, but there is nothing to prevent you from doing it. You will have to go three tier though.<br />
<br />
Thirdly what would be the procedure, as i suppose that one cannot directly install the Oracle 8i and then install BaaN on it. Why not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly, the Oracle for Novell is not ported for the NT machines, and thus one cannot have that as the database with the BaaN setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Please keep in mind that 7.3.4 is the only Oracle 7 version that is still supported by Baan.<br />
<br />
Installing on Oracle 7.1 might succeed using old porting sets (linked with Oracle 7.1 libraries), but more up to date ones (linked with 7.3) might result in errors and data corruption, especially when you do not use US7ASCII. (Has to do with incompatibilities in the Oracle Required Support files).<br />
<br />
Using 8.0.3 will result in runtime errors unless you install patch set 2 and several additional patches (fixing bugs in session switching and transaction handling).<br />
Baan support started with 8.0.4 onwards, but some of these old versions are not supported anymore.</div></div><hr />
