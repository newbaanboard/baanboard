<br />
        I have a very short question. Can I invoke a session in another user's system? What if the other user is not logged in?<br />
Can I make the system turn on a particular session at a predetermined time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 07:50</div></div><div class="posttext">For your second question you can use job mgmt to run a session at a predetermined time.<br />
<br />
First question- I don't know but curious to know the answer. In any case how will it help?<br />

<br />
         Some times, you require to show another user remotely, the problems in a session. Such as when reproducing a bug. In such cases, it will be helpful if you can show that session and use the same to demonstrate the problem..<br />
<br />
I encounter so many situations where such a requirement arises.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a tool called mirror6.1 which can be used to display sessions in a classroom-like manner, ie one terminal screen is being outputted to many others. I can't remember exactly how it works, I will have to dig into my documentation for that, but mirror6.1 -v might already give a good indication of how it works. This is a UNIX and BA only tool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
VNC Viewer (http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc) <br />
<br />
It works really well and is free, you install a host applet on the remote machines, and then log in using IP address &amp; password, and have full control of the remote machine.<br />
<br />
We use it over our VPN for servers as well.<br />
