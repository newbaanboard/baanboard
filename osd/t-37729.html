I am in trouble with my system: due to a unknown reason, the processes bshell of my users are never more listed within ps -ef | grep bshell.<br />
But licmon6.1 -w is still working...<br />
This is a question here once we use it to determine idle licenses in a periodical job. Furthermore, I wonder if this couldn't be kind a warning to bigger problems into our server.<br />
Any ideas?<br />
Thank u all<br />

<br />
what does $BSE/lib/ipc_info look like? Never tried it, but perhaps bshell6.1 (the executable) can be renamed? <br />
Since when do you have this problem? Has the ps command changed?<br />
<br />
Interesting story, please keep us informed.<br />
<br />

<br />
Run command: licmon6.1 -c (This will clean up orphaned licenses)<br />
Run command licmon6.1 -u (This gives total user count)<br />
<br />
Then, check ps -ef|grep bshell.<br />
<br />
Also, please check you are running this command on application server and not on database server (if DB server is different) and/or License server (if License server is different)....<br />

Well, this problem has began last jun 8, and we didn't perform nothing special this day...<br />
Here we have both oracle and baan at the same server...<br />
The ipc_info file do contain information about bshell - like this &quot;bshell    s    0    0   p   ${BSE}/bin/bshell6.1&quot;  and this file is this path...<br />
I tried licmon6.1 -C (lower c didn't work) and licmon6.1 -u but that ps is still not working...<br />
One curious thing is that ps command show us other process, like oracle, sh_server etc...<br />
Another information is that our company has had no contract (clearly: Baan updates) with Baan, Invencys(?), SSA or Infor since 2004...</div></div><hr />

<br />
you need to use ps -aef to show all of them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mferreira744</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 01:11</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry dave, but ps -aef failed too. For being sure, I am always trying these commands in a terminal at the server - and the incredible is that ps -ef was working...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 08:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure that you are calling the &quot;right&quot; ps? What does &quot;which ps&quot; tell you?<br />
When you said that it worked at a terminal at the server .... is your logon the same when you try it somewhere else?<br />
Sounds like someone built a shell script named &quot;ps&quot; which is calling &quot;/bin/ps | grep -v bshell&quot; <br />
:-)<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

When i refered to &quot;that ps&quot; i mean the complete problem's command: ps -ef |grep bshell</div></div><hr />

<br />
If on HP-UX: Try top command. (Run top)<br />
If on Solaris: Try prstat command. (Run prstat -n 10 for top 10 processes)<br />
<br />
These processes should show you processes consuming maximum CPUs.<br />
See if you can find any bshell processes in these top processes.<br />
<br />
