<br />
Had a question about splitting our Baan companies up to different Oracle servers.  We'd like to keep company 000 and our production 100 company on our primary Oracle server (HP 9000 N-class).  For space considerations, we'd like to move our (~20GB) archive company to a smaller Intel server   running RH Linux and Oracle.<br />
<br />
1) To save on tape backup times, can I set the archive co. tablespace(s) read-only so that I can back it up once and forget about it?<br />
<br />
2) If the archive co. DB instance crashes, what impact will this have on the production company (and Baan in general) while I recover?<br />
<br />
3) Has anyone else done something similar and willing to share their insight and experience with us?<br />
<br />
Thanks Gang!<br />

(they'll just do a query to see if they are there) so if the system is down, then you'll get errors.<br />
<br />
Your users definitely need Baan read access to the tables, not positive the write access portion though, i suspect not.<br />

If you are going to upgrade your software (Service Packs) etc and are forced to also include your archive company for a Create DD, then make sure you make its tablespaces read-write first or the Create DD will crash out.</div></div><hr />
