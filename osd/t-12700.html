	Some of the users in our office get disconnected from baan when there are in the middle of running a session. Some times they get an error message Detected database server termination and sometimes they dont get any error message at all. <br />
<br />
	When I looked in the log.bshell file, I saw the following error message just after a user got kicked out of baan.<br />

In unix run the command:<br />
<br />
strings core | grep -v CORE | more<br />
<br />
I have used this successfully only once to discover it was unix file permissions in a subdirectory of $BSE/api.  If nothing looks obvious in the first few pages, listen to OmeLuuk and go to BaaN.</div></div><hr />

	Thanks for the feedback. We did a reboot and everything seems to be working fine. But, just today we had a new problem. I am not sure if this is related to the one we had earlier. <br />
<br />
	Today, when user were trying to open sessions (most of em) they got an error message saying search domain tctano failed and could not open the session at all. The domain in the error message kept changing based on different sessions but they were all related to package tc. I looked at the domain definition file (dtc.pd) and there was nothing changed. We could not figure out what was going on. Finally, we did a create runtime DD for domains for package tc and everything started working again. Strange thing is that we havent touched the domain definition for package tc in a long time.  <br />
<br />
	Any ideas what might have happened.<br />
<br />
	As a side note, we dont have baan support anymore. So, cant get help from them.<br />
<br />
	Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpvdgiessen</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the following about debugging a core:<br />
<br />
Generate a core dump using qptool6.1. <br />
<br />
Execution:<br />
Qptool6.1 q select * from tiitm001 c617<br />
When information is given press &lt;ctrl \&gt; and the process will stop with a core dump.<br />
<br />
First it is necessary to see which binary is responsible for the core dump.<br />
<br />
This can be done with the next command:<br />
<br />
<br />
Strings core |pg<br />
<br />
&lt;HP-UX<br />
daytona<br />
B.10.20<br />
9000/889<br />
216894362<br />
qptool6.1<br />
UUUUU<br />
UUUUU<br />
&quot;$Revision: 92453-07 linker linker crt0.o A.10.44 951031 $<br />
/usr/lib/dld.sl<br />
<br />
This will give a long output, but somewhere around line 6 you get the info that is needed, in this example it is qptool6.1. Now this binary the right function has to be found, this can be done with a debugger.<br />
<br />
There are more debuggers and it is depending on the different systems. Possible debuggers are xdb, dbx, adb, gdb.<br />
<br />
<br />
xdb $BSE/bin/&lt;binary&gt; core<br />
<br />
Start this in the directory where the core is. The debugger will start up. Now a trace has to be made. This can be done with the t option or bt option. <br />
<br />
0xc0149fe8   _writev         BL              _writev,r2<br />
 File: unknown    Procedure: write + 0x00000040    Line: unknown               <br />
Procedures:      0<br />
Files: 0<br />
&gt;t<br />
 0 write + 0x00000040 (0, 0, 0, 0)<br />
 1 TMEM + 0x3fe8505c (Address not found (UE302)<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
In the underlined part there are the function names within the object. This information can be used to analyze the problem by looking in the source code of the binary. This is something only Baan Tech or PEG Tools can do. <br />
<br />
Hope it is helpfull</div></div><hr />
