<br />
i was just wondering you guys have some idea about migration or restoration of one windows machine to another.<br />
<br />
Currently we are running Baan on HPUX and a test server on windows 2003. i am really very new to windows environment and looking for an answer which is becoming mystery for me.<br />
<br />
I am looking for some technology of backup so i just backup a windows machine (as a whole, means everything system, registry, directories , everything) and place that backup copy to some other windows machine and restore it there and everything come up including OS, Application etc.<br />
<br />
if some one really does have this answer please share with us.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Shiv :confused:</div></div><hr />

U may consider high-availability licensing and win clusters for the same . For win clusters u need windows enterprise edition .<br />
<br />
Database u can take backups through database or veritas symantec backup agent . U can take ASR backup through  windows OS  backup programs for OS /registry etc. Database backup can be configured to take incemental backup every 15 minutes with backup being restored to other server . If  other server has Baan installed , all incremental data will be available in readonly mode .</div></div><hr />

   You could also check couple of software like SBESR (Symantec Backup Exec System Restore), which used to be from Veritas before being taken up by Symantec and &quot;everRun&quot; from MarathonTechnologies. The second one is a high availability solution and would automatically kickin once the main server goes down. We are using the first one along with differential backups in a virtual environment setup. <br />
