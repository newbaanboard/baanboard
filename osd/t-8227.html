I read the very helpful posts on record lock 107, and they reference changing the db_resources file / lock_retry setting.  Our systems currently have 2 versions.  One db_resources has no lock_retry, which should indicate the default (10?)  The other has lock_retry:0, does that also mean the default?  <br />
Does anyone have an example of what we might change this to if we were trying to increase the retry wait?  Or a Baan document number to review?   During the holiday, our db_resource resource is out.<br />

<br />
the BaaN standard/default value is 10.<br />
<br />
And its not mandatory to modify the $BSE/lib/defaults/db_resource file. Here is our system settings and we dont have it and it still works fine.<br />
<br />
$ cat db_resource<br />
dbsinit:01<br />
ora_max_array_fetch:5<br />
ora_max_array_insert:5<br />
nls_lang:american_america.we8iso8859p1<br />
nls_sort:binary<br />
oracle_home:/app/common/oracle/product/8.1.7.2<br />
ora_temporary_tablespace:TEMP<br />
<br />
 During the holiday, our db_resource resource is out. <br />
I am guessing you mean your baan administrator ?<br />
<br />
You can also use the Bshell command options and increase/decrease its values -<br />
<br />
TEST_RETRY=X --&gt; This variable indicates how often the system must go back to a retry point at the moment of committing. This cannot be used when testing different sessions with retry points parallel. <br />
MAX_RETRY=X --&gt; This variable indicates how often the system may return to a retry point as a result of an abort in an update action. Default: 10 <br />
<br />
<br />
I also found that many developers dont use this option - order by with retry which might also help in these kinds of cases.<br />
<br />
Please refer to - ORDER BY --- with retry (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_database_handling_order_by)</div></div><hr />

Yes, I would not modify it just for the heck of it!  A client is having table locks (Error 107) during large processes.  I know we need to monitor the process, and see what else is running, etc.   Our db_resource resource is a fellow consultant out on vacation.   Our humble test boxes here do not have the load on them that our client's machines do.<br />
Just hoping for an example, as listed in the attached thread, of what the syntax would be for the lock_retry parameter in the db_resources file.  It's not a development thing that I can change the script for.<br />
<br />

<br />
The client is using MSSQL, not Oracle, so the ora_* examples don't help us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry I dont have access to MS-SQL servers we are on Oracle here. But I believe <br />
those 2 BW options might still work for you.<br />
<br />
I found only this 1 line from the tracing document I have -<br />
<br />
Because the lock-retry mechanism is disable by &quot;lock_retry:0&quot;, the number of <br />
retries equals 1.<br />
<br />
The syntax must be the same as other settings.<br />

<br />
1. I guess you might have some performance monitors, tracing tools/options <br />
similar to Oracle, Spotlight, top etc.<br />
<br />
2. You might try to use the &quot;as prepared set&quot; for your selects.<br />
<br />
Prepared set. <br />
With this option, the entire set is retrieved before the first record is returned. <br />
The set is temporarily stored. This option is useful when a process simultaneously <br />
selects and maintains (or deletes or adds) records. In this case, changes must not <br />
be visible in the selected records. The prepared set option forces a consistent read. <br />
The syntax is as follows:<br />
SELECT ... [from][where] AS PREPARED SET<br />
<br />
Maximum set size and prepared set. <br />
<br />
and tweak the BW command parameter <br />
n	-set RDS_FULL=value to define max. nr. rows transfered between client and <br />
server as one block (good for imports/exports)<br />
<br />
to get the maximum performance.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would not modify it just for the heck of it! <br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of changing the original file you can create a user specific file and test it out. Francesco, gave a new tip recently at - Environment Variables (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=446) <br />
<br />
I think thats the best I can suggest others might have some more ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">30th December 2002, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">For Oracle folks you can take a look at solution 159170 on<br />
the Baan KB for help with error 107.<br />
<br />
lock_retry:0 effectivly disables the lock_retry interface<br />
and for Oracle defaults back to ora_timeout. I believe that there is a similar sql_timeout value as well.<br />
<br />
The default values for lock_retry:5*100, 5*500<br />
I belive, which is try 5 time waiting 100 ms, then trying 5 more<br />
times waiting 500 ms, etc.<br />
<br />
The default values for ora_timeout are {0,5,10,15,0}<br />
<br />
The first value is for &quot;select for updates&quot; which is where most of your 107 errors will come from. With a 0 it will try once and immedatly error (with 107) if no lock is available.<br />
<br />
So ideally you want something like<br />
lock_retry:0<br />
ora_timeout:{300,120,120,120,120}<br />
<br />
You can't / do not want do lock_retry and ora_timeout at the same time..<br />
<br />
I hope this helps!<br />

<br />
But still 10 times with 0 wait isn't going to be that long.</div></div><hr />
