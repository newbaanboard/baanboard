How is your RAS setup and your BW settings (Baan connects to all their clientes thru Dial-Up and this worked all time...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you (from a client MS-DOS box) perform a rexec call to the server?<br />
<br />
Your user Baan is allowed to remotely login via RAS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g_Jericho</div><div class="date">4th February 2003, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i have been able to connect to the BaaN Server through the Dial-up but its on NT Server.<br />
Now i want to do the dial-up on the Windows 2000 Server where my citrix is installed and then using citrix connect to BaaN, but whet is happening is that i m not able to login to the Windows 2000 Server. Using the dial-up i m able to make the hand-shake but after that neither am i able to ping the server or run the Citrix appliaction, as i get the error, &quot;Destination Host not reachable&quot;, Can u someone help me to identify the problem.<br />
<br />
Is there some different technique thru which we Set-up RAS on the 2000 Machine and then connect it thru Dial-up.<br />
