<br />
Baan support have asked me to change the first_rows_hint parameter in db_resource. <br />
<br />
It was set to first_rows_hint:2 they asked me to change it to first_rows_hint:1<br />
<br />
What does this setting actually do? I've searched the Infor KB for info but cannot find any, nor has it been raised on baanboard before.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
the first_rows_hint parameter is actually quite suitably named and refers to the &quot;first rows&quot; hint, which get's added to the SQL statement,when the baan parser (eg. oracle driver) translates the baan sql into oracle sql.<br />
<br />
If I am not mistaken 2 switches it off, and 1 switches it on.<br />
<br />
Now, what does it do?<br />
<br />
1) It has no functional consequences, so it will not fix a bug or similar.<br />
2) Oracle might simply ignore it (as it is a hint only)<br />
3) In situations, where the application only requires a single record (ie. in forms), baan might be minimal slower as Oracle will optimize the SQL for accessing the first record as fast as possible.<br />
3) In jobs (mass data select) this might result in slower performance.<br />
<br />
As a consequence some things might get faster and some might get slower.<br />

<br />
section 9-11<br />
<br />
The ERP LN Oracle driver generates for many queries the FIRST_ROWS<br />
hint. Since Oracle 9i it is better to use the FIRST_ROWS(N) hint where N is a<br />
number that specifies the amount of records expected to be returned. The<br />
first_rows_hint has been introduced to switch between 3 flavors:<br />
first_rows_hint:1 old style FIRST_ROWS hint will be<br />
generated<br />
first_rows_hint:2 new style FIRST_ROWS(N) hint will be<br />
generated<br />
first_rows_hint:0 first_rows hints will be suppressed.<br />
Note: the benchmark failed with timeouts<br />
on this setting.<br />
Initially, the default has been set to 1 for backward compatibility. This<br />
resource has been introduced in 6.1c.07.09, 7.1d.11, 7.6b, and 8.2b.<br />
For portingsets 6.1c.07.14, 8.3a.02, and 8.4a and higher the default has<br />
been set to 2.<br />
This parameter can have a significant impact on performance. However, as<br />
this depends a lot per customer, no general advice can be given.<br />

<br />
Thanks Dave for clarifying this.<br />
<br />
According to his profile PJ is on Baan IV.<br />
As far as I know, Infor has not made any benchmarks for BaanIV in a long time. Do you have any information how the parameter behaves there?<br />
<br />
Is the Oracle driver for BaanIV actually interpreting this parameter as BAAN ERP LN?<br />
<br />
Does anybody ever traced this, maybe?<br />
<br />
In case of &quot;2&quot;, what is the value for the number of record, eg N?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">6th May 2009, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">If i remember correctly the baan 4 driver does send first_rows(n) to oracle if this is set.<br />
<br />
So if you're on oracle 9i and up you should always see better performance with /*+ FIRST_ROWS(n) */ vs just  /*+ FIRST_ROWS */<br />
<br />
(So i disagree with support here in telling PJ to go back to the old style of first_rows_hint:1) Unless they know of some bug in the porting set / oracle version that he is on.<br />
