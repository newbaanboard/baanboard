   - windows batch script<br />
   - vbscript<br />
   - blat for emailing, also from windows 2008 you have emailing capability from the server<br />
   - task scheduler<br />
   - visual studio (SSIS/SSRS/SSAS), comes with SQL server disk already. you just need to learn the technology. also comes with c++, c#, ajax, vb,asp.net ....totally limitless :)<br />
<br />
i even converted our faxing,emailing and texting to cellphones to windows. worked like a charm :) good luck.</div></div><hr />
