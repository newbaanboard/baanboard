<br />
env. HP-UX 11.00 with BaanIVb4<br />
<br />
since a while we have connected some clients over VPN to Baan. Some of them have variable IP-adresses; means DHCP give them at every login a new adress. But we cannot print then, as always these new adresses needs be maintained in /etc/hosts. The printers itself are defined as remote printers. <br />
<br />
Any idea to fix that problem ? If I am right I only remember to AIX this is quite normal (but could be solved with -c option in rexecd), but on HP-UX ???<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input !!!<br />
<br />

Are you trying to maintain local or network/direct printers. It seems you are trying to setup the local printers attached to the client PCs to the /etc/hosts.<br />
You dont have to do that and you have a work-around by setting up a single local printer in the device data.<br />
Refer to the threads -  Windows Printer (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=14470&amp;highlight=bwprint) <br />

<br />
If you need network printer, then maybe the follwoing would help. The DHCP server normally is able to integrate with the DNS server to resolve the dynamically created IP adresses. Now you point your HP-Box to use the DNS server on the DHCP box and finished.<br />

<br />
unfortunately it`s BaanIVb (not c) - so devicetype WINDOWS is not available. Any idea if someone has managed to get WINDOWS-Printing under IVb running? But I suppose that the Tools-Standardprogramm is not able to handle this in IVb ...<br />
<br />
Markus: Your idea looks good. I have just spoken to our Admin, then with the Network-man. And got more infos. There is no DHCP within our environment (sorry for the before wrong info) configured. And not planned to setup. So this is no way for me to go. Sorry.<br />
This fact that VPN-clients exists with dynamic IP-adresses is due to a misconfiguration from our Internet-provider, which they could not solve now for a long time. But we will force them now to get all VPN-clients running on static IP-adress and we will then solve more problems (seen local network again, IT could better trigger activities and so on).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your inputs.<br />

You should be able to roll your own &quot;Windows&quot; device type.<br />
<br />
What is involved?<br />
- write a wrapper program for ttstpconv (look in the Code &amp; Utilities forum)<br />
- in this wrapper, capture the device independant spool file<br />
- transfer this file to the client PC (server2client)<br />
- launch this file with BWPrint<br />
<br />
Too much work?<br />
- Just implement the vanilla pdf printing in Code &amp; Utilities forum.<br />
- ofcourse the downside to this effort is getting ghostscript to compile for your OS.</div></div><hr />

I remember having fixed a similar problem in the following way:<br />
I wrote a little shell script, that grep'd the ip-adress of a user (last argument of 'who am i') and added it to /etc/host (if not already present). Then I created a user that did nothing much more than issuing this command and exited again.<br />
Without much effort on the client windows machine an automated telnet session was started, login in as that user. Thus the new IP-adress automagically got added to /etc/hosts. <br />
Could for sure been done in more artful ways ... but it did the job.<br />
