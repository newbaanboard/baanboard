I just migrated the LN environment from one server to another. The BSE files are correct, and I did a backup and restore of the database. When I try to enter the LN environment, it gives me the error of<br />
<br />
bdb_errno 510 on ttadv999    and then it says lost connection to server. <br />
<br />
Does anybody know how to fix this problem or where to even start?  I am definitely not an expert, but any help would be much appreciated because I am stumped. <br />
<br />
- I made sure the server and database are on already.<br />
- Created the Baan user on the computer. <br />
<br />
Again, any help would be great. Please let me know. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

If you installed SQL Server on the new server it could happen as the install process asks for an instance name which may not exist on the previous installation on the old server (e.g. if you had upgraded on the old server).<br />
<br />
If it is different, your tabledef6.1 would need to be edited to look something like this:<br />
<br />
tccom001:200:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=1,MSQL_SERVERHOST=192.168.10.2\BAAN1):Y<br />
<br />
where &quot;Baan1&quot; is the instance name.</div></div><hr />

I checked to make sure the instance names were correct, but they are both local so it shows up as just a blank. I checked to make sure I could log into the server through sql server management utility. <br />
<br />
Not really sure what is going on.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />

What are they? What's the output of qptool -c 000 -q 'select * from ttaad100' telling you?</div></div><hr />
