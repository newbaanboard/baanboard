<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">29th October 2003, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">My company is running Baan on a Unix server, and the users each have desktops running win2000. <br />
<br />
Everyone is using 'SmarTerm Essential' to interact with Baan in a text terminal way. <br />
<br />
I talked with a Baan rep yesterday who confirmed that we are running the first release of Baan IV. <br />
<br />
My question is, where is the GUI? I don't know how to start it or even where it is. Is it a seperate user-machine installation?<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you need any more info.<br />

<br />
could you specify the unix flavor please??<br />
<br />
It is possible using xwindows interfaces and running the bx6.1.<br />
<br />
If you need more information write to maurixgr@yahoo.com<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">29th October 2003, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The unix flavor is AIX 4.3.<br />
<br />
We're currently logging onto the unix server via smarterm by persoft. <br />
<br />
I've been trying to learn more about Unix commands and such, but am not up to speed as I need to be. <br />
<br />
Let me know if you need more info to help me with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 00:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of running through SmartTerm, the ole' VT way, you need to load the bw windows client on each PC.<br />
<br />
Check for the latest BW (Baan Windows) client on the Baan support site.  Once this is loaded and configured, you run through that.  <br />
<br />
If you have access to the Baan support site, Solution #13743 has the latest solution attached, and links to documents on the BW Client, and BW Print, which is a related executable that comes with it.<br />
<br />
Short explanation for a long process - give it a go and post back if you have questions.<br />
<br />
Edited:  I just reread the XWindows post - I really can't speak for that, I have never set it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
Our company canceled our maintenence agreement with Baan in 2001.<br />
<br />
Do you have to pay for access to the support site?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you need support for the site.<br />
<br />
You can check around on your original install and see if there is the initial release on there...look for bw.exe and bwprint.exe - those files need to be run on the PC's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool..<br />
<br />
Are those the .exe's for the install or the actual program executibles?<br />
<br />
What I mean is, would there be any chance all the installation files are on my unix server and I could copy them to the clients and install?<br />
<br />
Also, if that's no, do you know of any way I could buy the GUI install disk(s) from Baan or a reseller without paying for another maintenence package?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Check if you have files here:<br />
<br />
../baan/bse/mswindows/bw*<br />
<br />
the bw files here should be your initial install.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Lisa, <br />
<br />
I confirmed via Baan that we are using Baan IV, release 1, but when I log onto the unix server and look at the file structure, everything is under &quot;triton&quot; not &quot;baan&quot;. <br />
<br />
Also there isn't a &quot;mswindows&quot; directory either.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts as to where else it could be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">O yes, I remember that conversation.  I am still not convinced eh.  ok, you must have some very early release.  I don't know where the file would be under the triton structure, triton did not have gui, so I would not be certain you have it at all.<br />
<br />
You can check with a Unix find for bw* files under your triton directories.  I'm not a Unix buff, but hopefully you can work that out, or someone here can provide a good find command to search the directories..I always have to play with the help on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">When I talked to the Baan rep, she said we had the first release of Baan IV. She said that there were two more releases, and one of those two were the release that removed the 'triton' references.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if maybe we recieved the disks to upgrade and never did the upgrade?<br />
<br />
Last time I asked about my version here on the board, I got both answers, 3 and 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I was one of the ones that answered 3 - it certainly looked like Triton from what you described.  But trust the Baan rep here probably, what she says makes sense, I'm sure they know better than I about the evolution of their exact releases &amp; structure.</div></div><hr />
