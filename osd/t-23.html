<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 08:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I am wondering what the story is for Baan on Linux? I have heard rumours about people working on a portingset for Limux but how much of that is true? Is it an 'official' project within Baan that will be part of their future product/platform strategy? Or is it a solo-venture of a a couple of developers?<br />
<br />
I hope Baan is driving this with the aim of providing a full fledged Baan version on Linux one day. With Compaq discontinuing the Alpha architecture, Intel Itanium and sucessors will gain momentum and enable Linux to become an even more powerful player on the market. It would be a shame if Baan is going the miss that train.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerhard</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a portingset for Baan IV on Linux since more than a year. But this was never released. Upto now, there are no informations, whether Linux will be supported in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Gerhard,<br />
<br />
If you say never released, do you mean nobody can get it? Or do you need to know the right people?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 11:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say that the Linux porting set is similar to the CE client. There was always a rumour that Baan were working on a client for CE and other handhelds, but as of yet, I have never seen any these items available on the public market. <br />
<br />
I am sure that in the hallowed corridors of many Baan Towers, there are many ideas about getting Baan to work on many systems, however... you have to remember that the DB still has to be working in the background.. Anyone know of a MSSQL version that runs in Linux or want to put sales orders on over WAP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">MSSQL? Urgh.. Let's stick to Oracle and Informix, both products run nicely on Linux. And who knows there might be future support for MySQL :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that those two products run nicely, but Baan cannot be seen of as wanting to remove a possible sales lead. Remember, that Microsoft were once rumoured to be interested in buying Baan. <br />
<br />
I think that there has to be a customer overturn to see a change. When I installed Baan IV c the first time, it was one of the first NT installations in the UK. It was a major risk at the time as no-one could help us with the install (the guy who installed it had done it loads of times, just never outside a training room) and it took us about 3 weeks of fiddling with NT and Informix to get it working. Now an NT installation can be done in a few hours with no problems at all..... The more people moving to Linux and asking will force Baan's hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was on Baan, we talked once to the guy that has  the portingset running on Linux.<br />
He mention that he adapted/compiled it for linux as part-time, just for fun, but Baan officially did not supported it, not even a ba6.1 client (that would be also nice).<br />
Of course that we tried to convince him to send us the portingset, unsuccesfully I may say :D</div></div><hr />

You are right, Jaason. <br />

<br />
I got the portingset here at home.<br />
I received it from a guy at Baan at the time I was still working for VBS.<br />
It only has an oracle driver I think.<br />
<br />
I never got around to experiment with it, maybe some time in the future.<br />

If anyone can get me the client for CE, I'm willing to send the linux portingset to him.<br />

Just got an email from him saying:<br />

It was unixware7.0! Works fine.<br />
I had it running under linux with a sco portingset and sco emulation ibcs under linux.<br />
The only problem are the pty's!  For some reason it can not handle the pty's properly. May if you can tune the pty's under linux to a more sco/unixware like way it may works!<br />

So, try it using the binary translator (ibcs) and let us know if it works!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">areanvv</div><div class="date">2nd October 2001, 06:29</div></div><div class="posttext">When I worked at Baan I came accross to solutions for Linux.<br />
<br />
One was running Baan on Linux (early 98!) using one of Linux's emulation modes to support software for other i386 based Unix flavors like SCO (ibcs).<br />
<br />
The other one was the same as Gerard mentioned, Baan engineers in Holland that run it at home. You won't see a public release until there is enough demand. Baan customers I visited during my time at Baan were usually the smaller midmarket (NT dominant) or the bigger (Unix esp. HP and Solaris) users.<br />
<br />
Linux could play in the midmarket as well, but larger ERP implementations will probably stick to more mature Unix versions.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I left Baan was the fact that everything turned into MS code based apps. E-Enterprise on MS SiteServer and SQL Server, MS based addons etc. I now jumped over to the Java, J2EE, Linux, Open Source world... what a refreshment, but I do agree that OS needs are based on specific user requirements, Baan runs fairly well on NT and SQL 2000 with Baan is not a bad combo at all. <br />
<br />
WAP and Baan? Shouldn't be a big issue. You can use Baan's ConnectionKit BCK (free) or the more recent BaanOpenWorld (60k+) and integrate with Baan using Java and put a simple application together on a Java2 Enteprise server producint WAP pages. <br />

That would make Baan a more affordable solution at the entry level.  There would be a bit of irony in using SAP's relational database for the back-end with Baan, no? ;)</div></div><hr />

I didn't get any positive feedback from within PEG, so maybe this is just the frontend for the iBaan, still requiring BaanIV/ERP to run on a commercial UX/NT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gideon</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 02:13</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible that PEG has it wrong in this case. Brower's quote from the crn article speaks about, more as one application:<br />
<br />
 &quot;In addition, the company plans to announce Linux versions of its applications within the next few weeks. Baan currently supports Unix, OS/400 and Windows NT on the server. &quot;We will have a very, very big initiative for Linux and Linux support by the end of this quarter,&quot; Brower said.&quot;<br />
<br />
In this context you would not expect that we are only expecting BaanCRM on Linux, you would hope for a little more then that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't remember any major additions to the Baan IVc4 area, but for Baan 5.0c a Linux Porting set was present!! This is good news!    <br />
