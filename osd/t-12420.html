<br />
BaaN 50c portingset 7.1d.01, Win 2000, SQL Server 2000<br />
<br />
Getting a &quot;Connection with server lost. Reconnect ?&quot; message.<br />
Pops up randomly. The problem is that when it happens in the middle of a transaction, the data in the table is left partway done.<br />
If you want to finish the process, because of some value in a field, you cannot because the original process stopped in the middle and BaaN could think it is finished.<br />
<br />
Any help on why this connection problem happens ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

See this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5474&amp;highlight=connection).  It comes and goes.  There are 4 of us in my office and at times I have seen 2 out of the 4 of us get dropped - and in some cases it happens every few minutes.  We have tried sniffers, log tracing, etc. and have not found a new solution.  Soon we are going to expand the network bandwidth between my site and the host server site, maybe that will fix the &quot;latency&quot; problem. Sigh.<br />
<br />
There are probably other threads out there that may be of some help.  I tried doing some search but did not see anything that may help.  You might want to try your self.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
