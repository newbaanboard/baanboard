<br />
We have the company evaluating usage of ERP LN on Sql Server vs Oracle.<br />
If anyone has any specific information about advantages and disadvantages of Oracle over Sql Server?<br />
<br />
What are the common problems faced with LN-Oracle and LN-SqlServer<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexlow</div><div class="date">7th December 2007, 04:31</div></div><div class="posttext">which version of mssql, flavor of oracle? other than that you still need to consider the TCO. this debate will never end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flysurfing</div><div class="date">7th December 2007, 09:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly speaking take the cheapest one !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">7th December 2007, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion either of them will do the job.<br />
<br />
Things to consider:<br />
- is one of these RDBMS already being used in the company: take that one;<br />
- MSSQL can be received often very cheap if you already use a lot of other MS products;<br />
- with MSSQL you have to stick to windows server, with Oracle you can choose another OS;<br />
<br />
Please note that you can use the Oracle Standard Edition version which is a lot cheaper that the enterprise edition. I am not familiar with MSSQL versions/costs.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexlow</div><div class="date">7th December 2007, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">this comparison doc might be useful.<br />
<br />
http://www.wisdomforce.com/dweb/resources/docs/MSSQL2005_ORACLE10g_compare.pdf<br />
<br />
however my personal opinion is that if you want scalability, have the budget and expertise than go for unix base oracle, if not for fast and easy deploy just choose mssql.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Why not Linux / Oracle or even Linux / MySQL then?<br />
<br />
Otherwise, Han is right, go with what the site already is familiar with. <br />
<br />
If they don't already have DB experts then find out what their other systems are: Windows or Unix. If they're on windows then go with MSSQL<br />
if they're on unix go with Oracle (or informix, db2.. the linux option, whichever)<br />
<br />
Basically - the summary - for 30 - 50 users the Database choice is not a concern.<br />

Han, Client  doesnt have expertise with Unix.  Unix with Oracle is out.<br />
So we will go with Microsoft OS. <br />

Alex, Thanks for the pdf file.<br />

Your user base is too small to invest in a more expensive Oracle and hire a dedicated db admin. Additionally, SQL Server performance had been catching up with Oracle. Don't forget the other perks that came with it also, the Reporting Services (I think it's pretty cool), the Integration Services (seamless interface with Excel and other MS products) and lastly the analysis services.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexlow</div><div class="date">13th December 2007, 05:56</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, it will be a better choice, also one have to take into consideration the overhead of maintaining multiple login and password environment.<br />
<br />
by using mssql you can sync the erpln with AD users account, hence single sign-on conveniently. (with exception having password sync system, yet have limitation)</div></div><hr />

Ben,<br />
<br />
Even small companies need a good DBA. I see too often an expensive server with a DBA that had to learn the DB administration by a cheap on line course. None of the database perform when you go for click-click finish! If you do not want to run into trouble a well educated DBA is required whatever database you choose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">californialife</div><div class="date">5th March 2008, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We are in the process of upgrading to LN from IVC4, currently on WinNT4 and Oracle 7.3.4. While we like Oracle and had proposed to move to Linux OS (Novell SLES2) and Oracle backend, we are implementing several of the add-on modules like Mobile Service, Workflow, etc., which want to have Windows / SQL. We've just started re-evaluating our path and wondered whether to forego Linux / Oracle or attempt to mix the two. We have a 70 concurrent user setup, about half of which is actually used at any given time. Total named users will ultimately be about 120, but round the world so no heavy loading at any given time. Any thoughts on this, or maybe another forum would be a better place to address this?</div></div><hr />

Be aware of the fact that Workflow and Mobile service might require different versions of MS-SQL than ERP LN. Take special attention when you want to implement Windows in a 64-Bit version. Check out the availability of EVERY piece of software you want to run on the machine. Don´t forget the Java versions that are necesarry (e.g. for Workflow). Two different Java environments on one machine could be a pain ... <br />
<br />
Oracle on SLES is rock solid. My advice: When you like Oracle run it on SLES and run the other software (Workflow and Mobile Service) on smaller machines (could be PC´s) with Windows.<br />
