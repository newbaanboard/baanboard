<br />
I am at an installattion with w2000 and sql2000<br />
Sometimes the following error on the server:<br />
<br />
sort.exe -  Application error.<br />
the application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142). Click on ok to terminate the application.<br />
<br />
I know that the user session where the error was caused hangs until I give some enters on the server.<br />
<br />
What can this be?<br />
Anyone has seen this before?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BBailey</div><div class="date">9th June 2003, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We encountered this same problem. W2000/SQL2000 BaanIVc4, Porting set 6.1c.06.02.<br />
<br />
In our situation it was to do with a Registry Setting regarding memory allocated to desktop heap.  We had to increase ours to 1024 KB(was 512 KB as described below, which was too low for our # of users). <br />
<br />
Please confirm the following procedure with Baan Support (Solution 109404) before changing your registry!!!<br />
<br />
The solution description was:<br />
<br />
1. Run the Registry Editor (RegEdt32.exe). <br />
2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey: <br />
      \System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\ <br />
<br />
SubSystems\Windows <br />
The default data for this value will look something like the following (all on one line): <br />
   %SystemRoot%\system32\csrss.exe ObjectDirectory=\Windows <br />
   SharedSection=1024,3072 Windows=On SubSystemType=Windows <br />
   ServerDll=basesrv,1 ServerDll=winsrv:UserServerDllInitialization,3 <br />
   ServerDll=winsrv:ConServerDllInitialization,2 ProfileControl=Off <br />
   MaxRequestThreads=16 <br />
In SharedSection=1024,3072, 3072 represents the heap size for desktops associated with the interactive Window station. Scan along the line until you reach the part that defines the SharedSection values and add &quot;,512&quot; after the second number. This value should now look something like the following: <br />
<br />
   %SystemRoot%\system32\csrss.exe ObjectDirectory=\Windows <br />
   SharedSection=1024,3072,512 Windows=On SubSystemType=Windows <br />
   ServerDll=basesrv,1 ServerDll=winsrv:UserServerDllInitialization,3 <br />
   ServerDll=winsrv:ConServerDllInitialization,2 ProfileControl=Off <br />
   MaxRequestThreads=16 <br />
The 512 specifies the desktop heap for desktops associated with non- interactive window stations. This tells the system to allocate 512 KB of heap for each desktop. <br />
<br />
After making this change, close Regedt32 and restart the server. <br />
***********************************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Note that while the above excerpt recommends that this value be decreased Baan requires this to be increased.  On some systems the 3rd numerical entry in this string was set to 512.  This allowed only about 40 to 45 users to log in.   By increasing this number it was determined that a corresponding number of additional users were able to access the system.    In the systems that are experiencing the 505 there would be a 3rd entry that has a value below the required number.  By inserting a comma (,) and a valid number in increments of 512 with no spaces between the numbers and the commas you will specify the size of this desktop memory pool.  BE VERY CAREFUL WHILE CHANGING THIS VALUE!!!  Any modification to the registry can cause problems system wide.    A value that is too high will result in using up too many resources.  A value of 1024 may be loosely translated to about 50-100 users.  Windows 2000 may require a higher setting.<br />
<br />
You should always do a backup of your registry before performing this procedure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The site has a 42 user licence. The errors were appearing with #of logged on users above 35 or so....<br />
<br />
Increased the value to 1024. <br />
We'll see the results in the next few days...<br />
<br />
Will post the results here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
It is now 3 or 4 days after the parameter changing. The problem did not appear again.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

<br />
What are your settings and how many users do you have? Feel free to increase the parameter even further. Not a factor 100 or so, but 2048 is not a bad value.<br />
<br />
Let us know your results,<br />
