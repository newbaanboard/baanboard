I think this would be a space problem in our C drive, as it is running very low. The total free sapce available is around 1gb only in C drive where Baan application is installed.<br />
The baan db is in D drive and it have around 15gb free space.<br />
<br />
Is my thinking correct or anybody have experience this kind of error earlier?<br />
Any suggestion to get rid of this error as now this is comming very frequently. And at present we are getting rid of this error by server restart and deleting temp files, purging device queue etc.<br />

Redirect your sorts and temp's to d:<br />

BSE_TMP = xxxxxxxxxx<br />
BSE_SORT = xxxxxxxxxx<br />
<br />

BSE_SORT is a BaaN environment variable.<br />
It holds the path where the sorts are done.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
basicly BaaN handels the tmp-Files and sort-Files in $BSE/tmp.<br />
If your space in c:....$BSE left, you are able to redirect the tmp and sort files to any other diskspace (where's enough space) handled by BSE_TMP and BSE_SORT<br />
<br />
e.G. BSE_TMP = f:\baan_tmps<br />
<br />
<br />
