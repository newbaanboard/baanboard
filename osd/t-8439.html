<br />
We are planning to migrate to a new server in a few months and also are migrating from Informix to MSQL2000.<br />
My question is about what level to use? <br />
Level 1 is out for quit some time and is reliable.<br />
Level 2 is just out but has some major advantiges for us.<br />
<br />
Does anybody has experience with SQL2000 ( level 1 or 2 ) on a WIN2000 machine running BaaN4c4 ?<br />
<br />
Any information would be greatly appriciated.<br />

While I am reading this back I know I have to excuse myself for the language use :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">croezen</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a SQL training at Profuse the other day, and there was also someone from BaaN present.<br />
He told me that level 2 was released and that there were some clients working with it already!<br />
<br />
<br />
(I will make a case to discuss this in person, but I think that there are other customers who also want to know about this)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dvlahovic</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">As OmeLuuk said: SQL level 2 is not supported by BaanIV yet (at least I don't know for any customer that has this conf.).<br />
Bust as much as I have experience with BaanIV on W2k and SQL2k L1 ... it's working fine.<br />
However, I thing that beginning of use SQL L2 can cause some performance problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">croezen</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Dario,<br />
Why do you think that &quot;SQL L2 can cause some performance problems&quot; ?<br />
Is it because it's new and it needs a lot of testing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dvlahovic</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">That's right.<br />
It's known that Baan was written for Unix OS.<br />
It has always been a problem for Baan to work with MS systems.<br />
In few years, Baan was developed to that stage where it doesn't make so much problems with L1.<br />
I hope that I am wrong but there will a lot of installed patches on the system where application works on SQL L2.<br />
I thing that before installing BaanIV on SQL L2 it would be a good idea to wait and see other, existing companies, if they are having any problems with this configuration.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">L2 on the other hand puts more strain on the DBMS because it is to sort out the best way to deliver data... Oracle (L2) does have some fine mechanisms to optimize the queries. I am not sure about MSQL...<br />
<br />
Also within Baan (application programming) programmers sometimes force the use of indices (L2) but not in the correct way so the result was unpredictable... Most of these problems should be sorted out by now *knock* *knock*...<br />
<br />
Still a lot of people will agree: no faster DB for baan than TBase ...(but what is speed alone).</div></div><hr />

(* this I have to recall now, since the information is wrong - correction dated March 6th 2003 *)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">... and benchmarking is being done by Baan right now.  <br />
<br />
Testing with L2 is being done at a large customer in the US and they have had some luck with Level 2 drivers.  More info will be released in the next month...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sqlbuff</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, <br />
There are advantages and disadvantages with everything and same is the case with level2 driver, but the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages.  It is true that Baan released the driver for beta test at a large customer in US.  And they indeed found huge performance in many areas (database size reduction by more than 40% and database size growth rate reduced by 50%!! A distribution session that took 8 hours with level1 took only 1 hour with level2!  A finance session that used to take 24 hours with level1 now takes only 6 hours with level2.  Also there is a level1 to level2 migration tool available that smoothly migrates the level1 installation to a level2 installatlion).  See my reply in another thread:<br />
