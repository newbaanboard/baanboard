<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">26th October 2010, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We have recently migration from a Unix/Oracle platform to a Windows Server (2008 R2)/MS SQL Server 2008 platform.<br />
<br />
We have an issue where about 2 hours after most of our users are logged into the system, their existing sessions 'freeze' and users that attempt to log in after the fact will receive the Baan client splash screen (all users are using client versions .91 and up on XP mostly and a few on Windows 7) but then freeze.  There are no errors on the Baan server or the SQL Server's Event viewer.<br />
<br />
It does not appear that traffic between the Baan server and database server is clogged.  CPU and disk I/O are not an issue.<br />
<br />
Once we reboot we seem to be fine for that day.  Some days we have had to reboot much earlier than others and on those days, it seems to occur again late afternoon which forces a second reboot.  <br />
<br />
At first I thought it may have to do with a few triggers, so we disabled all of them but still received the error.  We also utilize the rushdll and I thought that it might be causing problems.  I changed the seq.open commands to utilize the 't' switch for an NT environment and verified that the run.baan.prog command which calls bic_info works so I believe that there isn't a problem with that.<br />
<br />
I'm at my wits end with the issue and was looking for any ideas the forums might be able to provide.  Thanks to any and all which might have a suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TIME.HIS File in $BSE/bse/lib<br />
<br />
Audit Files<br />
<br />
Max. process restriction on database level (only know this from oracle) having a lot of zombi processes (after some hours) and finaly reached max process parameter after relogin of users. (my favorit)<br />
<br />
Maximum (or number) of processes in the BaaN IV user settings.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">26th October 2010, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We had similar issues in SQL 2005 2 yrs back . Our SQL server was configured to use maximum possible memory .Though there were no clear solutions from Microsoft and online resources  , we re-configured the sql server to use only 90% of physical memory and not theoretical maximum possible memory.This worked well and we have no issues whatsoever on this count.<br />
<br />
Further if 3rd party apps are written to access sql directly , make sure they do not create server wide cursors .<br />
<br />
Also tell what u c in sql server logs when it freezes (some backup started , some major query failed / timed out etc  ) .<br />
<br />
Finally  have u scheduled update / create statistics say weekly . This is necessary for better db upkeep .<br />
<br />
 Also disk drive for logs and dbf must be separate for good speed . It  is good to segregate dbf files for some static tables like archieve / test comp and dynamic live tables.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you have SQL Servers Transaction Log configured?<br />
<br />
if your TX log fills up it will stop allowing TXs  until it's backed up / cleared.<br />
<br />
your reboot may be inadvertently triggering a SQL Server cleanup job that rolls back<br />
any open TXs and cleans out the transaction log temporarily.<br />

It appears to be a desktop heap allocation problem and so far we haven't experienced any additional issues.</div></div><hr />

What setting changes did you make to adjust heap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">15th July 2013, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to reference the old Infor Xtreme incident, but was unable to locate it.  It was a registry setting made on the Baan Server.  Infor technical support assisted us with the proper values to place in the registry.  <br />
<br />
Sorry I couldn't be more help.</div></div><hr />

Have a look at this KB: 941132. That describes how to change the heap space.<br />
