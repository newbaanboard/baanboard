I would like like to know the optimum values for the SHM Parameters.<br />
<br />
I feel even if i run shmvalues6.1, it always does not give the correct values suitable for the Operating system.<br />
<br />
Can any one suggest the recommened values ?<br />

<br />
There are not really any 'optimal' settings for the shared memory parameters.  These settings determine the behaviour of the OS shared memory allocated to Baan.<br />
<br />
shmvalues6.1 just defines the,<br />
<br />
1 Memory segment size,<br />
2 Memory start address, <br />
3 Memory step difference between segment start addresses, <br />
4 Max number of memory segments<br />
<br />
The default memory segment size is 16Mb.  If you make this smaller, more segments will be used; if you make this bigger, less segments will be used.  As far as I know, the number of segments has no impact whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The memory start address and step size just define the location of the segments in memory - these values should not normally need to be changed. <br />
<br />
Max number of memory segments is used to limit shared memory size available to Baan.  The default is 30 segments which is pretty high - this upper limit will prevent any Baan memory problems intereferring with other OS applications/functionality.<br />
<br />
So there are no optimal values for any of these parameters - they are just available so that memory settings can be tweaked should memory issues arise.<br />
<br />
If you are having specific problems then let us know.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the info you provided.<br />
<br />
The reason i asked about this memory issue is that, when i try to post the integration transactions (of course , they are huge in amount), the system hangs and when i see the particular processes they are in the sleeping state. Hence i was having a doubt in my mind whether the reason might be the operating system resources...<br />
<br />
any way, let me go through my system and come back to you if i require any assistance<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your problem is definitely not related to the shm params.  Indeed at the moment it is both month and Q3 end, so a lot of activities will be going on which would make your system slower than normal.<br />
<br />
Sleep state for processes is pretty normal and does not indicate a problem.  If a bshell process is sleeping, its probably waiting for information to come back from the database via the database driver.  So for example, a large number of reads/writes maybe being performed inside the database - the bshell must wait (sleep) for this info to be returned before continuing the processing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shared-memory communications:<br />
<br />
For the link with BAAN IV, it is not possible to use shm since the bshell establishes multiple links to INFORMIX (for Oracle I donÂ´t know) and shm is not able to handle multiple links. Perhaps check your bshell.<br />
<br />
Normal is 10.<br />
