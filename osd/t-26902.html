<br />
We are in project stage for a new group wide ERP solution (maybe SSA ERP LN 6.1).<br />
<br />
Now we use several BAAN IVc/SunOS implementations with one Oracle and some BaanBase DBs.<br />
<br />
But we'd like to unify OS and DB on a single, central installation. (Maybe Multi Finance/Single Logistic).<br />
<br />
Questions :confused: :<br />
<br />
a) Would you recommend Microsoft OS with SQL Server with ERP LN 6.1 for about 400 to 600  concurrent users?<br />
b) Are there already any &quot;big&quot; implementations with LN 6.1 and SQL Server?<br />
c) Who are the cracks for ERP LN 6.1 with SQL-Server?<br />
<br />

a) No<br />
b) I don't know<br />
c) 600 client access licences plus yet some other wheelbarrors of cash for SQL.<br />
<br />
Use linux!!! <br />
<br />
As far as I was told, in the meantime mysql DB should be supported (help me out there guys .. is it yet?) or will be supported shortly. <br />
<br />
Browse the board .... I haven't found a single post reporting about negative experiences with linux implementations.<br />
<br />
But ... on the other hand ... you won't be able to watch nicely animated papers flapping from one folder to the other if you copy things .... hmmm <br />

400-600 users is definitely enterprise class with all the related issues in regards to High Availablity etc. I certainly do not want to get flamed here from all the Linux fanatics out there, but why don't you stick to the proven horses: HP-Ux or IBM?</div></div><hr />

My question was &quot;MS with SQL-Server&quot; and not &quot;Linux with MySQL&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please give some ideas about using LN 6.1 with SQL-Server for about 400-600 concurrent users.<br />

Not a good idea.<br />
<br />
I agree with Markus. AIX, HP-UX and a solid database like Oracle is the only option for that many users.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">19th April 2006, 21:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Solaris with Oracle is also an option in my experience. We have 630 users on a kind of Sun cluster (5 Sun Fire 240 with a loadbalancer as application server and 2 890 in a HA Cluster for database, ultra-heavy users and jobs). Database size is about 1 TB on a SAN. Actually we are on Baan IV. Ok, I think/fear with LN we would need a hardware upgrade.<br />

<br />
Based on my experience I would go for either Linux or Unix with Oracle 10g if you are talking about 400 - 600 concurrent users.<br />
Definitely not Windows and SQL Server.<br />
Perhaps you should verify with the sizing guides of SSA Global as well.<br />

<br />
ok, I promise to try and hold my horses in the future. <br />
<br />
But don't think that I'm a hardliner when it comes to M$, I am definitely aware that you can run a stable installation on microsoft systems. Of course I am also 100% sure that you have a lot of additional work when administrating such an installation (until you add additional unix  with ms toolkit or suchlike).<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for the info edwin, I didn't know there was limit of 150 users to be certified with mysql.<br />
Sure enough yuo would be on the safe side with oracel, but I was just adding up costs and got carried away :-) <br />
<br />
Markus, thank you so very much :-(<br />
<br />
I am not a linux fanatic, but I remember a story I read several years ago.<br />
<br />
A large company decided to compare the system consulting services available for an IBM, a HP, another large brand unix system and a linux system.<br />
Although all of the specialists in the companies mentioned above did their very best and finally could provide solutions when they where confronted with some tricky questions ....<br />
none of the 'great players' even came near to the response time of the international linux community.  <br />
<br />
What would be your specific arguments against using linux as OS for a server with 400 to 600 users?<br />
<br />
Dear mack56, especially in the environment that you described in your post, I am seriously proposing to you that you install at least one test server with linux and have a look. <br />
<br />
We are talking about a really huge amount of money you may save (without losing quality) <br />
<br />
Finally:<br />
I did not intend to insult anybody, of course it is possible to use M$ and SQL Server in your situation. <br />
I personally simply can't find any reason why one should.<br />
<br />
Have a nice weekend everybody<br />

<br />
Hi Norbert, <br />
<br />
no offense intended here. My reasoning is very simple:<br />
<br />
a) There is worldwide no single reference customer for 600 users on Linux with Baan or 600 users on MySQL with Baan. With 600 users you do not experiment.<br />
<br />
b) I have a few customers of that size and they tend to have database servers with RAM in the range of 24-32 GB. I have to admit, my experience here is limited to Oracle, because that's what these customers are all (!) using. Try to search a bit the WEB how to configure an Oracle installation on Linux to use more than 4GB of shared memory and it will give you the creeps.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Markus</div></div><hr />

<br />
point taken.  (b)<br />
Have to finish some scripting atm, but I'll keep in mind to look up shared mem/linux/oracel.<br />
As SSA recommends no more than 150 users with mysql, I wouldn't dream of experimenting here. <br />
Even if there is no implementation with 600 users on linux (isn't there? I don't know), I wouldn't think that this shouldn't work.<br />
Remember that Baan failed to release the linux porting set until 2004, so comparing the number of installations doesn't seem to be too fair in my eyes ;-).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">20th April 2006, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Interestingly enough SSA Global is the one who decided to stay on the conservative side by certifying up to only 150 users maximum for MySQL in combination with SuSE Linux.<br />
This is also the case for BAAN IV in combination with MySQL and SuSE Linux which will be certified by them in August 2006.<br />
The people at MySQL have no problems with 400 - 600 concurrent users and SSA Global believes that if a customer still wants to go ahead with these numbers it will be at their own risk.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">20th April 2006, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know any site running Windows/sql-server with large amount of users but have heard in the past that volkswagen does (or perhaps did) use Baan with many users. That's what I heard around 1999. Perhaps our german members know more?<br />
<br />
We are using Baan5.0c with Oracle on Windows (NT/2000/2003). It's stable and to the users it doesn't make a difference what OS is running below. <br />
On the other hand for me as administrator I have to say I rather run Baan on any *nix box. Perhaps due to the fact that I don't program in e.g. VB but defining jobs that depend on other files etc. is a crime on windows.<br />
I notice that things like upgrading the portingset (apart of the size of the file that you have to download) is less smoothly on windows. Shared memory (emulation) on windows gives me problems from time to time.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: for the enduser it doesn't matter, for you as admin it differs a lot.</div></div><hr />
