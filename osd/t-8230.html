<br />
But of course curious if it will work and what the performance aspects are <br />
I am planning to write a document with some of the Oracle 8i or 9i new features like:<br />
<br />
Tablespaces<br />
-	Locally managed tablespaces (vs dictionary managed tablespaces)<br />
-	Read only tablespaces<br />
-	Resizing tablespaces (automatically, conditional, fixed)<br />
-	Temporary tablespaces<br />
-	Transportable tablespaces<br />
<br />
Oracle File Management<br />
<br />
Multiple Block Size <br />
<br />
Automated PGA Memory Management<br />
<br />
Tables<br />
-	Segment Space Management<br />
-	Partitioning<br />
<br />
Indexes<br />
-	Normal<br />
-	Reverse key<br />
-	Partinioned vs non-partioned<br />
-	Bitmap join index<br />
-	Clustered<br />
-	Rebuilding and Coalescing<br />
<br />
Undo data files<br />
<br />
Shared server concepts<br />
<br />
High Availability concepts<br />
<br />
As maybe you already have some experience with any of these I like to hear your comments (private or via this medium). What did you use, why how and what are youre your experiences.<br />
<br />
At the moment I have finished my document I will let you know the results.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

But you will also make these extra features available via a new database driver in the portingset? Which and when?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">27th December 2002, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">The Baan Oracle driver can handle most of the issues without any problem. The ones that are are not supported (yet) we have to find out if it is worth to change the driver. So if you can let me know with options you think are worh to implement I can forward it to the developers (who are also looking on this forum anyway ;)).  <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">27th December 2002, 19:23</div></div><div class="posttext">What I am missing in the Oracle driver are certain debugging features.<br />
<br />
Mostly, I  would like to know how custom code will translate (and break up), so I can do an explain plan and load calculations before introducing the code to the system.<br />
<br />
The bshell options just don't cut it there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">28th December 2002, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you eleberate a bit more what and how you what to have debugging on the driver? Do you want to start Oracle tracing at a certain point? And then turn off tracing? And what kind of tracing do you want to have: Baan tracing or real Oracle stuff with explain plan etc.?<br />
<br />
Maybe we can learn from it.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
My collegue Oracle DBA told me that some of the features you mention have been in Oracle long before 8i and 9i ... you are making a document just now because these features have not been supported by Baan before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">30th December 2002, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">As people don't know all possibilities I also will address some old topics. But I will mainly focus on the new issues. <br />
<br />
The driver is nearly changed for Oracle 9 but supports a lot of new features as it is transparent from front to end. E.g locally-managed and undo tablespaces can be used without changing anything in the driver.</div></div><hr />
