My portingset is 6.1c.07.21 and We are planning to upgrade our ORACLE DB <br />
10GR2 to 11GR2.<br />
<br />
1- Are there any documents explaining this migration?<br />
2- What do I have to do? AND Not To do?<br />
3- Anyone done it before?Expriences?<br />
5- Any performance issues?Any parameters Do I have to change?<br />
<br />
I am really appreciated anyone response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">23rd March 2015, 23:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I would opt for Oracle 12c, it will not long before infor will not support 11Gr2 anymore. See latest 9.0a.01 platform support matrix.<br />
You have 2 options: export all you data with baan tools, build a new oracle database and import it again; or upgrade your oracle environment.<br />
<br />
Latest is probably the fastest however you need to have oracle knowledge how to. Oracle can deliver you all the documentation you need.<br />
<br />
For both options I would recommend test the end result. Especially the performance both interactive sessions and your jobs. After all issues are solved perform the final migration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My Baan version is BaanIVc in the year of 1999.There are lots of customizations.On the other hand,We do not have any support aggrement<br />
with Infor.<br />
<br />
We have enough Oracle experience but Application Site I mean Baan Administration Honestly;We do not know what to do. There are not any documents for Upgrading Oracle DB for Baan Layer (Tools&amp;Administration)<br />
<br />
My Question is What are the steps? (Like)<br />
<br />
1-Close Baan<br />
2-Shutdown Oracle10GR2 (If necessary)<br />
3-Install Oracle 11G2 into new ORACLE_HOME<br />
4-Patch Oracle 11GR2<br />
5-Start Migration procedure from 10GR2 to 11GR2 (Oracle Layer)<br />
<br />
Start Baan with rc.start<br />
6-Logon user with Root or Bsp<br />
7-Call Which session?Any Export/Import Session?<br />
8-Do I have to set new ORACLE_HOME path (Probably YES) but using<br />
Which session?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You keep baan on the same server? Because without a support agreement you don't get a new license wich you need if you use a new server.<br />
If you have enough space available on your server than I would keep the datafiles of the old database save in case something goes wrong.<br />
If you keep using the same instance the only thing you need to do is to change the tabledef6.1 file. There the connection to your database is defined.<br />
<br />
However.....<br />
The portingset you currently use, does that one support 11Gr2? Not sure if that will work with your version. You need to check this.<br />
<br />
Another tricky thing since 11Gr2: oracle doesn't deliver 32 bits client libraries with that. So using this with a 32 bit portingset can only being done via a separate 32 client version installed in another ORACLE_HOME.<br />
<br />
IMHO I think the best you can do right now is to discuss this with someone that has done this before.  It's not rocket science but you don't want to end up with a not working system assuming it's being still used in production.</div></div><hr />

Yes I keep on the same server.<br />
In 2011; We migrated our BaanIVc to IBM Power P740 which was on the IBM P5 server<br />
and On that time We installed AIX 6.1 over P7 then We got new portingset (6.1c07.21)<br />
and installed to P7 server.<br />
<br />
We got a document as below says that our actual protingset supports Oracle 11G; <br />

Baan IV supported with Oracle 11i or 11g<br />
| Attachments (0) | Linked KBs | Sign Up | Add to Favorites | | Email KB<br />
Description:<br />
Oracle is talking about ending support for 10g in a 2011 or 2012, so it will be necessary to upgrade to at least<br />
Oracle 11g.<br />
Is there a specific SP or portingset that is required for this?<br />
Resolution:<br />
According to the technical notes of the porting sets, it would necessary to upgrade the porting set to at least<br />
6.1c07.21 in order to upgrade to Oracle 11g. In other words, 6.1c.07.21 is the first porting set that supports<br />
Oracle 11g.<br />

IF Our portingset is compatible with Oracle11g so Doesn't mean that support both 11gR1&amp;R2 ????<br />
<br />
When I check my tabledef6.1 file selected just 1 line like ;<br />
<br />
tibom000:*:oracle8(ORACLE_HOME=/oracle/baan01,ORACLE_SID=baan01,NLS_LANG=american_america.we8iso8859p9):Y<br />
<br />
At the moment I have installed Oracle10GR2 and it is working fine but the line says<br />
&quot;oracle8&quot;<br />
<br />
How can I check my installed Oracle10GR2 has 32 bit client OR 64 bit client libraries?<br />
<br />
And Finally; If you had such a kind of migration experience before  THEN I could think of your consultancy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">26th March 2015, 13:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the release notes: ftp://ftp.support.baan.com/updates/port/6.1c.07.21/Technical_Notes_PortingSet_61c0721.pdf This only mentions 11.1, not 11.2. Perhaps it will work but I would recommend to use only the combinations that infor supports according to their technical notes.<br />
<br />
From the technical notes of 6.1c.19:<br />
Oracle 11.2 support on 32-bit porting set<br />
Starting with Oracle 11.2, the 64-bit Oracle software does no longer contain a 32-bit client interface.<br />
Customers must install separate 32-bit Oracle client software. Refer to the Oracle installation guides<br />
for more details.<br />
An Oracle Database Net service must be configured in such a way that the 32-bit Oracle client<br />
installation can access the Oracle database.<br />
The setup of the Infor Baan IVc4 Oracle driver must be based on these resources:<br />
• ORACLE_HOME (of the 32-bit Oracle client installation)<br />
• ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME (the Oracle Database Net service name of the database).<br />
A connection between a 32-bit porting set and an Oracle 11.2 database based on ORACLE_HOME<br />
and ORACLE_SID is not possible<br />
<br />
And yes I do have the experience. Done it a couple of times already.<br />
Since noone reacted to your question I was willing to assist and guide you in the right direction. Actually I am currently maintaining for one of our customers a similiar environment as you have. (AIX6.1/BaanIV/Oracle 11Gr2).</div></div><hr />
