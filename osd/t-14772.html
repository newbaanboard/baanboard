<br />
I discovered  that all of our tables logging mode is not enabled except the tables we created  or reorganized after our DB installation and data load. <br />
<br />
All Tablespaces logging modes are enabled And I do not know how our tables  logging modes are disabled.<br />
<br />
We are using Oracle 9.2.0.3 and Baan IV .<br />
<br />
Anyone else having this situation?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Find all tables that have no logging like:<br />
<br />
SQL&gt; select table_name from user_tables where logging = 'NO'; <br />
<br />
and change the tables to logging mode:<br />
<br />
SQL&gt; alter table xyz logging; <br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
I got the list of logging disabled  tables , and it is over 20000 and I have over 30000 logging mode disabled indexes .<br />
Only 6000 tables and 10000 indexes logging modes are enabled.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this occured at data import time when we migrated to Oracle 9. by disabling Tablespaces logging modes for faster import , and Tablespaces logging modes enabled after that.<br />
<br />
Will the tables logging modes override Tablespaces logging mode and not generate redo ?<br />

So use a script like:<br />
SQL&gt; select 'alter table '||table_name||' logging;'<br />
  2  from user_tables<br />
  3  where logging = 'NO'; <br />
Will the tables logging modes override Tablespaces logging mode and not generate redo ? <br />
Table logging overrides tablespace logging mode. Tablespace logging mode is just a default for the tables.<br />

<br />
You are right about this. But in Archive log mode this does not include delete , insert , update operations<br />
I did some tests on my test server.<br />
I created some tables with logging disabled on a logging enabled TBS and on a logging disabled TBS.<br />
<br />
inserted some rows to these tables. and backedup the DB with rman, and inserted some more rows. <br />
shutdown the DB and deleted related Tablespaces (datafiles).<br />
<br />
mount the database , restore TBS with rman , recover TBS with rman. open the database and ALL the rows I inserted into logging disabled tables and logging disabled TBS came back.<br />
<br />
I asked this to our local support center and they said that When using DB in ARCHIVE mode update, insert, delete operations are logged in redo's except alter operations. <br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<br />
<br />
Although you can set the NOLOGGING attribute for a table, partition, index, or <br />
tablespace, no-logging mode does not apply to every operation performed on the <br />
schema object for which you set the NOLOGGING attribute. Only the following <br />
operations can make use of no-logging mode: <br />
<br />
direct load (SQL*Loader) <br />
<br />
direct-load INSERT <br />
<br />
CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT <br />
<br />
CREATE INDEX <br />
<br />
ALTER TABLE ... MOVE PARTITION <br />
<br />
ALTER TABLE ... SPLIT PARTITION <br />
<br />
ALTER INDEX ... SPLIT PARTITION <br />
<br />
ALTER INDEX ... REBUILD <br />
<br />
ALTER INDEX ... REBUILD PARTITION <br />
<br />
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE on LOBs in NOCACHE NOLOGGING mode stored out of line <br />
<br />
All of these SQL statements can be parallelized. They can execute in logging or <br />
no-logging mode for both serial and parallel execution. <br />
<br />
Other SQL statements are unaffected by the NOLOGGING attribute of the schema <br />
object. For example, the following SQL statements are unaffected by NOLOGGING <br />
mode: UPDATE and DELETE (except on some LOBs, as noted above), conventional <br />
path INSERT, and various DDL statements not listed above. <br />
<br />
even in the case of say direct insert ( where no logging is applicable)<br />
<br />
Some minimal logging is still done for marking new extents invalid, and <br />
dictionary changes are always fully logged<br />
<br />
<br />
