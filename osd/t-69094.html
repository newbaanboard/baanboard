So they ask me the following question:<br />
Have you checked the tables tfgld410, tfgld417 and tfgld418 for instance on database level, reorganize the indexes for instance?<br />
Can anyone explain me what I have to do now ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Reorganize tables<br />
The system administrator must frequently reorganize the database tables because the disk space of deleted records will not immediately be given back to the system. In other words, although many records in a table are deleted, the size of the table itself will not become smaller. Only after the table has been reorganized will the disk space of the deleted records become available on the system. Reorganizing the database tables becomes very important when many records in tables are deleted.</div></div><hr />
