My state of knowledge is, that the version of HACMP only depends on the<br />
the AIX-Level (incl. Maintancence Level).<br />
I guess you are going to create a takeover construct, where appplications<br />
are to taken from failed nodes.<br />
From HACMP's point of view the apllication servers are realized by executing scripts. <br />
To make the long story short :<br />
The latest HACMP-Version for AIX 5L<br />
is V5.1<br />
<br />

<br />
We are currently using HACMP E.S 4.5 With AIX 5L and Oracle 9i.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">We have two servers and external disks reachable from both servers. We decided to have all SW (Baan and Oracle) and data on external disks. Is this scenario possible? Could be any problem with validation? I suppose, we need to validate network management and HACMP as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fjaeck</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">What about the rootvg's ?<br />
Remember, the brandfile(s) reside(s) in <br />
the directory /.brand.<br />
Seems, that nobody knows about the<br />
exact constitution of the validation code.<br />
But definitely it depends on the system<br />
hardware.<br />
As i previously mentioned, in a takeover<br />
szenario the license daemon will also be<br />
swapped to another hardware. In that<br />
case you will get  the demo situation<br />
automatically and that is the problem.<br />
Are you planning to do so?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">My idea is to put both servers names in $BSE/lib/licence6.1, validate network and HACMP and result must be brand files on both servers. My question is: is it enough to have only $BSE/bin directory on internal disk or complete Baan SW have to be on internal disk (on both servers)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fjaeck</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't you plan to use IPAT ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jclju1</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know there is no IPAT anticipated. HACMP will install another person, so I don't know too much about. My duty is to prepare Baan (install and validate) for planed scenario. This person advise me to have all SW on external disks, but I am afraid that in this case it will be not possible to validate Baan properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fjaeck</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm! Do we have a communication problem?<br />
<br />
But don't worry,<br />
<br />
The external disks themselves are not the problem, provided that they are supported for HACMP.<br />
<br />
The  baan validation problem depends<br />
on your HACMP-Konfiguration.<br />
<br />
No IPAT means you can use the Cluster and network functions in the validation.<br />
But you have to install an complete baan <br />
application on both nodes.<br />
In case of takeover you have to tell HACMP how to deactivate the &quot;local&quot; baan of the second node except the licence management. The idea of moving<br />
$BSE/bin to a internal filesystem<br />
seems useful. <br />
In case of takeover you can link the local $BSE/bin to the Baan environment, which has been taken over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caner.B</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 08:05</div></div><div class="posttext">In our system baan and oracle runs on different machines and their softwares are on external disk (fastT 700) . RootVG's are on internal disks and both has a /.brand  directory. <br />
We don't have any licence problem when we takeover. I do not know how it is licenced by our cunsultant but if I can learn it from him I will post it here.</div></div><hr />
