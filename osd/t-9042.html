<br />
Can anyone tell me if/where Baan supplies information on their support website that shows a correlation between Baan versions and supported OS platforms and databases?  Our customer is considering a move from Baan IVc with the A&amp;D 2.0+ extension on AIX/DB2 to perhaps Baan V with AnD 1 on Wintel/SQL2k.  There is some question among my colleagues as to whether this Baan version will be supported on Wintel, etc.  I would also like for them to consider DB2 on Wintel, but I am not sure if it is supported, either.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Thanks for the reply!  I tried going to the URL you supplied, but I don't seem to have access.  Would I have to request of Baan to give me access to this page?  If so, I wonder to whom and how I go about making such a request?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
if your support website login:<br />
ecommerce/WebID<br />
<br />
didn't work, then its not open to the public yet.<br />
<br />
But if you log a case with Baan support they can access the site for you and get you the info.<br />

<br />
Did you get any further with your question about windows and DB2 ?<br />
<br />
Have you come across any other user with this set up ?</div></div><hr />
