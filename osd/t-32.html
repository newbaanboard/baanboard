<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">This sounds like a problem that appears in 4c4 with service pack 6. This is only occurs with MS SQL 7 and creates so many problems.. There is a patch and a correcting program for 4c4, but I havn't come across the Baan5 solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We run Ora805/HPUX/4c4 and also have the same problem.<br />
<br />
Ravenscross you mention that there is a patch and corrective program for this. Do you know the soluton number by any chance. I've searched the Baan KB, for what it's worth, and found nothing. (Surprise, Surpirse)<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
P.S. We are on SP5</div></div><hr />

Need to make a new dump of the live company which will have to wait until the weekend.<br />
<br />
Then we can try it again and report back<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">23rd August 2001, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about the solution number, but if you search on the BaanKB for 'Error 205' (I think), you should find the file. Of course, this is all coming from memory (I really should write this stuff down)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toby Stephenson</div><div class="date">8th November 2001, 19:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a similar problem when migrating data from Oracle7 to SQL2K.<br />
<br />
We had some 'duff' dates in a couple of tables that Oracle didn't care about but SQL saw that they were out of sync (i.e. 1345 AD etc).  At this point the sequential dump 'skipped' this table and so were left with incomplete data.<br />
<br />
The only way to fix this was to either edit the data manually or write an exchange script to modify/migrate the data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">After much torture and reading of much awful  documentation, I have managed to upgrade to Baan5c Service Pack 6, latest portingset, plus latest SQL service pack (nice &gt;40Mb download!)<br />
<br />
The problem seems to have been rectified somewhere along the way.<br />
<br />
There was a brief moment of panic when we couldn't get into (amongst other sessions) Maintain Purchase Orders - but this was fixed with yet another tools patch!<br />
