<br />
we are in the process to migrate a chinese Baan installtion on NT to a chinese Baan installation on HP-Ux.<br />
<br />
Baan is running in multibyte mode on HP-Ux (newly installed). We were able to transfer data via Baan dump from the NT system to the HP system into tbase. The data could be read and shows properly as chinese in the baan gui.<br />
<br />
Now! Here our problem:<br />
<br />
Even though the NT system is using oracle as a database and we configured the same Oracle settings (NLS_Lang, characterset etc) on the HP-Ux box, I get the following error during load:<br />
<br />
ORA-01401: inserted value too large for column<br />
<br />
I have the impression, that the HP-Ux box is using for the same multibyte characters more bytes in the database, then the NT box.<br />
This should not be the case, if the database has the sam echaracterset and the Baan config is the same.<br />
<br />
Has anybody an idea to this topic?<br />
<br />
Could the problem be, that on NT, we are using Oracle8i and on HP-Ux we are using Oracle9i?<br />
<br />
Any rough guests would be appreciated. <br />
<br />

<br />
We could solve the problem. Here our learned wisdom for anybody experiencing the same:<br />
<br />
We had the NLS_LANG variable set at two places, in the environment and in $BSE/lib/defaults.<br />
<br />
One of it had as characterset &quot;US7ASCII&quot;. As a consequence the storage in oralce was wrong.<br />
<br />
When everywhere the proper characterset for simplified chines was set, everything was fine.<br />
