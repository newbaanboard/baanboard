<br />
<br />
i have a question regarding the performance of LNFP3, when we want to print a report that has a huge data(for example the reconcilliation data) the system always hangs, do you guys/girls know the cause of this?This is never happenned before.<br />
<br />
i suspect the database, because the IT admin never reindex it since 2 years.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
is it OK to reindex the data after such a long time?and what will be the best method? is it using the reorganize table in the LN or using the stored procedure on the sql server?<br />
<br />
So far from what i see, the reorganize table doesn't have any partitioning table option, correct me if i'm wrong.<br />

<br />
If you're using the level 1 driver you probably need to use baan tools (reorganize tables)<br />
<br />
reindexing may or may not be the key. if your database isn't being maintained by a DBA knowledgeable in SQL Server then you could just be wasting time by doing that..<br />

<br />
<br />
can you explain more about the database driver in LN? i've read the manual but the info i can find is just the LN has it's own driver for the database.<br />
<br />
and is there any other possibilities beside the reindexing? all i can think is the table partitioning, i've done some tuning of SQL in the past, but the system is way smaller, and the data size is nothing compare to this.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

I'm not really a SQL Server expert. <br />
<br />
In oracle you might generate statistics for a larger table, check it's fragmentation, look for chained rows, check I/O, etc.<br />

<br />
after some time struggling with manual i found the problem: <br />
<br />
the I/O process is very huge<br />
<br />
the allocation size is only 4kb, i changed it into 64kb<br />
<br />
and i changed the memory allocation to program, and set the page file.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the guidance.<br />
