<br />
We want to make a migration, but at first I want to do comparative analysis of:<br />
<br />
&#61623; supported versions of RDBMS<br />
&#61623; price of license<br />
&#61623; HW price (and sizing)<br />
&#61623; What Baan people say<br />
&#61623; Implementation cost<br />
&#61623; Postimplementation cost and time frame <br />
&#61623; API-s<br />
&#61623; Disaster recovery i bussiness continuity ISO17799 / BS 7799<br />
&#61623; performance<br />
&#61623; skalability<br />
&#61623; 4GL support<br />
&#61623; future Baan polocy...<br />
<br />
Help me with some literature or if you can for DB2  / Oracle / support from Baan in this moment of time ...<br />
<br />
My option is to stay on Bisam but, it is not my and I think SSA / DBMS vendor interest ...<br />

I have recently had trouble down loading word documents but I assumed it was a microsoft problem. <br />
<br />
I have downloaded an enormous amount of LN6.1 stuff which is mostly pdf, without any problems recently.  <br />
<br />
As to the database.  Why change? <br />
<br />
If performance is a problem upgrade the hardware -- more / faster disks -- more memory and cpu cycles.   I think it would be possible to get much greater performance improvement with hardware upgrade than with than with database software no matter what your scale of operations are.  The improvement would certainly be at a much lower cost and the cost would be a one-time cost.<br />
<br />
If you were to change RDBMS you would probably have to pay SSA more money (certainly if you went to Oracle which is best of breed) as well as paying for RDBMS licences and ongoing annual support/use fees. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">6th November 2004, 07:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I think he might want to change because<br />
1) bisam doesn't support tables &gt; 2GB<br />
2) future baan porting sets may not have a tbase driver...<br />
<br />
As far as I know, you don't have to pay SSA any more money<br />
dependant on which DB driver you license, or even if you license all of them.. <br />
<br />
I'm a big fan of db2, it's small and fast, doesn't cost nearly as much as Oracle and doesn't come with all the extra un-needed  crap. The only downside is that db2's Query Optimizer is &quot;So Smart&quot; that it doesn't accept hints, a bit of a sticky situation when baan's sending &lt;blank&gt; to &lt;zzz&gt; queries... (of course there are ways around that....)<br />

<br />
Terry,<br />
<br />
it isn't MS problem - I listed QG-s by FTP - there is no DB2 migration guide (a saw it a couple of years ago on Baan KB...)<br />
<br />
Maybe, IBM is getting Informix as a basement SUBP and ?<br />
More I choose SUBP, I am more on the side to change only HW, but, when management is prepared for change, we have to make our situation so up to date and so better for IT.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Dave,<br />
<br />
you are right too,<br />
<br />
also, we have a global agreement with IBM and Oracle so beside DB2, there is Informix and Oracle in the game;<br />
<br />
Do you know what is with custom reports we made last 5 years on bisam;<br />
shall we have a problems migrating to DB2/Oracle/Informix because of SQL differences?<br />
<br />
Can you give me more details (links ...) on situation you said about:<br />
&quot;Query Optimizer is &quot;So Smart&quot;... &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">8th November 2004, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan you're not writing DB specific code.. so as far as that goes, bisam, oracle, db2, informix, mssql do not matter.. What matters is - you'll probably be migrating from Level 1 to Level 2 driver, that's where you may run into some problems. <br />
<br />
If you saw the quick guide &quot;years ago&quot; then I can imagine why they removed it.. it was 2 lines of migration (bdbpre/bdbpost), and then the Driver Manual. DB2 did not have a level 2 driver then, so that was really all there was to it.. Even today, with the level 1 to level 2, its not much more difficult, but you have to make sure to test your custom programs to make sure they are returning the data you expect (they won't error, they'll just parse things differently) Why? level 1 was buggy, level 2 is fixed..<br />
<br />
No links or anything on the DB2 optimizer.. just info that I received from Baan and DB2.. I can't find the syntax for the db_resource parameter to fix it otherwise I would post it here..<br />
<br />
If you're really researching multiple DBs, i would suggest getting a copy of the latest driver manual for each, maybe even get the SSA ERP LN ones since they're more up to date (and a good chunk of the stuff was backported..)<br />

with Baan's ftp server that's messing with all of the quick guides.<br />
