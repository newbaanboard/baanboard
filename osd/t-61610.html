<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">9th December 2011, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me start off by saying I am not a network guy, I program in Baan and perform business analysis work with the user community.  I hope I have provided enough information...<br />
<br />
In our Baan environment we have our installation in the US (Baan company XXX), but have a facility in Mexico (Baan company YYY).  The Baan server is a Windows 2008 OS.  The Mexican business unit is connected to the US through a VPN tunnel on a E1 (with DSL failover).  The Mexican business unit does have a server located in Mexico for file/print sharing and a few installs of software.  This server is also a Windows 2008 OS.<br />
<br />
It is not uncommon to have E1/DSL service briefly interrupted.  When this happens, any Baan Mexican 'in process' print job gets hung up.  We (the Baan administrative staff) do not know that service was interrupted until we start to get calls from our Mexican plant that users cannot print.  Most of the time restarting the Baan server's Print Spooler service will resolve the issue.  Occasionally we will have to delete an erroneous print job to get the 'backlog' of queues to print (this is rare).<br />
<br />
I believe that there may be a way to run a periodic scheduled task on our Mexican server which will attempt to ping the US-based Baan server status and write that to a file.  Upon its next scheduled execution, it will compare the results.  If the connection was 'down' and is now 'up' it will send commands (or execute a script on the Baan server) to restart the print spooler and notify us of the event.<br />
<br />
Have any of you dealt with this problem?  Can anyone with experience in this area share some ideas or point me into a direction that I can investigate some other alternatives?  Any assistance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had come Across similar Problem earlier .<br />
<br />
We had EDI Transfer for Inter Company - Some Times Due to VPN Fluctuations - the semaphore file used to hang the entire process .<br />
<br />
Which needed Admin to delete the semaphore from EDI Folder defined.<br />
<br />
Hence I had written a Code so that the User himself would run the session in such cases that in-turn deletes the Hung Semaphore from Server.<br />
<br />
You Could Try the same for below said commands for Windows.<br />
<br />
net stop spooler<br />
<br />
net start spooler <br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />
<br />
