<br />
for all of you who are interested, why don't we all send this e-mail to Bann daily at info@baan.nl<br />
<br />
Please spread it around to friends and collegues, a louder voice can easily be heard!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
============ Begin of e-mail ============================<br />
<br />
This is not spamming, this is a pray.<br />
<br />
IT'S A PRAY TO RELEASE AND SUPPORT THE &quot;Baan IV&quot; AND &quot;BaanERP&quot; PORTING SETS FOR LINUX.<br />
<br />
We know that it is not a technical matter: starting from one of the official UNIX releases (for example SCO/UNIXWARE) it is probably just a metter of recompiling the porting sets sources and build up a proper CD for the installation.<br />
<br />
There is a very old unofficial Baan IV porting set for Linux going around. <br />
People saw it: Its potentials and speed are great!<br />
<br />
Commercial and stable edition of Oracle, Informix and DB/2 databases are out there in the market since more than three years.<br />
<br />
It is just a commercial decision.<br />
<br />
Baan won't be probably buyed by Microsoft anymore, so what?<br />
<br />
Major and minor software and hardware players are fulling supporting, believing and investing in Liunx.<br />
<br />
Oracle, Informix, IBM, Dell, HP, SAP, just to say a few, are into the game.<br />
<br />
Baan is the only major player that it is staying at the &quot;windows&quot; loosing a lot of oppurtunities.<br />
<br />
Small, Medium and even Large enterprises are willing to save a lot of EURO in HW + SW with a powerful Linux installation on &quot;standard PC harwdare&quot; and use them to buy additional Baan licences.<br />
<br />
Come on, guys, do it! Let us see our loved Baan on our loved Linux!<br />
We won't stop to daily send this e-mail untill you will do it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

I have emailed Baan myself in the past to request Linux support, but without success. However Baan recently announced upcoming official Linux support. You can read the article here:<br />

<br />
Unfortunately the announcement for the Linux support covers only the Baan CRM and not Baan IV or Baan ERP.  <br />
