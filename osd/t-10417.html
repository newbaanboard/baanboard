Because,our local  Baan  center says that they have havent installed a Baan IV on ibm p630 RISC machines,and have same doubts about its possibility. That is why we now seek a 3rd party offices or people who has experience with ibm and Baan combination.<br />
<br />
Also they say that Baan IV is fast with Oracle 8i not Oracle 9i.is it true? and I have heard that Oracle 9i is more stable and faster that Oracle 8i.what is more our lisence is  on Oracle 9i!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently there are some problems when installing Oracle on a IBM 64 bit system, so that could be the reason of doubt of your support centre. On a 32 bit system you will not face any probs. <br />
<br />
Further more 9i performs a 15% less compared to 8i. 9i is not more stable or reliable, but has more features. As 8i will be desupported at the end of this year it is maybe smart to start with 9i directly.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
There's my truism for today.<br />
<br />
However, if your local Baan office admits to never having installed a configuration like that, I would<br />
A. Go with a group who at least think they can handle the job<br />
B. Take all my future business to that local Baan office first. That kind of honesty is a rare asset among consultants ;)<br />
<br />
As for Oracle 9i, I'll let you know in two weeks how well it works :))<br />
<br />
The performance may be less than what you can squeeze out of 8i, but the extra features make it well worth it and will allow you to get better performance out of the Oracle-Baan combination.<br />
In the end it matters not how fast your database is, but how fast it communicates with your front-end.<br />
<br />
Oh man, another one....is somebody writing this down?<br />
<br />
Like Dick says, support for 8i is running out, so you might as well take the plunge.<br />
The same is true for your version of Baan, btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have several clients that are running successfully on AIX 5.2 with Baan IV (both INformix and Oracle).  Yes, there were a few issues, but nothing too serious.  <br />
<br />
However, they are not using many third-party add-ons where 5.2 may be a bigger deal.<br />
<br />
But 5.2 is a great OS.  I love DLPARs.<br />
