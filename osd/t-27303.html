<br />
We just received this from Baan support on one of our problems:<br />
<br />
Because Oracle has desupported all versions 8i and earlier, SSA no longer develops or tests software for the desupported versions.<br />
<br />
With that being said, the fact that Oracle 8i is not listed in the release notes does not necessarily mean that the current porting set (6.1c.07.10) will not work with Oracle 8i.  It might work.  The fact that Oracle 8i is not listed does mean that the current Baan Oracle database driver has been developed for Oracle 9i and later and may not work with 8i in an optimal way (we do not know for sure, though, since the new drivers are no longer tested against Oracle 8i).<br />
<br />
The fact that Oracle 8i is not listed also means there will be no support for any problems encountered in using the latest porting set with an Oracle 8i database.<br />
 <br />
The last Baan IV porting set to offer full compatibility with Oracle 8i is 6.1c.07.05.  That porting set was released in October 2004.  Porting sets beginning with 6.1c.07.06 no longer support Oracle 8i.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone has already tested this porting set with oracle 8.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

We ran into a problem with tipgc0221m00b Process permanent transfers - when we logged the case they told us we need the current portingset to fix the issue.  The above inquiry number is where we asked (in march I think) about the latest portingset.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure about oracle 8i support. Becuase  we still have oracle support with 8i. Meanwhile we use oracle 8i.1.7 with proting set 6.1.c.06.01 .</div></div><hr />
