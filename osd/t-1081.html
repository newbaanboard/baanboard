I am trying to copy the baan master tape to another tape.  My thoughts are, why back up the systems and not have a backup of the master tape also?<br />
<br />
Anyway, is there an easier way to do this rather than (note I've only got one tape drive on each server):<br />
<br />
dd if=/dev/rmt/0mn | remsh server &quot;dd of=/dev/rmt/0mn&quot;<br />
<br />
Apparently there are tons of &quot;catalogs&quot; on this tape and I've had to re-exec this dd several times to get each chunk.<br />
<br />
Call me paranoid, but I'd really like to have a backup of my master tape.  The catch, of course, is it would need to be an accurate one!  :D <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I don't trust tape for the long run and sometimes don't have ready access to the tape drive.  Once on cd I can put it in any pc and ftp it back to the unix box.  <br />
<br />
I have had to install many times from remote locations and I find that cd is the way to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Pretend that you want to install BAAN, so run the script that reads tape and dumps everything to a specified directory<br />
- Now that you have the stuff on the disk, make all the copies you want. Remember to document a change note on the installation procedure if you have to use your own copies.<br />
<br />
OR:<br />
- Order extra master tapes from BAAN. They would charge for it, but it will spare you the hassles.</div></div><hr />
