<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wooying</div><div class="date">2nd February 2010, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I am building a new BAAN server, by no means am I am BAAN admin, but rather a sys admin.  I will build the server and pass it on to BAAN admin, I was wondering should they're be any sort of option for the OS.  I have install Windows 2003 Enterprise on the server and OS will be on RAID 1 and with 48 gig's of memory.  I have the /PAE on the boot.ini file already, should I be doing anything else to optimize the server performance.  Also I have the BAAN data itself on a SAN drive so I will attach to the server that way.  Please let me know what is the best way to setup BAAN from the server side.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Believe u have no cluster implemented. If 64bit  , no need for PAE switch .<br />
2. Allocate max memory to sql server compared to baan say 35 gb<br />
3. Create a page file  2.5 times the physical memory abt 120gb<br />
4. Keep log file and dbf on separate hard drives.<br />
5. Reserve separate space for log file and full/differential backups.<br />
6. One registry setting (search board for relevent thread) to prevent baan binary like sort.exe on console. These errors comes only in full load and not on test system.</div></div><hr />

1. Could not understand why u deploy 32bit for a new server when 64 bit  faster os capable of running 32 bit apps also is  available . Is there any particular  reason .<br />
2. Dont know any memory settings for oracle.<br />
3. Thumb rule 2 to 2.5 times physical memory ie 96 to  120 gb of  page file  is required for a transaction sensitive OLTP systems like baan. Think 48 gb of physical ram is very high . How many concurrent users u plan to use system with how many processors /cores . What is apps architecture webserver / app server / db server etc.</div></div><hr />

(A the director of IT Director does not want to take a risk, of any instability.  The Oracle DB and BAAN itself will be on 32 bit and thinks running it on a 32 bit OS should be fine.  Have this been proven yet, running Oracle and BAAN on 32 bit on a 64 bit OS?)<br />
<br />
2. Dont know any memory settings for oracle.  (I'll have to check with the BAAN Admins)<br />

(Again, I know very little of BAAN, we can have 100 concurrent license and at time we do have 100 connections at a time.  This server will be a dedicated server just for BAAN.  BAAN and Oracle will only be running on this server.  The processor of the server is Xeon E5530, 2.4Ghz, 8M Cache, Turbo, HT, 1066MHz .  Again your input is appreciate.</div></div><hr />

We run  32 bit baan on 64bit sql cluster on 64bit win2k3 cluster. No problem whatsoever . Same way u should be able to run 64 bit oracle also . Of course baan does not have any 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Further server memory  seems to be oversized for 100 users  . We have more users with 16gb  ram running since last 2 years. <br />
<br />
PS: I do experience some memory bottleneck since last couple of months due to increased work load and increased usage of some inefficient programs which we need to improve. Of course increasing memory is always an option.<br />
<br />
As recommended by Han u must get ur sizing vouched by Infor sizing team. For that u need to be precise about the modules u use , users (light /heavy) , baan architecture etc .</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is your DB version with patchset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuple9i</div><div class="date">9th February 2010, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently running BaaN V on Windows 2003 server (32 bit) with my Oracle database running on a separate 2003 server (64 bit). <br />
<br />
I went to a split environment because of performance. The BaaN Application is tuned differently than the Oracle database. The Application server has 16 Gbytes of physical RAM while the Database server has 32 Gbytes of physical RAM. My User group is over 400 users with about 1000 concurrent sessions.<br />
<br />
One of the best ways to handle memory (IMHO) is to make sure that your C:\ pagefile should be set to about 1 Gbyte and your main pagefile(s) should be on another platter group assigned to a different logical mount point. I currently have pagefiles of 64 Gbytes on 2 other logical drives with C:\ static setting of 1 Gbyte.<br />
<br />
I use the logical E:\ for my BaaN and have 2 main pagefiles on e:\ and d:\ (this drive is basically for all non-BaaN Application scripts, jobs, server maintenance, etc.).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a bit.</div></div><hr />
