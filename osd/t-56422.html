<br />
I was told by our BaaN that our version was B40_a1.   Is it the same as BaaN IVc ?   In porting set documents, the versions are never listed as B40_a1.<br />
<br />
I have found porting sets that are compatible with Oracle 10g or 11g.  Are they customers, large customers that are using BaaN IVc with Oracle 11g ?<br />
<br />
Are they any information about BaaN &amp; Oracle 11g ?<br />
<br />
Please feel free to share any information as we want to make the best decision about our next Oracle version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes there are larger organizations using BaanIV with Oracle 11G, but many have migrated to LN already.<br />
<br />
You will want to review the technical notes for Porting Set 6.1c.08 which is the first porting set that supports oracle 11G.  Also make sure your OS is supported and is up to date as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So if my version is B40_a1, does it translate to Baan IVa ?<br />
<br />
So they are large organizations using Baan with 11g.  Are they numerous ?Are you aware of the migration efforts, problems, pitfalls, etc.<br />
<br />
If proper testing is designed and executed, what would you choose between Oracle 10g and Oracle 11g ?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any information you can provide.  It is very appreciated.<br />
