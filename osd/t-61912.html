The performance of the virtual machine is good (16GB RAM, 64Bit, Win 2008R2).<br />
We have an 1GB network in the whole company.<br />
But BaaN is slow!<br />
For example:<br />
before the move the database ran on the same machine as BaaN did.<br />
In this case the daily dump neede about 8 hours.<br />
Now the dump needs 17 hours!!!<br />
I don't know why this happens.<br />
Is the anything that can be optimised on BaaN to increase the performance?<br />
<br />
<br />
Has anybody running a Oracle-DB on a virtual machine?<br />
If yes, on which system (VMware, Hyper-V, ...)?<br />
What is your experience with it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have Oracle11gR2 standalone and RAC (RAC uses mapped raw LUNs, I will check NFS solutions soon) running in VMWare VSphere5, on RedHat5.4 fine, on our case the bottleneck is the SAN (we are a major VM client).<br />
If your VM is setup in similar way as your physical host, with propper aligned disks (I think Windows does it automatically, not RH5), 10% more HW capacity and using the paravirtualized drivers (VMXNET, PVSCI), the Oracle performance should be equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">28th April 2012, 23:43</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way, the issue might not be due to the virtualization but due to the fact that you moved the database to a seperate server. There is a major difference on running queries (or other that translate into a lot of traffic between client and DB) locally or thru network. You might need to pump upp the network?<br />
<br />
On VSphere this is also very noticeable: 2 servers (one app. frontend and one DB) with vmxnet3 (that defines 10Gb interfaces), 2 same physical ESX hosts connected to 1Gb LAN. Running the servers on different ESX the traffic between then goes thru the 1Gb real network, but when on same ESX, there is no LAN traffic, all runs within the same ESX host, and here uses 10Gb: 10x faster!</div></div><hr />
