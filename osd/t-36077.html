   What are the repercussions, if any, when the baan database recovery mode is changed from Simple to  Full? By default baandb is created with the recovery mode set to &quot;Simple&quot;. <br />

I assume that you are speaking for SQL Server. It has nothing to do with BAAN cause this is an SQL-Feature.<br />
If you select full you will need additional space for the transaction-files but you you will get the option for an point-in-time recovery. (restore data for an specific date/time - in simple-mode you didn't have this feature.</div></div><hr />

However, when you create any database in SQL, the recovery mode is by default set to &quot;Full&quot;. Baandb is created at the time of installing Baan and its by default set to &quot;Simple&quot;. I am trying to understand, if there is any particular reason behind this move and if changing it later on would have an adverse effect on the working of Baan app. We all know how finicky Baan is about its various setups and how one simple change could bring it down...<br />

Hmm, usually Backup-Mode is always &quot;simple&quot; on an new installed sql-server 2000.  In version 2005 I didn't remember what's the default-setting. <br />
Probably you should read the tuning advisory-document for sql-server to understand what's behind that.</div></div><hr />

We currently use SQL2000 on our production servers and on all of them, the Recovery Mode on all databases created, after installation i.e, is set to &quot;Full&quot;. Right now only baandb(baan database) is having the recovery mode set to &quot;Simple&quot;. Is this another way of baan not approving of transaction log backup and restore? <br />
<br />
When you suggested about reading &quot;tuning advisory-document for sql-server&quot;, you meant the baan based one, right?<br />
