<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmbarr</div><div class="date">16th June 2003, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I have modifed my $BSE/lib/ora/ora_storage parameters to set initial and next sizes for table tfacp200 company 30.  I stopped Baan and started Baan again (rc.stop/rc.start).  Ran session ttaad4227m000 to create tfacp200 from a sequential dump file.  I selected 'Delete existing tables'. <br />
<br />
When table tfacp200 was created for company 30 the default initial and next extents were used  (16k for initial and 512k for next).  Entries in ora_storage are:<br />
<br />
tfacp200:030:T:group:0214:5:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE baandat INITRANS 3<br />
STORAGE(initial 53M NEXT 1M PCTINCREASE 10)<br />
<br />
How can I get this table created with an initial extent of 53M?<br />
<br />
Baan version is IVc4 SP8, Oracle 8.1.6, porting set 6.1c.06.07</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjl7666</div><div class="date">16th June 2003, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I have also seen this problem where some lines in the ora_storage are ignored.  My way around this problem was to change the default line in the ora_storage file to reflect how I want the table created and create the table and then change the default line back.  I don't believe that you have to stop and start Baan for this change to take affect.  This is not the best way to resolve your issue but since ora_storage is only read when you create tables or reconfigure it should work OK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 00:02</div></div><div class="posttext">verify that the line is the first line in the file that matches the table name. the file will be read from top to bottem and it will stop reading the file when it finds a line that matches. If you would have a line starting with *:* on the first line all tables will match and use the params on this first line.<br />
(this could sound really obvious but i have seen people making mistakes like this)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always have the line *:* last in the storage file,  but I have some lines for different companies before lines for individual tables.  Such as<br />
<br />
*:200<br />
TFGLD410:201<br />
<br />
<br />
Should I try changing the order of these lines.  Or shouldn't it matter because they are for different companies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've not seen this before - are you sure that the table was deleted from the database?<br />
<br />
I've seen sometimes in 'Delete Tables' that the session runs, but without deleting the required table - I've seen this happen when the user Company Number/Package Combination differs from the one of the table which is being deleted.<br />
<br />
So check that your environment is consistent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmbarr</div><div class="date">19th June 2003, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">My Baan user 'root' did not have the same package combination as the companies.  I changed 'root' and added the back slash when using two separate line.<br />
<br />
All seems fine now.<br />
<br />
Many thanks to all for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">11th August 2003, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having the same problem with my ora_storage file.  I was re-orging a table from the massive DATSPACE tablespace into a separated by Package tablespace.   My ora_storage states:<br />
<br />
(all on the same line)<br />
<br />
ti:786:T:group:0214:5:TABLESPACE BAAN_786_DATA_TI PCTFREE 5 INITRANS 3 STORAGE(INITIAL 40K NEXT 40K MAXEXTENTS 10000 PCTINCREASE 0)<br />
<br />
Then when I run a sql for a table with one (1) record in it, here are the results:<br />
BYTES:65536<br />
EXTENTS:1<br />
INITEXTENT:40960<br />
MAXEXTENTS:(unlimited)<br />
<br />
The bytes should equal the initial extents, right?<br />
<br />
Where else do I have to look for these changes?<br />
<br />
- I verified my baan user 'root' to have the correct package comb.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions..<br />
Thanks<br />

The basic storage structure in Oracle is the block. Our block size is 8K, but it can be set to 2K, 4K, 8K, or 16K. Records are stored at the block level. PCTFREE controls how much space in the block is reserved for future update operations. PCTUSED is the level at which the block can empty to before it goes back on the freelist for more insert operations. Contiguous blocks make up an extent which means extents are sized in multiples of your block size. I'm not sure which table you got these numbers from, but I've never seen any record lengths like that in any of our Baan tables. Oracle recommends using uniform extent sizes on tablespaces using three basic extent sizes of 128K, 4M, and 128M. Oracle recommends you set MAXEXTENTS to 1024.<br />

Also, the table that I referred to is a custom table.  Here is the whole entry in dba_segments table:<br />

When I reorg'd this table to go to the separated tablespace, it seemed like it didn't use the ora_storage parameters.</div></div><hr />
