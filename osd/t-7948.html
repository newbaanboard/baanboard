<br />
please have a look to solution 110907 on the Baan Online Support web site regarding the session_timeout mechanism.<br />
<br />
Also have you done a search on this board? There a lot of postings regarding this question.<br />

For NT I believe you'll need an application to serve this function (CloseIdle seems popular).</div></div><hr />

Works fine. The only problems we had were with older versions of the BW client. From 062 and up it works great, older version would timeout but then lock up. Upgrading the client fixed it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my NT days I remember a recommendation to reboot the whole box on a nightly basis anyway.<br />
<br />
If your build-up of hung licenses is too high in a one day period, I think you need to have a talk with your users before going out of your head installing new software.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To stop the BW sessions using the licence, when they no longer are running, we have several ways to achieve that. The simplest way seems to be to set this is as an environment variable for each user. When logging into Baan specify the following the command field of BW configuration:<br />
<br />
-- -set session_timeout=25<br />
<br />
This should release the licence if there is no user or database interface for 25 minutes. (The value specified is the number of minutes the bshell can be inactive before it terminates itself). Please donot set the time more than 25 minutes as the ds_timeout_detect is by default set for 30 minutes. The value of ds_timeout_detect has to be bigger than session_timeout. You can try less than 25 minutes for session_timeout if you wish to. <br />
<br />
This method will only work if you have a running ntbshell on the server for that user session. Only the ntbshell process can kill the license so if the bshell is killed manually you will not be able to recover the license.  In addition if the user kills (End Tasks) the Option Dialog this will kill the ntbshell.  You must instruct the users not to End Task on Baan, especially the Option Dialog.<br />
