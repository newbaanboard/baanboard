<br />
we are planning to migrate to level2 driver on our Baan B40c4/MSSQL2000.<br />
<br />
in the board, I checked thru the discussions for the past 4 years on the subject; its confusing; is level2 driver stable or not; is it good or bad; is it released or not etc.<br />
<br />
any latest information can you please update, it will help us.<br />
(we ami to go for level2 driver from a new installation to have reduced database size which is currently 140GB and for a better performance)<br />
<br />
can you also give any docs explaining the steps and pre-requisites for level2 installation of Baan.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sveiga</div><div class="date">15th July 2005, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">At Baan Support Site is available the documentation to do this proccess in B50c, and the procedure is the same for B40c (U7940B US).<br />
<br />
bdbpre -&gt; changes at tabledef6.1 and db_resource files -&gt; bdbpost<br />
<br />
Don't forget to upgrade before your Baan installlation with lastest porting-set and tools Service Pack. <br />
At the porting-set documentation you can find the previous steps to re-licensing Baan software for SQL Server Level2. <br />
<br />
Following this steps, I recomed you to go to Level2, the performance is much much better.<br />
<br />
Good luck, <br />
Sonia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">15th July 2005, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">It's very simple....<br />
<br />
set MSQL_LEVEL1 = 1<br />
bdbpre -p &lt;PACCCOMB&gt; -I&lt;LISTOFTABLES&gt; -E&lt;LOGFILE&gt; -O&lt;DUMPFILE&gt; -C&lt;COMPANY&gt;<br />
<br />
set MSQL_LEVEL1 = 0<br />
bdbpost -k &lt;PACCOMB&gt; -n -E&lt;LOGFILE&gt; -I&lt;DUMPFILE&gt; -C&lt;COMPANY&gt;<br />
<br />
repeat for each company.  Then set MSQL_LEVEL1 in the standard resource files and re-organise the tables to rebuild the reference counters.<br />
<br />
This will export and import from level 1 and import into level II. The -k option for bdbpost will delete the existing table, and re-create without the hash columns before importing.<br />
<br />
Get the list of tables by using the &quot;Count number of records&quot; session in tools.<br />
<br />
We saved 35% on our DB size! Performance for non-index queries is much better, which makes the &quot;Query by Form&quot; tool much more usable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tks for your good inputs<br />
<br />
sonia : the document number takes me to some other topic.<br />
<br />
New Server  Level 2 Driver:<br />
====================<br />
it seems, if I install a New Baan IV c4 Master CD with default Porting set 6.1c.07.03 or higher then, automatically It is a level II Installation I believe.<br />
Then I can just take the Seq.Dump from any Level 1 Server and put it on Level2 New server.<br />
<br />
So we got the CD with default latest porting set; we had problem with this CD in installing; Once we sort out I will know; <br />
<br />
Existing Server Level 1 to Level 2 Migration:<br />
=================================<br />
cole:<br />
the idea of set MSQL_LEVEL1=1 and bddpre followed by <br />
set MSSQL_LEVEL2 and bdbpost :<br />
just some questions : <br />
<br />
1)how the basic tools tables data like dba, aad, adv, txt, iex are converted.<br />
   is it going to be the same way as the application data with coy 000. <br />
BGS says they have developed Utility set to do the L1 to L2 conversion...??<br />
<br />
2)with L2 can we freely insert / delete / update from Query Analyser  <br />
<br />
dave can u pls tell me:<br />
1) what changes needs done in table def, db_resource <br />
2) why it needs re-licensing, does it mean if I convert to Level-2, then automatically it will go to demo mode; OR I need to run Patch objects after System Crash and take it to 14 days count down.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your co-operation and patience dear all.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">19th December 2005, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the minimum porting set for MS SQL2000 level2 driver is 6.1c.07.04.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavez</div><div class="date">19th December 2005, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to relicense because otherwise baan keeps creating the tables in level1 unless you install asolution that appends the option &quot;MS SQL Server level II&quot; option to session ttiex3501m000.<br />
After that you have to choose the refered option and to make it efective it must be relicensed.<br />
At this moment i donÂ´t remember what was the number of the solution that appends the option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">20th December 2005, 10:32</div></div><div class="posttext">hi<br />
<br />
we managed to install Level 2 from a baan CD with default porting set 6.1c.07.06.  (after this we got some error as Failed to connect we noticed in event viewer that too got resolved by upgrading the PS to 6.1c.07.08 and BW 079.<br />
<br />
yeah you are right; we need to apply a patch so that the Requested System Configuration is enabled with Level 2 driver check box option.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
