<br />
Recently we buy Quest Space Manager with Live Reorg, in order to make tables reorganization easier. So I already had reorganized some small tables, but a few days ago I did it with table tfacr200, because some user has complained about decrease in performance in some sessions using that table. At the begining, it takes almost 3 minutes each transactions to do, but after I made the reorganization with the Quest tool, it took foerver in doing just one transaction.... almost 4 hours... hours!!! <br />
<br />
I asked to Baan support and they told me that I must reorganize tables using Baan tools, because of some internal process that the driver do. So I reoganized the table again using Baan and the times came again to the 3 minutes rate per transaction.<br />
<br />
So the question is, has anyone had a similar experience with Quest Live Reorg? Have you ever reorganized tables with others tools than Baan?<br />
Live Reorg is a great tool, you don't have to shutdown database to manage spaces, tables and indexes, but with this issue I am now wondering if there is anything I can do to make use of this tool.<br />
<br />
Any coments or sugestions will be highly valuable.<br />

Thanks in advance.<br />
