<br />
Ran the oracle script utlpwdmg.sql that creates the default verification function for oracle 8i.  The users that were currently logged into the test system received several errors indicating record locks.  They also received these messages upon attempting to log back into the system.  Why did the running of this script effect the users in this manner?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I found several hits out there, but could not zero in on a specific reason because you did not list the error messages you were getting. MetaLink access is free to Oracle customers who have support contracts.  Just go to http://metalink.oracle.com/ and register for a userid if you haven't already.<br />

<br />
Let me present you with this:<br />
We have one oracle user and all baan users are connect to this oracle db user.   versus an oracle user for each baan user..<br />
We didn't have any password history/ expiration or complexity to this oracle user.  This script will allow it with some modifications.<br />
<br />
Do you have a similar setup?  How, or even, do you expire the oracle user password?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">19th November 2003, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Our Baan userid's each have their own Oracle userid and password. The Oracle ID is created at the same time that Baan and UNIX ID's are created. The user only knows their Baan ID and password and never their Oracle ID or it's password. The Oracle permissions are passed to each Baan / Oracle user through an Oracle role. We change the Baan passwords every 6 months, but because the Oracle password is encripted in Baan, and they don't know what it is, we don't bother with changing or expiring the Oracle password.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dsalter</div><div class="date">7th April 2006, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I have a question about the BAAN users not know their Oracle passwords and SOX compliance.  First just to let you know, I am an Oracle DBA supporting a BAAN user group and I have very little BAAN application knowledge, but we as well have one oracle user per BAAN user and now with SOX I have been requested to expire the oracle passwords every 90 days.  My question is if I expire the oracle passwords how do I update the BAAN application so the BAAN users do not notice the change?  Is there a BAAN tool that will handle this?  I would like to create a script that will allow me to change the BAAN users Oracle password and then update whatever file BAAN uses to store the Oracle password so the BAAN user does not need to know the Oracle password.  Has anyone created a script like this or know of another solution that might have the same affect?  Any responses would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
  Thanks,<br />
