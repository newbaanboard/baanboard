RDBMS providers are vary... depends on your environment and infrastructure for the IS and the IT.<br />
<br />
The URL below provide a Comparative Study on Total Cost of Administration for both DBMSs, i hope it will help you.<br />

In my opinion, Oracle beats SQL in all fields. Oracle is the Rolls Royce of the RDBMS. And quite expensive!<br />
<br />
Obviously, it is not the RDBMS for all (Not matter what Oracle says). All depends on your infrastructure and your applications.<br />
<br />
In small-middle environments, sql is a good solution. Small administration, acceptable performance and high compatibility with others ms products.<br />
<br />
But in middle-big-huge environments Oracle is better, much better I dare to say. In this kind of environments, Unix (any flavor) and Oracle, gives you an affordable administration and performance.<br />
<br />
I want to share my experience on this.<br />
<br />
For Baan, I have tasted, Informix and Oracle, due to I never have used windows for my ERP. Now I have been installed SL8 (another Infor ERP) with SQL in a two Dell boxes with 2 Intel six core processors with 16 gb of ram each one. Both of them are using MSWINDOWS 2008 enterprise server. For the database we are using MS-SQLSERVER 2008.<br />
<br />
The result: during the implementation, several crashes and poor performance between application-db server.<br />
<br />
Finally, the implementation environment (SL8, MS-WINDOWS, SQL2008) have not the same performance against my production environment (BAAN, REDHAT, ORACLE). I have to add, my Linux boxes have just 2 intel quad core processors.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

For us MS  SQL installation and usage had been very simple . There is no need/ requirement of special dedicated DBA for SQL .Configuration of other applications surrounding SQL have been very easy.</div></div><hr />
