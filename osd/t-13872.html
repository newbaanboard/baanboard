<br />
I just have a quick question regarding the &quot;Output to Console&quot; option in the menu dialog.<br />
<br />
While it seems that clicking this option kills a baan session cleanly (we have users using this on occasion without any noticable ill), I am concerned that this option isn't a good one for every situation.<br />
<br />
To that end, could anyone clue me in on just what, exactly, &quot;Output to console&quot; does.  I am particularly interested in any ramifications from the database point-of-view.  For example, suppose I were in the middle of processing financials and then click this option.  What is going to happen?  Could I be looking at data corruption?  Or is clicking this option willy-nilly really no cause for concern?<br />
<br />
Cheers all,<br />
