<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">30th April 2002, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know of a PDA version (preferably Pocket PC) of the Baan client out there. It would be handy for me to dial into users sights and the new HP Jornada that I have means I can know do it on the move, however I need some form of client software that can be used on it.<br />
<br />
Any one got any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">James</div><div class="date">30th April 2002, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know, there are no Baan Client versions for PDA's.  Having a Baan Client on a PDA would not really be feasible anyway.  The program would take up a lot of the limited space on the PDA, the network connection would be v slow for GUI, and the menu/sessions perhaps cumbersome to draw/read.<br />
<br />
If you want Baan access from your PDA, a far better option is to use a Terminal program to connect to your Baan server via Telnet, then use the Baan ASCII client ba6.1.  You'll get a better idea then of how a Baan GUI client would fair, in terms of response times - if one were ever to be available.</div></div><hr />

Another way is to have VNC running on a machine in the site and use the VNC client for pocket PC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">30th April 2002, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Good idea but as my speciality is NT systems not many running the terminal or ASCII interface. Also have used VNC before and even over a network it can be slow so would hate to think what it would be like over 9.6 speeds allowed by mobile</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nieuwsma</div><div class="date">17th May 2002, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">We are pushing both Terminal Server client and VNC http clients.  The VNC web client is the best we've found todate.  Nothing to install beyond the internet browser on the PDA.  Lean traffic, some refresh challenges though.<br />

I manage to telnet to Baan session using telnet on a DOS wireless handheld terminal<br />
The problem I face is that the screen is small on the terminal and need to use cursor to move around,not practical.<br />
Is there any software that will do a screen mapping or formatter.<br />
<br />
Another problem is that the Purchase Receipt seesion the screen size is 132 column instead of standard 80 columns.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />
