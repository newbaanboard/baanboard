<br />
We are facing this issue of logging on to Baan gui for sometime now. This is not happening though for all the users and for each user it got resolved in a different way.<br />
<br />
we are using the dns names as hostname for the login instead of IP address.<br />
As per the other posts here is what i have checked<br />
1. nsloopup for the host as well as ip works perfectly fine. no issues in this.<br />
2. login thru telnet is possible only the GUI failes.<br />
3. For some users changing the hostname to IP address worked.But this is not consistent.<br />
4. For some users, login thru VPN resolved the issue.<br />
5. For some, switching off the wireless connection on the laptopn resolved this.<br />
<br />
But now we are facign this issue with a desktop user. WE are using the B40c.96 version of BW client. we tried to install the higher version as well., but it failed. ANy lower version also did not work.<br />
<br />
The earlier posts says to use -c option with rexec, but this has been hapenning very recently and there is not change in the setup.<br />
<br />
Could it be because of some firewall? or network??<br />
<br />
Can anyone please suggest a solution to this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">7th January 2011, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the exact error message, is it something like &quot;Where are you?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please check the ip adress range of the clients ... could be a dns problem, that some ip ranges can make a look up, some higher ip ranges are not able using other dns server or method, happend once for new installed pc's (replace of old ones or new employees).<br />
<br />
We had this issue once, only solutions we found:<br />
<br />
(1) enter the client ip address and computer name in the /etc/host file of the baan server (works, but not a realy good solution)<br />
(2) use baan login instead of rexec, another advantage is that your passwords are now crypted, with rexec the passwords are uncrypted transferred over the network.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smi4975</div><div class="date">10th January 2011, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I have attached the error message too...<br />
<br />
I can understand the fact that if a new ip is introduced as in our case we have people with new laptops...and that ip is not in the range as defined in /etc/hosts then this error can occur. But we have this issue for a desktop user as well who has the machine for quite some time...<br />
<br />
is it anything to do with the windows update that firewalls the ip or something?<br />
Because the telnet front is absolutely fine...unfortunately we have restricted the Ascii access to our regular users so we cannot check if the ascii mode is working fine.<br />
any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The solution with the vpn points in the direction of ip ranges (but I am not a network expert).<br />
<br />
Have you tried to use baanlogin instead of rexec.<br />
<br />
We had suse linux enterprise server and were not able to suppress the reverse lookup (if this is the problem) with some options for the service. But that problems appears as &quot;Where are you?&quot; in the bwmessages.<br />
<br />
To try ascii interface you could simply enter the following code in the /&lt;home&gt;/user/.profile:<br />
<br />
ba6.1 mtccom00000000  (this should work but I have no system now).<br />
<br />
The next time you login with e.g. putty the ascii interface will start (if you have not totaly blocked it for the users).<br />
<br />

there is another thread in the board: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=53750<br />
Maybe it helps.<br />
*******************<br />
Another Thread:<br />
&quot;Problem was that in DNS cache there were two records for one IP address. The server can handle only one to one situation.<br />
Accepted Solution&quot;.<br />
I think you can check this if the next error occurs, what are the dns entries for this specific client.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">28th February 2011, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">we also had this in the past when DNS had problems. Mainly with laptop users. On HP-UX you can disable the reverse name lookup with the -c option in /etc/services I believe. Maybe a similar option exists in your linux flavor.<br />
<br />
Other solution is to have DNS records flushed more regularly. I believe the default is 7 days in standard microsoft DNS. We have now set this to 1 day so laptop users that travel are not so much affected.<br />
If a client still has the issue you can also run the register DNS on the laptop so it updates on the fly.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
