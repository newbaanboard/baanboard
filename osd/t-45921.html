<br />
We are planning to set a new server installation and we still have not decided which Oracle/Aix versions will we use.<br />
<br />
It's been decided to use Baan IV c4 SP 23. <br />
<br />
Which Porting Set/Oracle release/Aix version could be the best option?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">18th December 2007, 02:09</div></div><div class="posttext">First - find out which porting set is required for SP23.<br />
<br />
In the porting set release notes it will say what platform is supported.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest going to the latest that is supported. (so 10gR2 for Oracle)<br />
And AIX 5.2 (or 5.3? now) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fugazi</div><div class="date">18th December 2007, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks Dave, the problem is that we don't have access to the Infor Support so i can't check the porting set required for SP23.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">18th December 2007, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't have access to baan support then<br />
<br />
1) how are you obtaining the SP23 patches?<br />
2) how do you expect to get a porting set to allow you to run on SP23?<br />
3) how will you get licensed for your new machine?<br />
<br />
Unless Infor has changed policies (which they may have) it's not easy to license a new machine for baan w/o baan support.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We don't have support contracted right now but we will in a later stage (when the project begins). In the meantime i'm trying to advance some work....<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">19th December 2007, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, i'm not sure what the current SP for baan 4 is (if it's 23 then great)<br />
but for the latest Baan 4 porting set (6.1c.07.16) they support AIX 5.2, 5.3<br />
Oracle 10gR1 and 10gR2<br />
<br />
So go with 5.3/10gR2 if SP23 isn't a horribly old service pack.<br />
<br />
<br />
