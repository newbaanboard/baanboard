we are having a problem with baan performance. diferent sessions hangs and the performance of baan system is very poor. the oracle server procesor is 0% and with the debugger we see the execution stopped on select statements. if you make the same query in sql-plus, the processor activity increase and the query is executed in sql, but in baan the execution of the session stays stucked at the select. <br />
the oracle statistics are good, and oracle people has looked at the system with no result. our porting set is 6.01.07.03.<br />
db_resource:<br />
<br />
#dbsinit:01<br />
dbsinit:021<br />
ora_column_format:7<br />
ora_init:0101000<br />
rds_full:2<br />
ora_max_array_fetch:2<br />
ora_max_array_insert:2<br />
lock_retry:0<br />
<br />
when the processes number decreases the system start to respond normally. we might be reaching some kind of limitation but we don't know wich one. as an example: the sales integration to finance goes like that: first n invoices takes 20-30 minutes per invoice to be integrated, from a moment on the system respond and the rest n invoices are done 10 per minute or so.<br />
<br />
any idea about the way of investigate this?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's session related:<br />
1. use TT_SQL_TRACE=0200 to find the slow query (or use ORAPROF=1.0 )<br />
2. use SQL_TRACE=true and tkprof to find the slow query from the oracle side.<br />
<br />
There is a solution avaliable which describes important oracle settings. Are you aware of that solution?<br />

we were having a look to baan solution nr 166049 and we changed db_resource parameters but it was worse (we had ora_max_array_insert:2 and we changed 1 and we put baan_oracle_prefetch:2) we didn't try hidden oracle parameters, that's next test.<br />
we have recently growed  a lot in company numbers, so it seems that we have something to enlarge but memory, space, everything seems to be much more than enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you may be hitting some high end limitations as far as # of objects in the DB if you've &quot;increased the # of companies&quot; significantly. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that each Company brings with it ~2200 tables and each table has at least 1 index and possibly more. <br />
<br />
Oracle 7 doesn't work well with large numbers of objects in your system. If you've got 10k objects then oracle will show a marked degradation in performance.<br />
<br />
You could try to<br />
<br />
1. Split your companies across multiple databases<br />
2. Upgrade to 10g (still not great,  but you can have more objects)<br />
<br />
<br />
You should also check your oracle alert logs and trace files as well as do some DB monitoring for Locking issues, etc.<br />

My profile was not updated, (it is ok now) we use oracle 9 and windows 2003 server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True every new company creates about 2500+ tables . We found a way to this by sharing logical tables for all modules  like tp , tr , ts etc which we dont use . And then new tables created for us  are hardly 400 (lot of which are customized .) <br />
<br />
So u too can do this . Delete all the tables of newly created companies  after taking appropriate backups . Share tables in ttaad4120m000 , convert to runtime , restart baan and create tables again for those companies . This will reduce the substantial overhead from shared memory and baan logic service will be able to respond very fast giving very much better throughput .<br />
<br />
PS - If u dont know which tables to share better consult ur functional expert before doing so .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">merian</div><div class="date">12th November 2008, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">we have changed ora_storage parameter (..\baan\lib\ora\ora_storage)<br />
it was:<br />
*:*:T:group:0214:MSGSIZE:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE BAANDB INITRANS 3 <br />
*:*:I:group:014:MSGSIZE:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE BAANIDX INITRANS 3 <br />
<br />
now it is :<br />
*:*:T:group:0214:MSGSIZE:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE BAANDB INITRANS 3 <br />
*:*:I:group:0214:MSGSIZE:PCTFREE 5 TABLESPACE BAANIDX INITRANS 3 <br />
<br />
and the performance improved significantly.</div></div><hr />
