Over the past couple months (starting around 3rd week of January) I've had an issue where slowly more and more users are experiencing a constant java.lang.NullPointerException error while using LN via the Ming.le/web interface. It happens after a user has about 5-10 minutes of inactivity. After the period of inactivity if a user clicks on anything the error message pops up. They have to restart their bshell to get connected again. I've had a ticket open with Infor, but I'm not having much luck.<br />
<br />
Java installs haven't changed since 2014. Tomcat install hasn't changed. No major patching has been done since late 2019. User timeouts are set at 60 minutes in defaults/all. Tomcat timeouts are all at default values.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what's causing it. Infor's only recommendation so far has been to just update the system. We're currently trying to migrate to LN 10.7 so there's a lot of internal reluctance to make any major changes. That migration is at least 6 months away, though. We're also absolutely slammed with work so we can't afford any potential downtime. <br />
<br />
I've poured through Infor documentation and KB articles. Often times those relate only to specific sessions or activities within LN causing the java.lang.NullPointerException. In our case it seems to happen for anything after that period of inactivity.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else been experiencing any issues like this with any instances of LN? Potential causes? Just tossing out a feeler and hoping someone can provide some insight.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
