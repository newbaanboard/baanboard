We are looking for Itanium 2 technology, but my question is: what is better for Baan IVc4 with Oracle 9.2 and HP-UX, single core or dual core processors?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your answers.</div></div><hr />

Anybody out there?</div></div><hr />

Unless software is specifically designed to use dual-core, the benefits are marginal. Since both Baan IV and ORacle 9 predate this technique, I think it is safe to predict that there will be no positive effect from using dc.</div></div><hr />

This is not completely correct. If you run single user, this is correct. When running multi user or with parallel processing, you make advantage of the dual core. So I think for OLTP work, a dual core definitly makes sense!<br />

It was my understanding that multi-cores needed to be addressed differently then multi-processors but this is apparently not true. <br />
<br />
So if a dc system is effectively a dual processor box and you are running a single-tiered environment, then Oracle 9i (your biggest resource consumer) will benefit from the second core (if properly configured of course).<br />

Baan's VMs are notoriously single-threaded and so are the database drivers, so you still shouldn't expect miracles.</div></div><hr />

Even if they are single threaded, each users starts their own processes and, it's the OS that spreads them thru the available CPUs/cores (in a UNIX env. at least), so you do get improvements by using multi-cores or multi-CPUs (HT is not exactly a multi-core and thus does not fall exactly under this).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agrre for the most of it, but even dual core is not the same as dual processor. Not everything is implemented twice. It all depends on vendor and version, some parts are shared between the cores.<br />
