<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">P-Matt</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone help to explain how I can have my baan clients authenticate via our newly implemented Active Directory, using their new AD usernames?  The problem I have is that the standard for username is first.last, which makes the login name too large for baan to utilize.<br />
<br />
I've been told that perhaps defining a custom attribute will work, but, not being at all familiar with AD, I do not know how to do this.<br />
<br />
I have created a new user in my AD users container that has only 8 character username, and can login fine this way.  However, the &quot;powers that be&quot; do not want me to do this, yet are not forthcoming with alternate solutions.<br />
<br />
We are running BaaN IVc2, on an NT 4.0 application server, which authenticates to a Domain Controller running W2k.<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer ideas and or solutions for me?<br />
<br />
My appreciation in advance.<br />
