<br />
Can we install and run Baan4c4 on a database with unicode enabled ? I am trying to use the database for storing multiple language data, and running two different instance of Baan from the same. The languages are Chinese &amp; Japanese.<br />
<br />
Is that possible ?<br />
<br />
Regards. :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you can create 2 instances each in their own language.</div></div><hr />

Unicode contain both character sets so the db (oracle) should be able to support both type of data ?</div></div><hr />

I think you can probably use Unicode as your backend DB for Baan 4.. but <br />
I doubt that baan would help you if you ran into trouble with it.<br />

Thank you for the information. I tried it with Baan4, it did not work. Let me try it with LN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">1st December 2005, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Dave and I had an offline discussion and I have to confess that I didn't mention the whole truth: It is possible to use Unicode with Baan IV.<br />
<br />
But (and that was the reason did not want to point to this route) for Japanese and Chinese it should be 2 different databases (or instances) as you have to remember that Baan IV will not use the database Unicode pages exactly one on one as it should be. Actually the Baan database driver will make a conversion to a own subset of characters (TSS).<br />
<br />
So, it is possible, but never mix languages. That is currently only possible in ERP LN FP2. <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

For example the customer adress might be defined in oracle as CHAR(30). If you have german or swedish characters in the adress and you try to store that in a unicode database it could be that the resulting adress will need more than 30 (because some characters will use two bytes in unicode while this is never the case in a single byte character set).</div></div><hr />

Sorry Dave, but this is not the complete truth. At the moment ERP LN FP2 only supports Unicode on AIX and Oracle. Some other operating systems will follow quite soon, but for other databases we will have to wait longer.</div></div><hr />
