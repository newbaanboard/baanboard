<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">6th January 2006, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The following is a quote from Baan Solution 131609 regarding upgrade of MS SQL Server 2000 from Level 1 to Level 2 Baan database driver.  Does anyone know what the tool is that SSA Global are offering (or better still has anyone got something like it)?  Many thanks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Migrating a system to Level II takes a great deal of time if the database is large and using the traditional Baan Tools method of bdbpre/bdbpost.  In this scenario, each and every table would need to be dropped and recreated without the hash columns, the indexes rebuilt and each and every reference counter recalculated to ensure data integrity.  Unless there is a significant window of opportunity for the system to be down this is not a viable option with a large database.  Fortunately, SSA Global has come up with a methodology to expedite the conversion of data and avoid some of the steps involved with bdbpre/bdbpost.  <br />
<br />
 We have already converted several customer systems in a weekend (starting Friday) via this method and they are successfully running with this configuration today.  We are seeing throughput rates on the conversion of the tables of nearly 4 Gig an hour.  This is 2 to 3 times faster than data loads with bdbpre and bdbpost, not to mention the time it takes to repair the reference counters. &quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_user</div><div class="date">20th April 2006, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a utility which comes free with the Baan V installation CD's.  You can do this yourself, export all the data and tools tables. Then make changes to tbledef6.1 (Refer to documents on setting for LEVEL 2 driver available from Baan) :<br />
<br />
ppmmm999:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=0, MSQL_SERVERHOST=.):Y<br />
for example :<br />
tpptc000:*:msql7(MSQL_LEVEL1=0, MSQL_SERVERHOST=.):Y<br />
<br />
<br />
After doing this import tools data back and make sure everything is working.<br />
<br />
Then import all other baan data back, and you have migrated from LEVEL1 driver to LEVEL2 driver.</div></div><hr />
