<br />
A level N incremental backup backs up blocks that have changed since the <br />
most recent incremental backup at level N or less. <br />
<br />
9.1. Level 0 - the basis of the incremental backup strategy <br />
<br />
    RMAN&gt; run { <br />
    2&gt; allocate channel dev1 type disk; <br />
    3&gt; backup <br />
    4&gt; incremental level 0 <br />
    5&gt; filesperset 4 <br />
    6&gt; format '/oracle/backups/sunday_level0_%t' <br />
    7&gt; (database); <br />
    8&gt; release channel dev1; <br />
    9&gt; } <br />
<br />
Line# <br />
4: Level 0 backup - backups of level &gt; 0 can be applied to this <br />
5: Specifies maximum files in the backupset <br />
<br />
A list of the database backupsets will show the above backup. The 'type' <br />
column is marked 'Incremental'; the 'LV' column shows '0'. <br />
<br />
9.2. Example backup strategy using incremental backups <br />
<br />
A typical incremental backup cycle would be as follows: <br />
<br />
    - Sun night - level 0 backup performed <br />
    - Mon night - level 2 backup performed <br />
    - Tue night - level 2 backup performed <br />
    - Wed night - level 2 backup performed <br />
    - Thu night - level 1 backup performed <br />
    - Fri night - level 2 backup performed <br />
    - Sat night - level 2 backup performed <br />
<br />
If the database suffered a failure on Sat morning and this resulted in <br />
a restore operation, RMAN could recover to the point of failure by <br />
restoring the backups from Sunday, Thursday, and Friday. This is <br />
because Thursdays level 1 backup contains all changes since Sunday, and <br />
Friday's level 2 backup contains all changes since Thursday. Whether <br />
the database could be completely recovered would depend on whether <br />
archive logging is enabled. <br />
  <br />
<br />
10. Cumulative incremental backups <br />
<br />
A cumulative incremental backup backs up all blocks that have changed since <br />
the the most recent incremental backup at level N-1 or less (contrast with <br />
non-cumulative incremental backups that backup blocks that have changed <br />
since the the most recent incremental backup at level N or less). This <br />
means that more work is done in performing the backup (duplication of <br />
backup effort), but time may be saved when restoring (potentially fewer <br />
backupsets to restore).</div></div><hr />
