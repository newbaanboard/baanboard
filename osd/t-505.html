For example, if IP cannot be started on the primary NIC, then the license becomes invalid because Win2000 will not report the MAC address back to the license server.  The MAC address is part of the branding of the server, so if the cable is unplugged, you cannot start Baan.  <br />
<br />
There is a registry setting that can be changed to fix this, but I was wondering what other problems people have had running Baan on Windows 2000.<br />

<br />
As far as I know Baan uses the MAC address of the primary NIC as single point of ID for the license server on NT whereas this would be the CPU-ID on a UNIX system. However I thought the only requirement in the case of NT was to have the NIC present in the system but not necessarily hooked up to the network.<br />
<br />
Do you get anything when doing an arp -a?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">30th November 2001, 00:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Win2000 is very different.  Take a look at Baan solution #113902:<br />
<br />
<br />
VERSION(S):<br />
BaanIVc, BaanERP (all versions supported for Windows2000)<br />
THIS SOLUTION IS ONLY APPLICABLE FOR WINDOWS 2000 platforms !!!<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
Baan Licensing service (licd.exe, licderp.exe)<br />
<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
As soon as the network cable is unplugged, it is not possible anymore to start the Baan Licensing service.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Because of the Media Sense feature of Windows 2000 TCP/IP will invalidate the parameters associated with the network which has been connected. The IP address(es) will no longer allow sends, and any routes associated with the interface are invalidated. <br />
For more information about this Media Sense feature we refer to the internet side of Microsoft, eg.:<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/win2000/win2ksrv/technote/tcpipimp.asp<br />
<br />
Because the TCP/IP parameters are invalidated the mac address of the network adapter cannot be retreived anymore by the Licensing service of Baan. This mac address is used as a unique reference.<br />
<br />
Therefor the Baan Licensing service will not start anymore.<br />
<br />
To eliminate this problem disable the Media Sense feature as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Start regedit.exe<br />
2. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters <br />
3. Add DisableDHCPMediaSense as a new DWORD Value. The value of DisableDHCPMediaSense has to be 1 (TRUE).<br />
4. Reboot the computer to make this modification active.<br />
<br />

<br />
That is a bugger, too much Plug and Play I guess. Although I do like  the autosensing feature of W2k as I am constantly rebooting my old laptop to-reactivate my NIC on NT!</div></div><hr />
