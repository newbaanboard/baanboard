<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fdhfdh</div><div class="date">12th March 2004, 12:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to connect to two informix database within a single informix instance, but cannot get baan / informix configured correctly to do so.<br />
<br />
Operating system: HP-UX 11<br />
Informix: 9.2<br />
Baan: IVc3<br />
<br />
Informix databases within the single instance:<br />
<br />
1)	baan	Co 000 &amp; live company<br />
2)	arcdb	Archive company<br />
<br />
I can log into live company OK.<br />
I cannot switch into archive company though - table not found.<br />
<br />
I have set up a new group entry in inf_groups for arcdb, and have a user entry in inf_users that is assigned to this group.<br />
This user cannot start baan properly, as it connects to database arcdb, and cannot access the company 000 tables.<br />
<br />
The tables for the archive comapny are assigned to a different database defintion, and a new informix process is started when you attempt to access a table in the archive company.<br />
<br />
I beleive I need to force baan to use a database name of arcdb when attempting to access the tables for the archive company, but I don't know how to do this.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could have entries like;<br />
<br />
*:999:group:01:30:INITIAL 16 NEXT 16 LOCK row CLUSTERED dbspace arcdb<br />
*:999:I::01::dbspace arcdb<br />
*:*:group:01:30:INITIAL 16 NEXT 16 LOCK row CLUSTERED dbspace baan<br />
*:999:I::01::dbspace baan<br />
<br />
<br />
This will assign all tables in Company 999 (you'll need to change this to your archive company number) and all indexes, to the arcdb DB space. All other companies and tables (including index spaces) will be assigned to the baan DB space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fdhfdh</div><div class="date">19th March 2004, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">It is at the database level I want to do the selection.  The instance has two databases set-up:<br />
<br />
baan - many dbspaces for tables, indexes, etc.<br />
arcdb - dbspace arcdatdbs only.<br />
<br />
Just modifing inf_storage isn't sufficient - as I need the BaaN application to select the database arcdb for a single company only.  BaaN uses a informix role to sign into the database, the normal one is baanr.  I want to force it to use a role arcdbr for the my archive database.<br />
<br />
Hope this explains things a bit better.<br />
<br />
My local baan support has told me it isn't possible, but that isn't going to stop my trying ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have more than one informix instance or just a single one?<br />

<br />
We have an archive instance, it is not in the same instance as current data.<br />
<br />
Our main goal for separate instances was disaster recovery.<br />
<br />
We also have company '000' tables in tbase.  (fighting to change this..)<br />
<br />
As I was looking into more of how our archive db is setup, <br />
I came up with this question:<br />
--Where do you tell Baan the name of the database? (not the instance)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fdhfdh</div><div class="date">25th March 2004, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan selects the database from the group on the user in inf_users.  The group has to exist in inf_groups.  The groups maps to a role in informix with the same name as the group, but with an 'r' on the end.<br />
<br />
E.g.<br />
<br />
group      role<br />
-------      --------<br />
baan       baanr<br />
arcdb      arcdbr<br />
<br />
Beware of needing to get to Co 000 tables if these are in informix in the future.</div></div><hr />
