	I wanted know if anyone has done this before. I am currently in the process of upgrading portingset. I have successfully upgraded the portingset on our development server from 6.1c.03.01 to 6.1c.07.03 and now getting ready to do the same on production. Before I actually do it on production I would like to make our development server same as production server and do a trial upgrade to make sure everything works fine. Given the fact that I will have only a weekend to do the upgrade on production server, I want to make sure I follow the proper steps. <br />
<br />
	So, my question is, in order to make the development server same as production, what files/folders needs to be copied from production server to development server. I know that we donÂ’t have to copy $BSE/application folder but is it ok to just to copy all other folders/files under $BSE? Will that make the development server same as production server? Also, other folders/files I can think of not to overwrite  are $BSE/lib/user, $BSE/lib/tabledef6.1, $BSE/lib/ora/ora_users. Are there any other files that need to be kept as is?<br />
<br />
	Please let me know your thoughts.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help,<br />

<br />
Are both systems at the same patch level, both for tools and application ? If not, don't. If they are, things to remember (all in $BSE/lib)<br />
compnr6.1<br />
shm_param<br />
fd*<br />
auditdef6.1<br />
srdd_tab6.1<br />
datecurr<br />
<br />
besides the ones you already mentioned. I'm pretty sure the list is incomplete.<br />
