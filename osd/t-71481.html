<br />
I have question, we have four app servers and all are setup with shared $BSE. We have a situation now, we wanted to implement password change and when the user is changing the password, it is getting changed in only one server in Linux, due to certain restrictions we are not able to use ssh and change the password across all servers, could someone give my any idea how I can do this with Baan built-in functionalities PWDCHANGE,PWDAGING. Or is there any best way to change the password across all servers.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we use SSO.<br />
If the user changes his Domain PW, the PW on all SLES11 (BIV,LN) changes, too.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's working at RHEL.<br />

<br />
You either setup central authentication (ldap, nis). NIS/NIS+ is an option, but they're kind of challenge to setup and going while centralized (LDAP/Kerberos/SMB/etc.) authentication is a much much better idea.<br />
<br />
You setup a configuration management system (puppet,chef,cfengine, shell script) to automatically create accounts, and configure the environment on all your managed systems.<br />
<br />
Central authentication systems are good when all the systems are all under the control of the same organization. It tends to be necessary when you have lots of users, and when will need to use the authentication for many things behind just logging in.<br />
<br />
The configuration management way is good if you generally just need to setup a small number of remote admin accounts, and service accounts.<br />
<br />
Also, refer to - Password Synchronization on UNIX and Linux (https://docops.ca.com/ca-identity-manager/12-6-5/EN/administrating/password-management/synchronizing-passwords-on-endpoints/password-synchronization-on-unix-and-linux)<br />
<br />
MANAGING PASSWORD SYNCHRONIZATION (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/pass-sync)<br />
<br />
A Unix/Linux specialist Administrator would be a better person to answer and implement than a pure Baan/LN Administrator.</div></div><hr />
