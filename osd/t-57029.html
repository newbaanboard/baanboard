<br />
Apologies if this is in the wrong place/forum , but here is my issue.<br />
The company I have just started with have changed their ERP system from Baan IV to something else. (18months ago)<br />
<br />
I'm due to receive the baan table data on hard drive. I have to build a querying tool so that people can search for old data.<br />
<br />
I wasn't involved in the decommision of the old baan system and there is no documentation here for it either.<br />
<br />
I'm ultimately looking for a list of tables, what they pertain to , ie sales orders, header and lines, Purchase orders etc and possibly the fields in each table.<br />
<br />
Does someone out there have a spreadsheet or text file with this table structure information on ?<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
David</div></div><hr />

you can print the table definition on the tools section, it contains all the table information of the baan.<br />
<br />
i hope it can help you^^</div></div><hr />

I assume this is from the Baan system itself, which we don't actually have.<br />
All we have is just the data stored in a large number of text files.<br />
I guess 1 text file for each table. The table names wont mean anything to me , hence my post about the structure and what each table name means/stores</div></div><hr />

In that case u have no alternative but to identify the tables u actually require (e.g. tfgld106 / 201 / 008 for finance related data) and create ur own file parsers to  read , understand and present the same in human readable format .<br />
<br />
If the dump is delimited by pipe , then u can open the table in excel  (if permitted for ur version) and sit with a user familiar  who can probably tell u what fields  means what .</div></div><hr />
