<br />
<br />
i have a question that bothers me after some of the time playing with LN.<br />
<br />
is it possible to upgrade the OS of the server without giving any damage to the LN itself?say, for example, i have a windows server 2003 standard edition and i want to upgrade it for enterprise edition, the reason for this is the memory limit of the 32 bit standard edition.<br />
<br />
the windows site said that there's 80% that the upgrade will succeeded, but i don't think they count the ERP too.<br />
<br />
any of you guys/girls tried the upgrade?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
To my opinion it must be possible. However be aware of some facts:<br />
<br />
- You might have to upgrade your portingset also, check Infor's support site<br />
   to find out which portingset is needed for your upgraded O.S.<br />
- Upgrading the portingset may cause some solutions to install your Baan <br />
   environment also. This is normally mentioned in the release notes of the<br />
   portingset involved.<br />
- First try this on a simular test-enviroment, you could mark this action as a<br />
  major change, therefore you need to be sure that you don't have to expect<br />
  showstoppers before you perform this change on your Baan production   environment<br />
<br />
Never gamble with your production machine!<br />
<br />
Good luck <br />

<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response,<br />
<br />
i'll try to fully backup all the data and environment first then, the problem is some of the client that has this problem doesn't have any test server which give us another problem.<br />
<br />
oh, and i also ask INFOR for this problem also, because i need confirmation from them.<br />
<br />
this is the answer:<br />
<br />
Roy,<br />
<br />
We had upgraded several test servers from Windows Server Standard edition to Enterprise Edition ( as required by MyDay), and we had not encoutered any problem.<br />
<br />
The only things we can think of the problem is networking.  If the system is heavily networked, and those information are stored in the Windows registry.Such registry information will not carried from Standard Edition to Enterprise Editition.<br />
LN is just an application sitting on top of the OS layer.  I t should be intereedred by change of the underneath OS.<br />
<br />
I suggested that you do a complete backup of LN before you carry out the upgrade of OS. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">10th November 2009, 03:42</div></div><div class="posttext">that why when my server reinstall beginning of the year from NT 4.<br />
<br />
i choose to use Windows 2003 Standard 64 bit as it can support max 8GB.<br />
<br />
as for OS upgrade within the same family like 32bit, by right it should have no problem.<br />
<br />
still a full system backup are recommended.<br />
<br />
Infor support will not advise, if there any problem later you may need to engage the professional services.<br />
<br />
unless u have hard evidence that infor will support you if you encounter problem after upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
i don't think the support will do anything if something goes wrong( not trying to badmouth here).<br />
<br />
but of course, i'll do the backup first before doing anything.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
