<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">23rd October 2008, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">We have still a Oracle 8i with our Baan 5c. So far we have a &quot;nicely running System&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now our Oracle is not supported anymore. But what are the benefits of a supported Oracle, if you have no contract with Oracle? <br />
<br />
Let's say, if you have just a contract with Baan: <br />
- How does Oracle support you in case of a supported version vs. a not supported version?<br />
- How does Baan support you with database questions?<br />
<br />
If everything runs fine and you upgrade your database, for sure you will have to solve a lot of problems. Is it worth to do that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So - let's assume you need a patch from Infor for MRP. They give you the latest, But it requires a new ottstprepdll, you go to apply that, but you need a more recent tools standards to make that work. <br />
<br />
Tools standards are porting set dependent. <br />
<br />
You can't move to the latest porting set because that porting set doesn't work with Oracle 8i because baan's made a change to the ora8_srv6.1 to make it work with 11g.<br />
<br />
So now you can't apply the patch because of a seemingly unrelated issue.<br />

<br />
I see. Interesting for me, that Baan also doesn't support this oracle version anymore.<br />
<br />
OK, we will see what to do.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">24th October 2008, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, baan ties their support to the DB vendors. So once a vendor doesn't support it, they stop.<br />
<br />
(it usually still works, but they don't guarantee it anymore...)<br />
