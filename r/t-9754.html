I had a project by a shipbuilder in north-east-germany. We used the big projects and a little bit manufacturing and warehousing. i think it's very interesting to discuss how the different projects were realized.<br />
Let's start something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rrankinmba</div><div class="date">9th September 2004, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be interested to hear more about using Baan in the shipbuilding industry.  While working in a variety of capacities in naval shipbuilding I was involved in the creation of our inhouse MRP program.  Since leaving them seven years ago and getting into Baan I've often wondered how well Baan would stand up to the rigors of shipbuilding planning.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gbnbabu</div><div class="date">10th September 2004, 13:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan provides basic planning methodology... If actual activity based planning &amp; controls are to be in place, customized solutions/ interfaces to Core Project Planning softwares (like primavera) will help. My experiences of implementation at one of the ship building industries in India, the above methodology is working as per the client's expectations. Platform-BaanIVc4 and Interface developed (bi-directional) from-to  Baan and Primavera.</div></div><hr />
