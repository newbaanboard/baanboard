<br />
This is basically a file handling utility developed using BaaN Tools , which makes all common file operations easy through an easy to use Graphical User Interface .<br />
Though only few operations are included in the utility , you may add some more functionality to the existing one . Possible that there might be few bugs but its working perfectly on NT environment . Slight modification can be made for it to work on Unix or possible can make it platform independent .<br />
<br />
Features included at present are :<br />
<br />
1) Color Indicator to show the file exists or not on entering the filepath<br />
2) Open Remote/local file with your desired application<br />
3) copy option - client2server , server2client etc<br />
4) Delete a remote/local file</div></div><hr />

<br />
A file browser on the Server, which you can zoom and pick a file and then pick any device to view the file.<br />
<br />
A Baan FTP tool.<br />
<br />
PS - I'm not posting the code</div></div><hr />

Hi Mr. Rao ,<br />
<br />
Your File browser looks really cool ,<br />
Can you give an idea how you programmed it , Is it done entirely with BaaN Tools or other open technologies are involved ?<br />
<br />
But really its cool .<br />
<br />

The source code is included but I have not test it yet. One more thing the site is in Russian, so you might want to translate it using Google:<br />

Refer to the thread - File Browser (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=1844&amp;highlight=select.file) for more info on the function select.file()</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will go through the thread .<br />
<br />
For local file selection though , in LN 6.1 , there is a very good function<br />
<br />
<br />
function extern long seq.open.dialog.local(<br />
	 boolean mselect,<br />
	 const string defaultname(),<br />
	 const string directory(),<br />
	 const string filter(),<br />
	 ref string filename() )<br />
<br />
Descr	: Show the Windows file-open dialog to allow the user to select one or more files.<br />
<br />
<br />

Niraj</div></div><hr />
