We are looking at Infor 10/LN. Is it true that LN application was completely re-written and is not an evolution from he previous versions?  In 5.2a, which really is a pre-curser to LN, the old code has been heavily modified to encompass ennchanced functionality.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know, even in rough approx numbers,  the breakdown of sites using, say Baan4 to 5 and LN? Is LN now the dominant Infor ERP product being installed? My feelings are that 4cx is still widely used<br />
<br />
Ion seem have done  grand job of enhancing the user experiance of Infor LN. Taking that away, how good in LN as a core product, compared to say SAP R3 or any of the other big players ?<br />

sea my comment below.<br />
 - Is it true that LN application was completely re-written and is not an evolution from he previous versions? <br />
No, Infor LN is further development of Baan 5.2. And LN functianality extend Baan 5. Infor has some special migration toolset for support migration for Baan4 and Baan5 customers. We have experience with this toolset - it is very good.<br />
<br />
- Does anyone know, even in rough approx numbers, the breakdown of sites using, say Baan4 to 5 and LN? <br />
I think, that more than 1000... If you are interest, I can connect you with Infor managers. Only in Russia we migrateed 50% of Baan4 customers. <br />
Is LN now the dominant Infor ERP product being installed? Yes. Many companies migrated from Baan4 to LN.<br />
<br />
-Ion seem have done grand job of enhancing the user experiance of Infor LN. Taking that away, how good in LN as a core product, compared to say SAP R3 or any of the other big players ?<br />
If you are from discret manufacturing industry (Auto, A&amp;D, IE&amp;M, HTE, ets.) LN is a better solution for you now. Also as a core product.<br />
