If it is just static data (Customers and Suppliers to Business Partners in V and Items to Items, etc. ) it probably won't be all that bad. <br />
<br />
We are just on the other side of the migration (first month) and we required A LOT of data to come over - both static and historical. That was very difficult because it required a lot of mapping tables to tables and we used IBM Global Services because they had a migration tool that worked (unlike Baan). It took a lot of tweaking, but it is probably even easier now after it went through our company's requirements.</div></div><hr />

We wanted to migrate Baan4 to Baan5 with one year old data.<br />
This data consists of 1.Master data  2. transactions data 3. History data(1 year)  and 4. Financial data for 2 years.<br />
No of Baan concurrent users in our Baan environment are 100 and Baan named users are 150.<br />
We have implemented 1.Manufacturing 2. Distribution 3.Finance<br />
4. Service  <br />
<br />
Can you please tell me how long this migration procedure will take and what is the procedure we need to follow to complete this migration.<br />
<br />
Do you have any Baan migration document to do this.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your response.</div></div><hr />

Right - The #2 above is the biggest issue you will need to deal with. Since the warehousing aspect of Vc is so new and you are used to IV sales orders and purchase orders, the mapping of transactional history is going to be the key. Finance shouldn't be too bad. Sales history and service history will be very tough. <br />
<br />
We had 4 years of history - if you only have 1 year or 2, you might just want to start fresh in V. I cannot hope to tell you how long it would take since resources and expertise are key.</div></div><hr />

Here is the answer I got from Baan migrations in the Netherlands,<br />
they also told me that it takes an experienced consultant approximately 15 days to testmigrate a part of the data they also have a tool but as you can read they never distribute this alone.<br />
<br />
When you want to have your data succesfully migrated I think I only can recommend you to use an experienced consultant.<br />
<br />

Next information is available:<br />
<br />
First of all, Baan offers migration solutions and not a migration product or tooling. The software part of our migration solution Baan IV to Baan 5.0c is free of charge for customers who pay their maintenance/innovation fee. The software part of our migration solution will never be distributed alone to<br />
customer or partners, only the complete migration solution (software + services). <br />
<br />
Means the Migration Competency Center (MCC) from Baan will be acting as a sub-contractor of local Baan parties to perform the data conversion process.<br />
 <br />
A complete migration project is split up into two different parts, first part (75% of a migration project) is business consultancy , functional and technical consulting including education, complete responsibility of local Baan party. The other part is data conversion (25% of a migration project) and can be done by Baan MCC. <br />
<br />
You can read more in the attached document 'Powerful MCC Solutions' where you can check the Q&amp;A (Questions and Answer) part.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juancarlos</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard nothing but horror stories about Baan trying to help you migrate from IV to V. <br />
<br />
Good luck, but the Baan Migration 'Tool' was off and on the market SEVERAL times because of flaws, so this is why we went elsewhere not to mention the expense of having Baan Consulting around in addition to Baan Partners each pointing at eachother when stuff went bad. This is something I really wanted to avoid.</div></div><hr />

I think that there must be standart migration procedure or session of baan.<br />

Isn't there any standart migration procedure or session of baan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this document described in pdf file in the reply above should be considered as standart. Some trouble thoughts immediately come - shall it require much single user baan time? It is difficult to get it working 24 hours a day online. And another thing - all financial localizations and own customisation progarms will gone? It's a pity and hard to restore. We have 3-rd release of Russian localization and 61 solutions inside it.</div></div><hr />
