Because now most of our clients are talking about implementing SAP or Oracle Apps ERP in near future replacing BaaN. So I am worried about my future prospects. <br />

No doubt SAP number 1 in ERP but BaaN also on number 3 (hope I am right) as on Oracle on Number 2 after acquired Peoplesoft.<br />

<br />
Rita do you have an opinion on how long Baan will be able to compete with other ERP's ? <br />
<br />
Are we entitled to ask you why your are asking vyp-007 why certain thoughts come to his/her mind. Are wanting to psycho-analyse him so as to undersatnad the question a little better ? <br />
<br />
Because you have answered a valid and topical question with an inappropriate question. Some of us will probably suspect that your are in some way associated with SSA or a partner and would like to deflect comment on that topic. <br />
<br />
As a long standing customer and user of BaanIV, I am certainly interested in discussion on the future viability of the product.  Any suggestion that Baan/SSA rank anywhere near the likes of SAP and Oracle is ridiculous. SAP is clearly no1, Oracle no2, but there is no number 3, 4,..20 for that matter on that scale. It would have to be a log-log-log scale for Baan and its ilk to rate as number 3.  Remember that BaaN was worth $135 mil 2 years ago and will be written down considerably in SSA books by now.  The IPO will efectively let the owners get most of that money back into their pockets.   <br />
<br />
As for companies moving away from Baan to the likes of SAP, there is a lot of evidence. I have even seen articles that suggest that much of Boeing's Baan has been superceded with SAP (despite the Boeing Dreamliner project). I have not seen one article that suggests a SAP implementation has been replaced by Baan. <br />
 <br />
Rita, I would certainly be interested in your answer to the question of how long Baan will be able to compete. <br />

I am read official SSA information about SSA ERP LN (Baan) 6.1 implementation project for Boeing 787 Dreamliner program. Boeing planned to finish this project in November 2005.<br />
<br />
Where you read about SAP?<br />
<br />
In Russia we have some new project with SSA ERP LN (Baan), including divisions of companies, which previous has SAP as corporate system. <br />
<br />
Last year, one of the top 10 Russian defence choice SSA ERP LN (Baan) in competition with SAP. <br />
<br />
I am fully confident, that SSA ERP LN (Baan) will be able to compete with other ERP's many years. Particular in discrete manufacturing.<br />
<br />
I not SSA partner, i am CIO in manufacturing company.<br />
<br />
Previous i am working with Baan, Oracle  and SAP. Baan is the best of all for discrete manufacturing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as our career goes, we can decide which ERP want to work for.<br />
<br />
As far as the market is concerned, please find enclosed a Boston Matrix which shows that SAP and Baan both are Cash cows.<br />
<br />
SO no worry of the survival. If anyone of you are still interested to know more about the ERPs you can refer to the link <br />

<br />
If you merge those 2 together as well as Oracle and Peoplesoft and you get kind of a #1 and #2 market share per company (as opposed to per product)<br />
<br />
Of course SAP might own all the rest of the products. I've, oddly enough, never really had enough interst in them to research them.<br />

Oh... the project scale is so big, just 25 concurrent users. So, anyone knows what the project cost is.<br />
I just work for a company which buys a ERP package but not so well preformance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for this very interesting information. You will see from previous posts of mine that I am an ardent admirer and log time (10+ years) user of Baan software. From those posts you would also find that I do not have the same sort of regard for those who have managed to guide the company from its postion 10 years ago as a serious contender to the number 3 rank to the position now where the company was worth only $135mil 2 years ago and probably a similar amount today.  <br />
<br />
There is no doubt that it is a cash cow and that many other ERP's including SAP (and other SSA products) are.   This doesn't mean very much other than that the customers are prepared to pay more than they may otherwise pay and that the product requires very little investment to keep it in the market.  <br />
<br />
To my mind the Baan product is not in the same league as SAP in terms of its installed base and new sales numbers or the likelihood of it still being around in say 5 or 10 years.  This has nothing to do with the capability of the system or elegance of the software.  It does have to do with the management of the company, its business strategies, the quality, professionalism and commitment of its people.   <br />
<br />
SSA's stated and observed strategy is to buy customer base and grow the revenue from those customers. Its strategy is not to sell product to more or new customers.  Hence we see very little new name activity. I have not heard of any large scale new name customers for years.  (Boeing 787 is a dwindling old name).  SSA is run by a bean-counter who has a few cronies around him who evidently have very little software marketing experience.  They have a business that has a very large revenue stream from annual fees that provide for future software upgrade and support services. Because the software is old, the installed base is old, the software is stable and requires almost no support.   Yes it certainly is a &quot;cash-cow&quot; in terms of Boston Consulting's grid analysis. <br />
<br />
On this forum most of us share a passion for the product. Especially the technical ones amongt us. We waited for years to see what Invensys would  do with its large internal sale base. We were then anxious for SSA to put Baan back where it should be in the market. That has not happened and sadly it is becommig less likely as each day passes.    <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Germanicus</div><div class="date">28th June 2005, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I think it depends on the ability of SSA to be inovative and to deliver what customers need.<br />
<br />
Let me go into detail: I know Baan and SAP and I have seen that SAP delivers a lot of functionality, not to speak of the flexibility in the Report Area. The disadvantage is that you need  an army of consultig experts to handle SAP.<br />
<br />
Baan is not that complex and still better in the Manufacturing Module. But the customer has to take what the standard offers. The standard is not as flexible as SAP.<br />
<br />
Another point is that SAP reacts much faster if the legal situation changes in  a country which is important in the European countries.<br />
<br />
Baan is mostly behind the flow of legal changes.<br />
<br />
Baan is not known by many people. When you talk about Baan in Germany most people think of the Deutsche BundesBAHN (a railway company).<br />
<br />
If you think about the Development of the Baan Company since 1998 the customers don't have much trust anymore. <br />
<br />
But despite of this I hope that Baan will go on because I am still supporting this application. If not I could also do something in SAP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pokitlok</div><div class="date">28th June 2005, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is worse in China. Well! You can find lots of offer for SAP, Oracle, PeopleSoft and JD Edward. BAAN? Sorry, NULL!<br />
Yes it can name one or two companies using BAAN as corporate ERP system. But, if you tell ordinary employers (even those work in IT yield for years), they seem not to know what BAAN is. You hardly find new implementation of BAAN.<br />
I have known BAAN for ten years. In the old day, it was as favor as SAP. But now, no one know it anymore. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very interesting article Bader,  particularly pleased to learn from the penultimte para quoted below: &quot;...that SSA is no longer soley interested in milking exiting customers for support...&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;In the past 12 months, analysts have detected a shift in SSA's business model as it seeks to throw off the image of a rest-home for retired ERP programs. So, the new SSA is no longer solely interested in milking existing customers for support, but has developed new products and extensions. According to Mr Greenough, around 10 per cent of SSA Global's licence revenues now come from new customers.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">6th July 2005, 03:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting topic! But the question should be, how long SSA will be able to compete with other ERP vendors, especially SAP, Oracle and Microsoft?<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with the product. What I want to complain is it become complex and will be difficult to maintain for SME customers. <br />
<br />
No one knows what will be the future of business applications. ERP is a hot topics in the past twenties. But a large amount of failure cases (any ERP software) indicate there will be some better approach to deploy business applications.</div></div><hr />
