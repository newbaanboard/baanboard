How does F9 connects to Baan database?  What is the price of the licence?<br />
One of our customer on BaanIV, on the way migrating to Ln, is not happy to find out  that Ln cut the financial statement module. Since it was our fault to suggest them to upgrade, so we created a  utility base on Excel for them to use. If F9 is good enough and with a reasonable price, maybe we can stop the further improvement to our utility.</div></div><hr />

We are using Cognos for reporting, as well as modifying some native LN reports. We also tried using LN Microsoft Integrations, which lets you import/export table data into LN via Excel, but found it to be troublesome.</div></div><hr />

I have read the user guide. It is strange why Infor not just plug F9 to ERP LN. F9 is also a product of Infor.<br />
<br />
Actually our free utility use the same approach as F9. I should admit our utility is much easier to use than F9.:D</div></div><hr />

Cognos Reportnet is nice for end user to design query type reports. But it is terrible if you would like to use it to design financial statement. <br />
<br />
For financial statement, use something like FRS or even F9.</div></div><hr />

cognos support any lang web content, at framework you can even customize and make your own xxx lang. probably the person who told you doesn't really know much about cognos.</div></div><hr />

reportnet is old version, now we using report studio. basically several client when they move to ln, i recommend along cognos and they love it very much.<br />
<br />
just run the report in excel mode and fin statement will look very familiar to most fc. however the user friendlyness of cognos will pretty much depends on the framework designer, 60-70% should be focus on this area rather than report design. result will be fantastic.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you are right. But general reporting tools, like Cognos Report Studio, Crystal Report or Microsoft Reporting Service is normally not suitable for preparing financial statement like balancing sheet. I mean with such general reporting tools, IT persons need to spend a lot of effort to do it and it is difficult for the end user to maintain it. I think that is why there is market for tools like FRX or F9.</div></div><hr />

Cognos Finance/Consolidation is regarded as high end(high price) product, something like Hyperion or Infor PM Planning/Consolidation. For large companies, such solution is their natural choice. But for smaller companies, something simple and built-in is more appropriate. It is very strange for an ERP product to have no built-in or simple plug in to make a balance sheet.<br />
From Baan5, the finance statement module was removed from the system. The solution offered from the vendor was first Safari, then Crystal, and then Cognos Reporting tools. The problem is not you cannot use such reporting tools to create a balance sheet, but requires the partipation of IT department. This is actually a drawback.<br />
I have said too much on this topic. :D</div></div><hr />
