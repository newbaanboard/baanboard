<br />
We are trying to customize a standard session &quot;Print Inventory Transfer by Item&quot; tdilc1422m000 to generate a file having the transfer order data and then store it to a defined path.<br />
<br />
We are able to generate the file and store it on the defined path, but the transfer orders consist of Japanese characters data, system is not able to write this Japanese characters properly into the file. When we open the file the Japanese characters appear as Junk Values in the file.<br />
Kindly let us know in case someone has solved this kind of issue in the past. <br />
Please find the server details as below:<br />
OS : SUSE12<br />
DB : Oracle 11.2.0.4<br />
App : BAAN4c4<br />
Porting set : 9.0b<br />
Also please refer to a sample file having the Japanese characters as Junk Values<br />
Thanks In Advance</div></div><hr />

I think creating of a Unicode text file will be mandatory to create readable Japanese characters.<br />
This is done by using ttstpconv with argument &quot;ASCI -u&quot;.<br />
Maybe this is working with Baan4, too? (May be a function of the porting set and you're using a modern 64bit version, I think. We're on 9.0a with LN 10.2)<br />
We donâ€™t use Japanese characters, but Russian and Chinese.</div></div><hr />
