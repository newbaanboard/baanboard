I'm trying to clarify the rules for defaulting the Tax Country and Code in Sales Order Lines.<br />
<br />
I've always worked (simplistically) on the basis that the Ship-To Address determined the Tax Country and Code.<br />
<br />
However, in my EC Shipping address example below, this is always being defaulted to Tax Country: UK and Tax Code: A1 (Std Tax - 20%):<br />
<br />
Sold From: UK<br />
Ship From: UK<br />
Sold To: Russia<br />
Ship To: Germany - Tax ID quoted on Address<br />
Invoice To: Russia<br />
Item Type: Cost<br />
<br />
In this example, I would expect the Tax Country to be Germany with an equivalent ICT (zero %) Tax Code.<br />
<br />
It doesnt seem to matter what setting I have in the COM parameter - Use Destination Address, the Tax Country is always defaulted to UK.<br />
<br />
I've checked and Germany is correctly set as an EC Country and Russia is not.<br />
<br />
Am I misinterpretting the rules or are there other settings I could investigate?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not sure about Baan V but in LN you can test your tax setup using the session &quot;Test Tax Model&quot; (tctax8100m000).<br />
<br />
Just check whether this session exists in your version or not. I can help you further if required.<br />
