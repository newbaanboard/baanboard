<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Premahari</div><div class="date">5th September 2018, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Thanks, I tried my Device length 55 and Notepad length was 100. I changed that also to 1000. But still not working</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th September 2018, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Could it be something with the Chinese characters on the form - something with the languages and characters?  The page length should only come into play with the page breaks.  What happens if you print the file to like an ASCII file and then open that in notepad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Premahari</div><div class="date">5th September 2018, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Thank You Mark_h. I tried printing in Ascii file then opened in notepad but the report not all opening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">6th September 2018, 09:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi AnuKass<br />
  Thank you for your reply. I have attached the output of my notepad and D, Where you can see in PDF there are 33 pages where as in notepad only 7pages.<br />
<br />
Could you please take a look at your Notepad file using a better Editor? I'm using a Version of Ultraedit. At the end of the file you can see, there are some line breaks added.<br />
<br />
I've had similar strange effects when trying to print Russian texts in a report (the rest of the report was in german). It also happened in a programm where I write a &quot;normal&quot; textfile.<br />
<br />
The problems I had where because I used a very basic technic of cutting strings after a given length (like dummy = output(1;20) ). With output defined is non multibyte string (= ascii string)<br />
This worked well when using normal ascii based strings. But I did assign a multibyte string to output beforehand, which worked quite fine - until some multibyte coded character was cutted right in middle of its 3 bytes.<br />
<br />
This may not be the cause in your example, but it is worth checking. It may also be caused by some codebase problem.<br />
<br />
Your notepad file seems to contain some UTF charaters at the end:<br />
<br />
Invoice-to BP            : 100000034  SATEE                            201108 不<br />
<br />
But other lines just show questionsmarks:<br />
<br />
Invoice-to BP            : 100000031  CRRC Zhuzhou electric            412000 ?? <br />
<br />
So there may be some codepage/charater coding problems involved.<br />
<br />
Maybe its both:<br />
<br />
Invoice-to BP            : 100000031  CRRC Zhuzhou electric            412000 ??                        Payment Terms            : 90   90 days credit<br />
<br />
Invoice-to BP            : 100000007  CRRC Sifang                                                       Payment Terms            : 100  30 days credit<br />
<br />
Invoice-to BP            : 100000034  SATEE                            201108 不<br />
海                      Payment Terms            : 100  30 days credit<br />
<br />
(Lines are taken from your attached notepad file.)<br />
<br />
Is this address data (bold text)? Maybe its created with some string cutting on wrong characters because of mixing multibyte and non multibyte strings?</div></div><hr />
