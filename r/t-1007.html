<br />
Recently i am reading and hearing demand for Oracle Apps,Peoplesoft,JD Edwards and ofcourse SAP.I don't have any news of projects coming up in BaaN.<br />
<br />
I also heard that Invensys (US) is going to Implement SAP and not BaaN.Does this mean that Invensys is going to Kill BaaN product? I hope its a Rumour.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">11th February 2002, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">With the sheer size of the global user base, I would think that it would be hard for the Baan product to die! The main reason that there has been no big projects for Baan has been that the problems over the last few years stopped the faith in the product. This is starting to be picked up again with the announcements from Baan about the future of the product. <br />
<br />
As more companies start to put faith in the product (which is still one of the better products out there!) then the news will start flowing, plus the budgets have to be out there as well (and there does appear to be an IT recession on at the moment with a lack of spending). <br />
<br />
The idea of Invensys implementing SAP would be madness, after all considering that the Baan product is cheap to them (after all they do own most of it), it would be a financially suicidial move (and with most of the finance problems Invensys tell us about would suggest that money is not free flowing at the moment)<br />
<br />
At the moment I as waiting for Baan to scream out that new projects and products are in the pipeline, which I expect we will see when the new season of budgets and finances appear in a few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">20th February 2002, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Invensys is not installing SAP, but where there is an installed base, they may be allowing Invensys companies to roll it out to other locations - having made a huge investment already this makes sense.<br />
Think how much effort and cost it would be to rip out all existing ERP's (many not yet depreciated) and go wall-to-wall Baan.<br />
Baan remains an integral part of Invensys (see Invensys strategic announcement Feb 19th) and is their own new ERP software standard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cabihler</div><div class="date">22nd February 2002, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Following the 19Feb Invensys strategic announcement I spoke with several friends at Morgan Stanley and TD Waterhouse. They are analysts and offered this to think about:<br />
Invensys is mired in debt, no secret given their announcement. Hawthornthwaite wishes to return Invensys to its core competencies that excludes those acquisitions that Hawthornthwaites team believes is contributing to the ongoing debt issue. The acquisitions of Wonderware, Marcam and especially Baan by his predecessors were a huge mistake. Invensys has poured tens-of-millions into their development and even though Baan has now turned what is termed a profit it continues to cost Invensys additional millions in loses for them keeping it afloat. Their belief is that Invensys will stabilize this division and that they will either look to sell it off or spin it off within the next 2 to 2 ½ years, hoping to bring in some 2+ bn pounds to possibly 3 bn pounds and by doing so offsetting their debt. This strategy would remove nearly all debt from Invensys and would put them in a position to strengthen their true core business, Energy systems. To attempt to sell/spin off this division now would bring in only 1 to 1 ½ bn pounds and would not recoup what it has cost Invensys in just its Baan investment given the purchase price of Baan and Invensys investment/losses in making Baan profitable. <br />
<br />
Anyway just some thoughts looking down the road.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 20:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Go back and review the Invensys strategy.  Baan is listed as part of the CORE businesses.  Invensys wants to focus on 2 separate cores or divisions.  One for Production the other, Energy.   To Quote From the Strategy :<br />
&quot;The Production Management Division will comprise<br />
Foxboro, Wonderware, Triconex, APV, Eurotherm and<br />
Baan and have total sales of £1.6bn*. These businesses will provide production technologies and services to the sectors of oil, gas and chemicals; power generation; food, beverage<br />
and personal healthcare; and discrete and hybrid<br />
manufacturing.&quot;<br />
To Quote from the Interview with CEO:<br />
&quot;Q. <br />
But you are staking the future of this company on just two divisions. Production management - why are you convinced that this is a good business<br />
and where are the growth prospects here?<br />
<br />
A. <br />
Well we are convinced it is a good business because our customers have told us it is a good business. They recognise that going forward they have an increasing need for consistency, for reliability, for productivity as it gets<br />
harder and harder to take costs out of the business. Now we have the technology, we have the domain knowledge, we have the installed base,<br />
everything that they are looking for. What we don't have currently is the quality of execution. But paradoxically that makes what is an exciting sector even more exciting, because not only have we got the scope for market growth, we have got the scope for a lot of margin growth. &quot;<br />
<br />
Baan is listed in the Production Management core.  <br />
Baan is NOT one of the businesses that are listed to be maintained 'through to disposal'.  Your freinds as well as the rest of us are entitled to their opinion but, they are taking a rather different view from the one held by the CEO in his interview, AND the published stragegy. Anyone who wishes to review the business strategy for Invensys may do so at www.invensys.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cabihler</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">You're correct when you said that my friends are putting forth an opinion differing from that of the CEO. As market analysts that is what they do from time to time. CEO's have been known to say what they want for us to hear while they are planning something else. Truly Invensys is NOT selling off their Production Division...TODAY. This division's value is diminished to the point that Invensys could not recoup what it has paid for and invested in developing each of its entities (BAAN, Wonderware et. al.). That is their point. Until such time that the value of this division is such that selling it would raise cash to pay off their debt Invensys would be foolish to do so; it is their belief that this could happen in the next 2 to 2 1/2 years. Energy is and has been Invensys' only true core business since its merger everything else they bought. Their CEO has indicated in this statement of last week and interview that his predecessors badly managed the merger founding Invensys and nearly all of the subsequent acquistions. He intends to turn Invensys around correcting their mistakes.<br />
<br />
Again you are right. This is THEIR opinion and they could be very wrong. They do not,nor do I, need a lecture from you to &quot;Go Back .....&quot; &quot;Their Core...&quot; because I know and more importantly THEY KNOW. Their business is to question and to advise their market executives so they can make money for us poor jerks who don't know. You can keep on quoting and they can keep on making money. Me I don't give a rat's backside if Invensys sells or not, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">digitd</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">The strategy makes one believe that the emphasis is now on the (Baan) Installed bases.....possible piggybacking to sell other service lines<br />
<br />
Given that less than 20% of Production Management business comes from Baan and that Invensys sees major opportunities for improvement in production management division (on the other hand, major business potential with Energy management division)....well its any CEO's game of Russian Roulette (can we have a poll on this please!....Baan - Is it being dressed up for sale again?<br />
<br />
Is the famous &quot;Sensor to Boardroom&quot; strategy still live!! (with sensor up for sale) :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">No lectures.  Simply an attempt to make more information available to those who might read this post.  ...'something to thing about down the road' , you might say...  <br />
There is no need for an apology.  I do not mean to attack you, or your position.  Like I said...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Not necessarily: &quot;sensors&quot; are manufactured all over the place. In terms of the Energy Management part, Energy Solutions has a large sensor (&amp; other control equipment) manufacturing facility in the Building Systems company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maaxim</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Please....PLEASE.....let us not try to spread such doubts....<br />
<br />
You must well be aware of the proceedings from the market about the developments at Invensys and Baan.<br />
<br />
It is a great a ERP and I know of people who would NEVER leave Baan even if you offer an alternative FOC....!<br />
<br />
So let's hope for the best....and pray for the markets to recover...which helps us all !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bogdan</div><div class="date">27th February 2002, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Is it dying or not? Who knows.Considering that a lot of companies spent a lot of money with BaaN I think it will survive.<br />
But why is this happening?<br />
Let's see:<br />
BaaN licence cost a lot of money - CORRECT<br />
BaaN training cost a lot of money - CORRECT<br />
BaaN documentation costs a lot of money! (if you can find it, and when you find it you will see it's not exactly what you were looking for). Why? Probably to protect BaaN partners (local support, etc.). This is correct from their point of view, but: who's in charge to decide if BaaN is or is not a proper solution for a company? Invensys, BaaN, local partners? NO. The company's IT and Managment stuff.<br />
How much BaaN gain from keeping secret a lot of the real important docs? I think they lost a lots of possible clients.<br />
How many of this board users were attracted to BaaN from the first sight?<br />
I think they must change their politics about information; and BaaN partners must not be afraid of that. How many companies were canceled the support contracts just because they have a couple of good programmers or admins? How many times a BaaN consultant doesn't want to talk &quot;the same language&quot; with an end user?<br />
I spent a lot of time today to realize that server2client() is a BaaN function. Is it documented in Tools User Manual? Maybe, but not in mine's. Do you think I will call for consultancy on that (why is this board reality?). No. How much it will earn a consultant answering to my silly question? But if I'll know more about Baan power maybe I'll convince my managers to pay for a Tools course. Is this a biger proffit? For both of sides.<br />
<br />
That's what I think about BaaN: an extraordinary car, a very expensive one, but you must pay some extra for the keys!<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong. And maybe not.</div></div><hr />
