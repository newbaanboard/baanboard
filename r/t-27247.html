They have a very experienced team.<br />
The surprise of the tournament will be Ukraine as they will beat Brazil in the semi-finals.<br />

I will definitely watch as many games as possible.<br />

<br />
I think that a real fan WANTS and THINKS the same way. You can't seperate the heart and mind in Football.<br />
<br />
For me for example, I think England will take the cup this time. We just need to get over the bad luck in the last few tournaments and get Wayne Rooney back in time for the final stages..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">1st June 2006, 08:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Bader,<br />
<br />
Even if Wayne Rooney is recovered again in time it will still make no difference for the end result. The rest of the English team is just not good enough.<br />
Leo Beenhakker, the coach of Trinidad &amp; Tobago, was right by saying that England will never win a big prize again.<br />
<br />
However, I agree with you that heart and mind are both the same when it comes to football. Isn't that just beautiful?<br />
Perhaps a good example for the IT world as well?<br />

You can if you just like the sport and are not a fan of any team.  I enjoy watching it and often catch myself watching some European\English\South American league games(on replay).  I really do not know enough about world soccer.<br />

This weekend is the last week of the Kentucky State soccer championships - my two nephews competitive teams are trying to repeat.  So that is where I am a real fan.</div></div><hr />

The team are consist from young and full with experience players.<br />
<br />
The two central back is very excellent, (Jhon Terry and Rio Ferdinand)<br />
Even they can make score from corner kick. :)<br />
<br />
Rooney, he's an emotional player. <br />
<br />
I guess England will score lot from their midfielders and their back.</div></div><hr />

Today Australia is playing Liechtenstein and we will see whether the Aussies are the red hot favourite.<br />
In case you guys beat Germany will that then be the revenge for SAP?<br />
<br />
I hope Australia can do the world a favor by beating Brazil in the group.<br />
Of course you need a Dutch coach (Guus Hiddink) to make it all happen :).<br />

<br />
Nope. The Aussies have selected Guus Hiddink from The Netherlands and of course he will become the next president of Australia if they make it to the semi-finals. Just like 4 years ago when Guus was coach of South-Korea.<br />
<br />
In total there are 4 Dutch head coaches active during this World Cup:<br />
<br />
- Marco van Basten for The Netherlands<br />
- Guus Hiddink for Australia<br />
- Dick Advocaat for South-Korea<br />
- Leo Beenhakker for Trinidad &amp; Tobago<br />

<br />
The national football team of Holland is the same like Sun Microsystems.<br />
<br />
Holland is very creative and invented &quot;Total football&quot; in the 70-s. <br />
<br />
Sun Microsystems also is very creative and invented Java, but the companies that are enjoying Java today from a business point of view are IBM, BEA and Oracle.<br />
<br />
This maybe explains how Holland is exporting 4 coaches for teams that are playing the world cup, while Holland itself never won anything major, except for the European Championship in 1988.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bamnsour</div><div class="date">19th June 2006, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it is not exactly random. After they have 32 teams, they are devided into 8 levels of ranking. Ranking 1 is the strongest teams with the best record of the national team in recent world cups and other regional games. This group includes Brazil, Germany, Argentina for example.<br />
<br />
So, in every group, we have a team from ranking 1, another from 2, 3 and 4.  This is done using a random draw<br />
<br />
This way Brazil does not meet with Germany in the first round, for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This tournament has already reached it's zenith in the France/Switzerland match where the fans got their ultimate reward of nothing happening for 90 minutes and a 0-0 draw - PERFECTION.<br />
<br />
The Axis of Evil (Brazilians, Penalty Shootouts and leader of this triocha, &quot;Psychopath&quot; Sepp Blatter) have for years contrived to deprive us fans of the truly beautiful game.<br />
<br />
For generations, the Brazilians (lead by the Prince of Darkness, Pele) have ruined our dreams by an endless procession of goals from anywhere on the park.<br />
<br />
Just when the world managed to curtail this travesty, Fifa introduced the Penalty Shootout!! Are they insane?<br />
<br />
Psychopath Sepp must be held accountable!!! When will this lunatic be eliminated?<br />

Give us boredom - that's what will bring the fans back to the game!!!<br />

The referee may just have had a lapse of competence.  <br />
<br />
I think Australia did very. Especially for such a small country (20million) and one that has lots of other sports that it participates internationality in.  Just check the results from the Olympic games or British Commonwealth games (50+ countries and Australia clearly tops the list by a big margin)<br />
<br />
There are two points that come to my mind over this game/contest.<br />
(1) I hadn't realised that Italy played any sports at an international level.<br />
(2) This is another sport for which the world community is endebted to Britian.<br />

The real reason we did not beat Italy or at least draw with Brazil is that under this level of pressure, we didn't get the ball into the net enough times.

<br />
and now back to the diatribe - And don't think Franz Beckenbauer's role in all this hasn't gone unnoticed - &quot;Organizing Committee&quot; (for his European mates only apparently!!)<br />

and another slant on this scandal<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;An Australian man has been arrested in Italy for an assault on a local man following the football match between Australia and  Italy. <br />

Witnesses say the Australian man was 20m away when the incident happened. The victim suffered a fractured skull, a cardiac arrest and has developed diabetes as a result of the incident. He is expected to recover in a few minutes.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Four years ago the Italians were in the same position Australia is in this World Cup. &quot;What comes around goes around&quot; as they say.<br />

<br />
Just like my first post in this thread, that England forward will score less than their midfielder. From all the matches that England played, their forward only scored one goal.<br />
<br />
Peter Crouch: 1 Goal<br />
Steven Gerrad: 2 Goals<br />
Joe Cole: 1 Goal<br />
David Beckham: 1 Goal<br />
<br />
And also about Rooney, he's really a temperament player.<br />
I just got remember that one of the newspaper in England wrote &quot;10 Men Hero and one Stupid Boy&quot; when Beckham got the red card in World Cup 1998 in France after he got the red card against Argentina and exactly happened to Rooney. The same scenario happened, England losed in the penalty shoot out.<br />
<br />
I think that Portugal will win this World Cup. Deco will play again after his red card punishment. And also Cristiano Ronaldo has found Extra Joss. :rolleyes: <br />
It's become his secret now, that what he said.<br />

The team I picked is still in - I would like to say I did it by knowing the teams, but that is not true.  I just briefly glanced at some stats(and because I did not want Germany or Brazil to win(no offense meant)) and picked France.  Go France!!! :)  My prediction for the final is Italy and France.</div></div><hr />

Who wns most of the Italian media?<br />
Silvio bloody Berlusconi that's who! - Hey, if I can buy a whole country, buying off a few FIFA officials should be a piece of cake!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David Eagar</div><div class="date">5th July 2006, 09:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Only bitter that our team didn't take all their chances and progress a bit further. Will possibly be able to say for the next 4 years that we were 'robbed' against the world champions!<br />
<br />
I just hope the final does NOT go to a penalty shootout</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">5th July 2006, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree with you here. A final should not end with a penalty shoutout.<br />
For Italy this may become a problem as they were defeated by penalties against Brazil in the final of 1994.<br />
Hopefully the opponent will be France so Italy can take revenge for EURO 2000.<br />

<br />
If France wins the world cup, Zidane is on his way to the Football hall of Fame in a trinity with Pele and Maradona.<br />
<br />
See the attached picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David Eagar</div><div class="date">10th July 2006, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Zidane can now be considered a big a goose as Maradonna. <br />
Suggestion for the next world cup, can we cut out the dross and just have the penalty shout-outs? Instead of dragging this out for a month, you could get the whole thing over in an afternoon. Think of the savings!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">10th July 2006, 07:51</div></div><div class="posttext">As stated before the start of the World Cup: <br />
<br />
Predicting the winner of the World Cup is like going to the casino but if I had to make a choice I would go for Italy. They have a very experienced team.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately teams only play not to lose and they no longer play to win because there is too much at stake. Also the coaches are too chicken and this is all bad for the future of the game.<br />

Overall, i found this to be one of the more entertaining World Cups, the early rounds especially. Even traditional stick in the muds like Italy &amp; Germany generally played attacking football<br />
And yes, Edwin, you told us so</div></div><hr />
