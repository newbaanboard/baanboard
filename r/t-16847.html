Hello Mr. Law,<br />

E.g. new sessions for EDI (Electric Data Interchange between the head office and the subsidiaries), to create different financial reports for the head office about the subsidiaries,  From my desk I could enter into the systems of the subsidiaries and solve their problems, to instal there the new developments, (sse my C.V attached)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I am interested in this offer. Please let me know if my C.V. has aroused your interest.<br />
