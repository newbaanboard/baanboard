<br />
We are a group of students in Switzerland and need to give a presentation over Infor ERP.<br />
<br />
I tried to get the requested infos from Infor directly but they didn't respond, maybe someone here takes a little time and answers my questions:<br />
<br />
-programming language used to program business objects?<br />
-languages supported in the GUI?<br />
-your satisfaction with support/consultancy (in which region? US/Europe/Asia)<br />
-is Enterprise Modeler still the way to go in Infor ERP? (got the info from Baan V6.1)<br />
-is customizing functions/business objects an easy task?<br />
-Webclient: does it provide full functionality? if not how does it differ from the Worktop (as it was called under 6.1)<br />
<br />
Maybe someone has a little info about the technical architecture. I only found a really raw model of 3 layers: Enterprise Structure model - Business control models - Function/Process/Organization Model<br />
<br />
does anyone have something which goes deeper? say some picture about the SOA architecture? or about the WS architecture?<br />
<br />
best regards<br />
<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />

<br />
-programming language used to program business objects?<br />
<br />
Mainly a proprietary 4GL language, called &quot;Baan C&quot;, which allows for inline SQL. Good engine for standard sessions that does all the CRUD stuff without programmers having to do it manually. On top (very) new, GUI oriented developments are done in .net environments<br />
<br />
-languages supported in the GUI?<br />
<br />
See above<br />
<br />
-your satisfaction with support/consultancy (in which region? US/Europe/Asia)<br />
-is Enterprise Modeler still the way to go in Infor ERP? (got the info from Baan V6.1)<br />
<br />
Still used in projects as a documentation tool, but it's not that you can't do without it<br />
<br />
-is customizing functions/business objects an easy task?<br />
<br />
Yes, if you know how :-)<br />
<br />
-Webclient: does it provide full functionality? if not how does it differ from the Worktop (as it was called under 6.1)<br />
<br />
Offers more(!) functionality compared to the Worktop. Definitely recommended to be used as end user interface, even if it requires an additional technology stack (two different stacks, if you add Workspace (Sharepoint based interface) on top).<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your information. GUI languages I meant: EN/FR/ES/PT etc… not Java/4GL etc…<br />
<br />
In Europe more and more easter Europe countries are getting off… so czech, hungarian, romanian etc. might be required as GUI language<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">7th November 2012, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently supported GUI languages are:<br />
English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portugees, Italian and 2 Chinese languaes.<br />
<br />
