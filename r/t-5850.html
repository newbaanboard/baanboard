<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Uh, since when is FreeBSD considered a Linux flavour? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, ok....you got me.<br />
<br />
FreeBSD is not exactly Linux, but since it matches the profile and it's one of my own old-time favorits I thought I'd sneak it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I will close my eyes and pretend I didn't see :) Added Caldera and Debian. And TurboLinux</div></div><hr />

I prefer Debian just for &quot;apt-get&quot;. Port apt-get to any other system and I would probably have no issues using any of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">what's apt-get?<br />
<br />
and thanks for the additions, Pat. Just thought of Corel myself but I can't edit the poll anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Corel Linux added. Isn't 'apt-get' like the up2date agent from Redhat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 22:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever experience with Redhat a situation where you are trying to install an RPM and it will abort with a message that it needs additional dll and will not continue. You go and try to install the said dll and it will complain that this dll needs some other dll (you get my drift). In Debian apt-get resolves all dependencies to the lowest level. When you doapt-get install apache or something similar (can you tell I am not much of a linux guy :)) it will install apache by getting all the dependencies.<br />

If you install the Ximian bundle on Redhat you can get a similar functionality. Check it out on http://www.ximian.com</div></div><hr />

Hey we have only 11 linux users on Baanboard. Not much of an argument to make Baan release a Linux porting set if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">17th July 2002, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe members being afraid to come out of the closet? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">18th July 2002, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Not fair to draw such a conclusion ~Vamsi! I could say the same about the other poll: <br />
<br />
out of 414 viewers of the thread &quot;Client Software Used&quot; we have only 64 votes. This means 64/414*100 = a little more than 15% of the viewers use Baan. So from the 2,067 members (and for the ease of reasoning ignore the guests), only less than 320 members connect to a Baan system using some kind of client software....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">18th July 2002, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">OmeLuuk,<br />

Please do not bristle at my idea. It was said in jest. I should have put a couple of more smilies at the end of my statement. I am just frustrated that more people do not take an active part in the proceedings. Especially when we are not even asking them to talk. Just vote anonymously. I will be in the forefront with all the other Linux fans celebrating the release of Baan on Linux when (see I do not say &quot;if&quot;) it happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">18th July 2002, 23:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Look who's talking :D<br />
<br />
I wanted to find out what all of these 2000++ users were using to connect to baan. Only 400++ only watched and 60+ gave that poll a shot.<br />
<br />
I assumed more response would been given.<br />
<br />
On this poll I can imagine, lots of people don't use Linux, never ever. But all do connect to Baan once in a while I suppose... And yet such a poor response.<br />
<br />
But I think there may be over 400 BaanBoard registered users who have installed Linux at home or at work. So it would be a little effort to just click and be counted.<br />
<br />
It might be a good idea to show off with the poll's so that people not only tend to vote more, but also see the progress... Can the polls be gathered together in one thread (or mirrorred - more occurrences more chances?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">18th July 2002, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Omeluuk,<br />
<br />
To answer your question about polls: no, that's not possible at the moment. Voting on a poll is always a voluntary effort. Don't put too much value on the baanboard polls ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pit0815</div><div class="date">21st August 2002, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">i guess, the linux world is aware about the flavor issue. At least, that's  how I  interpret the following initiative:<br />
http://www.unitedlinux.com/ <br />
<br />
...<br />
Linux Industry leaders Caldera International, Inc. (Nasdaq: CALD), Conectiva S.A., SuSE Linux AG, and Turbolinux, Inc., today announced that UnitedLinux will be available as a closed beta product by the end of August to partners of the four founding companies. It is expected to be publicly available in open beta by the end of Q3 2002.<br />

I think there are more than 11 Linux users. I use Linux Spring 2001 - it's our Russian product. Of course it has much common things with Red Hat.<br />
It is worth running Baan thru X-windows rather than bw client (PIPE is preferebly of course than SOCKET connection especially when you are operating with large amount of data)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hsteenwi</div><div class="date">21st August 2002, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Everybody,<br />
<br />
I have no experience with Linux so far. For a couple of months now, I've got an installation CDR of Red Hat at home, just begging me to be installed.<br />
Because of the birth of my son on the 9th of July, I had no opportunity to make the begging stop.<br />
<br />
So, I really want to participate in your poll, but am not able to contribute (yet). Sorry.<br />
