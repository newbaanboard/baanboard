<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frank holland</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question on character sets, due to the following situation:<br />
<br />
We have a BaanIV installation with a western europe character set and english/german gui components (no other language packs). We would like to make a russian version of some sales reports, e.g. of the sales invoice. Adding the system language is no problem, and entering russian labels for the reports can be done either (by installing the russian font on your client). <br />
<br />
My question is: how do you get the printing to work? How should the locales for the user and printer be set, can they be different? Am I right that the locale for the user converts characters between client and bshell, whereas the locale for the printer converts between bshell and printer?<br />
<br />
Has anyone dealt with this problem before?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help !<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xiamu_baan</div><div class="date">14th July 2003, 07:26</div></div><div class="posttext">If you use windows printer, you can set printer locale in session Device Data. If you use unix printer, by default, printer get your LOCALE setting as its locale.<br />
<br />
In my opinion perhaps, print works like this:<br />
BAAN read a report dump(must be as the same locale as current use)<br />
write down the data to that report<br />
convert the TSS to native code<br />
Put to printers<br />
<br />
Since German / Russian use the same chartset ISO-8859-5, that is to say, if you have a german homepage, you can see it in Russian with just change the encode. The only difference between them is font, not code itself. So if we can get a Germanny report as flat file, you can print it to the printer as Russian.<br />
<br />
The critical problem is how to get a Russian report.<br />
I have a bad idea. Make a report use german character, which is just match the Russian one as you need. and put out this report use German user account and use Windows Printer-&gt;preview-&gt;Change Font.<br />
If you use Unix, set charset parameter to lp command.<br />
<br />
This is not a good idea, if you have time to do it, please tell me the result.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frank holland</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the following solution, however it requires a separate login and printer:<br />
<br />
User settings:<br />
- Create a user with an ISO88595 Locale (I took the bulgarian one, BULG_HPUX9.0)<br />
- In the bw-client configuration for this user set the NLS-setting to russian<br />
- The language of the GUI may be english or german (however in german characters like ö or ä are not displayed rightly...)<br />
<br />
Creating the report:<br />
- Add a system language for russian<br />
- Copy a report to this language<br />
- Switch the windows keyboard setting to russian<br />
- Enter the labels in russian and compile<br />
<br />
Defining a printer:<br />
- Create a printer with the same locale as the user (must be the same, otherwise you get an error message)<br />
<br />
For the combination user / printer things should work.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
