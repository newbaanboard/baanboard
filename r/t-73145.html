Hope anybody can help me. I know that Infor has discontinued the distribution of the translation files of Russian for BAANIV. But I need to setup an installation to be able to store information in russian with the cyrilic characters.<br />
<br />
I guess I must setup the SQL Database with an specific characterset, but I can't find any information about this.<br />
I've just tried to setup the R language in an existing BAAN installation, but failed miserably ..<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
