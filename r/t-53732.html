<br />
Is there anybody, who don't just programmin BAAN and administer it, but like to know, HOW it is work? For example, such things:<br />
<br />
1) How to decrypt sources in $BSE\include6.2 dir? It is simple sources, but encrypted somehow.<br />
2) What is the internal structure of the bshell virtual machine? The commands? The variables? The program flow?<br />
3) What is the compiled object format? Can we recover source code from the object?<br />
4) What is the PMC file format?<br />
<br />
As for me, at this moment i know this things:<br />
<br />
1) All internal command for bshell (and know how they work - 90%)<br />
2) Internal bshell object structure (how bshell stores variables inside)<br />
3) Object file structure. About 70% - so i can not completely decompile objects, but i came close to it.<br />
4) PMC structure - but it contains chiphered sources, so there is much to investigate remains.<br />
<br />

Hello blueboar,<br />
Yes, I am interested to know the following things:<br />
<br />
1) How to decrypt sources in $BSE\include6.2 dir?<br />
2) What is the internal structure of the bshell virtual machine? The commands? The variables? The program flow?<br />
3) What is the compiled object format?<br />
<br />
Apart from that I would even like to know how does BAAN stores the value of the array variables (array of the domain of string type) in the memory.<br />
<br />

<br />
- I don't want place info only here, so only participants of this forum can read this. May i write info on my site and give you a link?<br />
- My native language is Russian. So it will be better for me to write it in Russian. Is there any translators in English in this forum? If no, i can write in English, but i think my English is not very good (is it so?).<br />
- If i will share info, which i know, will be any return to me? For example if you use my info and do something new with BAAN, will i know about this?<br />
- I will not share some info about baan, based on security reasons, for example the internal structure of BAAN licensing and obtaining license passwords.<br />
<br />
If it's ok, that i will write on my site, i can do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I know the closest now is to use bic_info<br />

If i run it simply, bic_info [some_script], it works. But if i run it &quot;bic_info -i [some_script]&quot; then i receive an error message, that the prorgam can not found F_OBJ : ottstpstandard? Why? The command &quot;bic_info ottstpstandard&quot; is working perfectly, but does not produce source code :(</div></div><hr />
