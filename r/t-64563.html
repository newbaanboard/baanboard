Hello,<br />
<br />
depends, on how/where the description is stored.<br />
<br />
try to use attr.textlang$() or language$()<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mitchell</div><div class="date">12th September 2013, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a customized table that contains items and the Russian descriptions.<br />
<br />
When I print these descriptions to a report, the report itself is in the Russian Language and the device I am printing to has the correct Locale.  It works great.<br />
<br />
Now, I need to create a csv file with the item and the Russian item descriptions.  Therefore, I have no report and no device.  I use seq.open to open the file and I use seq.write to write to the file.  Everything works ... except my Russian Item descriptions are garbage. <br />
<br />
Can I specify the Russian Language with my seq.write or do I need to set the locale before the seq.write?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
Thanks<br />
Barb</div></div><hr />
