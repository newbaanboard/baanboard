<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chodix</div><div class="date">8th April 2002, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I know some consultants from CIS, DST and Ster-projekt and i can say about them really good things. But, as You know, people are most important, not companies. I will write about thatm below.<br />
I don't know if DST can implement a BaaN. I suppose not. They are rather a developing company and we use their services in that way (b2b solutions, own HR module). Ster-projekt and CIS are implementig companies and has good reputation on market. My current implementation was done by Ster-Projekt. I know that there was some problems at the beginning, but after changing the team everything was good.<br />
Consultants from Sterprojekt and CIS which I know has good knowlegde as consultants and as a programmers.<br />

Contact January Suchan there and say hello from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chodix</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">BEELC is based in Krakow and they are like You wrote a Localisation Center not a implementing team. They are owned albo by BaaN. But I can be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krazykriz</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">BEELC has been sold to Singular Greece about two years ago when Baan wasn't - well - too well. Of course, this sort of business is called 'Joint Venture' nowadays.<br />
<br />
They might not do implementations themselves, but they sure can tell you who does and how. <br />
<br />
Krakow used to be the branch of their Warsaw office, but this might have changed as well. As we all know, this environment is changing at a fast pace (sic).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can contact EFBUD. They were involved in BaaN implementation in our company (distribution, finance, Proloq) and are quite good I think. EFBUD is the only one company which deal with Proloq in Poland (it is BaaN Dimension now).<br />
Use the following e-mail: baan@efbud.com.pl.<br />
