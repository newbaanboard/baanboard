<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">9th May 2003, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan, leading enterprise application provider for industrial enterprises and part of Invensys plc, marched into 2003 with first quarter sales results that reflect strength in its enterprise solutions. Now in its 25th year, Baan signed 52 new customers during the quarter, demonstrating confidence among customers in Baan's long-standing reputation for quality products, service and end-to-end industrial solutions.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
For the quarter ending March 31, Baan signed agreements with 28 new customers in the European region, 17 in the Americas and seven in the AsiaPacific region. &quot;Despite continued softness in the IT market, results for the quarter demonstrate a belief and loyalty among customers in Baan's hard-won reputation for leading-edge products and solutions that solve their business problems,&quot; said Baan President, Laurens van der Tang.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Commenting on the performance, Meta Group, vice president, Ruediger Spies highlighted that under the current weak economy ERP sales have slowed down significantly. &quot;Winning new customers and expanding license sales proves to be very hard for ERP vendors currently. Therefore, every new customer, every new license agreement counts twice as it shows that those selected survived the hard selection process,&quot; said Spies. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Managing Director of Softworx (the local Baan distributor), Jane Thomson said, &quot;The general economy in Sub-Saharan Africa is standing up well compared to other territories, however the Enterprise Solutions space (including ERP and its extensions) has a similar pattern to that reported for the other regions.&quot;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;The interest in and support for the Baan solutions is strong given this pattern and the uncertainty of the times,&quot; reports Thomson. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Among the new North American customers who signed agreements with Baan during the quarter are Joy Mining Machinery, Target Pro, Staples, and A&amp;P in the US, in addition to Bonetera Monterrey, S.A. de C.V. and Paniplus, S.A. de C.V. in Mexico. In the European region, the major new customers during the quarter were: Ungricht and Afflerbach in Germany, PA Krasnoyarsk Combine Harvester Production in Russia, Boytas in Turkey, HUBER+SUHNER Group in Poland, and Si &amp; Si Company in Serbia.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Asia-Pacific companies purchasing Baan for the first time in the quarter included the following Indian companies: Indofil Chemicals Company, Lakshmi Ring Travellers Ltd, Lloyd Electric &amp; Engineering Ltd, Polygenta Technologies Ltd.</div></div><hr />
