<br />
We are on BaaN IV and we use ILC and LTC.<br />
<br />
We have such a problem:<br />
There is a purchasing budjet (not in BaaN) - and we must indicate budget article for each line of purchase order, or at least for each purchase order (PO are in BaaN). In other words, users want to have reports on using budget articles made automatically. <br />
The worst thing is that we can not distingvish purchase items in advance - I mean that one item can be purchased for different budget articles.<br />
(We don't want to use customized items - it is too difficult to transact them.)<br />
<br />
The problem seems to be common... <br />
What is the most common way to solve it?<br />
How can we work it out?<br />
<br />
Thanking in advance,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you classify your suppliers and tracks purchase activities by geographical area? If not, then you can use the area code for your budget articles. Change all labels saying &quot;Area&quot; to &quot;Budg&quot; or something similar. Enter budget article in area code field every time you create PO. You can even record the purchase budget per budget article (area code) in PST module and have your purchase budget vs realisation report right out of Baan<br />

<br />
Thank you for idea.<br />
It sounds good - we do not use area codes so this field is free. <br />
<br />
And could you give a little more precise idea about using PST - we've  never used it?<br />
<br />
One thing is strange - I think the problem is common and lots of enterprises who use BaaN deal with it. I wonder why there is no &quot;strict&quot;, &quot;common&quot; functionality for it.... <br />
<br />
Thank you once more,<br />

<br />
There is a short desc of PST on the following thread<br />
<br />
PST &amp; archiving (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7124)<br />
<br />
If your purchase budget article scheme is not too complicated, without too much hassle you can use the PST purchase budget recording &amp; reporting feature. The purchase budget entered will be included in the so called dimension 3 in the short desc above. Hence you can make report detailing purchase budget vs realisation per budget article per year for the last 5 years, for example.<br />
<br />
If you think PST is suitable for you and ready to embark on the journey of setting it up :) there are many people here in BaanBoard who can help you<br />

<br />
Thank you for your suggestions - I'm starting to work it out. From the first glance it seems to be a good decision - for at least &quot;from scrutch&quot; implementation.<br />
<br />
I'm looking also at Purchase requisitions (tdprq) functionality. Have you dealt with it?<br />
<br />
And the thing I'm still concerned very much - why there is no standart solution for my problem? The task seem to be obvious...<br />
<br />
Thank you once more,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glad I can help :)<br />
Unfortunately I've never tried B4 purchase requisition functionalities before. It's not available in our B4c4 system as standard. Probably it's add on? We looked briefly into pur req module in B5c though (built in). We decided not to use it because it's not suitable for our case (too many new goods considered as cost item)<br />
<br />
There are quite a few Baan people who are members of BaanBoard, some are better at listening to suggestions than others. If they think it's a good thing to have they'll consider including such feature.<br />

<br />
Now I'll try to test both avaliable functionalities.<br />
<br />

But... We are looking now for a temporary solution - because we plan to implement full finance integration next year, and then, of course, we'll have full-blown budgeting system in finance (or may be controlling module).<br />
And Mexico is too far from Russia :) <br />
<br />
But nevertheless, thanks for help.<br />
