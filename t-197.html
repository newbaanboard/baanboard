<br />
1.Our firm has one managerial office and 13 distinct warehouses in different cities. All of them is planned to be implemented by BaanERP. <br />
2.We plan also to build 32K FR channel on each of these warehouses and 512K FR channel in the central office. As far as we understand the quality of channels mentioned above can't provide 24h, 7 day of week assured connection and the situation of carrier lost during 2-3 hours may be occurred. The needs of our business can't allow a warehouse downtime in this period <br />
3.We plan to produce approximately 300-400 sales order per day on the biggest warehouses and to analyze sales statistic (on the logistic level) in the central office on the daily level. <br />
 <br />
<br />
So, our questions are:<br />
<br />
1.How many financial and logistic companies in BaanERP we should create for the best business effectivity. <br />
2.How we could organize the process of data interchange between the Baan companies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To manage Multisite with Baan is not easy, you have to know very well the complete process between every plant (financial, manufacture, Transportation and distribution concepts).<br />
<br />
Existe a good Baan MultiSite course and manual you have to read first of all. <br />
<br />
For exemple if a Financial buy material for all the plants and  the delivery is in each warehouse and you don`t want to make an invoice  at those warehouses (taxes!!!), BaaN donÂ´t manage the same  receiving  process in 2 dif. financial on the net.<br />
<br />
The way I have solve this problem (a Mill company), is using NFS with a little file (ascii) between both financial and a T1 comunication network(64k),  with all the datas you need, and apply the reception (FILE) on the consolidate financial with a little program in TCL/TK (Shareware) every time you need it. <br />
<br />
Hope you understand and that can help you<br />

Bien le bonjour<br />

<br />
Many thanks for the answer. We now use this variant. But really there is no other decision?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you have an other one, but you have to use the Manufacturing module....Perhaps BaaN Support or somebody else have more information. <br />
<br />
If you find any other solution, please answer me how...<br />
