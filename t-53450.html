<br />
	<br />
I'm developing on BaaN IV a session process that will insert automatically some records in session tfcmg1110m000, which come from a .csv file and a parameters table (tfgld900), through a library that contains AFS, to do this I'm using the stpapi.put.field() for fill the required fields, when I have finish, the stpapi.insert() is called, when I process the first record, all it's okay, the information is inserted in the table, but when I process the second one or all other records the return value of the stpapi.insert() is &quot;false&quot; and the error message says &quot;No se permite Divisa&quot; (&quot;The Currency is not allowed&quot;) obviously the currency is allowed and exists in the currencies's table but the process always should be reads the same currency, and doing a debugger the field tfgld900.ccur always brings the same value as the first record that was processed successful, when I'm debugging I put some value to the field and get the same result, the variable error message tells me that do not allow the currency, maybe I'm doing some wrong... Can U help me??<br />
<br />
Here is the script:<br />
<br />
	tfcmg1110m000f.put.Proveedor(tfgld900.suno)<br />
	tfcmg1110m000f.put.M_todo_contabilizaci_n(tfgld900.post)<br />
	tfcmg1110m000f.put.Importe(importe)<br />
	tfcmg1110m000f.put.Referencia(col6)<br />
	tfcmg1110m000f.put.M_todo_cobros_pagos(tfgld900.paym)<br />
	tfcmg1110m000f.put.Motivo_para_pago_extranjero(tfgld900.reas)<br />
	val.insert = tfcmg1110m000f.insert(true, errorm1)<br />
	if not val.insert then<br />
		val.recover1 = tfcmg1110m000f.recover(errorm2)<br />
	else<br />
		val.save = tfcmg1110m000f.save(errorm3)<br />
		if not val.save then<br />
			val.recover2 = tfcmg1110m000f.recover(errorm4)<br />
		endif<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
Thanx a lot!!<br />

Have you tried ending the session after inserting each record?  Yes it causes a lot of overhead, but it may work.  I don't like to do this, but sometimes it is the only way to get them to work.</div></div><hr />

Please forgive me, I saw the subforum for Function Servers after I wrote the thread, This is my first time reading and writing in this great forum, I'll be carefully next time :D<br />
<br />
I tried your solution (end session when this inserts a new record) and everything was successful, however, the process could be a bit slow because will be read and insert many records at the same time but it doesn't even matter...<br />
<br />
Thank you in any way for your help!! :D :D<br />
Problem solved :cool:</div></div><hr />

No problem on the posting - that is what us moderators are for. :)<br />
<br />
Great!!! glad it worked. And yes it can slow up processing - you might want to continually check things as you do a service pack updates.  You never know when baan might fix the issue.<br />
<br />
Let me warn you; on one session I had to do this on, it would work for around 1000 transactions - then it would abort.  Somewhere in the service pack update this error or abort stopped happening.  We used to split the transaction files into pieces to process them.</div></div><hr />
