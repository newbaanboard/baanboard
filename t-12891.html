<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 02:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I originally wrote this progress bar for Baan IV, back in July 2002. But have recently seen a post by; 'Guillaume.G' where the question about progress bars in Baan IV was asked. A posting was made by Asterix, with a text file that contained how to do this.<br />
<br />
So have to give thanks to 'Markus Polzer' for letting me refine my original code (which was a little messy), to make the progress bar more &quot;functional&quot;... (See: Progress Bar in Baan IV (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8249))<br />
<br />
Thought that it would be handy, if anyone is interested in creating a progress bar on their Baan IV sessions...<br />
<br />
<br />
The best way to call this is by;<br />
<br />
- Following sets x postion, y position, size and colour, it does NOT create the progress bar, but just sets the settings of the bar... NOTE: if size is -1 then the bar takes up the entire width of the form (and the x position is ignored). If y position is zero, then the bar is placed at the bottom of the screen. This is the best example of it's use...<br />
igen0000.init.progress.bar(0, 0, -1, PBAR.COLOUR.WHITE)<br />
<br />
- Following creates the progress bar. Pass through the count of how many records are being processed...<br />
igen0000.create.variable.progress.bar(total.record.count)<br />
<br />
- Following updates the progress bar. Pass through the caption and the record number you are up to...<br />
igen0000.update.variable.progress.bar(&quot;Item: &quot; &amp; tiitm001.item, current.count)<br />
<br />
- Following destroys the progress bar...<br />
igen0000.destroy.variable.progress.bar()<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For more information, just see the comments in the attached text file (there are other functions that can be used as well, but they are documented in the text file)...</div></div><hr />

<br />
my apologies (but the attached file above, is pretty functional).</div></div><hr />
