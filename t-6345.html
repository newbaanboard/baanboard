<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">21st August 2002, 13:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Each customer has got good repository of reports (which may be standard / localized /customized ) which are useful in their day to day functioning. Now it is possible get any kind of graphs and charts from these reports in Baan with least effort / without any customizations or parallel development / without any implementation like effort. This maximizes the ROI for customer.<br />
<br />
The data dictionary dump of the session which enables this functionality is attached along with documentation (on functional description / installation procedure / ready graphs / FAQs on Chart manager). The fixed length table dump of tables tudll950/tudll960 also is attached which enables users to see the 50 examples of standard reports in which user can see the graph charts. The user should go through the word docs before installing /using the download for this purpose.<br />
<br />
The data dictionary dump is created with the help of Export Data Dictionary ttiex1280m0000 program based on sessions for package tu only. The tool comprises 10 main sessions. The programs which are created do not update / modify any Baan standard (including tools) tables. <br />
<br />
In technical sense, use of this tool means customization of report (though practically everything remains same and nothing major has been changed). If user wants to eliminate /exclude the graph /chart from the report and return to standard, all user need to do is to recompile the same (ttadv3130m000 - Baan Standard) or to exclude graph from the tool (tudll9160m000  customized session). This way user returns to Baan standard as is without any impact of this tool.<br />
<br />
In case  have any problems with installing and using the tool ,please write to us ( hitesh@jewelexindia.com ) . The dump is valid till 19th September 2002.</div></div><hr />
