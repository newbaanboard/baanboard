<br />
I have a specific requirement in which BillsofResources BOD is involved. What i want is to add user defined fields in the Lines Component of the BOD using extensibility. Now there may be multiple Lines in a single Header. I want to populate fields in a specific Line. How do i know which Line is being Processed. This is while i am sending a Sync BOD.<br />
<br />
Suppose there are 10,20,30,40,50 Position in a BOM BOD. I want to populate only position 30 in a BOD.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">20th March 2018, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Ajesh, Are you talking about user defined fields in tibom010? these can be added to the userarea on the operations level of the BOD. If you only want to do it for some operations only then you need to program this as an condition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">21st March 2018, 01:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes in user defined areas.But I need to add in a specific Line and not at header level..But how do I  capture info of a specific Line??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">21st March 2018, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">there is extensibility support with a UserArea on the operation level as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your replies..<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea how to.capture a specific line @ Operation level.<br />
<br />
Suppose I want to add user defined fields @ Operation line level ..Not @ 10 or 20 or 40 but only for 30 BOM Operation..How do I do that??<br />
<br />
Any idea how</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">22nd March 2018, 03:06</div></div><div class="posttext">My Problem is that in the Operations component, the program goes 4 times if the number of BOM Items is 4. But the tibom010.sitm is the item on which the change has been done and not the consumed item individually for each component. And incoming  tibom010.sitm <br />
 value is the same for each component.</div></div><hr />
