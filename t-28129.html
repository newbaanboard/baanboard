I need help to get my baan4c2 to work with API. I tried to copy baan4c4 apihand and apiserver to this server but it does not work and give me fatal error with tc.ignore.process.<br />
<br />
has anyone with baan4c2 used API before? can you put on this site all the objects in ttB40_c1\ottstp. The baan support guys asked me to update my server with latest libraries and patch updates, but I cannot because the solution 10923 says that I need to upgrade my portingset after i install that solution. I do not wish to upgrade portingset and cause other issues to arise.<br />
<br />
appreciate if anyone can give me the objects to make c2 work with API<br />
<br />
thanks n regards,</div></div><hr />

Contact baan or SSA for a solution.  Maybe they can provide some older objects for your version.  I am only leaving this thread open so others might provide a different solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The AFS functions run perfectly on BaanIV c2. To make it work, we did need to upgrade the Portingset as well as we applied all available Tools solutions. <br />
<br />
We did this approx. 2 years ago, and we currnetly have a number of high volume customizations based on AFS running live ...and they have been doing so for a long period. Lately we upgraded the standard program again due to problems (...limitations) with one specific new AFS based program. Again everything worked without problems after the upgrade. <br />
<br />
For your information the site in question is an extremely customized site - hundreds of standard Baan programs are customized and even more are added. So the reasons for NOT experiencing problems is definitely not that we're having a &quot;clean system&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unless you have a very special system, I wouldn't be too considered about upgrading the Portingset/Tools - but of course you'll need to test it...<br />
Go ahead, it's neither very complicated or risky as I see it.<br />

<br />
Can you tell me the solution number fo the portingset you used and also for the Tools solutions. Will it be many solutions? How many? Can i use the latest portingset for baan IV? or you tell me your portingset number.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />
