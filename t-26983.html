My wish is to read an ascii file which contains, these fields, PO number, Position Number, Packing slip number and quantity received in a ascii file. Now, how to do api call tdpur4120m000 and do receiving function automatically, after reading this file.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th April 2006, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend searching this forum for that session tdpur4120m000 - you will find plenty of posts.  It should give you an idea of what is needed to run AFS code(and you can strip out anything that has to do with ILC).  Also read the sticky thread at the top of the forum where there is documentation.  Doing AFS is basically read record, start session, put fields, process record and repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pedromrs</div><div class="date">28th April 2006, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">You can just do it by picking the code in this forum and removing the part relating to session tdilc4113s000. In that case you just have to handle field tdpur045.dqua instead of going all through the session. (assuming Baan IV)</div></div><hr />
