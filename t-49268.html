Trying to print order acknowledgement via an own made afs session <br />
This works  OK in worktop.<br />
<br />
In webtop the session prints, but after this webtop is hanging and you would have to close ineternet explorer. <br />
<br />
So the last command (in webtop) which is executed is : <br />
    stpapi.form.command(&quot;tdsls4401m000&quot;, 5 , &quot;print.data&quot;, print.mesg)<br />
after this nothing happens.  I know this because I put an end() just before  and after this statement). <br />
<br />
In my afs session itself I'm not doing any printer dealing like rprt_open / rprt_close etc. The printer must be filled in on the form, and is than taken as variable to the AFS session, which again works OK in worktop. <br />
<br />
<br />
Is AFS not to be used in webtop? <br />
How to debug a session in from within Webtop? <br />
Any ideas are most welcome!</div></div><hr />

Since we do not use webtop I did not persue this with baan.  Have you contacted support?</div></div><hr />

we had the same problem with other sessions-we got a new tools-solution which solved the issue. <br />
<br />
So check if you have the latest tools solution installed.</div></div><hr />
