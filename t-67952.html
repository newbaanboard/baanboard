The script looks like being developed by other people and hence has to be removed unless the original developers permit.</div></div><hr />

     Yes I know that someone else's work is not allow to post as a new utility. I had also not done the same thing. But yes I had used the someone's code which is working only in worktop (client) environment and also in Unix OS only. I had modified that code to work that utility in Windows Environment as well as in both mingle and worktop.<br />
<br />
You can remove this utility. I had just thought that this should be sharable which will help to someone and hence posted here.<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

No problems. You can always create a file transfer utility for Ming.le. Just make sure you use the template mentioned here Code &amp; Utilities Template (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=479)</div></div><hr />
