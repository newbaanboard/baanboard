<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rtylerdunn</div><div class="date">2nd May 2016, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We use BaaN 5c3 and have many repetitive processes (open screen, input name here, input date there, input invoice details, close window, open new screen, click here, click there ...)  In my previous Job, we automated much of the no-brainer work in SAP by using SAP's scripting language, which was basically VB for Applications.  We wrote macros for Excel and let it control the session in SAP so that form population and simple tasks that required multiple screens could be automated.<br />
<br />
Is that same sort of automation possible in BaaN 5c3?  Excel interconnection would be preferable, but any macro application that could accomplish the same thing would be very helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

There is a couple ways you can do this - call the baan session straight from an excel macro.  Or you can create libraries in the baan application (the library runs the session) and call the library from excel.  Never really been a fan of either method, but also never really had a reason to use it.  I believe there are a few people on the board that actually have VB developed interfaces.  <br />

Welcome to the board!</div></div><hr />
