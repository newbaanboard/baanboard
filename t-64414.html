I am trying to start a workflow when a SO/PO is approved. I know, no BOD is published before that unless we use LN Message.<br />
<br />
Now, I have successfully started a task for approval of SO/PO when the SO/PO is approved. But, what happens is, the next processess are not blocked by workflow, I mean, the user can release it to watehousing and can do all the other related activities. Is there anyway to block other activities until the task is completed through workflow?<br />
<br />
I have done this at PurchaseRequisition level, but it's not working in this case. Anyone has tried this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The requisition way of getting LN blocked while the appoval is pending in ION is not an optimal solution. There is a new tools feature in FP8, ttocm0101m000 and related sessions.<br />
This feature need application adoption which is only done for a few simple cases. The PO and SO approval flow is not yet supported as standard content.<br />
The available Document Authorization content is described in KB 1026816.<br />

Thanks for the response. Well, I had a big discussion with Infor on this. As for now, this is not included in standard LN was their response. We were amazed to learn this as SO/PO approval using workflow would be anybody's first requirement.<br />
<br />
Anyways, they seem to add this feature sooner. Lets wait for that. :)</div></div><hr />
