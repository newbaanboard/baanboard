<br />
I have created the workflow to approve customize SCA request and when user approves the task, I want to send approver's details back to LN in process BOD to update approved by field in custom table. How can I achieve this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there any way to process inbound process BOD in LN with the logged XI user instead of user who is specified in connection point?</div></div><hr />

Just check it and take the input in a Workflow input field and finally take it as a output field in the WF Output parameters. It should come in the chosen field in the process BOD.<br />
<br />
Once it is in Process BOD, you can take it and use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just Curious..Is there any way by which we can override setting in connection point? I mean, Process Inbound BOD in LN with logged XI user instead of user who is maintained in connection point.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">16th May 2018, 09:06</div></div><div class="posttext">In many standard BODs there is logic that takes the LastModificationPerson/IDs/ID and uses this user to process the BOD. So yes this is something you can implement as part of the BOD implementation inside LN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is something new to me. So, will i get value of logname$ equals to person ID of XI user while processing inbound BOD in LN? If possible, Can u elaborate more on BOD implementation (I mean, how can we implement this functionality in BOD implementation)?<br />
<br />
One more question, In IFS, person ID is set as an email address for each user. is it fine or should it be LN login ID?</div></div><hr />
