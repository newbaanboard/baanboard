It has stopped working after upgrading from SP21 to SP27. It seems it does generate the outbound but always comes back with a message that &quot;Report Name not Filled&quot;. AFSLOG does not say more. We have also installed the latest stpapi solutions. It only works if we replace tdilc4201m000 with SP21 object. One more thing, everytime we run this session the reports <br />
rtdilc420101000 and rtdilc420102000 are loaded in the background and keeps running. Any help will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrinmoygupta</div><div class="date">14th April 2010, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your inputs Mark. Both the posts originated from the same source.<br />
<br />
Along with SP-27 we’ve also installed latest tools and stpapi patches.  I’ve tried going back to older stpapi, it does not help. It is only when I go back to older outbound session object it starts working again. In all the cases it does generate the outbound and print the outbound but comes back with this message and also has both the reports running in the process list.<br />
<br />
This is what Infor support says<br />
“...customizations are not part of the Scope of Operations for Standard Support.<br />
The session in the AFS script is using a customized form which can not be supported...direct you to PSO department....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th April 2010, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep - that sounds like them.  Have you asked pointedly for the lastest version of the outbound program?  We also have customized the form - using qkey. I think we are going to SP27 later this year. Do you all own source where you might be able to see what the code is doing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There even seems to be a specific solution that could be causing the problem:<br />
Solution: 239302<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: <br />
&quot;Generate Outbound Advice&quot; (tdilc4201m000) <br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
If a customized report is added to the &quot;Generate Outbound Advice&quot; (tdilc4201m000) session, then <br />
the box to select the report is displayed multiple times. The user chooses the required report and <br />
after pressing the continue button, the box comes up again. <br />
When running the session for a new outbound run, without closing the session, the box comes up <br />
three times. <br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
Adaptations are made to ensure that a report menu box only appears once per print range.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st February 2011, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">More detail is that what we did before - was we ran the session twice to get all the reports.  One run got the advice and the error report.  The second run would get only the peg shortages.  I did not try to re-write the code to get all three reports at once.  Before this patch those routines would error out with report name not filled.  And now with the patch the old code works, so I left it alone.  Thanks again for the solution!</div></div><hr />
