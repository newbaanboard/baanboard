After I worked on it initially, I never went back to it. My users are happy with it. They have asked for improvements which were part of my initial design scope. Never got around to coding that stuff. Hopefully there are enthusiasts amongst you who will finish the project.<br />

Things to do:<br />
 Add Type-3 report support<br />
 Create output file in native excel format. To get specs on Excel and other spreadsheet/database program file formats go to www.wotsit.org<br />

<br />
With great interest I read your article about your product BaanXL at<br />
www.baanboard.com. It sounds realy good but I would have some questions for<br />
which I'm sure you can give me the answers:<br />
1) When I am using the logical BAANXL-Printer for the first time, I will<br />
have to state all the necessary information (as shown in your manual).<br />
Finally I have to save these defaults for this one report. Will every user<br />
now be able to print this report without stating all the necessary datas, or<br />
does the saving of the defaults apply only for me?<br />
<br />
2) Where are all these settings stored? (Is the report going to be changed?<br />
Are the informations stored in a special table?)<br />
<br />
3) Do I understand you correctly when I repeat the implementation like this:<br />
I have to create the forms like given in your &quot;forms.txt&quot;, I need two<br />
scripts (zusfw1400 and zusfwexcel) and finally I would have to create one<br />
session, called zusfw1400m000 (Format Data for Excel). And (not to forget)<br />
of course I have to declare one Printer.<br />
<br />
In advance many thank's for your request and your efforts!<br />
<br />
best regards<br />
Juergen Strasser<br />
<br />
Juergen,<br />
<br />
 When the BaanXL device is created if you do not specify a directory then the defaults would be per user login. They then stored in the user's home directory. I would suspect that you will want the defaults company wide. In this case please create a directory under $BSE named baanxl. In the device for arguments use BAANXL, ADMIN, ${BSE}/baanxl<br />
 See above answer<br />
 Correct to the part that you will need to create a session, four forms, two scripts. You will need to create atleast two devices. One called BAANXL and the other BAANXL-ADMIN (these two devices should ideally have the ${BSE}/baanxl. Optionally you can create two more devices named MYBAANXL and MYBAANXL-ADMIN. These devices will not have the directory specified and so can have user specific options.</div></div><hr />

we did it!<br />
With some changes we can use BaanXL for Baan IV.<br />
We did the following changes:<br />
<br />
Script zusfwexcel: <br />
Baan 5 : <br />
 start.session(MODAL,&quot;zusfw1400m000&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<br />

Script zusfw1400: <br />
Baan 5 : <br />
 (included in Forms definition)<br />
Baan IV: <br />
 in Choice Section<br />
   choice.user.0:<br />
   on.choice:<br />
      preview.report()<br />
   choice.user.1:<br />

   :<br />
Baan 5 :<br />
 before.display.object:, disable.fields and disable.commands	<br />
Baan IV:<br />
 not possible (and not yet needed)<br />
Baan 5 :<br />
 local.filename = &quot;${BSE_TMP}\&quot; &amp; strip$(str$(utc.num())) &amp; &quot;.csv&quot;<br />
Baan IV:<br />
 local.filename = &quot;${BSE_TMP}\&quot; &amp; strip$(str$(time.num())) &amp; &quot;.csv&quot;<br />
In function process.file:<br />
 Field separator &quot;,&quot; to &quot;;&quot; (because of the specifics of Excel)<br />
In function remove.commas:<br />
 Comma &quot;,&quot; to dot &quot;.&quot; (because of country-specifics)<br />
<br />
Additional to the steps in your documentation   we had to define:<br />
- domain zusfw.dtyp<br />
- question zusfw1400.1<br />
<br />
Thank you for your efforts!<br />

Fisrt, congratulations for your work, I think that is very usefull and interesting<br />

Questions:<br />

 Have you attached all four forms to the session? If you have, please check to see that the correct standard options for the forms are enabled. I believe all the options that need to be enabled are listed in the file forms.txt which is attached in one of the posts at the top of this thread.<br />
 disable.fields and disable.commands are BaanERP functions. If you are on Baan IV please look at the posting just above yours to see what changes need to be made to make BaanXL work for Baan IV.<br />
 zusfwexcel is a script of type '3GL (Without Stnd. Prgr.)'. We have this in a package 'zu'. You can have this in any other package .. for eg. 'tu' or 'tc'.<br />
[/list=1]<br />
<br />
Would someone who has gone through the installation of BaanXL be willing to write some documentation on installation.</div></div><hr />

USD 1,000,000.00<br />

<br />
Please let me know what direction you want to take. From first looks at the Microsoft website and the program that you quoted, it is Windows specific. Especially in its use of OLE. I have in the past looked at complete standalone programs written in Perl that do this.<br />
<br />
The idea of keeping BaanXL completely in Baan is extremely tempting to me. This is the reason why I had in the past chosen not to use the Perl program I quoted. If we can find a program written in C completely without using any APIs specific to a platform, our job of creating the BIFF in Baan would be easy.</div></div><hr />

    1 = Name of input (temporary) file containing report - argv$(1)<br />
    2 = Name of output file - argv$(2)<br />
    3 = Additional arguments (from Device data) - argv$(3)<br />
    4 = Specilar parm for ttstpconv (unknown reason) - argv$(4)<br />
<br />
Not sure what the &quot;argument = argv$(3)&quot; is for, but the wait.and.activate launches ttstpconv converts filename argv$(1) into a plain ascii format and places the output into the input.file file.  Does this answer your question?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using your program, when i print a report to Excel, does it launch Excel first?<br />
I need a program that just prints report to Excel format without lauching the Excel application and then user have to &quot;save as&quot; into a file.<br />
<br />
Best regards and thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Hi Vamsi,<br />
<br />
As an user, I have no access into the BaaN server to make any installation nor modification previlige. But I have to do my report in Exel format by downloading data from BaaN 5. <br />
<br />
The IT department either shortage manpower or don't care/no what todo. Leaving me suffer with the report in Excel format.<br />
<br />
After downloading from BaaN 5 to Excel, I had experienced the following issues:<br />
<br />
1. Two coluum from BaaN5 are merged  into one coluum of Excel after the downloading from BaaN 5 to XL completed.<br />
<br />
2. The order of each coluum from BaaN 5 are changed at XL.<br />
<br />
3. Word wrap will not work correctly when I tried to do &quot;auto coluum size&quot;<br />
<br />
Please give me a hint of how to do a one time set up on EXCEL side, to save alot of &quot;time consuming&quot; correction in manual mode.<br />
<br />
4. I am currently using BaaN 2 Excel software, however, how do I active the &quot;user configuration mode&quot;<br />
<br />
5. After downloading files from BaaN5 to Excel, the coluum order were different with the original file from BaaN5<br />
<br />
6. There are spacing in the coluum which I can eliminate. Because it will  make the characters in the coluum disappear.<br />
<br />
7. Alot more of the problem which I wanted to make job more simplerer.<br />
<br />
Please help<br />
<br />
Million of thanks Vamsi,<br />
