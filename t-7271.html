<br />
I am evaluating whether or not our existing group company setup can accomodate another company.  I understand that there are four requirements that determine whether or not a company can be used in an existing group company setup.  These requirements are:<br />
<br />
*Same Home Currency<br />
*Same Financial Periods<br />
*Same Dimension Descriptions<br />
*Same Home Country<br />
<br />
My question is, where exactly is the home country defined for a company?  Is this in the &quot;Maintain Company Data&quot; session?  Is this also where the currency requirement is defined?  Essentially I am wondering what four fields must be equal to the group company home currency, financial periods, dimension descriptions, and home country.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
You just need to create the new company and then preferably (especially tccom000) have the table sharing as applicable to other companies in the group company. Once you attach the existing group company to the new company automatically the properties (periods, dimensions) will apply to the new company.<br />
<br />
If your existing group company is not multi site, change the parameter to multisite.</div></div><hr />

Because of all the financial transactions going around, I can understand the need for the same home currency and financial periods, but the requirement of 1 and the same country drastically limits the possible use of this functionality.<br />
Multi-company/finance is especially very usefull for multinationals imo, but even for my simple company with a headquarters in NL and some sales offices abroad I cannot use this functionality:<br />
<br />
&quot;Home currency and country should be same as for group company    PRESS &lt;RETURN&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Even in a BaaN document about multi-site setup (U7031BUS) they use an example of multiple companies in multiple countries.<br />
