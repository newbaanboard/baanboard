<br />
I am trying to set up the BAAN CRM integration with Lotus Notes. <br />
The installation process is OK. The DBSync Assistant is installed. It is also configured to accept the integration with Lotus Notes. <br />
<br />
In BAAN CRM in the contacts form there is a new button: &quot;Send to mail&quot;. Suppose I select a contact and I send it to mail. <br />
<br />
In DBSync Assistant - Lotus Notes Tab , when I press &quot;Syncronize&quot; I get the error message <br />
 <br />
&quot;Error setting locale in Lotus Notes&quot;<br />
Error: 91 (Object Variable or With block variable not set)<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea why?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot !!!</div></div><hr />

It seems that CRM integration with Lotus Notes only works if the user has a local copy of his e-mail. It does not work if you are in the same LAN with the Domino Server and you read the e-mail directly from the server.<br />
<br />
Therefore I had to make a local Replica of the mail database. This Replica is scheduled to be syncronized periodically with the database on the mail server.<br />
<br />
Now the error message &quot;Failed to initialize Lotus Notes API&quot; is solved.</div></div><hr />
