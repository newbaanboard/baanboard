<br />
For Baan E-Collaboration a special EDI setup was present in Baan. This resulted in a 'pseudo' XML file that was sent to Baan E-Collaboration. On the E-Collaboration server a NT service was running that picked up XML messages from a certain directory. If this service found a message coming from Baan this message was first transformed in a real XML message (a start and end tag was added and all &quot; were removed from the message (because in the setup the tags are defined as fixed strings they contain quotes in the messages). <br />
<br />
I attached a part of the setup for a purchase order as an example.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did Baan not deliver any EDI setups for this purpose???<br />

I guess you must be using an EDI translator also. And EDI transalator can generate XML from ASCII and may be post also. Atleast my EDI translator can do that.<br />

thanks for ur replies.<br />
we have succeeded in generating XML messages through EDI.<br />
Along with iBaan B2B server, we get the edi setup. There is a file called defaults.edi that comes. <br />
when we import this in EDI module, we get all the default XML tags that are stored in tables. <br />
Then when we run the session, generate EDI messages, we are able to generate pseudo XML messages. (coz, all tags are separated by a delimiter). <br />
This we are able to send to iBaaN B2B server.<br />
<br />
thanks again<br />

If you want to convert ASCII format into XML , there are plenty of ASCII TO XML Coverter utilities available. Also some of the EDI Translators converts the ASCII into XML for the data transmission.</div></div><hr />

Its a little tricky I have done this with Baan Open world Broker<br />
What I did was to write the EDI message as a text file<br />
from Baan iv c4 to a specific directory. Then I let the <br />
Baan Open World broker read the EDI text file from that directory <br />
and converted the text file into tables.  I created the XML documents with SPY.  In Baan Open World Broker using its script I importer the XML document and converted that XML object to COM object.  Then I used DOM to write the values from the<br />
tables into the COM object (XML object). Then I saved the XML object to a directory that was later picked up by MQSeries. This process then ran all automatically using message featured and objects in BAAN Open world Broker.</div></div><hr />
