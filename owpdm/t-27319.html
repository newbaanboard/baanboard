I've started my bus component in Tmboaserver. However, when I try to connect to it using this command - jview com.eibus.test.regression.B3test &lt;component name&gt; I get an error Did not receive BusDoc before timer expired.<br />
<br />
However, in the tmboaserver I can see that it received the request.<br />
<br />
Any idea what is the problem?<br />

The problem was that I had different ldap.xml files on the server and client. The server was using bidisockets for the connection whereas on the client side I had it setup to use sockets. Since there was a mismatch in the protocol's the data wasnt being transferred back to the client.<br />

Thanks,<br />
