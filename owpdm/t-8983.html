querying Baan tables through the BDN/Toptier query<br />

<br />
What kind of solutions did you incorporate to overcome these?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
since nobody gave you an advise, I will try. I am not experienced with BDN/Toptier tools but have written a lot of SQL code in order to build reports.<br />
<br />
You have few possibilities to speed up your queries - creating additional indexes (they accelerate certain queries, but slow down the insert/update somtimes), using views (the advantage here is that you form the execution plan initally), reviewing the SQL query structure (reorder the WHERE clauses, stay away of ORDER BY if possible) and of course automating reports in non-working hours...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">28th May 2003, 00:19</div></div><div class="posttext">In the past I have experienced that if you use the level1 driver the queries are much slower then when using a level2 driver.<br />
<br />
At that time we tested the same query on Oracle (level 2), Informix (level1) and MSSQL7 (level1). Only the environment with baan on oracle was fast.<br />
If we executed the same query directly in MSSQL7 or Informix without going through the bdb-layer it was fast as well.<br />
This made is conclude that when using a baan level1 driver you could have performance issues.<br />
Like said before adding the right index can help, but it will make maintenance/documentation of the environment harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We did go the additional indices routesome time back.The risk is these indices being only in Informix (we added them at the database level) we have an extra level of caution to guard against losing them inadvertently.<br />
<br />
Again, this was a specific BDN/toptier situation and I am familiar<br />
 with the Baan query optimization procedures.</div></div><hr />
