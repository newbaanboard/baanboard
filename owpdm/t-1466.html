<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">21st March 2002, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
Should Customers of BaaNERP5.0c buy Open World Separately?<br />
If not, does BaaN5c has OW in it's entirety? <br />
Should the customer buy any accessories(viz... editor or connector or something), to work on OW?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

-iBaan OpenWorld Adapter<br />
-iBaan OpenWorld Broker<br />
-iBaan OpenWorld Studio<br />
-iBaan OpenWorld Gateway<br />
<br />
All the Baan versions lower than iBaaN , need to purchase OW components separately.<br />
Thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">25th March 2002, 04:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I lately heard from BaaN Company that Open World need to be purchased even if the customer is on BaaNERP5.0c with SP7. Actually SP7 of BaanERP5.0c is termed &quot;SP7 for iBaaN&quot;. BaaN is very clear abt selling OW, as the fate of BaaN lies with success of OW.<br />
I would like  to hear from someone who have worked on OW, preferably with BaaN5c.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Youp2001</div><div class="date">25th March 2002, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan OpenWorld products must be bought separately. Since Baan OpenWorld 2.2. the product is licensed so as from this version you really need to buy licences for the product to run it. <br />
<br />
Development in Baan OpenWordl cannot be done by just somebody. I think you need to be certified for that by Baan. Baan Openworld Studio therefor is only available for certified partners.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">25th March 2002, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I must disagree with you all.  Baan Open World is available from the ftp site.  As far as licenses I don't know if once you install it, it you need to license it or not.  It's in the update directory under openworld/221.  I believe it was just put there within the last 2 months.  There is an adapter for both baan IV and V.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">26th March 2002, 06:04</div></div><div class="posttext">can u furnish the ftp address here, from where u can download?<br />
It sounds incredible!!!<br />
It can be very helpful for lot of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeyaseelan</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 06:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked ftp://ftp.baan.com but unable to find OW components. Only log file is left out.hehe!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Youp2001</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 14:08</div></div><div class="posttext">It is correct that you can find certain components of the Baan OpenWorld software on the ftp site of Baan. I know servicepack 1 for Baan OpenWorld can be downloaded from this site (see solution 120827). However this is not the complete openworld product and you'll still need a license.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">29th March 2002, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The path to pickup the Openworld release 2.2.1 is <br />
<br />
ftp.support.baan.com  anonymous login<br />
<br />
/updates/OpenWorld/221/Unix<br />
                                        /Windows<br />
                                        /Documents<br />

I still don't know about the license issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">20th April 2002, 02:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep u definitely need to buy licenses to use OW. Infact u need a separate license for each component of OW ie Broker, Adapter, Studio etc ....<br />
<br />
Also in order to buy OW u need to have someone in ur company whoz certified in OW by Baan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Youp2001</div><div class="date">22nd April 2002, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to use the Baan OpenWorld products like adapter or gateway you don't need someone in your company to be certified. These products are available for anybody.<br />
<br />
However if you want to develop integrations based on Baan OpenWorld you need to buy OpenWorld Studio and for this the certification is required.<br />
