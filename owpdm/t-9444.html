I've installed BCK 1.3 as the Developer's Manual explain, and I can run the java sample application and the C++ sample application with success, but when I try to run the Visual Basic Sample I get the following message: &quot;Runtime error 430 &quot;Class does not support automation or does not support expected interface&quot;<br />
Can somebody help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

you can check your System classpath settings.<br />
From Vb, it calls the java classes. <br />
so you need to set the system classpath.<br />
<br />
Say, if you have the samples inside the folder D:\BaanConnectionBasicEdition\Samples\ccmcscurrrates,<br />
You need to set the classpath till D:\BaanConnectionBasicEdition\Samples\<br />
Also, you need to set the classpath for D:\BaanConnectionBasicEdition\<br />
as all the packages com.baan.tech.baanconnection are inside it.<br />
<br />
so after entering the classpath you can try running the samples.<br />
<br />
Also you can see ccmcscurrratesReg.reg and baanconnectioncom.reg files. <br />
You can take a backup of your system registry and then click on these two registry file entries. and then check.<br />
<br />
this VB program works fine for me. <br />
If nothing works, then try the same in a different machine. if that works then definitely some problem with system registry.<br />
All the best for your tries.<br />

Thanks<br />
<br />
By the way... I've compiled an IDL in BaaN (without problems), and I've created the TLB file on my system (without Problems again) but (maybe it's a silly question, but I prefer seem a silly man for a few minutes than be a silly all my live ;) ) How can i compile the .java files to get the .class files I need?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your Help<br />

<br />
  For compiling .java files, you need to have Java Development Kit(jdk). You can download one free from java.sun.com . <br />
In jdk, you have the java compiler(javac.exe).<br />
<br />
so you can compile individual files by javac xxx.java<br />
and group of files in same directory by javac *.java.<br />
<br />
hope this helps.. and there is nothing to feel silly in it. and all those beer/s you have for yourself. <br />
