<br />
Can anyone give me an example of how to use a BOI dll function in a standard Baan script? <br />
<br />
Any DLL function of any BOI would do.<br />
<br />
I want to import several things into Baan that come into ASCII files (and, for obvious reasons, XCH is not usable), <br />
but do not have experience using BOI's.<br />
<br />
I know this must be simple...after you know.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />

If you see BOI dll, they use a new concept in baan called as 'Container' which are like structures in C, in order to exchange data between applications.<br />
so if u want to use BOI dll in your external applications, then you should take care of creation of this containers.<br />
When you create a container, this will give you unique id  and then you should pass this unique id to BOI dll.<br />
I would say u open the BOI dll and then you will be able to find its working and then u can use it in your program script.<br />

<br />
Anyway, the problem is just that.<br />
<br />
I want to use the dll's internally in Baan. How can I call a function in a BOI DLL from inside a Baan script? <br />
<br />
I saw the BOI dll scripts and found that new structure concept. I need an example of how to call a function (and using the respective structure). <br />
<br />
I know this must be very simple but, I have no experience with this functionality.<br />
<br />
Can you (or anyone) help?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />
