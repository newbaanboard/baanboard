<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JerryGuo</div><div class="date">21st June 2003, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that OpenWorld families have several products, such as OW Adapter, OW Broker, OW Studio, OW Gateway and so on. <br />
<br />
They can integrate different Baan products, including BaanERP and iBaan CRM, BaanERP and SCS... <br />
<br />
But I found different integration uses different tools, for example, the integration between ERP and E-E (ERP/Webtop) uses just OW Adapter, but the intergration between ERP and iCRM (ERP/SCS) uses OW Broker, the Broker integration seems very complicated :(<br />
<br />
I wonder why different types of integration uses different OW tools? Can somebody tell me why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alkreddy</div><div class="date">10th July 2003, 07:10</div></div><div class="posttext">In simple terms, the nature of integration between ERP and Webtop is different from that between ERP and CRM.<br />
<br />
Webtop, in essence is like a front end application providing alternate user interface option for Baan ERP. So, webtop is always a client and Baan ERP the server, so, it is just sufficient to go ahead with Adapter for integration.<br />
<br />
Whereas, both CRM and ERP are business apps with their own data (databases), logic, UI etc. In order for these apps to collaborate, the simple capabilities of Adapter are not sufficient and hence, once needs to make use of the sophisticated, great Broker tool.<br />
<br />
Hope, this clarafies.<br />

<br />
ERP/Webtop<br />
ERP/E-Enterprise<br />
ERP/CRM<br />
ERP/SCS<br />
<br />
But I have never done it myself, I think I would be clear after working on it.<br />

Thx a lot</div></div><hr />
