<br />
I want to design an excel template with more than one tables (these tables have relation with each other). e.g. I want to create excel template with receipt table and item general table (as item field is the common field between these two tables) So that item description can be printed.<br />
<br />
Please guide in this regard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aamir_faried</div><div class="date">7th December 2010, 14:02</div></div><div class="posttext">HI guys, i have same question as Vishal had,  but i could not understand Hitesh Shah reply. As for my understanding, excel template is linked to a session and get and put values/data from/to session. It is Infor standard plugin/functionaly and do its job automatically. <br />
<br />
Do we really need to write separate sql in macro?? is it only solution ?????      <br />
Is there any standard functionality or trick that can be used instead to get multiple related table under some conditions.????<br />
<br />
is there any body who can help us to understand this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Report data does not get converted this way .  In such a case , SQL  in macros appears to be the only feasible  solution.<br />
<br />
May be somebody more expereinced can shed more info on this .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamdnb</div><div class="date">2nd May 2011, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume you are using Office Integration to design and publish the excel based templates.  The requirement mentioned by Vishal can easily be met.  While designing the templates in excel it displays all the related tables that has references with the main table i.e. in the example if we select receipt table, the item table will automatically get listed and one can select the required fields from both tables and design template as per their need.  Though I have not used office integration extensively, I faced the problem while placing the non-tabular form.  It is easy to design the template is data is to be retrieved in tabular format.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">4th May 2011, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Being able to convert tabular data in ERP (like in sessions , queries,reports etc) is an excellent value proposition. In fact key value of XL is in what if analysis and corner-stone of it is tabular data . So  if one could do any ERP tabular data conversion  to XL , this is what people  need . One must be very happy and celebrate it .<br />
<br />
And for non-tabular data other tools like baan native report , pdf output , notepad / wordpad output etc are better.</div></div><hr />
