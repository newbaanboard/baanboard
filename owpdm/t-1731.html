   We are trying to connect to two different Baan Systems using OpenWorld. The idea is to create a web based Sales Order which goes into Baan System A, and corresponding to it a Purcase Order goes into Baan System B.  It is a typical case of Intra Company Sales/Purchase.<br />
    Is there any way to do it as a transaction. We are using Open World for connecting web applications to BaanIvC. <br />
    Both the &quot;inserts&quot; are initiated by the web application.<br />
<br />
 Any pointers to Transacton Mgt capabilities using Open World would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
OW API does provide support for transaction management. How ever, it all depends how are you building your BOIS.<br />
<br />
1. If you are using DAL based BOI's, then you can very much make the entire process of creating PO and SO in different environments as atomic, by making use of transaction management support of OW.<br />
<br />
2. How ever, if you are using DLL based BOIS, then you need to properly design your BOI DLL's. Your DLL should not implement transaction management in terms of commit and things like that. Instead your DLL&quot;s should pass on the status back to your java client(from both the env's). Upon receiving these acknowledgements, you should invoke another methods( to actually commit  the transactions.<br />

Any more info, should you need, email me.<br />

Thanx,<br />
