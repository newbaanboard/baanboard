<br />
My customer wants to keep the running Baan logistics modules (ML:SF) alive, but integrate it with SAP FICO, which means that integration postings will have to go to SAP. All daily logistic matters will still be done in Baan. Purely financial matters will be handled in SAP FICO. This would mean some sort of interface, not only for integration postings, but also for the master data, which will most probably be handled in SAP, interfaced to Baan.<br />
<br />
I do have some ideas about it, but I am wondering if there is any experience around in this field.<br />
<br />
I would be thrilled with a quick reply, any ideas, hints &amp; tips are welcome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our finance departments uses the only tfgld410 (and referenced/related tables) for reading all stuff they need. The (pre-)account assignment is done in baan and the interface is certified by other accountant/financial auditors (hope this is the right word).<br />
One problem have been the incoming invoices. For this they also use tdpur045 in an oracle form. <br />
