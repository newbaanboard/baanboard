Has anyone experience on running OW and BCK -based integrations in the same Baan environment (BSE) ? Is this even possible ?</div></div><hr />

I recently had the same question and at to get an answer for this question I had contact with Baan. According to Baan it is possible to install BCBE and BOW in the same environment and use them at the same time<br />

Yes, I got a BaanERP 5.0c environment running with both OpenWorld as well as the BCK environment. Due to the different appoaches in OW and BCK (the first works through XML as the 'protocol' in combination with the tmboaserver at the server side processing the XML documents, the second works through Baan's propietary display protocol (DS)), the same applies to Baan IVc4. <br />
<br />
Only point of consideration when using OW and BCK in a combined way are the BOI components themselves. These differ from BCK to OW, however in general, this will not become a problem as long as the BOI-names do not overlap.<br />
<br />
Finally, the tools (stored in the 'cc' package) to create customized BOIs differ from OW to BCK as well. However, this seperation can easily be achieved by using the BCK tools in one package combination and the OW tools in another (possibly it is even possible to use both from the same PC, however I decided to seperate the two environments to avoid conflicts for now...)<br />
