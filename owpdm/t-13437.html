<br />
I need to propose a solution to a customer that want to connect a central SAP accounting system with Baan logistic systems.<br />
<br />
What about Baan Openworld and its SAP connector? Does this component give a value to the customer? It there any preconfigured interface?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, any info about costs and licensing? Hardware necessary?<br />
<br />
Every info will be appreciated and provided documentation as well!<br />
<br />
Thank you si much in advance.<br />
<br />
Ciao.</div></div><hr />

    If the customer has SAP and Baan. If customer need integratio between them. The SAP connector is your solution.<br />
<br />
   You don't need any other system or server for the installation. You can install the solution on any machine. <br />
<br />
   The connector also has its own tools which allow you to generate any SAP based BOI to use from Baan system. So what you need to do can easily be done using the SAP connector.<br />
<br />
   If you have any specific questions I can always help you.<br />

   Yes SAP has lot of good connectors, Like Business conenctor, Java connector, theya re also coming up with web services based connector. But Baan's SAP connector is the only one in which you can make baan act has a client.<br />
<br />
   Here is a scenario, As soon as Sales order is created in Baan you want to make a posting of financial transaction in SAP, real time. This is only possible using Baan's SAP connector. Try this with anything else and it is not possible,<br />

<br />
now I can be more precise.<br />
The customer has three Business unit that are running BAAN and two BU that are running SAP, he wants to create a central accounting department that will operate in a separate SAP company only on FI module.<br />
You can find in the attached document detail about data flow from the erp system and the central system.<br />
The solution could be BAAN OW adaptor on Baan side, SAP OW connector on other side and any broker system in the middle (BAAN OW for example) could it be feasible?<br />
One of the reason that the customer ask for BAAN OW solution is that he think that there is something already usable.<br />
What about the so called BAAN OW domains could sendo me a list of them or standard already working BOI from both BAAN or SAP side?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot again.<br />
<br />
Ciao,<br />
Lorenzo.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Whereas in iBaan OpenWorld Domain Pack 2.1 for iBaan ERP 5.0c I believe such breakdown is not there. It is one domain pack with all the BOIs.</div></div><hr />
