<br />
We have Openworldstudio2.5 installed and I am trying to create the Sales Pricing BOI using the studio, I am using the baan standard dll tdslsdll0001 ( search price matrix) to gererate the QCD and compile then QCD to get the client proxy BOIS(java classes). I did all the above but the class itself has 20 input variables. is it the right dll to use search the baan price matrix.<br />
<br />
I am sure some of you have already done this, any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">16th August 2004, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not worked with Studio 2.5 but the way it was done in OpenWorld 2.3 was that we created a custom BOI dll in Baan and that BOI will call the standard pricing DLL to get the pricing/discount information. That way we will pass on the Customer/Item/Price List etc parameters from the client (Proxy Java Classes) to our custom BOI dll and that will return us the correct pricing/discount information.<br />
<br />
I know that it was possible to create BOI dlls based on sessons but I didn't know that it is possible to create a BOI dll based on a standard Baan dll. May be it is a new feature in OpenWorldX or simply I was not aware of that.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this helped you but I thought atleast I could share my experience.</div></div><hr />
