does anybody have experiences with BaaN Open World in connection with BaaN IVc4 ?<br />
Is there something to take special care of when starting to implement BaaN Open World ?<br />
Handling, costs - benefits ?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to any reply (positive or negative) to this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan OpenWorld</div><div class="date">15th June 2004, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I've implemented OpenWorld 2.2 (HP-UX), 2.1/2.4 (AIX) and 2.5 (Win2k + HPUX) on Baan IVc4.  All were fairly straight forward.  There are some min. requirements like porting set, JDK version, and tools patches.<br />
<br />
What do you plan to do?  Do you plan to use the Domain packs and integrate to standard Baan using the standard BOI's?  Have you customized Baan, and want to develop your own BOI's? <br />
<br />
Which components of OW are you planning on using?<br />
<br />

Marco</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muetze</div><div class="date">16th June 2004, 08:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Well at present I do not have any experience in BaaN Open World. So I'm not quite familiar with the terms you are using.<br />
Sure we do have customizations which hopefully we can somehow also bring into this task.<br />
<br />
The main topics for this tool is a connection of BaaN to an E-shop, to a CRM software and to a storage management tool.<br />
<br />
We would like to use it on BaaN IVc4, Oracle 8 and Windows 2000 servers.</div></div><hr />
