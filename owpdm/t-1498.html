<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">26th March 2002, 06:22</div></div><div class="posttext">What exactly is iBaaN?<br />
Recently there is a string of products coming out of BaaN stable<br />
( Or is it just a change of name???? prefixed with 'i')<br />
<br />
BaaNERP 5.0c Service Pack 7 bears the name &quot;Service Pack 7 for iBaaNERP) Till SP6, it is BaaNERP5.0c and after that gets the name iBaaN?<br />
<br />
BDN became iBaaN BDN.<br />
BIS became iBaaN BIS.<br />
I am sure iBaaN Portal is equivalent to TopTier eBusiness Unification Portal (now SAP Portal)<br />
TopTier BaaN Data Navigator is now iBaaN BDN.<br />
And in iBaaN Portal, what if u want to integrate other apllications?(other than BaaN)<br />
TopTier had TopTier Web navigator to facilitate integration of other applications. iBaaN Portal has got rid of this layer?(WEB Navigator)<br />
I heard lately that SAP Portal now need not have as many Web navigator servers as there are applications, to be integrated.<br />
<br />
And what is this iBaaN?????? Is that just change in name???<br />
<br />
someone clarify pls!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">10th April 2002, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">This is quite right. IBaan is really just the next step in Baan 5's career. Take it to be almost Baan 6. It has greater interation with the web, designed more to the next generation of purchasers. <br />
<br />
Those that can get hold of the roadmap (not sure if it is available on the knowledge base or baan website yet) can see where it comes in line with future developments.</div></div><hr />
