<br />
can anybody tell me the exact table-structure of the database, that will be used by the BOW-Broker for logging and the &quot;Component Integration Subsystem&quot; ?<br />
e.g. BIS_RELATIONS <br />
<br />
I have to create the tables manually, because<br />
I set the broker up without having access to a ODBC-datasource and it started successfully.<br />
<br />
And I donÂ´t expect the broker to  set the tables up when getting started next time.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

<br />
can you give me more information? You mentioned that you have installed the BOW - witch version and why?<br />
<br />
The last weeks I worked on the integration of CRM 4.2.1 to BaaN 5 ERP.<br />
<br />
What want you to do?<br />
<br />
I think that I'm able to give you the specification of the tables mentioned in our question.<br />
<br />
Ciao<br />

<br />
we are looking to integrate the two products Baan 5c SP 6 and iCRM 4.2.1<br />
How was your experience? <br />
<br />

<br />
my experience were good. Our problem was/is that we are up to Baan 5 ERP SP7 and this did'nt work at the moment concerning the down and upload of quotes and orders - but they work on it.<br />
<br />
An other problem is that the integration uses Netchange (this is in fact the Problem with SP7) and that the use of Netchange isn't descriped very well in the implementation guide. I can give you some more information about this.<br />
<br />
My tips 1. Test the integration with an empty CRM database because the domian data are downloaded form BaaN - and make a copy of your CRM live Database before you try to get the integration live. Tip 2. install all software components of the integration server on a physical server and not on the CRM or BaaN server.<br />
