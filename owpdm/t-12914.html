<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marselhober</div><div class="date">10th September 2003, 08:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I have some very basic questions about iBaaN :<br />
<br />
1. What are the differences between BaaN ERP and<br />
   iBaaN ? <br />
<br />
2. What are the main features of iBaaN ?<br />
<br />
3. Our company implement BaaN ERP B50c. If we want <br />
   to implement iBaaN, what should we do first ? Any <br />
   preparations or requirements we have to fulfill ?<br />
<br />
Anybody can list me the answers ?<br />
<br />
Thank you so much</div></div><hr />

<br />
The i is only to document, that this is Internet enabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Gerhard, are you sure?<br />
<br />
We have Baan IVc4 and we have iBaan/E-Procurement. I can't say that they have anything in common. In iBaan, you must use Windows + SQL Server, there are only a few database tables, the complete application is based on ASP technology and so on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">E-procurement is only a small fraction of what Baan refers to as iBaan.  The core of iBaan is, like Gerhard says, the normal Baan software.  They just added some niceties, which they could have called whatever they want, but they decided to call the whole bundle iBaan...  so to implement iBaan, you have to implement Baan!<br />
<br />
And it is not really internet enabled.  It has some extras that can be done via internet, but nowhere near the complete interface.  Only if you could throw out the BW and use one of the standard browsers, an application becomes Internet enabled.  They should term it: Internet Add-ons Available<br />
<br />
What's in a name?</div></div><hr />
