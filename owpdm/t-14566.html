<br />
We are on BOW 2.1 and we are having one of the frequent problems with this and I've no clue why its happening. May be this forum, gives me some input.<br />
<br />
There were cases, where the BOW used to hang when there used to be requests coming at the same time for the same bus component. We then had to create additional bus components and it works fine. <br />
<br />
But, here's one unusual case. The requests are not many but it still hangs. One of the reasons might be Baan had heavy load that time. But, how its going to affect BOW when it has few requests?<br />
<br />
Another point is when BOW is running for quite a while,  when there was not much load and even when there were no requests, it still hung!!!<br />
<br />
I tried troubleshooting with whatever documents I've on BOW, but thats taking me nowhere. And, no where it mentions that, BOW requires this much memory at a given point of time. So, how one can determine what is the minimum configuration needed for BOW?<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help...<br />

<br />
Can you try starting multiple bshells and then start the buscomponents by spreading them over these bshells. Hopefully this will make it more stable. <br />
<br />
Also may be you should consider upgrading your OpenWorld version as one of the clients I worked with has OW2.3 and they have not complained so far about any problems and they do have lots of transactions. Just a suggestion ;)</div></div><hr />
