<br />
I have got trouble in getting SSA OpenWorld 2.6 up and going.<br />
My OS is Windows 2000 Server Standard Edition SP3, and database is SQL Server 2000 SP3.<br />
<br />
I installed License Manager client first. In the Licence Manager Client installation, it couldnot locate the License Server automatically. So I had to type it manually and add it in the License Manager. <br />
<br />
At the end of installation of OpenWorld, it raised some warning messages saying that it couldnot create some of the local users (EEAdministrator,EEGuest,EEUnknown etc). But in the installation log, it said that those users were created. But anyway, I created manually assigning the passwords which was mentioned in the installation log file.<br />
<br />
After installation, I tried to log as UID: administrator  and Password: baan, it said &quot;Error: Access Denied&quot; and there were some error messages in the event log which i attached to this email. It seems that we are having trouble with the License manager client but i dont know exactly what went wrong.<br />
<br />
The error message in the Event Log was:<br />
Prog	 E-Enterprise Server file \general\bclm\BclmProt.c # 2594<br />
Keyword	 BPSockSend<br />
Username	 EEUnknown<br />
Process	 0x408<br />
Lasterror	 0<br />
Errno	 0<br />
Message	 Failed to connect to 'rnzbn1.domain.rinnai.co.nz:6005' for operation '56'.<br />
 <br />
Also you can refer to attachments for error messages, they are screen shots.<br />
<br />
Could anyone please help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance  :confused: <br />
<br />
Regards<br />
