<br />
How many members actually use Front Office? I haven't seen Baan Front Office and I'd like to know how powerful it is and what it has to offer.<br />
<br />
What methods do people use for performance metrics? Sales statistics? I was working with Crystal Reports - tracking number of orders shipped on time per customer etc - all tied together in Excel with lots of links. Prior to that was an immense access database which EasySQL queries were put into. What are other people doing? Access with ODBC drivers / OLE?<br />
<br />
It doesn't seem the point of using Oracle when you create large Access databases as well but this seems to happen quite a lot and they can be quite useful! Has anyone any experience regarding these that they would like to share? It might be worth starting something in another forum about those!</div></div><hr />
