<br />
I am looking for somebody who has expirience with JAVA and Baan. On each Baan Installation there are some Java Classes on $BSE/internet and also a directory with an example.<br />
<br />
I would like to know how can I connect to Baan by using Java.<br />
<br />
When I have to use the netserver6.1 <br />
<br />
And general, how does it work?<br />

<br />
For BaanERP 5.0c. One possible solution could be:<br />
<br />
1. Use session ttstpcreatdll to create a Baan internal dll.<br />
<br />
2. The corresponding files will be written automatically somewhere under the application directory.<br />
<br />
3. With the bin/bic_jstub program it should be possible to create Java classes. <br />
<br />
See the BaanERP Tools for the documentation of the BI server and the bic_xxx commands.<br />

Try BaaN Business Objects (BOI's). Its very reliable and safest way of doing data insertion into BaaN and it wont affect the database schema also. BaaN Openworld adapter and BCK kit helps u in building BOI's.<br />

See wthether its recognising javac command. If its compiling properly then java is running fine. If not then there might be a problem in the java classpath settings.<br />
<br />
If u want to set the path permanently Choose settings, Control Panel, and select System. On Windows NT, select the Environment tab; on Windows 2000 select the Advanced tab. Look for &quot;Path&quot; in the User Variables and System Variables. If you're not sure where to add the path, add it to the  right end of the &quot;Path&quot; in the User Variables. A typical value for PATH is: <br />
     C:\jdk1.3.1_&lt;version number&gt;\bin <br />
<br />
Capitalization doesn't matter. Click &quot;Set&quot;, &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Apply&quot;. The PATH can be a series of directories separated by semi-colons (;). Microsoft Windows looks for programs in the PATH directories in order, from left to right. You should only have one bin directory for a Java SDK in the path at a time (those following the first are ignored), so if one is already present, you can update it to jdk1.3.1_&lt;version number&gt;. <br />
<br />
The new path takes effect in each new Command Prompt window you open after setting the PATH<br />
variable. <br />
<br />
If u still face any problems mail me with the details.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

We are running B4c4 and don't have that executable on our system? Do we need to purchase OpenWorld to get this bic_jstub program?<br />

Can somebody tell me how to call a BOI from Java? (analogue to the submit.function(...) function in VB)<br />
Can somebody provide me with an example of a Java Class calling a BOI (or any other DLL on the Baan server)<br />

when u create a boi for any session, it gives u a set of classes in java which has certain functions like create(), change(), list(), netlist(),delete().<br />
Using these classes we can write our own java client and execute the boi in baan.<br />
It is successful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mickbaan</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there an official release of the Baan.connect.* classes? in the $BSE/internet directory of our B4C4 system there seem to be different versions.<br />
<br />
Also (arun). Have you got a working example of a Java class communicating with a BOI?<br />
<br />
How does the connection with Baan take place? From Visual Studio you can start the BW client as a process to create an OLE link, does this work the same in Java? (baan.connect.connection.class???)<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunprasath</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 17:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi mick,<br />
after you install BCK(Baan connect Kit) , it has all the necessary java classes that are necessary to connect to baan. <br />
Here Java connection to baan takes place by implementation of the Display Server Protocol. <br />
BCK also gives a sample Java client. Apart from that I am also having some clients in Java.<br />
<br />
You can also write a BOI client in Visual Basic or Visual C++.  Also the method which u say is also possible through OLE. this doesnt involve BOI. Here we activate the baan client from vb and execute some functions in dlls.  <br />
<br />
Any responses welcome.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunprasath</div><div class="date">9th July 2004, 08:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Have you installed bck? BCK has got in itself set of samples for every type of client. That would give a better idea of how to integrate boi with other applications.<br />
And FYI I have moved out of baan quiet a long time back. Now I am into a different domain. I dont have any of baan's old code with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arend-Jan</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Tania,<br />
<br />
To connect to Baan via Java/C++/VB or .NET code you can better use OpenWorldX. This suite contains a BOI development studio (graphical) with several compilers (Baan, Java, C++, .NET). It also supports XML and SOAP messages. <br />
<br />
