<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lfhaddix</div><div class="date">8th November 2017, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to replace our existing MQ series integrations setup with C4WS webservices.  Some of our BDE's were standard BDE's that were modified for us by a contracting service and they do not show up for deployment.  <br />
<br />
The C4WS documentation says we can Import the Business Interface into the LN Studio, generate a WSDL and then deploy on the C4WS. <br />
<br />
Has anyone done this?  How do you know which one to pick from the list if the a BDE shows up more than once?   I cannot find the VRC definition associated with them to know which is standard and which is our custom ones.</div></div><hr />

This will help you to identify the BDEs' later in the Process.</div></div><hr />
