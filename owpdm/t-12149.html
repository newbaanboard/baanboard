<br />
I'm the System Administrator for our Data Warehouse system which is BIS (iBaan Decision Manager 2.2)<br />
<br />
Currently we've got all BIS templates installed + others written specifically for ourselves and we perform FULL extracts on a weekly basis.<br />
<br />
We're considering moving to Incremental processing, however we believe that to properly test Incremental processing in a static test environment will be a huge job + it will need application consultants for each functional area of Baan ERP to create appropriate transactions in Baan + it's not clear extractly what transactions would need to be created in Baan ERP ie. exactly what is transferred to BIS.<br />
<br />
Hence, we're considering just switching on the processing in LIVE (as the Baan extract sessions do support Incremental extracts).<br />
<br />
Does anybody else run BIS via Incremental processing ? If so, are there any lessons learnt, pitfalls to avoid, etc... Did you test this before switching on ? If so, how ?<br />
<br />
Also, I'm trying to understand who uses BIS and what size of warehouse you have + what's the configuration of you're BIS server ,etc...<br />
<br />
If there are any other BIS administrators out there, can you post a reply to this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and any help is greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />
