<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sat100</div><div class="date">3rd December 2005, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">One of our clients reads data from an  Oracle database and sends order information to Baan through Connector for Java adapter for Open World. Some of the cities have European characters (ex. City KÃLN in Germany). XML parser on the server side chokes at the character Ã and gives a parsing error - <br />
&lt;error&gt;Error in parsing message: Line: 2;Col: 1381; not well-formed&lt;/error&gt;. <br />
<br />
When parsing error happens, exception is not thrown to the client. instead, the client is made to wait for time-out indicating that server side process is hung. I could see that this happend due to parsing issue by looking at server side adapter log. This is the first problem.<br />
<br />
The second problem is the XML on server side log shows %16 for character Ã <br />
&lt;SoShipToCustCity&gt;K%16LN&lt;/SoShipToCustCity&gt;. Why is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sat100</div><div class="date">3rd December 2005, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">The OW version we are using is 2.6.1</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a common encoding problem. Your client is reading data with UFT-8 encoding from Oracle and tries to load it into a system which ist set up for  IS8850-1 or a similar one byte encoding. The name of the German City in question is actually KOLN (Cologne) where the O has two points on top of it (Ö if your browser kann show it). In UTF-8 is this charachter represented by two bytes  C3  and 96 . Charachter K, L and N are however represented by one (good old ASCII) byte each. A parser expecting ISO8850-1 encoding however expects one byte pro character. and interprets the sequence of bytes as: K, Ã, (a control character 96), L and N.  It should be this control character that actually makes the parser choke!<br />
<br />
The solution ist to covert the data read from Oracle to ISO8850-1 encoding before supplying it to Open World. Maybe it can be done in the connector itself by changing  its configuration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sat100</div><div class="date">4th December 2005, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, something like that is happening. When I look at the client side adapter log I see that character as  which translates to unicode 0x16, which is an invalid XML character and as a result server side parser is accurately giving the error message (I wish this was conveyed to the client as an exception rather than going into hung mode causing time-out). <br />
<br />
I will try using the encoding you specified before passing the data to OW connector and see if that works.</div></div><hr />
