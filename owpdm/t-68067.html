I think that is good for non customization implementation.<br />
Could you tell me how to do it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What kind of Web-message is it? What are you looking for?<br />
<br />
You can use inbuilt Soap Based functions in LN to invoke a web-service which can send your messages or do anything you want it to do. LN has soap.* functions built in. Not sure if this is what you are looking for.</div></div><hr />

Make new form which has key information and the session send WEB message to it's self.  It just like a AFS process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The requirement is not clear yet. When do you want to send the message to itself? Aren't there any better ways to do what you are looking to do? Probably adding a session to job or something like that? If you can explain the requirements someone might come up with a better solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SWO_hayashi</div><div class="date">25th August 2015, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically the WEB interface is used to connect to another software.<br />
I just want to use C4WS to connect user interface and Database only.<br />
I want to make easy entry form, because LN session has too much fields and many functions.<br />
AFS programing is the way I know.<br />
But I would like to know C4WS can be instead of AFS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a standard document Infor Enterprise Server Connector for Web Services Administration and User Guide(U9209JUS) which explains how and where you can use C4WS. What you are looking for can be done with C4WS. Just go through the document to get some ideas.</div></div><hr />
