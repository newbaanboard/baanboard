My company is considering the move and I would be grateful for comments / queries / issues from anyone who has already undergone this change.</div></div><hr />

For an average sales guy excell (pivot functionality) is much easier to learn and understand than the edm client (which from an IT point of vue could maybe be more powerfull)</div></div><hr />

Also concerned as Crystal seem to change their modules at each release which might result in additional resource to update</div></div><hr />
