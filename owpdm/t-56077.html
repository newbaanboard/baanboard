<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rahul.kolhe22</div><div class="date">9th June 2009, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
       I will first explain the process:<br />
<br />
1. User enters the production order (Baan dll is called)<br />
2. Then the user is displayed the order details<br />
3. Then the user enters the quantity completed and sets order as complete &amp; says OK (Bann dll is called)<br />
4. User is taken back to the first screen.<br />
<br />
My problem is:<br />
1. I enter the valid production order (Bann dll is called)<br />
2. I enter completed quantity &amp; sets order status to complete &amp; says OK (Bann dll is called)<br />
<br />
The above order is completed.<br />
[Here if I say &quot;Yes&quot; for Backflushing question I have the below written problem] <br />
<br />
3. I again enter the valid order (Baan dll is called)<br />
4. I enter completed quantity &amp; set order status as complete &amp; say OK (Here the baan dll is not called &amp; I get the timeout error)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This problem I dont face if I say no to backflushing.<br />
<br />
I even tried to check the process (using ttstpshell), if any of the process may be started but not ended. But I cannot get any clue<br />
<br />
Is there any other way by which I can know why the call is not going to Baan. <br />
Or <br />
When the baan dll is called, how many of the processes are started and what is their status (means are they stoped or not).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are welcomed<br />
<br />
