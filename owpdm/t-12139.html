<br />
We've come across a limitation in OLAP cubes that only allows 64000 children for a single parent in a dimension (OLAP 7.0 SP2).<br />
<br />
Currently to fix this we either need to delete the dimension or re-structure it. ie. identify and add new levels to split the data into smaller categories<br />
<br />
We believe from various documentation that this issue may be fixed by upgrading to SQL 2000 and Analysis Services .. there is some kind of fudge that allows a dimension to be linked to iteslf ??<br />
<br />
Has anybody come across this problem and resolved it within either OLAP 7.0 or Analysis Services ?<br />
<br />
If there is a fix in Analysis Services, is it fairly straight forward to implement ?<br />
<br />
Any assistance in this would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

See: http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q303/9/69.asp<br />
<br />
In SQL7 you would need to add a higher level in the existing dimension.<br />
