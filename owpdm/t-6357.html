Our company has purchased open world and I have started wading through the documentation however I am still confused about exactly what I need to install to communicated to BAAN via the XML gateway.  Do I need both the adapter, studio and gateway installed on every client to connect to the gateway?  Maybe I just need a general overview of how it works.<br />
<br />
Thanks..<br />

    You will need to install Openworld adapter and Gateway on machine from where u want to access the data from baan through gateway.<br />
<br />
     Now having said that you have lot of options for configuring the whole environment. <br />
     <br />
     You can have one machine with OW adapter and gateway and all other machines can access information via the gateway machine(via http-web, Sockets, MQ series or FTP). This is the way to run Gateway out of process this the way Nortel Network uses OW gateway.<br />
