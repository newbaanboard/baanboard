<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bvallepalli</div><div class="date">9th March 2004, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have my customers login to our website and look for their Invoices and Credits from Baan within the given time range. When a user clicks on a particular Invoice/Credit number, I run the standard Baan reprint Invoices session in the background through a function server and convert this output to a PDF file and launch it in a seperate window.<br />
<br />
This works fine in normal cases. But when I simultaneously click on 6 to 10 different Invoices/credits, it always loose one request with a time out exception (The bus component shows the right number of calls made to Baan). There after it runs one call behind. 11th request will show the results of 10th request and so on untill I restart my tmboaserver.<br />
<br />
I ran some tests and figured out that the problem is some where in handling the files. <br />
<br />
1. I capture the report file from ttaad320 (Printer queue) for the current user.<br />
2. Create a unique temporary post script file and convert the report output to post script file.<br />
3. Use ghost script to convert this post script file to a unique pdf file.<br />
<br />
I even added a suspend() call to make the process wait for a while after Post script conversion and after pdf conversion. I am not even deleting any of these temporary files created in this process.<br />
<br />
I didn't want to post this in Openworld/Function server discussion as I think the problem is somewhere handling these files.<br />
<br />
We are on Baan5.c/SQL/Openworld 2.0/com dll for the webserver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bvallepalli</div><div class="date">11th March 2004, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that each time a call is made to the BOI from Web page, tmboaxmlhand will be running in the background (Shows up in the current processes run). If I close my bus componenet (tmboaserver) and web page, this should kill this process. That's not happening here. I can still see otmboaxmlhand running and this is creating the problem. <br />
<br />
I have a time out on my ASP page which I changed back to something greater than what I have in the adpater.<br />
<br />
I feel some thing is not handled clean in BOI or the Inter process communication between ASP and Baan is not as expected.<br />
<br />
I am sure that this thread can now be moved to Openworld forum.</div></div><hr />
