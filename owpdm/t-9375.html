<br />
With 12 CPU's, I feel pretty screwed with a $20,000 per CPU license.<br />
<br />
Or do I just don't get it and can I run a single CPU license on a 12 CPU machine?</div></div><hr />

   I don' t think you can do much about this. Lot of customers have protested about the same with Baan. But I am not sure if the licensing model is going to change. If you have 12 cpus then you will have to pay for all. Maybe you can talk to Baan and check if they can give you any discounts and all. <br />
<br />
   But in short as per the rules, there is no way out.<br />

<br />
What ab't creating a new Baan Application Server (Fat client) with 1 cpu and connect the Fat client to the DB server<br />
<br />
In this case OW processing power is limited to 1 cpu but u can<br />
access the same DB server</div></div><hr />

<br />
cause OW (Broker) runs only Windows Systems you need'nt have care about the CPU of your Baan Server.<br />
<br />
Normally you install an OW-Adapter on your Baan System (does no matter if it's unix or windows) and install the Broker as a Service on a so called Integration- or Broker Server on a Windows System (that's the only supported Platform).<br />
<br />
So the licence price of OW depends on the CPU of the Integration Server and the quantity of the CPU of the Integration Server depends on the work OW as EAI-Tool has to cope with and the speed you like to have in your EAI-Process.<br />
