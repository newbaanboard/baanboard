<br />
Does anyone know if OpenWorld is being offered at no charge by SSA Global for companies with current support agreements?<br />
Does anyone know what the current status is and if this only applies to the Baan OW adapter or to the whole suite?<br />
<br />
Any information would help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

We just bought OpenWorld and its components few months ago, although we do have a support agreement as well.<br />
<br />
SSA do offer OpenWorld runtime components for free with the applications that require OpenWorld for their integration with Baan, such as Baan E-Enterprise and CRM applications.</div></div><hr />
