<br />
I am working on BCK 1.3 with Baan IV c4 with Windows NT. I had developed a few BOI COM proxy objects and were working fine.<br />
<br />
Now I am working under a new environment on a new server with Windows 2000 and BCK 1.3 and Baan IV c4. I have re-done the BOI COM proxy objects and now am facing the following issues-<br />
<br />
1. The javac compiler (jkd1.3) is not compiling the .java files generated ... it gives error even for the BOI sample provided :<br />
<br />
.\ccmcscurrrates.java:13: duplicate class: ccmcscurrrates.ccmcscurrrates<br />
public class ccmcscurrrates<br />
       ^<br />
ccmcscurrrates.java:6: package ccmcscurrrates clashes with class of same name<br />
package ccmcscurrrates;<br />
<br />
2. If I change the package name and regenerate the .cfg, .odl and .tlb files it allows to compile. Now when I refer the library in VB6.0 and run the program it gives error-<br />
<br />
Runtime error &quot;430&quot; Class does not support automation or does not support expected interface.<br />
<br />
I am using MDAC 2.7. What could be the problem ?<br />
Any help much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am using the same jdk1.3 as earlier. If I change the package name all classes are generated. But it gives this error when running from the VB project.<br />
<br />
Is there something to do with the OLE server ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I remember doing some research on it and if you do a search on Google on this, you will find a number of reasons why this error could happen. One thing that you could try doing is to use a java based client for this call and see if it works. Atleast that way you will make sure that there is nothing wrong in generated java code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry ... I forgot to mention that I have tested the BOI with a java client and it works perfect.<br />
<br />
Also I tried searching on google..... the runtime error 430 takes me to mostly to the fact that the MDAC is not update. In my case MDAC is already at 2.7.<br />
<br />
Any other possibilities ? B'cos I am really surprised to find this error.... never seen such before. Also the sample provided works well in VB client... thts strange... this probably means that the COM interface classes are not getting generated correctly!! Anything to do with the jactivex and mktyplib versions ??<br />
<br />
Any help much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
