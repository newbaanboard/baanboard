<br />
Has anyone installed webtop 3.0 for Baan IVc4 successfully?<br />
I searched on other threads but could not find any answers.<br />
I have tried to install the webtop and would like to test it on the local LAN<br />
<br />
These are my steps:<br />
1) Install IIS<br />
2) Install JVM<br />
3) Install Tomcat<br />
4) Install webtop<br />
<br />
What are the next steps? How do I configure it for the local LAN?<br />
What should be the URL for the user to connect to the Baan Server?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nneilitz</div><div class="date">6th July 2004, 22:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I've installed it as we are working on converting to c4, it wasn't too bad.  I would following the provided instructions on the CD, they provided just about everything.  Really only stumbling blocks where finding and starting tomcat for me and some problems with a custom program that was attached to user logins.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT<br />
On the Baan Application Side<br />
You will also have to be up to BaaN SP16 which just started shipping (or patch 15 with some weekly downloads). SP Solutions necessary are given in install instructions<br />
<br />
In addition you have to be on nearly the latest porting set. (I think either 6.7.2 or 6.7.3 works)<br />
<br />
SOME KEY STEPS<br />
Make sure Tomcat service is up and running before going to far (in additional being installed).  You should be able to bring up the web page (include the port in the URL).<br />
<br />
look to apache sit for help. http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-3.3-doc/tomcat-iis-howto.html)<br />
<br />
Move webtop.war to directory, stop and restart the topcat service.  This should install webtop.war<br />
<br />
I know this is really brief but it's been a while and instructions really are pretty good (once you find them on CD) If you need any help let me know.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
I read the document about Tomcat that you attached but too complicated.<br />
Could you write down the simple steps for getting the webtop to run. I would really appreciate that.<br />
By the way, what is the name of the document in the CD that you talk about.<br />
I cannot find it.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">member2002</div><div class="date">11th July 2004, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Upgrade to service pack 15 for tools and then install the solution 140164 <br />
2) Upgrade application to service pack 14 (13 as we have done only upto 13 and baan recomends 14).<br />
3) Download the latest porting set 6.1c.07.04 or 6.1c.07.03<br />
4) Download and install (just it is botton clicks) buildGY0114 from support site.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now u are ready to work with webtop 3.0 .. we have done so and it works fine in our case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ericthomas</div><div class="date">15th July 2004, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">1.Get the Webtop CD's from Baan support as you need to sign some agreement(no license cost plus first year support is free).<br />
2.Run the SSAWebtop.html and install the SLM(license manager) first.<br />
3.Read importantNotes.htm<br />
4.Stop the IIS server to test the tomcat web server as it listens on port 80.<br />
you may cange port later.<br />
5.Start the SSA Webtop installer for Win32 platforms go with defaults.<br />
You can read the Installation &amp; Configuration guide which shows step by step setup procedure. <br />
6.setup creates few icons on the desktop, Run the tomcat first and see it shows no errors on the cmd window.<br />
7.Click the webtop admin login shortcut (Webtop Admin login),type in the password you typed during the setup. You can follow the documentation to do the initial configurations which are quite easy steps.<br />
8.If you havent got the webtop build GY0114 then download it from <br />
/ftpdownload/updates/webtop/GY0115/SSA_Webtop__3.0_buildGY0115.zip <br />
(Size: 98290 KB). update is run automatically and explained in documentation.<br />
9.It is windows so reboot as many times as possible to clear unknown errors.<br />
 <br />
On the baan side<br />
I have done  with the following<br />
1.Porting 6.1c.7.03 and sp15 <br />
2.Tools standard 143492.  <br />
3.Dem in webtop 144611.<br />

6.run ttconwebtop on baan to convert/enable sessions to be used with webtop.<br />
7.In user management startup tab click the webtop for the user you want to test.<br />

<br />
I already installed SLM on my baanserver. But seems cannot use the MMC.<br />
Can you guide me on how to do the SLM configuration outside MMC.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have upgraded to SP15 and also portingset 6.1c.07.03<br />
Also installed 140164 and 143134 solutions.<br />
<br />
Now I have also installed the SLM into our baanserver.<br />
After this step, I am suppose to configure SLM using MMC<br />
But I am having error &quot;snapin failed to initialise&quot;<br />
&quot;-name : - not available&quot;<br />
&quot;CLSID: &lt;long numbers&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
This is why I need another way to configure or do you know<br />
why I cannot add the snapin.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />

Also you check by restarting the pc. SLM installtion is strightforward and you need administrator right on the pc where you installed it.<br />
<br />
After all these check if it is not working then uninstall the SLM and log on with administrator account and try.<br />

<br />
if i connect via iexplore from another client, i get always after<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">2nd August 2004, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Refer to the SSA Webtop 3.0 - webtop-faq<br />
<br />
1. The login dialog box does not appear <br />
This can have various causes. Please check the following points: <br />
<br />
Check whether the Sun Java Plugin is disabled: <br />
- Go to Control Panel <br />
- Double-click the Java Plugin icon; if it is not there, the Java Plugin is not active. <br />
- Check the Browser tab <br />
- Clear Microsoft Internet Explorer <br />
<br />
5. Does Webtop work with on the Mac through Internet Explorer?<br />
Internet Explorer is available on the Mac. However, Webtop does not run successfully in this version of Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
6. Is Netscape supported by Webtop?<br />
Provided the market requirements do not change, the Webtop team has no intentions to enable Webtop to support Netscape. .<br />
<br />
And some more info in the release notes -<br />
<br />
2. Internet ExplorerIE 6.0: Webtop only runs in Internet Explorer 6.0 (or higher). <br />
Java Virtual Machine : Internet Explorer must use the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine. It cannot work with the Sun Java Virtual Machine. If you cannot run the Webtop, check your Virtual Machine settings: Tools menu|Internet Options&gt; Advanced. Make sure the Java (Sun) is NOT checked.</div></div><hr />

It seems webtop is not free anymore. Have to pay maintenance of USD 3000 to SSA if you want to validate the SLM to work.<br />

What are your comments?<br />

- The first year of the support for Webtop is free. Going forward (from the second year), have to pay the support fees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a question about the Webtop. and the question is that if there is an in-house development then will it work with the webtop or only standard sessions are working with webtop?<br />
<br />
Details<br />
We have some in house and third party developed modules for LC, LG and an add- on Cable Solution from Proloq running in BaaN 4 c4 so the question here is that whether these extra sessions and modules which are not standard Baan sessions and modules will work with Webtop or not?<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance.<br />
<br />
Nadeem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">10th April 2009, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Nadeem,<br />
<br />
All sessions in your custom package/module/VRC should be working in Webtop too as long as they are WebTop enabled and comply with the programming standards.</div></div><hr />
