<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamdnb</div><div class="date">14th April 2011, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to make use of OpenWorld Adaptor for building an interface with Baan.  Infor Integartion 6.1 has the capabilities to generate proxies for .net which can be used by the .net code to access Baan DLL to execute the desired functions.  The data between two applicatons is exchanged using XML datasets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rket4u</div><div class="date">29th November 2011, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">there's a limitation on using the COM object in ASP.NET, which is what I was attempting to do.<br />
<br />
It would have been nice to make the BOI connection right from within the code-behind for my web page that I'm developing, but I'm not finding any information about it.<br />
<br />
I haven't taken the sage class, however my predecessor left the BOI Programmer's Guide from when HE took the class, which I have gone through extensively (to the point of correcting all the typos and bugs in the book).<br />
<br />
When I attempt to create the object from within ASP.NET, it gives me an error that it can't create the scripting object.</div></div><hr />
