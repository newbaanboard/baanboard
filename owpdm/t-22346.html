We enjoy the program very much, but there are a few things we would like to do extra with BAAN.<br />
<br />
We want to access the BAAN database via the internet. We want to create our own webapplication that communicates with BAAN so we can get data out of BAAN and put data into BAAN.<br />
<br />
Is this possible? And is there a connect module that allows you to create your own webapplication, and that takes care of the connection between the internet and BAAN? Please advice, we dont know what kind of tools there are around for BAAN!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

You can create custom session with required Form layout and then call the session in the webtop. But, this will work only when the Baan data is being looked by your Baan users.<br />
<br />
For generic two way connection, you can go with OpenWorld. It is a real-time connection. For eg, if you send data for creating Sales Order, you can get the created Sales Order Number or any specific error message encountered while creating the order.<br />
<br />
PS: If it need not be any real-time connection, just to show data and also update data (in batch mode), why can't create PHP or ASP pages which directly interacts with the database itself. Create custome tables for data going in and going out. Use customized Baan session to update the required Baan tables.</div></div><hr />

To create my own web application that connects to my baan db and that can get the information out of the db and store information into the db?<br />
<br />
A company came to us with a 'connect module', but they only wanted to sell it to us if they got the project for creating the web application. Do we need this 'connect module' or can we create one by our own? <br />
<br />
For intern process we can use webtop, but we also want the customer to access certain parts of baan to place orders, check some reports and other stuff, we can do this by creating a web application, but the only thing I'm concerned about is how can I access Baan via our own webapplication? <br />
<br />
Please help and tell me if it's possible what I want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For your internet application you can easily use OpenWorldX. Within OpenWorldX you will have the connectivity tools, development tools and standard web applications. All these tools are modular. The OpenWorldX connectivity tools are the tools with a deep and native integrations into the Baan application. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of customers that build already their sales order entry application for real-time integration towards Baan IV and other Baan versions<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

<br />
That sounds great! So where can I get OpenWorldX and what does it cost?<br />
I see you have a Dutch name.. is it possible that I contact you so I can ask you a few questions? I'm also Dutch.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your answer,<br />

I was under the impression that it was full fledged read-write thin client access to Baan, including Baan IV.</div></div><hr />

Webtop is read-write thin client. Another client to Baan similar to BW, BX and BI.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arend-Jan</div><div class="date">23rd November 2004, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not say that Arjen. It is 100% read/write and has full access to Baan sessions</div></div><hr />

At present we are getting 15-16 thousand lines from web or 1400 Sales orders from the web. In our warehouse, most of the transactions like Items enquiry, lot changes, pick lists etc process through scanners. Open world is vital for our company now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arend-Jan</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">BOW is realtime. But I guess that you use a Broker inbetween WMS and Baan, which pull's or remaps data.<br />
<br />
But BOW is for sure real-time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shasbe</div><div class="date">8th May 2005, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Arend. Openworld is a set of tools. It is not just 1 tool. It has various components like adapters, connectors, Broker etc... Broker is hub and spoke kind of product. That means mainly works like a batch mode tool. Whereas OW Adapter and Conenctors are realtime tools. They allow you to make BOIs for Baan and call them from interfaces via Java, Com, Baan to call these BOIs in real time. <br />
