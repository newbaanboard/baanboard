<br />
Can anybody help ?<br />
<br />
We currently have Decision Manager 2.2 installed on an NT Server (NT 4 with SP 6a).<br />
<br />
We also have SQL server 7.0 and OLAP 7.0, both with SP2 installed.<br />
<br />
We have 4 GB of physical memory installed and 4 x Pentium 3 700MHz CPU's.<br />
<br />
We have all the templates installed (customised) and the size of our warehouse is about 30GB (if we do full extracts from Baan ERP, the total size of the extract files about  6GB and growing).<br />
<br />
We've been running with iBaan Decision Manager for the last 18 months.<br />
<br />
We are using the DM2.2 utility to 'Process Cubes' and we are finding that OLAP regularly crashes (ie the Service MS Sql Server OLAP Service crashes).<br />
<br />
The majority of crashes occur when the memory for SQL Server is just short of 2GB and we are processing the Cubes... although it does sometimes crash when users connect and start accessing OLAP (ie. no processing on the server)... and sometimes there is lots of memory available and it crashes... also, it sometimes crashes when running ETL Runner (ie. when loading the warehouse)<br />
<br />
We believe that if we upgrade to SQL Server 2000 and Analysis Services, that these problems may be resolved as Analysis Services and SQL server can be configured to use more memory and they are more stable than SQL 7<br />
<br />
Does anybody else have a set-up similar to this (ie. hardware, SQL 7, data volumes being processed, etc..) ?<br />
<br />
Is  anybody else experiencing problems with OLAP crashing ?<br />
<br />
Has anybody upgraded from SQL Server 7 to SQL 2000 to get round these kind of problems ?<br />
<br />
Does anybody have SQL Server 2000 and a large warehouse ? If so, are you finding that you've got performance problems in extracting, loading and processing the data ?<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be greatly appreciated ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
