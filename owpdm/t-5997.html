What is the minimum infrastrucure required to install iBaaN products on a machine, and is it possible to install more than one iBaaN products on a single machine!?</div></div><hr />

About one year ago, we started that product on a single machine (512 MB memory, single processor), but that had very poor performance. Now we have two machines each 1 GB memory, one running as database server and one running as web server -- the performance is now acceptable.</div></div><hr />

The performance was also poor. While running such things as MRP - we always had <br />
in UNIX prompt sar 2 3 - idle 0. Now we have two servers - both SUN ES Ultra with almost full infrastructure and the situation is stable enough. Note that the performance also depends of what is installed as RDMS - if it is Oracle pay attention that this one requires a lot of resources to run properly to say nothng of tuning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it is possible... but depending of the needs you have (kind of iBaan product, number of users, security...). For instance, I have a demo server with the B2BServer (application and database server on the same server), BCLM Server, and the openworld adapter to communicate with ERP... The server runs like hell, and it doesn´t have too much in it (512MB and a P4)... of course the user access to this machine is limited, so you couldn´t actually rely on this experience to size your needs...<br />
<br />
We have another installation with 2 servers, in this casean e-sales... the memory is 512MB in each, and both are PII. This machines support about 30 concurrent users at this time, and the performance is brilliant.<br />
<br />
The thing is that with the &quot;e&quot; products there are no needs for &quot;big&quot; machines. The databases are not too big, and the process are not to tough... of course with an ERP you would have to change your mind completely and go big (of course talking about Microsoft enviroment bigger).<br />
<br />
Another thing is security. Talking about &quot;e&quot; products we normally recommend 2 servers for security: one with the application data (the public one) and one with the database and the connection with baan (OW adapter). This architecture also gives you the capability of balancing processes...<br />
<br />
Well, I guess the only answer I have is &quot;depends&quot;, but if you have more concrete questions I may be able to give you more concrete answers...<br />
<br />
Take care... regards</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to face what is needed for a dev and prod env for ibaan E-Proc. <br />
I could, thanks to the bannboard, find about CPU, RAM ... but how about Hard disk needs ... Does anybody have an estimation of how mush space is needed by Web server and SQL server in prod.<br />
<br />
I know the answer is It depends but I just need a rough idea ;)<br />
<br />
Concerning users as well : when should I use named and concurrent users ... what is the real difference?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Nicolas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we have two servers (one web, one db) each with two disks. The system disk (&quot;c:\&quot;, &lt; 10 GB) is only for system programs, the data disk (&quot;d:\&quot;, 40 GB) is for e-procurement programs and data.<br />
<br />
After one month live,  our data disk looks pretty clean (10 GB used), althoug we have about 20 catalogs with 300.000 products and most of them with product images.<br />
<br />
But that might change fast, because:<br />
- requisitions and invoices are stored as separate documents<br />
- our users found a nice way to store attachments (word, excel, access, images and all that stuff) ...<br />

<br />
second question, second answer.<br />
<br />
There is one big problem with the named users: each supplier requires a separate user license, because the mail address is stored here. So, if you know that you have &lt;n&gt; users, can you say that you have &lt;m&gt; suppliers?<br />
<br />
We decided to have concurrent users for that reason.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nboseret</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 11:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Gunther, <br />
thanks for the anwser :<br />
<br />
Just one more question (for now ;) ) :<br />
<br />
2 servers (web and db) with 2 disks :<br />
web server c: &lt; 10 Gb for system files and D: around 40 Gb for e-proc programs and data (+10 Gb after 1 month ??? or isit the db server)<br />
<br />
how about db server : c:&lt;10 Gb but how about D with db programs ?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />
Nicolas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">That one looks even better: 60 GB disk, containing 2 GB data ...</div></div><hr />
