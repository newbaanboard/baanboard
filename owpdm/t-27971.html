<br />
After the E-Enterprise installation in a test enviroment, we are trying to log in the page by means the Administrator account as suggested in the Installation Guide.<br />
<br />
The LDAP validation seems to work fine, but after click in the logon button rapidly it returns to login page where the User ID and Password fields are required and the E-manager link has never been reached. As mentioned LDAP seems to work because with a wrong account and wrong pwd the &quot;&quot;Invalid user id and/or password, try to log in again&quot; message appears.<br />
<br />
would anyone have an idea what's missing in the installation?<br />
<br />
Any sugestion is wellcome.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
