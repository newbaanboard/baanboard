<br />
Also, what determines which logistic company a customer places an order in...is this set by customer? <br />

We are on Baan5b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ewarmenhoven</div><div class="date">8th April 2002, 09:52</div></div><div class="posttext">The item determines which logistic company is used. <br />
<br />
You can have several logistic companies tied to one e-sales installation. You have to define for each a BIS instance refering to a specific company.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried seen it yet, but a customer should be able to see all order status from both companies.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps (a bit).<br />

<br />
Dont be shocked by this info.<br />
<br />
Its not based on transactional data as what is the logistic company that is determined.<br />
<br />
In case of logistic transactions like sales order, purchase orders, etc, et. The company that is attached to that particular bus component in your directory service is the determinator.<br />
<br />
So, if you can share your customer data across two logistic companies, then if you properly define your bus components in your directory service, then for same customers, you can have different sales order numbers in differnet logistic companies.<br />
