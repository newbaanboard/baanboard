<br />
I think the session which you are talking about is boibuilder session , <br />
you will have to separately install BOI builder in LN if you want or else you can always write a BOI DLL by your own .<br />
<br />
Write necessary DCDs and QCDs and using BOI compiler , generate JAVA/C# classes and 3GL includes and integrate .<br />
<br />
If your tmboaserver is up , this is what you need to do .<br />

to use BDE you need Business studio 8.5 in which yiu create a project and than yiu can create your java proxies to use as you used with BOI<br />

Hi Zanza ,<br />

Business Studio 8.5 is only introduced in FP5 .<br />
Am I right ?<br />

<br />
BOIs are not supported in LN even in FP3<br />
this means that if you ask for an help to the support they don't give you help<br />
moreover the BOIs doesn't manage MMT sessions so there are a lot of new feautures in LN that you cannot manage with BOIs<br />
you can use BOIs just for simple task, anyway it is an own your risk<br />
