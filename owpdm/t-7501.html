As a consequence our version of Internet Explorer is changing as well. (now version 6 with sp1) <br />
<br />
When starting the portal (My Page) none of the iviews load correctly and they all fail with the message &quot;action canceled&quot;. There is also a page error given which says 'access is denied'.<br />
<br />
If we open an individual iview (launch it in a separate browser window) all results are shown perfectly ok. <br />
<br />
Probably this has something to do with the new security settings in XP/explorer6, but we cannot determine what ... <br />
<br />
PS: If I logong with the same user on a pc with NT4.0 and internet explorer 5 all is fine.</div></div><hr />

Important Note for iBaan Portal Users:<br />
<br />
We inform you that the latest version of TopTier Portal (iBaan Portal 4.5) is incompatible with Internet Explorer 6.x he current certified version is IE 5.5 or earlier. Version 4.5 of iBaan Portal does not work consistently with Internet Explorer 6.0 and there are issues with reverting IE 6.0 back to IE 5.5. Hence please do not load iBaanPortal 4.5 onto a machine that is running IE 6.x. <br />
<br />
This limitation is also briefly documented in the User Manual, U7661A US - User's guide for iBaan Portal Version 4.5 Running on MS Internet Explorer <br />
<br />
(Software requirements page 2-2):<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We are currently working to resolve the compatibility problems, and do not have a release date yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(i made a case with support as well, still waiting on a proper feedback)</div></div><hr />
