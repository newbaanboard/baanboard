   I had couple of questions.<br />
<br />
   What is the difference between BCBE and OpenWorld?<br />
   Is OpenWorld just the next version of BCBE?<br />
   Is BCBE/OpenWorld an EAI tool?<br />
   Is TIBCO an EAI tool?<br />
<br />
   I am totally confused. It'll be nice if somebody can clear this<br />
   for me.<br />

<br />
1)What is the difference between BCBE and OpenWorld?<br />
<br />
BCBE is the set API's that will establish communication with BaaN Application Server from any third party application. <br />
<br />
OpenWorld is an Adapter to integrate BaaN ERP with other applications. OW minimises the overhead of writing code for BOI's. OW sits on top of BCBE internally.<br />
<br />
2)Is OpenWorld just the next version of BCBE?<br />
<br />
We can not say OW is the next version of BCBE. BCBE is part of BaaN Connect Kit (BCK1.3)  After OW is developed by e-Emphasys BaaN dropped BCK developments. BaaN doesn't support BCK anymore.<br />
<br />
3)Is BCBE/OpenWorld an EAI tool?<br />
<br />
BCBE is not an EAI Tool , its an integral part of BCK components.<br />
<br />
4)Is TIBCO an EAI tool?<br />
TIBCO is one of the best EAI Tool in the world which is complaint to J2EE Connector Architecture<br />
<br />

<br />
BCBE is the old Baan integration strategy, and is replaced by Baan OpenWorld. OpenWorld provides connectivity to for example:<br />
<br />
 - Baan to Baan<br />
 - Baan to OLE-DB<br />
 - Baan to SAP<br />
 - Baan to Corba<br />
 - Baan to Java<br />
 - Baan to C++<br />
 - Baan to COM <br />
 - Baan to XML <br />
<br />
And visa versa. In general it is a very flexible solution for all your connectivity needs. The architecture is primarely based on Java and XML<br />

<br />
What exactly is an EAI tool?<br />
<br />
Is it a tool where in all the apps connect to it rather than to each <br />
other? So the EAI tool just acts as a middle agent for giving and sending info. <br />
<br />
Is my understanding correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your posts.<br />
Thx,<br />
John</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
An EAI tool can do both. You can connect for example Baan to Baan (Baan IV to ERP or ERP to ERP). Or you can use it for example just to post an XML message in a simple app to create a sales-order (the iBaan OpenWorld Connector for XML).<br />
<br />
<br />
What iBaan OpenWorld is a transport layer (to send/receive messages) and several adapters/connectors. The &quot;middle-agent&quot; as you describe is just the adapter and the transport layer. The Connectors are providing connectivity to specific applications or languages. <br />
<br />
Does this help ?<br />
<br />

Thanks.<br />
