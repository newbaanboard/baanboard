We use Open world together with office integration to trasfer data from baan to microsoft word (sales quotation)<br />
Now we are forced to upgrade to OW 2.6 as we are upgradingto service packs 13 14 and 15 (Baan5c).<br />
Baan doesnt have know all the compoents which are compatible to each other (OW client, Server side components, Java VM....). <br />
Atlast we got all the relavant components and installed ont he test machine and now the test machine is all screwed up. Cannot strat the control panel, cannot open IE, windows explorer, SQL server enterprise manager (DTS designer) messed up....Now we need to rebuild the damn machine...<br />
<br />
<br />
My question is<br />
1) Did any one had similar problem?<br />
2) Is any one is using OW 2.6? Does this thing really works?. We didnt had much problem with OW 2.1<br />
<br />
Now baan says i need to go tot V2.5....!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">24th April 2005, 07:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently using OW2.5 with BaanIV and it has been working great. We are planning to upgrade from 2.5 to 2.6 soon due to text/error handling limitation of Connector for .NET 2.5. <br />
<br />
I would assume that 2.6 is not a major release (compared to 2.5) and therefore it should work with little effort. But in your case, I believe you moved from 2.1 to 2.6 directly, which in my opinion is a big upgrade. OW 2.6 must have installed .NET framerwork too and there might be some issues with the version of MS JVM that you have on your machine. Did you also updated the MMC on your server (as per the requirement for BCLM/SLM)? Problems with your Enterprise Manager and DTS designer could very well be due to that. <br />
<br />
All this might not help at all as it will be hard to clean your machine now but I can atleast share my experience of using OpenWorld 2.5 and other than its known limitations, it has been working great.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your response.<br />
I think the Adaptor for Java broke the DTS, since on the client machine i only installed that piece and my DTS is broken.<br />
Other thing is OW 2.6 came as a complete installation kit (not as an upgrade), so doesnt make any difference if i go from 2.1 to 2.6 ...I un-installed the previous version and installed 2.6.<br />
Before you try 2.6 i would recommend take a back up of your test system..rebuilding the whole test machine is a pain....<br />
