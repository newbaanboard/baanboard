<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">7th May 2003, 04:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Dashboard in E-Sales are basically meant for looking up data from the backend (e.g. BaanIV, BaanERP). Hence the dashboards are used only in a 'read-only' mode to see data such as sales orders, item inventory, Invoices etc. The standard dashboards are delivered with the specific iPacks (Integration Packs). For example, standard Dashboards for ESales - BaanIV will be available in one iPack and th dashboards for ESales - BaanERP in another. For dashboards, you will need to deploy OpenWorld components as well.<br />
<br />
This was a very general overview. Feel free to ask any specific questions that you might have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RovertNZ</div><div class="date">7th May 2003, 08:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Shaboo<br />
<br />
do you use Dashboards?, if so what do you use it for?  Would Standard Dashboards have customer invoices/Statements etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">7th May 2003, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Dashboards/Lookups can be for internal employee as well as external customers. For example there are two different lookups for Sales Orders, One for a customer and one for an employee. Hence dashboards can be used by internal users as well as externals.<br />
<br />
There is a standard lookup of Sales Invoices that provide overview of all invoices for each customer. It might not have all the info you want but atleast it is there. <br />
<br />
We have two/three totally customized lookups that were specifically developed for us. And are extensively used by our customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esantisteban</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">We're implementing e-sales for BaaN IV, and we have some problems at the time of configuring the presentation and views for the customers.<br />
The cuestion is that we have some lookups linked together and when a customer enters to the e-sales views, all the lookups (parent and child looups) are shown.<br />
<br />
For exemple:<br />
   Sales order<br />
   Sales order lines<br />
   Sales order details<br />
<br />
We only want, the customer see the main lookup, Sales order, and drilling down to go to the others.<br />
<br />
There's a place, in common/users.., where aparently we can parametrice that, making the lookups to exclude, but if we do that, the customer can't drill down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone could help me?.<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
Eva.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Eva, I couldn't understand your question. At one place in your post you mentioned:<br />
<br />
We only want, the customer see the main lookup, Sales order, and drilling down to go to the others <br />
And then you mentioned:<br />
<br />
.... making the lookups to exclude, but if we do that, the customer can't drill down. <br />
<br />
Isn't this what you want? That is disable the drill downs? Could you please explain the situation again..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BBailey</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">hello Eva,<br />
we have Baan E-sales with baan IVc4.<br />
I think I understand what you are asking for.<br />
You have a Customer Dashboard which includes several SSA's attached to it, such as:<br />
Sales orders, Sales order lines, and sales order details.<br />
You only want your customer to see the first one, Sales Orders.<br />
Using this one SSA, you want them to be able to drill down to see sales order lines, etc. but not have the separate Sales order line SSA included on the main Dashboard itself.<br />
If this is the case, you can go to to e-Manager, Dashboards,<br />
Dashboard contents, and click on the SSAs you don't want, to delete them from the list...also make sure the linking is set up between Sales order and sales order lines SSA's.<br />
...as a side point, our customers really DO NOT like the std dashboard functionality, and I've logged several enhancement requests.  If you're interested in the specifics, email me at <br />
bbailey@jvk.net</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esantisteban</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you BBailey!!!<br />
It works!, we were turning us crazy with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esantisteban</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 22:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Bbailey, I can see that you know what you're speaking!. Despite of my bad expression in English you have understood perfectly.<br />
<br />
I agree with you about the enhancements that should be done, may be the next version will be better.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking if I could abuse of your generosity?, I have more questions....<br />
<br />
Also We have some problems at the time of generating order Acknowledgement.....<br />
<br />
It is suposed that with the installation, in the EDI configuration, a WWW-AC message is created with another called WWW-ACK to send XML messages.<br />
We don't have the B2B installation. And curiously, the system has only created the WWW-ACK message and not the WWW-AC.<br />
<br />
The problem is that we can't generate the acknowledgement messages to update the orders in the web (from processed to confirmed).<br />
<br />
Did you find it out in your installation?</div></div><hr />
