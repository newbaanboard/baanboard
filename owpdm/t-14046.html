<br />
<br />
I have BOI purchased from BAAN.<br />
 <br />
I want to call this BOI from external application. This application could be ASP/Java/VB<br />
<br />
Is it possible to get the BOI work without using BCBE/OW?<br />
<br />
Are BOI shipped as DLL? If so why can't we call them directly<br />
from Java using JNI?<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />

<br />
1. I believe you cannot call a BOI without OpenWorld because these BOIs depend on some java classes that are included in the OpenWorld installation.<br />
<br />
2. If you buy a domain pack, the BOIs are delivered as a COM DLL as well as a JAR file.<br />
<br />
3. The BOI DLLs are basically a COM wrapper around java classes and hence they are inherently again dependent on OpenWorld (as mentioned in point 1)<br />
<br />
Hope it helped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a middleware tool as part of our WiseAPP Framework solution which allows to call BOI's from external sources without having Open World.<br />
<br />
The best thing is to send me an email on how I could get in touch with you.  My email is carl.boutin@fullscope.com<br />
