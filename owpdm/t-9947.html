<br />
In our company almost all our desktops have been upgraded to XP (since we needed it for an internal developed application that requires IE6). Since then none of these desktops can access the Portal anymore (all iviews return the message 'action canceled').<br />
The documentation does say IE6 is not supported for administration and says nothing about the normal client. Opening an iview in a seperate window works fine so it is only the 'my page' that has a problem. I believe it has something to do with the extra security in IE6 compared to IE5.5 in particular in relation to xml.<br />
<br />
We have logged a case with baan for this since november and still they cannot come up with a solution. We cannot revert to IE5 or IE5.5 so we need a fix for the portal in combination with IE6.<br />
<br />
If anyone has faces the same problem we should unite and put more pressure on Baan to get a solution.<br />
Thanks (and feel free to ask me more info on this matter.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure if it will help or not but once I tried to install the portal on a machine with IE 6.0 and of course it did not work. Then I went into registery and changed the version of IE to 5.5 and then tried the installation again and everything worked just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">12th May 2003, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tip Shaboo.<br />
We are using portal 4.0. <br />
On our server we still have IE5.0<br />
What registry key did you change exactly and was it on the server or on the client?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">12th May 2003, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">If I remember correctly, the location of the version was:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; MICROSOFT -&gt; INTERNET EXPLORER -&gt; Version.<br />
<br />
I changed it on the server on which were installing the portal. Right now we do have a Portal 4.5 running on a Win2K machine with IE6.0 and we can access it from another machine using IE6.0 as well. Could it be XP specific? I will see if I can get hold of an XP machine and try to access from it.. <br />
<br />
Goodluck and keep us posted.</div></div><hr />

I just did a test with W2K (found it on a pc which still had a dual boot) and IE6.0<br />
and ...<br />
No problem all seems to work fine.<br />
My conclusion is that it must be XP that is blocking the iviews to function properly.<br />
The error message gives an &quot;access is denied&quot; and i think the user name and password are not passed to the database in the iviewframes.<br />
<br />
All help or suggestions on how to debug is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">12th May 2003, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I have started to think it is the 'patches' (the one released by Microsoft periodically) to basic IE 6.0 that is cause of the problem. I have two machines with IE 6.0, one has more patches installed than the second and the second one works whereas first one does not. I think if you stick with the base version of IE 6.0 (which might not be ideal), you might be able to get your portal to work. <br />
<br />
I am attaching a 'screen captures', displaying two IE versions. The one on the left (with more patches and higher version number) does not work and the one on right does work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">13th May 2003, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right: using version 6.0.2800.1106 on W2K also has the problem and fails.<br />
Using version 6.0.2600.000 works fine.<br />
Version 6.0.2600.000 is the version without SP1 and 6.0.2800.1106 is IE6+SP1. Since SP1 is installed together with the SP1 for windowsXP it is very difficult to revert back to an IE6 without SP1 because this would mean we have to uninstall sp1 for XP.<br />
<br />
So far i have not been able to track the specific patch that relates to our problem.</div></div><hr />
