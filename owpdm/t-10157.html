BOI is supported by many languages such as ASP, COM, Java, CORBA, XML etc., As for as your case , OW BOI supprts ASP and u can directly call BOI's from ASP pages but if u want to enhance the efficiency, u may need to write your own connection manager etc., on top the this.<br />
Please mail me for more details.<br />
