At one time our servers were talking to eachother without a problem. Nothing has been changed since then other than that we had to restart the BaaN server. After that, OpenWorld hasn't been communicating properly and we're confused. <br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
We are in the process of testing OpenWorld from the command line.<br />
We are getting the error, &quot;Did not receive busdoc before timer expires&quot;.<br />
On the BaaN side, the asm_srv reports, &quot;Unknown Protocal.&quot;<br />
The Buslog states, &quot;Timeout in send and wait for answers for ***&quot;<br />
The log.asm_srv states:<br />
       Errno 0 bdb_errno 0<br />
       Log_mesg: Unknown Protocol<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why we would be getting these errors?</div></div><hr />

I know it looks strange to reply to a post which is 4 years old, but we have the same setup and we are facing the same problem.<br />
<br />
Have you managed to solved the problem? How?<br />

<br />
Which version of OpenWorld you guys are using?</div></div><hr />
