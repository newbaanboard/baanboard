<br />
we are installing baan openworld for test.<br />
<br />
know we facing the problem that tmboaserver does not start.<br />
the following message appears:<br />
<br />
&quot;Cannot start tmboaserver: failed to start JAVA, wrong JDK version&quot;<br />
<br />
if we debug with the bshell option -dbgjvmi the we get at the end of the log the statement:<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
Starting the JavaVM using JNI<br />
<br />
Failed to start the JavaVM<br />
Unable to start JavaVM - JVMI not available<br />
Removed queue with id 1 <br />
&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
all the pathes are set to the correct places. JDK 1.3.1 ist installed and SP1 of Baan ERP Adapter 2.3 is also installed.<br />
<br />
do you have any hint what else we could check?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

<br />
could a wrong path to the java environment cause the problem?<br />

thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have contact with baan support at the moment. they are also searching arround. probably the environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH points not to all necessary locations.<br />
We have also to go to the protingset 6.1c.06.06 (the last one for SUN OS 2.5.1.<br />
<br />
We'll keep you informed if we get some more details<br />
<br />
thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lakoon</div><div class="date">29th July 2003, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">hello<br />
<br />
together with the baan helpdesk we have solved the problem.<br />
It had nothing to do with the set environment pathes or with missing permissions but for some reason in our installation protingset 6.1c.06.xx does not work. <br />
<br />
<br />
Intressting thing is, that we have now installed only the binary bshell6.1 from portingset 6.1c.07. the rest of the binaries remains in 6.1c.06.06. and - everything works fine!<br />
an other thing is, that actually portingset 6.1c.07 does not work with SUN OS 2.5.1(our version) because it is deliverd only for SUN OS 2.6.<br />
Of cours we will only have this situation on the test server for the productiv server we have to go to right version for all binaries and to update the OS release us well.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your participation and support....</div></div><hr />
