<br />
I´m looking for information or even the path to obtain the Baan Connect Kit. Some information we got from Baan was to use iBann and stuffs.<br />
<br />
What I´ve heard is the BCK is free to be used by Baan customers.<br />
<br />
Do you guys have some information about that? :) <br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciate! tks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">houstoce</div><div class="date">9th November 2001, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">WE were also looking for it towards the beginning of the year for use with an EAI package by the name of WRQ Verastream. We were told by the local Baan representatives that Connect Kit is only 'free' with the purchase of Baan Front-Office and / or certain versions of Baan software, and in any event the product has been superceded by Baan Open World. If you find out any info to the contrary, please let me know 'cos we'd love to get our hands on a copy.</div></div><hr />

If u have BaaN license , u can ask BCK free of cost at your local BaaN representative. I think BaaN has stopped supporting BCK caz Open world is not moving fast . Our client has got  BCK 1.3 recently.<br />
Bye.<br />
