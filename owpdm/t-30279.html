<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EntMgmt</div><div class="date">22nd January 2007, 20:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been thrusted into the world of ERP LN and my repsonsibilities are to get the Collaborative order Managment tools to work with ERP LN 6.1.  We are running LN on Solaris 10 with Informix.  I have read all the documentation I can find on the SSA Technology Adapter Suite 2.6 and I can't seem to get the adapter server to run.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this is best practice or not, but I would like to start the adapter server process with a script and then define a named bus client to connect.  I have attached the unix script that sets up and launches the tmboaserver (rc.bcERPLN.start.sh)<br />
<br />
In the log.bshell6.2 file I recieve the following:<br />
E:bsp: ******* S T A R T of Error message *******<br />
E:bsp: Log message called from /BAAN/view/port.8.2b/vobs/tt/mir/mir/java_fun.c:<br />

<br />
<br />
I have tried java 1.4.2_08 and 1.5.0_06 with no luck.  Does anyone see what I'm missing?  Should I be doing this a different way?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your insight and assistance!</div></div><hr />

I think in most of the cases we use Baan as a server and for that you dont need to set these parameters. We have been using OpenWorld/TA extensively with our sales and service front ends and have never setup any such parameters.</div></div><hr />

I had a similar (almost same) problem. Later I found one more installation of JRE/JVM installed as a part of one of the server management softwares. This was mentioned in the environment variables also. So Openworld was not able to call it. After removing it, it worked.<br />
Also check if you have defined all the environment variables correctly.<br />
Heap size was the same in our case.<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peter Campbell</div><div class="date">9th May 2007, 09:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Usualy the problem is in the path variable which should also include &lt;java&gt;/bin/client where the jvm library is kept.</div></div><hr />
