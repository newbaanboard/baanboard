<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fredintaiwan</div><div class="date">14th January 2009, 04:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Issue Description : Records to a customized ERPln table is populated by a VB based Legacy system using SQLServer prepared statements. After populating these records, the customized ERPln session is invoked and these records are queried using one of the indices. On quering, these records failed to appear. The customized ERPln table has 3 indices and activity from Legacy System and invoking of the customized ERPln session are executed by ERPln periodic Jobs.<br />
<br />
Requirement Description :  The table indices are not updated by prepared statement while populating the table using the VB script.  At the moment ERPln side we have the following questions :<br />
<br />
a) Run a particular bshell command from 3GL script in the customized ERPln session which reorganizes all table indices. If yes, which bshell may be used ?<br />
<br />
b) Is it expected we have to compulsorily execute the Reorganize Data session in ERPln when data is being populated externally into the database(not through ERPln) ?<br />
<br />
c) Is there any other better solution ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you have fields in your table that look like &quot;hash1&quot; or something along those lines?<br />
