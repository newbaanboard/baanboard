<br />
I have come across a requirement of building the repository (.rep) files in OpenWorld for the BOIs being developed.  I have found the way of generating the repository file using BOI Studio.  The same can be generated by setting the &quot;Generate Domain&quot; property as TRUE. This will create the repository for the single BOI being generated.<br />
<br />
Now the concern is how can other BOI's being generated can be added to the same repository file.  When I generate the next BOI, the previous .rep file gets overwritten.  My requirement is to build the repository of all the BOIs.  <br />
<br />
Do I need to include all the QCD/DCDs files in one project to build the single repository.  If yes, there can be common elements across the QCD/DCDs and when the same are compiled, it gives error.<br />
<br />
Please advise if there is any other way to generate the repository of BOIs.<br />
<br />

<br />
Finally I could find the way to build the repository file using BOI Studio.  The steps are as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Go to project properties in property explorer.  Specify repository file name in Domain Name.  Set &quot;Generate Domain&quot; to yes.<br />
<br />
2. Include all the QCD and DCD files of the BOIs to be generated.  While including the QCD/DCD files, the only care to be taken is that all the QCD files should have unique ManagerDef i.e. the value for &quot;Type&quot; should be unique accross QCDs.  For DCDs, &quot;ID&quot; of all ElementDef should be unique.  Since, BOI studio generates java class files for each ElementDef, the duplicate name will have the overwritten class files i.e. any subsequent ElementDef with same name will overwrite the prior generated CLASS file and at the end we will have the class file for the last ElementDef, hence all the ElementDef in DCDs should have unique ID.<br />
<br />
3. When the project is build, it will generate the class, source and jar files.  The repository file will be available in the CLASS folder and will also be available with in the JAR file.  This repository can be used by BOI Test Tool or XML Connector Utility.<br />
