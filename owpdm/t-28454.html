<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcibo16</div><div class="date">19th October 2006, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I am trying to install the integration ERP LN 6.1  - MS Project 2003.<br />
I cannot do it :( so I need some help.<br />
This is what I have done so far:<br />
1. Installed Adapter for erp + licence (7013) <br />
2. Installed Connector for Java (both on server and my XP desktop:confused: )+ licence (7017) <br />
3. Installed Connector for .NET (both on server and my XP desktop:confused: )+ licence (7021)<br />
4. SLM 2.5 client on my desktop.<br />
5. Integration Pack 61.3.0.1on my desktop.<br />
6. Parameters in erp for External Project...<br />
<br />
I have created a BusComponent type BaanERP naming my erp ln 6.1 server.<br />
I start tmboaserver + Bus component. <br />
When I try to connect from project I get the error &quot;Default Backend....&quot; see atached files.<br />
______________________________________________<br />
What should I do next?<br />
And another question: for 10 concurent MS Project users I need 10 Bus Components and 10 tmboaserver sessions?<br />
Thanks guys,<br />

<br />
Bus-components are single-thread in nature, meaning if 5 calls are made at a time, it will process them one by one. Then the other thing is to how many tmboaserver sessions you should run in a single bshell as it will mean running multiple session at a time which can also result in slower performance. So you have to think about number of bshells you can run plus how you will split your buscomponents among them. If the load is not too heavy you can survive with one bshell + one tmboaserver and one buscomponent for all users.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Go to Central Configuration Console and under Adapter Client add your machine name. This is the name of the machine from where you will be launching MS Project to connect to LN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have added the machine name as described in step above, you will find an option of selecting default bus component (see snapshot below). From the drop down select the bus-component you want your integration to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
It should be that simple.</div></div><hr />
