Here is my code:<br />
    Dim BaanObj as Object<br />
<br />
    Sub BaanConnect()<br />
        If BaanObj Is Nothing Then<br />
            BaanObj = Server.CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application&quot;)<br />
            BaanObj.Timeout = 10<br />
            MsgBox(&quot;Connected&quot;)<br />
        End If<br />
<br />
    End Sub</div></div><hr />

The code and utilities forum is for actual code for utilities and sessions.  So hopefully you will get some answers here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st January 2003, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I had some time to look at this post, the code you posted looks just like what I use in Excel for the OLE piece.  Now I do not know anything about ASP.NET, but I do know that certain client versions, porting sets and tools versions do not play well together.  I learned this the hard way when Baan support told me this was no longer supported for our versions, but here on the board I learned that it worked for others.  So I went for a while where I had to use an old client to get it to work, then when we got a new porting set the new client started working.  I know this is not much help, but you may have to go to baan support.<br />

My posted source code works fine in VB 6.0 and in vb.net but not in ASP.Net so I think it is a specific problem to ASP.Net.</div></div><hr />

Hope this helps,<br />
