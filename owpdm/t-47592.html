<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beluver_2k</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I have generated the jar for table based baan dll, by using the source java code in j++ i have created a COM DLL which I was using with my VB6.0 and asp application. Now I am using the same COM DLL for VB.NET with background language C#, where I am having problem with the Iterator for list kind of method.<br />
<br />
I have worked upon some java program regarding the same where the class for Iterator is getting loaded from b3.jar file so do we have COM DLL or any other method to access the same class in C#. I am pasting my java code fro your ready reference. The import for the iterator class I have specified in bold letters.<br />
<br />
import com.baan.b3.boi1.Iterator;<br />
<br />
class EmpDetLst {<br />
        public static void main(String args[]) {<br />
                try<br />
                {<br />
                        EmployeeMasterManager man = new EmployeeMasterManager();<br />
                        //man.initialize(&quot;cn=hfs2b, o=baan.com&quot;);<br />
                        man.initialize(&quot;cn=vstbaan, o=baan.com&quot;);<br />
                        EmployeeMaster rs = new EmployeeMaster();<br />
                        System.out.println(&quot;1&quot;);<br />
                        //MaintainDepartmentMasters dep = rs.getMaintainDepartmentMasters();<br />
                       <br />
                        //rs = man.show(122519);<br />
                        Iterator it = man.list(122519,122530);<br />
                        System.out.println(&quot;2&quot;);<br />
                        System.out.println(it);<br />
//                      it.setFetchSize(1);<br />
                        System.out.println(it.hasMoreElements());<br />
                        while (it.hasMoreElements())<br />
                        {<br />

                        System.out.println(rs.getMaintainDepartmentMasters().getShortDescription());<br />
                        System.out.println(&quot;Employee Name : &quot;);<br />
                        System.out.println(rs.getName());<br />
                        System.out.println(&quot;Employee Code:&quot;);<br />
                        System.out.println(rs.getEmployeeCode());<br />
                        System.out.println(&quot;Employee Cadre:&quot;);<br />
                        System.out.println(rs.getCadreMaster().getDescription());<br />
                        }<br />
                        man.close();<br />

                {<br />
                        System.out.println(e1.toString());<br />

Kindly advice.<br />

<br />
I don't think you will have to import the iterator class explicitly as the manager class (EmployeeMasterManager in your case) should already have the iterator implemented in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beluver_2k</div><div class="date">5th February 2008, 07:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Shaboo,<br />
I have attached both the java file for your ready reference. Kindly look in to it acc. to me it uses the Iterator class from b3.jar which is a standard jar from Baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beluver_2k</div><div class="date">5th February 2008, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Shaboo,<br />
<br />
I am not getting any error while I am using the java code. If you see the code in  which I have imported the class for iterator which I have marked BOLD in my first post. If I want to use the same in my new C# code then I am in need of that iterator class, which is available with b3.jar which is BOW's standard jar file which I can not use in C# code.<br />
<br />
So either I need a class for C# which I can use in my C# code else if at all necessary I have to create COM dll from jar file which might be some bit tricky, so if Baan has distributed such class for the use of .NET then I would like to use the same. In VB.NET this iterator can be addressed as object but in C# it needs specific type to type descriptor so that it can be classified as Iterator.<br />
<br />
Hope this makes matter more clear.<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

Any suggestions?<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">9th February 2008, 20:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Rather than creating a java project and then using it to create a COM wrapper using VJ++, why don't you create a .NET project in OpenWorld studio and that will give you a .NET dll? <br />
<br />
Creating COM wrapper using VJ++ is the old way to do things. You should look into creating .NET dll directly out of OW Studio.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">11th February 2008, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Which version of OpenWorld you are using? I am pretty sure that the Connector for .NET comes standard with purchase of OpenWorld. You need a license for .NET only if you use a .NET server. You don't need license for creating .NET projects in Studio and using the .NET dlls hence created.</div></div><hr />

I am using Studio 2.5 which includes .NET dll maker but I have license for java connector only.<br />

You need license only for '.NET server' and not 'Connector for .NET'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vaishali_sftdev</div><div class="date">3rd December 2008, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
I am also facing the same issue.. I have to fetch data from Baan using dll.. But in C#, when i typecast using following code..<br />
  EmployeeMasterManagerClass e1 = new EmployeeMasterManagerClass();<br />
  e1.initialize(&quot;cn=vstbaan,o=baan.com&quot;);<br />
  EmployeeMasterClass e2 = new EmployeeMasterClass();<br />
  e2 = (EmployeeMasterClass)e1.show(129814);<br />
<br />
 it is giving me following error....<br />
&quot;Unable to cast COM object of type 'System.__ComObject' to class type 'emplyeedetailsnew.EmployeeMasterClass'. COM components that enter the CLR and do not support IProvideClassInfo or that do not have any interop assembly registered will be wrapped in the __ComObject type. Instances of this type cannot be cast to any other class; however they can be cast to interfaces as long as the underlying COM component supports QueryInterface calls for the IID of the interface&quot;<br />
<br />
And, if i use list method i am again facing same issue.. since, there is no such iterator type avaliable.. <br />
<br />
So, in C# is it required that dll should be .Net and not java... <br />
or, what changes in code to be done in C#.Net for fetching data from Baan thru dll..<br />
<br />
Reply ASAP....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">3rd December 2008, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you create your own 'Employee' BOI or you are using the standard one provided by Baan/Infor?<br />
<br />
If you are using the one provided by Baan, then I think you need to install Microsoft JVM before you can use them. Do you have that installed on the machine you are making this call from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vaishali_sftdev</div><div class="date">26th January 2009, 07:01</div></div><div class="posttext">shaboo, thanks for the reply..<br />
<br />
We are creating our own Employee BOI using BOW adapter (Java Connecter 2.5). All source code is in Java, i guess thts y there seems issues in typecasting. Can u suggest me solution for same then.... <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
