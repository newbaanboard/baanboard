<br />
Can anyone tell me whether the BOIs coded in 5b will work in 5c.<br />
<br />
<br />
I heard that in 5c it is XML based and not container based as in 5b<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends on the middleware from Baan that you're using. If you have worked with BOIs on Baan 5b using the Baan Connect Kit then it is correct that the BOIs in Baan 5c will be different (and it is indeed the difference in using containers or using XML). However, if you're familiar with BOIs you'll see that the structure/functions of the BOIs are pretty much the same. The main differences are hidden in the DLL's provided by Baan. These DLL's contain the actual functions that manipulate XML.<br />
