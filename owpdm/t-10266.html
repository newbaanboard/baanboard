<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">6th June 2003, 04:09</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no cubes around common template. Common template is part of DM infrastructure and hence other templates use it for dimensions and stuff.  <br />
<br />
Hope it helped. Feel free to ask more.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g_Jericho</div><div class="date">6th June 2003, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I m new to BaaN BIS, i have the following queries, in case some one can help me with:<br />
<br />
1. I m not able to view the Cubes in the BaaN itself, what is happening is that whenever we install the templates for say, &quot;Sales&quot;, in the startbar, only the shortcut for the cubes, templates and utilities are created, but all these don't have any cubes/templates/utils in them. As of now i m doing all the analysis in SQL Analysis server only, what can be the problem.<br />
<br />
2. Say i have Sales order table only in my sales model the very first time i generate the model. Do i need to re-generate the model in case i add some more tables to the existing generated sales model or do i simply export the data from baan and run the ETL runner.<br />
<br />
3. Is there any Manual for Learning BaaN BIS.<br />
<br />
4. last but not the least, where do i find OLAP BaaN Client.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">6th June 2003, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">1. For viewing the cubes you need an external application such as Crystal Analysis. Baan used to have its own OLAP client but I think it is not sold any more and Crystal Analysis is the preferred OLAP client utility.<br />
<br />
2. When you modify your ETL model, you will have to generate the model again before running the ETL runner.<br />
<br />
3. As far as I know, an administrative and developers guide come with the product, and have reasonable information.<br />
<br />
4. Again, as I mentioned in point one, Baan does not have/sell its OLAP client anymore and hence you have to look at third party products that support MS Analysis Server and Crystal Analysis is Baan's preferred OLAP client.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g_Jericho</div><div class="date">7th June 2003, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx for all the information.<br />
I have the administrative and the developer guide, what i was looking for was a step to step guide as to how we can use the BaaN BIS, if any such thing would exist.<br />
<br />
Also, i was reading somewhere that we can use to BaaN portal to view in the info in BaaN BIS, any idea as to how do we do that..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">7th June 2003, 18:55</div></div><div class="posttext">In order to view data in Baan Portal from Baan as far as I know there is no 'out of box' solution. The old iBaan OLAP client was completely integrated with iBaan Portal and if you had it, you would have easily accessed the data from BIS. Now I think Baan doesnot sell its OLAP client any more, there is no straight forward way of doing it. You can check with Baan if you can get a copy of it and it will be very straightforward.<br />
<br />
One way of doing it could be of using Crystal Analysis + Crystal Enterprise solution. You make your OLAP views in Crystal Analysis and then publish it to Crystal Enterprise. That way your OLAP views will become 'web-enabled'. Then I think somehow you should be able to use E-Portfolio (a sample webbased application that comes with Crystal Enterprise) to provide access to users in the iViews. <br />
<br />
There might be some other solutions out there.. but thats all I know :) <br />
<br />
BTW, Baan BIS is now called Decision Manager.</div></div><hr />
