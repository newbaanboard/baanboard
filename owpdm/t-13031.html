<br />
Now I try and run the session ccboi0104m00 and it does not run for me.  A closer look and the session is present (maintain sessions) but the program script record is missing (maintain program scripts) and thus no object.  I have service pack 13 loaded. Any reason why this is not present ?<br />
<br />
Also are there any packaged BOI DLL's that come with baan ?<br />
What is the naming convection that I can find one via Maintain DLL session ?<br />
<br />
thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have actually never seen any objects in the cc package!  It always gets created, but always empty!<br />
<br />
For the functionality of the ttstpcreatdll, have a look in the AFS (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=59) forum.  That's mainly where it is used.  I myself only used it once or twice, since I don't like the overhead of another DLL, but for learning how to use the AFS, it is quite good!</div></div><hr />

In order to have it running, I believe, you need OpenWorld Studio. With OpenWorld Studio, among other things, you get these sessions dump as well.<br />

Hope it helped.<br />

<br />
ccboi0104m000 will be enabled when u install BaaN Connect Kit or Open World Studio. BaaN actually developed the DLL's and the BOI sessions and left it not fully exposed until they comeup with BCK and OW Model.<br />
<br />
Hope this clarifies.<br />

Thanks.<br />

With warm regards,<br />
