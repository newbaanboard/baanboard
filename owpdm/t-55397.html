I need to know If it is necesary to capture de error's in Baan LN when I'm making an integration with .NET. I think I need this one because in .NET I need to capture then, so What I have to do in BaanLn?, Is this really necessary?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely you need to capture the errors in BaaN LN .<br />
IN LN DAL will handle all the Error Handling unless you introduce new warnings/errors in your business flow .<br />
Only thing you need to set the error on Baan side in your error struct in your BOI DLL .<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you .<br />
