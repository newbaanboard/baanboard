<br />
Ive taken over administration of an ERP LN site here in New Zealand and we wish to start performing B2B transactions with other business partners.<br />
<br />
We require XML EDI transactions for warehousing and sales/invoicing.<br />
<br />
What is currently is the best way to go about implementing this, Openworld? or another solution 3rd party solution?<br />
<br />
FP5 is looking promising with the SOA additions, is this going to change how we should go about implementing an XML based EDI link.</div></div><hr />

This has obviously been done many times from what I read around the forum but everyone seems to have implemented this in a different fashion with different 3rd party software.<br />
<br />
What were your decisions for using the software you did and how would you go about implementing XML EDI if you had s second chance at starting again.</div></div><hr />
