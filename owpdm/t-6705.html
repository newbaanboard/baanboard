<br />
I can reach the BCLM Server from the BCLM Client with bclmcmd and I can't find anything wrong with the servers.xml.<br />
But still the BCLM-check tool says: &quot;BCLM Client is unable to connect to the BCLM Server. Please check the Servers.xml configuration file of the BCLM Client and check that the BCLM Server is running and can be reached.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there anybody out there who has an idea to what can be wrong?<br />
<br />
The server runs on NT and the client on W2k server.<br />
I have included the servers.xml in case you  can see anything strange there. The name of the server and the numbers are correct.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

    The problem could be <br />
1. Your client machine cannot access server based on the host name... Try giving ip address instead.(I don't hink there is anything else taht could be wrong on the client side..<br />
<br />
2. On server side is the service for BCLM started in the NT services. <br />
<br />
   Hope this helps.<br />

Since I can reach the server from the client with the BclmCmd, I know that the Client can communicate with the server, and that the service is running.<br />
<br />
(To be sure, I have checked that the service is running anyway.)<br />
<br />
Is there maybe some entry in the Directory Service that is needed here?<br />
<br />
I hope you can think of some other hint for me!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Because of that, the file servers.xml could not be found.</div></div><hr />
