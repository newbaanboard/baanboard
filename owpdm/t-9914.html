   I had couple of questions on iBaan.<br />
<br />
   1. What are the applications included in Baan Enterprise Solutions suite (BES)?<br />
   2. Is iBaan same as BES?<br />
   3. What does iBaan Value Apps mean?<br />
   <br />
   Thanks.<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">8th May 2003, 01:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I think answer to all these questions are anybody's guess but here is what I think about them.<br />
<br />
1. BES, I think, is the term loosely used to envelope all the applications offered by Baan.<br />
<br />
2. When Baan changed their vision to become a 'Solution' provider rather than a 'software' seller, they started using iBaan with their product names. Hence, in my opinion, iBaan is not a product rather it is a new approach of selling the products in anintegrated form with other applications i.e. in form of a solution.<br />
<br />
3. In my opinion, iBaan Value Apps means all the applications around ERP backbone, for example, all E-Enterprise products.</div></div><hr />
