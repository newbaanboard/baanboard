the idea is to wrap a BOI around this session and automatically pass a JV (we want to use this to pass a payroll JV)<br />
has anybody done this before, if so have you been successful!<br />
since the session itself calls a sub subsession, will the BOI work as it should?<br />
any kind of help would be appreciated.<br />
thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 13:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I've not gone that long. I started creating a BOI called through<br />
ccboi0102m000 from session tdsls4102m000 so I selected just<br />
a few fields and the appropiate methods. Which should be my<br />
next step ?<br />
<br />
I thought I had to compile it using the maintain libraries session <br />
just because it was displayed on it like anyother dll, but couldn't <br />
since it had three associated libraries :<br />
<br />
  ccboifetchpkey, ccboiaudfrwnxt and tdsls4102m00, which was <br />
  clearly not one of them but the source of our error.<br />
<br />
I then called ttstpcreatdll and transformed tdsls4102m000 into<br />
a dll but I'm somewhat unconvinced this is the right way. Could<br />
some of you please share some light over this obscure matter ?<br />

    Yes ... u need to compile the BOI  DLL.<br />
    The BOI DLL is just like any other DLL.<br />
    What errors are you getting ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, first time we couldn't achieve its compilation because<br />
the session from which we had created the BOI through<br />
ccboi0102m000 appeared linked to it just like any other<br />
dll, not being the case.<br />
<br />
That's the reason we run ttstpcreatdll to turn the original<br />
session into a real dll. Once we did it we finally could<br />
compile our BOI. But we were not sure if we could add<br />
our recently created BOI, as it was, to our Self Service<br />
Lookups or not. Neither we knew how to fill all fields<br />
like BIS, Classification File or Implementation Data.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">26th March 2002, 06:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sanchez,<br />
after u generate AFS DLL for ur session using ttstpcreatdll, u got to compile the AFS DLL. And AFS DLL has to be named in a specific way. There has to be a 'f' before the number starts. The BOI DLL compilation is dependent on AFS Compilation. So first compile AFS DLL. Then compile BOI DLL. And to get the java stubs, u need to use the idl compiler.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

    We all ready have a BOI for JV imports. We are using it at various of our client locations for diff interfaces. <br />

<br />
I definied for several clients in the logistic soc the edi - parameters.<br />
at the end the edi-tabels where filled (tdsls480 81 82 83 84)<br />
<br />
That salesinformation i used to create purchase invoices in another fin soc using the tfgld1101m000 with the subsessions (purchase invoice header and purchase invoice lines)<br />
<br />
It toke some time to develop but i runs very good.<br />
Because you use the standaard session (no adaptions) the number of errors is rather small.<br />
<br />
the only problem we had was the need of the installation of the latest portingset.<br />
<br />
If you are interested you can mail me</div></div><hr />
