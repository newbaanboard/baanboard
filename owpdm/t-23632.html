<br />
We are using B2BServer as one way for getting the company customers Purchase Orders.<br />
<br />
Customers upload their Purchases Orders on the WEB, then a Send method puts a resultan file into the corresponding path. This file is taken by EDI from Baan IV c4 in order to process the sales order.<br />
<br />
I'd like to put the Document ID that B2BServer generates when the upload process is carried out into the plain ascii file generated.<br />
<br />
Currently I've done something similar in an own asp page but I'd like to know what is the exact page that generates the resultant file I have not been able to find it.<br />
<br />
Any answer is wellcome.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
