   I had couple of questions regarding BCBE.<br />
   1. Is BCBE still supported by Baan?<br />
   2. Advantages of Openworld over BCBE?<br />
   3. Is BCBE available on Baan V? Or am I forced to use Openworld?<br />
   Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- BCBE is not supported anymore by Baan. BCBE is replaced by OpenWorld.<br />
- BCBE was available for Baan Vb (Grieg). For later Baan V versions it is not available anymore.<br />
<br />
Advantages BOW:<br />
- more stable<br />
- more flexible<br />
- support for different transport mechanisms (TCP/IP, MQSeries, MSMQ)<br />
- better use of resources (licenses)<br />
<br />
Disadvantages BOW:<br />
- price<br />
- BOI development only by trained / authorized partners of Baan<br />

<br />
I accidently happened to read your thread. <br />
<br />
For your information some additional info:<br />
<br />
1. I have successfully used BCBE/BCK for multiple projects in and outside NL for a number of times already using Baan IV and BaanERPb/c (Baan V). Among others, I managed to fully automate multiple (nested/multizoom) Finance-sessions this way, so that the Baan Business Logic is accessible form a 3rd party application using VB(.NET) or Java. By this time, I can honestly say that ANY session in Baan can be automated this way.<br />
<br />
2. As to the stability of BCBE, I found that it's stability mainly relates to the quality of BOI's and (to less extent) the associated Application Function Servers developed and not the framework itself.  As I have been able to FULLY control almost every BOI's quality myself by using the BOI Builder followed by modifying the 3GL-script created , this always proved solveable. Multiple customers are currently using solutions in their production environments as a result of this successfully.<br />
<br />
3. As to BCBE for BaanERP (Baan V), please be informed that I have managed to make the BCBE-framework available to BaanERP 5.0c (Corelli) without any problem as well.<br />
<br />
4. Until now, with each respective released Service Pack or Porting Set, BCBE continues to be supported by Baan. Furthermore, even some Baan-own interfaces have been realized using BCBE, rather than OW. As such, I currently don't expect BCBE to disappear in any of the current Baan-versions.<br />
<br />
5. Although OW can be marked as more complete (but be honest, who really uses or needs MSMQ, MQSeries or even XML-MessageExchange for that matter !??), it certainly is not better or more stable than BCBE in my eyes. Due to the higher complexity, I found that the chance of unexpected/unexplainable errors occurring in the OW-framework is even higher than that of BCBE. Finally, to comment some more on Youp's arguments, although licence-management using BCBE is not natively built-in, it is quite easy to realize a ConnectionManager which implements ConnectionPooling using BCBE-components in the Microsoft .NET framework using (for example) .NET's Remoting and Windows Service possibilities.<br />
<br />
6. Best advantage of using the BCK/BCBE platform as opposed to OW is it's price...... It's 100% for free !  (As a reference, please compare this to OW. Last price I heard for an OW Adapter licence was in the range of 20-25000 USD, and a multiple of that for the OW Studio (the OW-development environment), which is perfectly alright for large Baan-customers but clearly beyond reach for the smaller ones  !!!)<br />
<br />
