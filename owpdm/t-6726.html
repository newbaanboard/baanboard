<br />
I read in the &quot;Installation and Configuration Guide for Adapter&quot;, Appendix B XML file Directory Service, that I'm supposed to &quot;Add the reqired components and connection points&quot; in the Bus component Editor.<br />
<br />
My big question now is What are the required components and connection points??<br />
<br />
I hope that someone might have a nice list of these, and how they are supposed to be configured.<br />
If you are that someone, would you please send me that list. It would certanly help me a lot!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

    Basically you will have to create these entries based on your systems that are going to interact using openworld. So it will be of no help you getting these entries from anyone else.<br />
<br />
    After you have created the base file fromsample in Apendix B. Go to Adapter config and set that as ur directory service file.<br />
    Then use Bus component editor to add entries based on the number of baan systems u have and the companies you require..<br />
<br />
   Hope this helps.<br />
