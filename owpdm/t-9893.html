We are currently in the process of evaluating Open World.<br />
Hence I had couple of questions.<br />
<br />
# 1 Do we need OpenWorld to connect Baan 5x to E-Sales, <br />
      E-Collaboration etc?<br />
      Can we have an integration between Baan 5x and these <br />
      products without OW?<br />
<br />
# 2 For Web Top, do we need OW?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">7th May 2003, 05:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Answer to Q # 1:<br />
<br />
Integration between ESales and Baan (BaanIV or BaanERP) has following aspects.<br />
<br />
1. If you want to use all the pricing/discount logic 'Live' from Baan backend, then you will need openworld to achieve that. This, by the way, is available in the standard integration between Esales and Baan.<br />
<br />
2. If you do not want to use the pricing/discount logic 'Live' from baan and would rather use pricing and discount mechanism in ESales, then you will not need openworld solution. <br />
<br />
3. The order data from ESales to Baan and back to Esales is done through EDI messages, and hence no OpenWorld components are involved.<br />
<br />
4. The static data from Baan (Customer, Address, Products, Units, Currencies, etc.) are transfered from Baan using combination of Exchange Schemes and SQL Server DTS Packages.<br />
<br />
5. If you want to use Dashboards/Lookups to see 'Live' read-only data from Baan (e.g. inventory, order status, etc.), then again you will need OpenWorld components to achieve that. <br />
<br />
Answer to Q # 2:<br />
Yes, you do need OW for Webtop.<br />
