Hi every one<br />
<br />
Im work in an application in HTML and ASP with the purpose of  doing the delivery of  inventory issue to Production Orders by this application and processing data by BaaN IV session Delivery issueInventory to ProductionOrders, using iBaaN OpenWorld Technology.(BOIs)<br />
For this purpose I want confirm which method of Production Order BOI I must use??<br />
I already read all documents about OpenWorld, and none explains me how to use BOIs in my application in programmers point view!!! <br />
Do any one have a general example with a piece of codification that shows to me how we invoke a specific method in an Client application?? <br />
<br />
And in my specific case of my work...what i´ll need to do, to integrate um aplication with that session??<br />
Do I need to implement additional code  over the method invocation??<br />
<br />
Be grateful for possible help<br />
<br />
Álvaro</div></div><hr />

If there is  BOI developed for this session, you should have a COM object for the BOI. If you have the COM object, Im quite sure you should be able to see what methods available for this BOI from the COM object and invoke the appropriate method.<br />

<br />
But if that possible BOI exists, that COM object is already implemented or do I need to implement this Object?? <br />
And with this object I be able to see what methods available for that BOI, maybe if I have the soluction installed in my BaaN server, isn´t it??? the problem is that I don´t have yet the soluction installed!!! I'm studing this produt and after this I decid if I buy or not understand???<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />
