Our company currently uses LN and webui.<br />
We are dealing with java version issues and exploring alternatives.<br />
<br />
My question to the community is how extensive for LN customers is the adoption of ming.le as it seems not a cost effective alternative?<br />
<br />
Are there many users using LN and BW?<br />
<br />
If you are a LN user, can you post your company client preference?<br />
<br />
Thank yoU!</div></div><hr />
