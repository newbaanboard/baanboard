I have performed all the steps (recording to the manual) but I could'n manage to set up the LDAP server correctly (at least that is what I presume).<br />
<br />
When I try to open tmboaserver the message is: &quot;No bus components received from location service&quot;<br />
<br />
I have installed iPlanet5.1 and I have imported the file from the iPack cd (.ldif).<br />
<br />
The configuration is:<br />
machine name: ibaancrm <br />
domain: baancrm.itc.ro<br />
<br />
I do not get a certain part of the installation manual (8008A US):<br />
&quot;Aditionaly, you must create the root of the directory structure where you want to store the BusComponents, for example:<br />
o=MyOrganization.com<br />
dc=ptg, dc=baan, dc=com&quot;<br />
<br />
I've seen an old thread on baanboard regarding this problem but it has not helped me at all.<br />
<br />
I am not familiar with LDAP technology. How am I going to do this?<br />
I can see in my Directory Server the following characteristics:<br />
o=netscaperoot<br />
dc=baancrm.itc.ro<br />
<br />
I have used this when configuring the Adapter:<br />
Generic/system: C:\WINNT\bus.properties<br />
LDAP<br />
Server URL: ldap:\\ibaancrm<br />
Server ROOT: o=netscape.com<br />
<br />
And I result in the error I have already mentioned to you.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
Couple of things:<br />
1) After you installed the LDAP, did you use the Bus Component Editor to add you own bus component(s) ?<br />
2) Since this is a Baan &lt;-&gt; CRM integration, for performance reasons, you may want to switch to using an XML file based LDAP instead of an LDAP server.  To do so, change your Adapter configuration to use a File in the Directory Service Tab, and set the Server URL to the location (i.e. c:\ldap.xml).  The server root can be anything (i.e. o=baan.com  OR o=yourdomain.com)<br />
Then create an empty xml file with only the xml version at the top and open/close tag &quot;DirectoryService&quot;.  Then use the bus component editor to add you own bus components (remember a bus component is logical name which points to a physical location, so when you start up tmboaserver it needs at least 1 bus component otherwise it has no port or msg queue to listen to for incoming messages)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

It works now. I was not using the right connection when editing the xml file.<br />
ok, LDAP server seems too complicated for just a Windows to Windows app integration.<br />
The xml file is a far more simple solution.<br />
<br />
But one more question:<br />
Since I do not use iPlanet any more is it mandatory for the machine (by the way: my machine has on it everything: BaanIVc4, CRM 4.3, Adapter, Broker, Designer, Connector) to be part of a Windows Domain?<br />
Or a workgroup is just fine?<br />
<br />
We have different type of customers and, as you know, they are the one to decide on their inner organization. I need to know if I have to restrict them to one of the options.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
Mihai</div></div><hr />

<br />
To my knowledge, a workgroup *should* be fine.  I have a stand alone test system on Win2k server that is setup as a workgroup with Baan IVc4, Vc and all the OpenWorld Components on it with no issues. <br />
The only area I have not had enough experience with is the CRM product so I can not say for 100%<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
