supposed to be put over c4 VRC so a new branch is created<br />
in our derivation tree apart from the one which contains stnd,<br />
mven, mvco, iber ( spanish locations ), even service packs.<br />
Has someone confronted this same problem ? If so, how did<br />
you solved it ? Thanks in advance and read you soon.<br />

However to integrate the new VRC into your live package combination, you will need to correct the derivation structure.<br />
<br />
If you have a tools validation password you would be able to correct the derivation structure.<br />
In our case, we posted it as a case on support website and it was resolved by a baan specialist dialling in and correcting the derivation structure.<br />
<br />
The installation kit for BCK should have the option of selecting the VRC to be used as your parent VRC before installation, which is not present and as a result it is installed as a derivation from the standard Baan IV VRC.<br />
New Derivation structure we have:<br />
<br />
B40 c4<br />
B40U c4 stnd  -&gt; Update for Standard<br />
B40L c4 bci2<br />
B40U c4 bci2 -&gt; Update for BCK<br />
B40C c4 liv0   -&gt; Live VRC</div></div><hr />
