<br />
<br />
  Has anyone installed Webtop?? If yes, does it work OK and would you use it for remote offices?? <br />
<br />
Is Print Preview available in WebTop??<br />
<br />
Lots of questions..... hopefully lots of answers.....<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">5th March 2004, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I know of a company that has implemented WebTop as the only interface available to normal users. Actually WebTop 3.0 is better than WebTop 2.0 as it has some extra features. <br />
<br />
And yes, Print Preview is available in WebTop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">8th March 2004, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know webtop3.0 is not available yet for 5c. We are testing the product for SSA.<br />
<br />
Of course the 2.2 version can be used but you need openworld for that. In 3.0 is no longer needed.<br />
<br />
There are still things to solve by SSA:<br />
- parallel sessions which are often used in the project module don't work;<br />
- printing on windows doesn't work yet (at least not in our version);<br />
<br />

<br />
Webtop 3.0 is currently processed by the fulfillment department.<br />
Availability of Webtop 3.0 is currently scheduled for April 15th. Those of you that have access to the Baan intranet can preview Webtop 3.0 via http://ibaanwebtop or http://srv-nld-maan/webtop_gy/defaultlogin.html. Webtop 3.0 is the web-interface for BaanIVc4, Baan5.0c, Baan5.2 and Baan6 (Gemini). Webtop 3.0 has many improvements over its predecessor (Webtop 2.0), i.e. much improved performance, a new skin, improved usability and stability.<br />
<br />
Installation must be done once (webserver, NOT the client) and when this is done, Webtop can be accessed by all users via the intranet (no internet support yet, although it is possible).<br />

do you know where the document is available?<br />
via Baan-Support (Doc-Name or Doc-Number)?</div></div><hr />

I dont have the document number it was a short document we received from BaaN development as we are were on all the different phases of Reger-5.2 version. According to our version, all the sessions have to be integrated for them to be webtop enabled.<br />
<br />
You can contact the BaaN support to get the official document for your BaaN version. We are currently not using Webtop on Reger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It only works with Microsoft JVM and it is unsupported by microsoft and sun jvm is in most of the latest IE on clients.<br />
We cannot remove sun jvm as other applications currently depend on sun jvm.<br />
<br />
Some of our front end(client) applications talk to bw dlls on client to load data into sales orders etc.  We dont know how we can make webtop to do those functions.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lvdberg</div><div class="date">27th May 2004, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed Webtop 3.0 only uses the Microsoft JVM for now (Microsoft will support its JVM until the end of 2007, at which time we will have removed the dependency of Webtop on the Microsoft JVM). You can remove the SUN VM for just the browser by opening the Control Panel on your computer, opening the Java Plug-in Control Panel, and on the Browser tab you have to deselect Microsoft Internet Explorer. If you use other applications with Internet Explorer that need the SUN VM, you indeed may have a problem.<br />
<br />
As far as in house applications are concerned  that have to work in Webtop, they require some restrictions in their code constructs. We can provide the service (billable) to make these applications work in Webtop.<br />
