<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">We are evaluating OpenWorld.  There is some confusion on how user accountability is accomplished.<br />
<br />
I have been told that a single adapter can handle multiple request from different users, keeping there user intact for history.  Is this possible, and technically how is it done.<br />
<br />
My thoughts are that the adapter runs ontop of a bshell and can handle multiple requests.  If that request requires you to run a session, then another bshell is started with a users id.  In the case of webtop, the openworld adapter would start another bshell for every user connection.<br />
<br />
Detailed technical help please?</div></div><hr />

    There are 2 ways of using Openworld.<br />
<br />
1. With User accountibility: <br />
     As you mentioned in Webtop. Baan starts multiple bshells for different users. So tmboaserver(Baan object adapter) will be started for every user. That means user based bshells are started.<br />
<br />
2. Without user accountibilty:<br />
    Don't use ASM(Application services manager). Start tmboaserver with anyone user. All the call from different users will come to same bshell. But here there will be no accountibility of users. So no tracking can be done. Everything goes through same user(user who started tmboaserver).<br />
<br />
    I don't think baan can handle user - context switching. I may be wrong on this. But I don't think Baan system allows you to do that. So it is not possible for Bshell to switch between users on the fly.<br />
<br />
    Hope this helps. Please let me know if you need more concrete info on anything. I will try to get it for you.<br />
