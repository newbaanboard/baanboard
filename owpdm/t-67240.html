<br />
I got problems with the installation and configuration of the Infor Office Integration. I installed and configured everything, as far as I know, according to the docus. One point is different: I have no place where both unix server and windows client have access to a central configuration directoy thats writeable to all. So I configured the xml-file with the CCC and then copied it to the unix server. Hope that this is o.k.<br />
<br />
But now my problem description:<br />
On the server I started the tmboaserver with the one and only bus component I have configured earlier with the CCC on my client pc (and then copied over the xml-file to the unix server). <br />
<br />
When I start word and choose &quot;New ERP Template&quot; an error pops up:<br />
Windowname: Insert ERP Fields<br />
Error: Invalid port in uri  bidisocket:// myserverhost  :7912/<br />
After that a VB error showing &quot;wrong file name&quot; pops up and nothing happens.<br />
<br />
In Excel when I choose &quot;New ERP Template&quot; the dialog to name and save a template pops up and when I choose ok the same port error appears.<br />
When I use socket instead of bidisocket, nothing happens in Excel at all.<br />
<br />
I checked the following:<br />
Unix- Server<br />
- checked the port 7912 after starting tmboaserver<br />
- checked logfiles in ~/.owlog<br />
Windows<br />
Checked makro security (which I don't really know how it must be configured)<br />
Checked logfiles under %USERPROFILE%/.owlog<br />
An excerpt from that logfile that shows the error is attached...<br />
<br />
<br />
Have I forgotten something!?<br />
<br />
Here again in brief form what I did:<br />
<br />
1. Installed License in SLM<br />
2. Installed Infor Integration on server<br />
3. Configured Classpath on server<br />
4. Configured Central Directory URL on server<br />
5. Installed Infor Integration on Client<br />
6. Configured Bus Components on Client<br />
7. Copied xml-file to unix server (no world writing directory available)<br />
8. Configured Office Parameters<br />
9. Copied OfficeIntegration.exe to server directory<br />
10. Installed Office Integration Client<br />
<br />
The specs are the following:<br />
<br />
IBM AIX 7.1<br />
Infor ERP Enterprise 10.2.1<br />
Porting Set 8.9.a.01<br />
Infor Integration 6.2.11<br />
Office Integration 2.1.121<br />
MS Office 2010 (14.0.7015.1000 (32-Bit))<br />
<br />
<br />
After I have done all this, nothing happens in damöä?ned%?§% Microsoft Word or Excel. Thats a bit anoying to me. :mad:<br />
<br />
Has anybody any idea what's wrong there?  :confused:<br />
That would be great...<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Litrax<br />
<br />
<br />
Update: O.k. I found the reason for the invalid Port error. I had accidently set &quot;Client Bus Component&quot; in the Adapter Client in CCC. It must be empty.<br />
But still I got the VB- Error &quot;wrong file name&quot; in Word.<br />
And after I set the template name (in both word and excel) nothing happens.<br />
Shouldn't there open a window where the fieldnames can be chosen, or what step comes next!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure how relevant it would be, but you can check if the template names are exactly same in parameters and the actual template name?<br />
<br />
Also, check the permissions on client folder. Also, what is the VB error code? Have you checked event viewer on client machine? May be that can give you some ideas.<br />
<br />
Also, make sure the file on the server is not corrupted. What you can do is, you can get the standard template from Xtreme or use if you have one and replace it with the template you are using.<br />
<br />
Now, check if that works.<br />
<br />
Also check this Thread (http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/HV080607855.aspx). Make sure the file name is not conflicting the MS terms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">12th January 2015, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">The VB Error Code was 4160<br />
<br />
Seems that I have to be in Compatibility Mode but I must do more tests to aprove that thesis. I now can go a few steps further.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will search for the Infor templates in Xtreme to have a good example for testing. Thats a good hint.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But when I open a word template from within a Baan Session I got the error that you can see in the hardcopy attached. When I use &quot;Test ERP Template&quot; everything is fine and the Data is filled in the template.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what this error comes from nor what it means!? :confused:<br />
<br />
Had anyone had this error and solved it or does anyone have an idea where to search the solution?</div></div><hr />

In solution 1126565 they give the resolution to add the path to Trusted Locations in Word.<br />
I forgot that totally in MS Word. Now it works fine.</div></div><hr />
