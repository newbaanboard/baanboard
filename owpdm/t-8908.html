<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jhargett</div><div class="date">17th February 2003, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm writing an Intranet application that intergrates with Baan in several ways. Currently, it requires the user to go to Baan to create Purchase Orders. I would like to be able to automatically generate Purchase Orders with lines from the intranet site. We are using Baan IVc4. <br />
<br />
Can someone just give me some general idea of the best way of doing this? Also, some general idea of how much it cost? As with most corporations, free is always best. We have some dedicated Baan programmers, so that should not be a problem. I don't have access to Baan's support site (the corporate office has this). They don't seem very willing to upgrade to a newer version of Baan, so we have to make it work with this.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would most likely want to use Baan BOI Application Function Server developement to write libraries in Baan that call the standard Purchase Order Objects.   Search on these boards (keyword AFS I think) for a recent version of the manual.   This can most likely be done without source code.  <br />
<br />
You can then call the libraries using Java calls I would think.  Also many postings about that.</div></div><hr />
