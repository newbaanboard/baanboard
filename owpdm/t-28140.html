The question of multi vs single threading has come up.<br />
I searched this site for an answer but found nothing definitive.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
If 5 service technicians submit a service order at the same time,<br />
and each service order takes about 15 seconds to process,<br />
will the fifth service order submitted be completed in 15 seconds or 75 seconds.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Al.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you did not enable APS then the client request will create dedicated backend process. If you do enable APS then you share the multiple requests over a single bshell connection, and it depends on the tick size etc (similar to a BW/Worktop connection and opening multiple sessions at the same time). You can enable different log/trace options on the bus components and gather statistics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">12th September 2006, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually we are also in a similar situation. We are developing a web-based application for our field service folks but in the first phase we will just initiate service orders in Baan but they will be able to report their hours, material and cost against it through web. <br />
<br />
We are not planning to use ASM to automatically start the bus-components We will have rather two or three buscomponents started all the time and put some logic in the application to pick the one that is not in use or something like that. If we use single bus-component then you are right, fifth service order will be done after 75 seconds as all the calls to a single buscomponent follow a single thread.</div></div><hr />
