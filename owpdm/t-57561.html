<br />
I could not reduce the time for 1 transaction but in my case i was making multiple calls for the same BDE .<br />
<br />
I found a way to send all the calls for the same BDE at once, it did the trick for me.<br />
I changed the webject that was sending the data to BDE.I was calling the webject multiple times for the same BDE, but the trick was to send data as a group.<br />
<br />
If you are dealing with webject, then i can help.</div></div><hr />
