For some reason our webtop version seems slow and almost unusable. Is workspace the new webtop version/rebranding? is it fast (or faster than webtop)? what are the requirements? any experience with customizations and how they look?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

What is the desktops configuration? I observed that some of desktops with older processors and low RAM were slow compared to the newer ones with faster CPU, RAM etc. <br />
Is it slow just from that desktop or from any other computer? Performance Tuning is a broad area, needs thorough analysis.</div></div><hr />

For slowness, an example: in purchase orders the header looks fine, but when trying to add the lines it takes a while to load the articles and some clicks to add it to the line. Our webtop version is 8.4.2. We probably have some issue with the install but really would like to move forward and ask you for any experience with the recent versions.</div></div><hr />
