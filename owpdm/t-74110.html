<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RieseUSA</div><div class="date">17th November 2021, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone successfully created a BDE with an Association Relationships?<br />
<br />
I am working on creating a BDE for the Business Partner (BP) data with all the roles, e.g., Sold-to, etc.<br />
<br />
The BP data and each role has an Address.  As the LN Studio Integration Development Guide calls it, &quot;The address is a typical 'associated non-root table' case.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could add the important address fields as attributes, but that would have to be repeated for each component, so the Association Relationships sounds like a better approach.<br />
<br />
I created a BDE Interface Definition/Implementation for the Address data.  For the Business Partner BDE Interface Definition, I added an 'Association to the Addresses BDE with the addressCode/addressCode being the link between the two.  The Implementation has the Association Relationship Implementation with the Addresses To Business Interface/Component Implementation.<br />
<br />
The BDE Implementation gets generated fine, but when using the List method, the Address data is not in the response.<br />
<br />
Is there a step that I am missing or is there something that needs to be done to the request itself?</div></div><hr />

I did create a BP BDE for our special case customers where I did make use of the Aggregation Relation between BP and Sold-to BP / between BP and Contacts, but not to addresses. In our special case we have one Sold-To BP per BP and only one Contact, so 1:1:1.</div></div><hr />
