<br />
I've used it quite a bit and in combination with the rest of the iBaan DM road map, it's hard to beat for a Baan shop, because of its pre-built templates.<br />
<br />
I think it takes Baan customers very close to the point that they could easily build a Balance scorecard in a reasonable time.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 10:06</div></div><div class="posttext">we use a quite old version DEM1.2 and for the moment we only use the Sales part of it. We have extended the standard baan solution with a lot of extra DTS scripts to get the data in the format that we want it. (+ keeping the 'result'-table to a minimum of records)<br />
<br />
Our problem is partially that we use the baan process (PMG) module instead of manufacturing (SFC). Scripts for PMG or not included in the baan standard solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan_James_Baan</div><div class="date">11th November 2002, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had some experience with 1.3 and quite a bit of experience using DM2.1.  We to did some customization work to the models, cause we used service in 4c2 and 2.1 doesn't have a model for service in Baan 4 (just 5).  Plus we had to develop quite a few of our own export sessions as well.  But all things considered I found 2.1 to be quite intuitive and easy to use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">12th November 2002, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know the latest versions, but for 1.3 my findings were:<br />
- For sales, purchase and inventory it is very easy to create decision models yourself by exporting e.g. tdsls050/051 data using for example easysql, and then import this into a MS OLAP system. This has the advantage you can build it right from the start how you want it to be, rather then having to customize existing parts<br />
- My objections againts the Finance models were that they followed very closely the BaaN Finance table structures, e.g. separate models for finalized transactions, non-finalized transaction, and integration transactions. I would rather build 1 model, with dimensions for 1) Finalized/Non-Finalized, 2) Origin (a) Finance -&gt; ACR, ACP, GLD etc. and b) Integration -&gt; sales/issue, sales/invoice etc. etc. etc.)<br />
It all very much depends on what you excatly want to analyze.<br />
