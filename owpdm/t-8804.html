We have found the one shipped with the product incomplete: there are methods available for example for BOI Manager (getIterator) not documented, but used in sample code we got from OW course last spring.</div></div><hr />

The Documentation that u have for the broker is all the documentation provided by Baan. <br />
Anything not mentioned in the docs u have to do all the RnD by urself. Infact when I was stuck on broker sometime last year I asked for help from my contacts in Baan and all I got in return was the same Baan Broker document :) lol<br />
<br />
Maybe if you have the contact info about the person who trained you on Broker you can contact him/her.<br />
<br />
You can also contact Marcos Marsilli (me got training from him) from Baan, but unfortunately I dont have his contact info with me anymore.<br />

All the best,<br />
