<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lfhaddix</div><div class="date">27th March 2019, 03:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We have some custom BDE's that are being called using jboss/MQ Seriies/WBI adapter/bus component.<br />
<br />
MQ series is no longer supported and we need to replace it.  The BDE's were created in a business studio before 8.6 so we cannot use C4WS.<br />
<br />
What are our options?  Java connector sounds like what we want but we only have xsd's (no wsdl).  Does anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />
