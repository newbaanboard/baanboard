<br />
I just discover AFS and I read AFS.doc that I've found in this forum. It looks great...<br />
<br />
In fact, I'm losssssssssst...<br />
<br />
At the begining, I just would like to make a report print, through the session : tcmcs0401m000 (print units).<br />
Someone could send me a full example I could test and debug, etc.... ??? :confused: ???</div></div><hr />

The way it works is that the user provides a file of part numbers on the client or PC side. I copy this file to the server, read through it, print the BOM.  Once all parts are processed I then copy the file back down to the client. I also included the library I created for tibom1411m000.  We are on 4c3 so I do not make any promises that this will work on 4c4. You will have to create the form and files to feed the program. <br />
<br />
When the first f1411m000 command executes you should be able to goto a shell and see that tibom1411m000 is running as a sub-process to your session. It continues to run until the f1411m000.end is executed.  Usually I end programs after execution, but this one worked just fine as is.<br />

Good Luck! <br />

<br />
I thank you for this example, but !!!<br />
the problem is that I don't have development Licence to create forms in BaaN.<br />
Don't you have an interface wrote in C or Java ??? using the same dll ???<br />
About your dll, it's ok, you have generated with ttstpcreatdll.  But this dll is not compiled. Do you use bic.exe to do this ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">25th July 2002, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same problem with no developer licence but you can get round it by calling the complied dll from vb like this <br />
Function exchange()<br />
<br />
Set BaanObj = CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application&quot;)<br />
BaanObj.Timeout = 30<br />
BaanObj.ParseExecFunction &quot;otudllolemps&quot;, &quot;exchangemps()&quot;<br />
BaanObj.Quit<br />
End Function<br />
if you use Set BaanObj = CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application&quot;) <br />
then it will use whatever BWC file is default but to call a specific one use <br />
Set BaanObj = CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application.name of bwc file&quot;)<br />
<br />
I have compiled the object with <br />
bic d:\mpsimport.bc -o otudllolemps<br />
<br />
<br />
the mpsimport.bc file looks like this<br />
#pragma	used	dll ottstpapihand<br />
<br />
function extern void exchangemps()<br />
{<br />
DLLUSAGE<br />
	import mps data<br />
ENDDLLUSAGE<br />
wait.and.activate(&quot;tuxch0223m000&quot;,&quot;TMUK_MPS&quot;,&quot;TMUK_MPS&quot;,&quot;WEEKLY&quot;,&quot;WEEKLY&quot;,10,10,0,1,100)<br />
}<br />
I use this to activate an exchange scheme from my program, although this example doesn't use stpapi commands it does show how to call your complied script using VB. <br />
<br />
Take a look at the code and utilities section as there are examples there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th July 2002, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Try searching on OLE, Visual Basic, Excel.  There are most posts covering this topic.  Here is one with a sample in it - follow this link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1231&amp;highlight=tisfc0408m000).  Here (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5540) is another that may be useful.<br />
<br />
When I use ttstpcreatdll it automatically compiles the library for me. Sometimes I have to make changes and compile it myself. If you are using the stpapi commands from VB then you really do not need to create a DLL.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
I'm very happy you sent me these links, they are very usefull and I didn't find them ... may be I have a bug ;) <br />
<br />
Than you very much... All works wonderfull, and I precise just to who wants to know that it works directly with VBScrip... (without compilation)...<br />
<br />
Thank you again.</div></div><hr />
