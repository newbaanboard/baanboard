We are currently configured with 1 logistics and 2 finance companies with a 60 GB SQL 7.0 Database and running both the app and the db on NT 4.0.<br />
<br />
Has anyone successfully implemented an archiving procedure in 5.0c?  Were custom sessions required?  How much consulting time was required to complete the project?<br />
<br />
Any info is greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
you already know this, but since it might interest others as well:<br />
<br />
The basic archiving concept is the same in Baan 5 as in Baan 4. Baan offers several sessions that have to run and will move data to an archive company. Add on sessions are usually required for archiving purchase data, sales data and service data. <br />
<br />
A list of sessions that might be needed for Baan 5 can be found on www.maxsc.com as well as other information about archiving. I have started a lot of cases with Baan support for archiving in Baan 5 and have received a lot of solutions recently. The main bugs have been solved although a few problems still remain. <br />
<br />
I use an archive planning tool, which allows me to do a much more thorough data assessment than manually possible and automatically generates an archive plan and other important information. I've used that for Baan 5 and Baan 4 archive projects (exampes on www.maxsc.com). <br />
<br />
Anyone interested, please contact me at karin@espelage.com .<br />

We are on Baan5c (we went live from April 2001) and intend to do achiving soon. If any one did archiving before please share your experiences. Would like to talk to them. Thanking in Anticipation<br />
<br />
Stachia - I have 120 page Baan archiving document, which is pretty detailed and is useful. If you dont have it i can email it to you. Let me know<br />
Also we are planning to attend a Baan webinar (which costs $1800) sponsored by Baan company.<br />
