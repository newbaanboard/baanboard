<br />
    I'm new to INFOR ION and I'm in the process of trying few things with INFOR ION webservices connector. While creating an webservice connection point in ION Desk, I'm not able to load WSDL. I keep on getting the error &quot;unable to retrieve the wsdl file from location&quot;. I'm trying with following WSDL URL : http://wsf.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/Weather.asmx?WSDL . I'm able to see the WSDL when I try to view it through IE. Somehow I'm not able to load the WSDL in ION DESK while creating the webservice connection point. Please let me know if you have seen this kind of error and found some solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Ravi</div></div><hr />

Never seen the problem before, but check if you have set usewsdl to true. Also check if you don't have any typos. <br />
<br />
Check this link. Will definitely help.<br />

<br />
     Thanks for the reply. Can you please let me know where to set &quot;usewsdl=true&quot; in Infor ION? The link given by you is for Delphi product. I have already searched in the net but I couldn't find anything related to INFOR ION. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
When are you actually getting the error?<br />
<br />
I am able to create the connection point without any issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
    Thanks a lot for trying to help me out. I'm getting the error while creating the webservice connection point. <br />
1. New -&gt; Webservice Connection Point<br />
2. Give some Name, Tenant, Description<br />
3. Click on Load WSDL <br />
4. Give the WSDL URL(Ex: http://wsf.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/Weather.asmx?WSDL)<br />
5. After clicking OK, I'm getting the error. <br />
<br />
Actually I tried with many free webserivces, I'm facing the same problem. I feel ION desk is not able to connect to any WSDL URLs and hence it's not able to get the WSDL.<br />
<br />
Please find the screenshot for more details. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I guess you might be missing some patch on your system. I would suggest to contact Infor with this issue. Generally, there is no issue with this process, it should work and should show you something like the attached snapshot.<br />
<br />
Also check if you get anything in the log files which will help identifying the issue.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's working fine on your infrastructure. I guess, something is not set correctly or missing on mine. As you suggested I will try to contact INFOR with this error.<br />
<br />
Thanks Again!<br />
