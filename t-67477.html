 I did not want to create a new bod...just to import bod that already exists to ION  and sent it to another aplication. How to achieve that?<br />
 Do I need to use Infor(lawsson) process designer? Or maybe there is a way to do that in ION DESK, maybe I just don't see it<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your question is not completely clear.<br />
If you have already an application that can publish a BOD to the Outbox table and if you have an application that can receive the BOD in its inbox then you need to define both applications a connection points in ION Desk and define a document flow between those 2 connection points. At moment form activating the doc flow, ION will start reading the outbox for available BODs to be routed to the other application.<br />

I have no expirience with ERP systems, please forgive me if my questions are not clear. I have INFOR LN and INFOR ION DESK. My task is to generate new BOD's and to send them to another ERP system (NOT INFOR). Also I have some already generated BOD's which I have to send. How to achieve that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">18th March 2015, 09:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, At the infor support side you can download a document that describes the BOD which can be published by LN. See KB #22945150.<br />
So if the BOD you need exist for LN then you are fine and you can use the configuration guide from the same KB#. This guide describes what to do in ION and LN in order to get the BOD actually being published.<br />
I'm not an expert in connecting third party software to ION. Main thing is that you figure out how a connection can be made from ION to that application. For this there are multiple connection types available in ION desk.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you in getting started.</div></div><hr />
