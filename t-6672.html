eg. of a value is 09011999<br />
<br />
i have to insert this value into a table field having domain tfgld.date<br />
<br />
i use the foll. to try to do it :<br />
<br />
<br />
       num.day   = lval(bfdt(3;2))<br />
       num.month = lval(bfdt(1;2))<br />
       num.year  = lval(bfdt(5;4))<br />
       tfgld998.bfdt = date.to.num(num.year, num.month, num.day)<br />
where <br />
    bfdt contains the date in string format , as it is extracted from the ascii file i.e 09011999<br />
<br />
<br />
when i run the session it gives a error<br />
<br />
Error 205 OUT OF RANGE<br />
<br />

For testing, can you make sure this is running/broken for just 1 record, and not a possible problem with record number x of 50?  Try moving the commit to right after your update of a single record, and see if there is still an error on the first record, or if it comes up later.<br />
In debug what are the following values, after their assign statements, for a record causing the error:<br />
num.day<br />
num.month<br />
num.year<br />
tfgld998.bfdt<br />
<br />
Maybe one of the records is having a month higher than 12 or a day higher than the month allows - that may generate an 'out of range' error, not sure. <br />
<br />
FYI - Rohan has already tried filling the date with date.num(), and it works fine.  There does seem to be a problem with his date field or formatting, though the syntax seems correct.  Any other suggestions welcome :)<br />
<br />
Rohan - there is at least 1 other method (probably many) - using the inputstr.to.date you can give it the input string without conversion, and the date format.  It should convert this to a Baan date, like the other functions.  I don't use that one much myself, but it may work better in this situation.</div></div><hr />
