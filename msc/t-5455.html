<br />
Please help...:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">10th June 2002, 11:35</div></div><div class="posttext">MRP and MPS is by default infinite planning systems. End dates and start dates control the planning systems and no control is done on the capacity of the machines or people. CRP and Capacity planning will inform you that you are over capacity but the user has to move the orders manually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">10th June 2002, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you're talking about &quot;planning against infinite capacity&quot;. That means that the planning engine will not take into account any resoure limits. When a certain order will be produced is just calculated from the lead times. So, if two orders have to be done on July 31, and both need exactly 24 hours to be produced on  one machine, both orders are scheduled to start on July 30 on that machine: The system does not take into account that this machine would have to operate 48 hours in just one day. Tee capacity of the machine is infinite.<br />
<br />
This is opposite to &quot;planning against finite capacity&quot;, where the system would &quot;see&quot; that the machine is overbooked and reschedule on of the two orders. Classical MRP-II systems always plan against infinite capacity. So does Baan, even if there are modules to do (rough!) planning against finite capacity. <br />
<br />
Problem is, that in practice automated planning against finite capacity (by genetic algorithms, heuristics and so on) does not work very good, because to many constraints have to be put into the system each day (like illness of a worker, machine stand still,  change of order priorities, and so on). Most of the time a human planner evaluating and adjusting the output of an infinite capacity engine is far more effective.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps <br />

i will try to be as simple as i could me. let me explain.<br />
i have vw. i drive it, my girl friend sits next to me. and 3 more guys sit at the rear. <br />
so the capasity of the car is 5.<br />
if you say 50 people will travel with your car, this is infine planning, which does not take the capacity into account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will also try to explain as simply as possible the reason that finite planning algorithms are often less effective than a human planner.<br />
 <br />
You have VW. You drive it and your girl friend sits next to you. The finite planning algorithm correctly identifies that the VW has seats for 5 persons. <br />
<br />
You see 3 guys. The planning system permits you to pick them up. They fit in the back seat and capacity is not exceeded. Your girl friend is pleased because she is the center of attraction. <br />
<br />
Suppose, instead, you see a beautiful woman. The planning system permits you to pick her up. She theoretically fits in the back seat. However, there is a unprogrammed resource conflict and capacity is seriously exceeded (at least according to your girl friend)! If you had used common sense, youÂ’d still be alive today.<br />
