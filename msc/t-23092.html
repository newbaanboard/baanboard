<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VilasoorRavi</div><div class="date">6th February 2005, 09:02</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using tipcs projects within BaaN Manufacturing.  We are buying a lot of items specific to projects.  Apparently, if we do tipcs projects within BaaN manufacturing, part number must be given to each and every item, as every item will be either a manufactured item or a purchased item(all purchased items for projects should also have a part number in order to place purchase orders?).  Is there any way I can place purchase orders and receive material directly into a Project within BaaN Manufacturing without needing to give part numbers?</div></div><hr />
