<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">12th April 2003, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">we are on Baan50.b, and moving to 50.c<br />
<br />
Let me setup an example to demonstrate my issue. We have 3 machines, and 5 molds that go on the machines. <br />
<br />
Mold 1 is for item A<br />
Mold 2 and 3 are for item B<br />
Mold 4 and 5 are for item C<br />
<br />
Currenlty, our routers are setup as follows:<br />
Item A has a machine operation with the # of machines = 1<br />
Item B has a machine operation with the # of machines = 2<br />
Item C has a machine operation with the # of machines = 2<br />
<br />
When MRP runs, it assums that all 5 molds are available all the time, when in fact, we can only run 3 at a time. The system always thinks there are all 5 molds avaliable, so our capacity is overstated<br />
<br />
Currently, we run MRP for these items, and the system tells us how much to build for a given week. We look at this demand, and based on that we manually decide how many molds for each item to put on the 3 machines. Ideally, I would like the system to schedule this combination of molds for us, instead of us doing it manually. How can this be done? Is this possible using TRP or the Baan scheduling bolt on package?<br />
<br />
There are really 2 problems/questions here:<br />
1- how can I setup Baan routers so that it does not always assume I have all molds available? <br />
2- how can I get Baan to recommend what molds to run on which machines each week based on demand per item? This would not only include chosing a mold, but sequencing which molds to run in which order?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example, sequencing dye lots from light to dark to minimize the cleaning of machines between lots. Or, having machinists be able to work on the same tooling for as long as possible before switchiong work centers.<br />
<br />
I personally have not seen this done with standard functionality -- but since I am more of a tech guy versus schduling wonk, I might just not know...<br />

I also have a pretty good experience with Manugistics. I'd definitely recommend this alternative.<br />
