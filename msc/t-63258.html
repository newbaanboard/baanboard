<br />
I have updated the PO Parameters to &quot;Approval Rules Mandatory&quot; and created Approval Rules in tdpur0191m000. They are as follows: Buyer B-SK is approved up to $500 and Buyer B-SM (Manager) is approved up to $1,000. <br />
<br />
Buyer B-SK enters a purchase order for several items totaling $550. Obviously, the PO cannot be approved, but we still want the items. B-SM has verbally approved the order. <br />
<br />
What are the steps in LN to get this PO approved and to the supplier.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />
