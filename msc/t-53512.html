<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhenning</div><div class="date">1st September 2008, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to print a detailed costed bom for a manufactured Item. I have tried the Print Multi-Level Cost price calculation, but the detail seems to be according to current price structures although the system reflect the historical Standard Cost Price at the top.<br />
Anny help would be appreciated.<br />

I have put in an Enhancement Request to Infor saying that &quot;Standard Cost&quot; should be a cost price calculation code option along with Cost of Last Receipt, Latest Cost, etc.  I am not even sure if this is provided in later versions of Baan/LN.  Suggest you complain to Infor as well.</div></div><hr />

Since, system prints the BOM as of a date entered, all one need to do is get the cost price from history (at least for purchased items). For operation cost it can be tricky as system doesn't store the operation rates, subcontracting rates by dates, but one can get the summary cost of each part number as of any date.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">2nd September 2008, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, a report is not a problem, although tricky for operations costs as you say.  However, what we want to be able to do is to cost a manufactured item, which may include sub-asemblies, using the standard cost of the components, not cost of last receipt, etc. This happens because you make a change to a product or introduce a new one during the year, and for consistency with other products and your standard costing as a whole, you need to keep the standard cost base.  This is not possible at present.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">2nd September 2008, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">What I meant is it may not be possible to get the breakdown like operation rates, subcontracting rate factor, but since Baan stores the cost of each sub assenblies (by cost price component), one can know the historical cost of each sub assembly and thus can get the cost of entire BOM strcuture.<br />
