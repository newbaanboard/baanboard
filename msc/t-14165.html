<br />
We're on Baan 5 and tried to use backflush hours for production order.<br />
<br />
We have set the SFC params to automatic backflush, we filled in the backflush employee and the default hourly labour type has also been filled in the HRA params and HRA master data.<br />
<br />
But strange thing is, we always get zero in the actual hours whenever we do report orders complete and answer yes to the backflush hours question. We were also able to close the production order without any hours entered, thus the actual hours remain zero.<br />
<br />
Anybody has ever encountered this? Please give us some info.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

The actual operation rates is Estimated Rates<br />
<br />
Any idea?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are 2 types of work hours that should be reported and can be backflushed, man hours and machine hours. You might have set it up right for the man hours side, but how about the machine hours? There's multiple level of machine hour backflushing setting in B5, and the higher level setting will override the lower<br />
 The lowest is in Tasks, I think. I don't have a B5 system handy currently<br />
 There's one in Operation which will override the setting in Task<br />
 The setting in Production Order Operation will override the ones from lower level mentioned before<br />
 There's Backflush Hour setting in Item Production Data of the item you want to produce in production order<br />
 The highest is Backflush Hour setting in production order itself. If the setting here is disabled, hour backflushing just won't happen no matter what setting is on the lower levels<br />

<br />
Thanks for the explanation. I didn't check the backflushing option in Task or Operation. I check the backflush option in Item Production Data so everytime I create Production order for that item, the Backflush check box in the Production Order will always be checked.<br />
<br />
I've verified that the backflush check box is checked in the Production Order. If it's not checked, the pop up box, asking to backflush hours/material, will not show when doing report operations complete, whereas in my case it did showed up.<br />
<br />
Any other possibilities?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">14th January 2004, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, Hendra, there are still so many things to check for. For starter, check out the Estimated vs Actual Operation Costs. See whether the estimated hours for man and/or machine is calculated correctly there. Probably you'd want to check out the Number of operators setting too in the Task, Operation, and Production order operation. If the above things are set correctly, then there are more things to check for.<br />

<br />
You are so right...<br />
<br />
For the estimated vs actual hours, they displayed zero. This is the symptom I saw and so I raised the question.<br />
<br />
As for the production task, I checked the task of each operation on the production planning session, they all have man/machine occup. value of 1.<br />
<br />
I also ran a check on the operation rates for the corresponding work center (I use work center operation rate), the data seems ok.<br />
<br />
Please let me know other settings need to be checked to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />

<br />
If number of man is specified and the estimated man hours in prod order is 0, then it is very possible that you didn't specify direct labor hourly rate in Operation Rate. Please make sure there's at least one line in the operation rate for your work centre that is of type Labor<br />

<br />
Sorry, I made a mistake in giving information. What I meant was that both actual man and machine hours were zero while both estimated actual man and machine hours were filled with figures calculated from standard cost and hours.<br />
<br />
I tested the exact same company setting on Baan with SP12 (mine was on SP11), the result is the hour is now backflushed. I guess the problem was software error.<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing your knowledge.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<br />
I need to correct myself :D <br />
<br />
Apparently the backflush hours problem has nothing to do with SP12.<br />
I tried to complete another production order but this time at the Report Operations Complete session, I make sure that the backflush options (under the miscellaneous tab) is ticked.<br />
<br />
To have this options automatically ticked, I have to make sure that the backflush option in Production Order is ticked and at Routing Operations each operations is given backflush option as well. Just backflush hours on the Production Order is not enough.<br />
<br />
After this setting, the backflush hours works perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
Hope I haven't mislead anybody. :cool: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">21st January 2004, 09:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Aha! Exactly! You missed the backflush setting in Operation. It's the third highest level setting on (man or machine) hours backflushing. As a guide, everyone must check the setting at every level from the lowest to the highest if they want to ensure backflushing works.<br />
