<br />
i actually have problem with some item.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, we have to buy an item A (Tube for ex) from a supplier B<br />
Then a Supplier C have to do some work on the item A. (Painting for ex)<br />
<br />
Do you know how to handle that situation in the ERP ?<br />

What i would have done (in BaanIV i.e) is to create a purchased item code and a manufactured code for item A. The manufactured item code will have a subcontracting operation in it. Whenever the paint job has to be applied to the purchased item, an sfc order is made for this item, which inturn, when executed, will generate a subcontracting purchase order for the paintjob. Once the purchase order is received, it will complete the sfc order and you would have captured the purchasing and painting cost for the item with documentation to show. The principle could remain the same in Ln...the way you apply it might change...<br />

<br />
This functionality is available in LN. You have to make an another Item Code(Manufactured) against your Purchased Item(A) and use this purchase item as the BOM of Manufactured Item. Then maintain the &quot;WORK CENTER&quot;, &quot;TASK&quot;, &quot;TASK RELATIONSHIP&quot;, &quot;ITEM ROUTING&quot;, &quot;ROUTING OPERATION&quot;.<br />
<br />
You also have to make another Item with Item Type &quot;SUBCONTRACTING&quot; against which you have to maintain the &quot;SUBCONTRAACTING RATES&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then make a SFC Production Order of this manufactured item &amp; generate Subcontracting Order against this production order.<br />
<br />
I think now the functionality is clear to you.<br />
