Is there a way to automatically cancel a sales quotation based on the expiry date. I think it was possible in Baan IV. Our requirement is something like if the expiry date has passed the current date the quotation lines must reach cancelled status. Even if I have to run a session regularly to achieve this, not a problem.  We need this because quotations are included as demand in our planning using success percentage.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

What we did in the end was to make a small vb program with the help of AFS that cancelled the quotation lines(changed status from Free to Cancel)..<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could use the same technique..<br />
If not, you could write a sql script which does the job since(based on baan4 experience) there are fewer tables to be updated...<br />

Thanks for the response. I will consider your suggestion as a lost resort. There is a global update session which changes the status within the effective period of the quotation. But the problem is it changes even the 'confirmed' lines to cancelled if it is within the range. I have raised the issue with Baan support and a defect has been raised to rectify the problem. If everything goes through well I can put that session in job with current date as the end of the expiry date and run it regularly. <br />

Good luck!!<br />
