Why do they have this status? Is it possible to declare automatically a production order finished with qty = 0?:confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tbrault</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">We knew that it was possible to allow 0 completion through the session tisfc0206m000 but here we have not used this session.<br />
So is there another way to do that?<br />
It's a bug?<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
