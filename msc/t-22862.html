<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">14th January 2005, 23:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for documentation on the calculations done and details behind the Copy Master Plan Between Scenarios session<br />
<br />
I have a scenario with monthly buckets, and one with weekly buckets. I want to copy my demand forecast from the monthly scenario to the weekly one, but before I do that, I want to make sure it is going to copy it over correctly, look at calendar lines etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">just_fro</div><div class="date">16th January 2005, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The copying is quite simple.<br />
<br />
First all demand is distributed over the working days and then the new periods are filled with the demand again.....<br />
<br />
For example: monthly periods with 20 workable days and DF of 20 results in daily DF of 1.........(1 on a workable day and 0 on non workable days)<br />
Copy this into a new scenario with weekly periods (with 5 workable days) and you will get weekly DF of 5<br />
<br />
When you have different DF per month, this will result in a 'gradual' rise/drop in weekly DF in the 'breaking' week....<br />
<br />
(at least this is how I made it 2 years ago.......don't know if someone changed it.........)</div></div><hr />
