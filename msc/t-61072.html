<br />
I am relatively new to Baan, and one of the most frustrating features I am finding, is the ability to filter. I am searching by description, and in this particular baan area, I cannot sort/find by description. I am attempting to use the filter application with the like operation but am having a difficult time. The word BRIGHT is most likely imbedded between other words and I attempted to filter with just BRIGHT and *BRIGHT* (I assumed * was the wildcard character). Any help or advice on a better way to filter and find what I am looking for would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!!</div></div><hr />

you can use condition &quot;Contains&quot; with case sensitive option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">22nd September 2011, 01:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Use Command as show below:<br />
<br />
Use Operator &quot;Like&quot; use Expression &quot;.*drawer.*&quot; this will find anything under the description field that contains drawer.<br />
the wildcard is &quot;.*&quot; before and &quot;.*&quot; after.<br />
If you wanted to find everything that started with drawer you would use &quot;drawer.*&quot;.<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
