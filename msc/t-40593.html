<br />
We want to track the scrap. How we enter the scrap in the production order and also how we convert the rejection stock in the scrap.<br />
<br />
Presentely, we insert a line in the ENTER MATERIAL ISSUE FOR PRODUCTION ORDER in negative quantity and issue the material, this method is process the scrap data and maintain the iventory for the scrap.<br />
<br />
Please guide me, how we track the actual scrap for every production order. We are not maintain the scrap factor in the Production BOM, because the scrap may be lower or greater than that factor.<br />
<br />
Please provide any suitable method for tracking the scrap.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

You can use the quantity rejected filed to input the scrap qty , if you are not using this field at present.<br />
<br />

<br />
But in the Rejection Qty field we insert the rejected quantity in nos, rejection units in KG. How we match the fields. Because the Rejection fields are not accept the in the fraction value of the scrap eg. 15.250 kgs.<br />
<br />
Please, provide the suitable path for mainting the scrap in the system.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

If you are entering negative lines in the estimated material then you have the requisite information - how much scrap is generated- in table ticst001. Isn't that what you need. <br />

<br />
We are also adopted the same way for entering the scrap qty, but, again we face another problem the user modify the bom material and RM stock discreencies come.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your valuable suggestion, Please also provide any other workaround for the same.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

There doen't exists a standard work around solution, but however you can customize it as per your process needs. It seems your scrap is variable and it depends upn user to enter how much material has been scrapped, so there needs to be an input of scrap against a production order. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">22nd August 2008, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">We have our users enter Material Issue (negative quantity) of a non-planned item (that is, it is not on the BOM) per Production order.<br />
<br />
The scrap item is a standard item of type &quot;Purchased&quot;. In fact, we have a number of items for different reasons of scrap:<br />
<br />
SETUPSCRAP<br />
BADMATERIALSCRAP<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
The standard cost of those items it set to be as small as possible as we wouldn't want a favourable variance to arise from generating lots of scrap!<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />
