<br />
I have been struggling with this problem for quite a long time and using GTm to resolve this.<br />
<br />
The issue is as follows:<br />
<br />
The user by mistakes requests for material A through the session ticst1501m000 by clicking on initiate.<br />
<br />
Actually this item does not have any stock. So the quantity gets stuck in 'To issue by warehousing'. <br />
If I have stock, maybe I can process through warehousing order and then return it back. But the problem is there is no stock.<br />
<br />
What do I do to clear this field???<br />
<br />
Thanks and heap in advance..</div></div><hr />

Please don't use GTM it's very risky<br />
all you have to do is visit session timfc0101m000 i.e production warehouse orders, view tab select materials, here u will find material in process and left side you have to cancel, use this tab and then shortcut on left to initiate and next left button to process and your problem is solved....<br />
