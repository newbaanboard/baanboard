Can anyone please help?<br />
<br />
How to simulate the calculate cost and valuation prices (ticpr2210m000) to produce a report like those non-simulated whereby it shows the new cost price and the revaluation of inventory??<br />
<br />
I have created a price calculation code (ticpr1500m000) say SIM code with price calc.type=cost price. Also the 1st to 4th Priorities = Si.<br />
Then Calculate Cost and Valuation Prices (ticpr2210m000) with price cal. code=SIM (of course the Actualize cost and val. price is dimmed). However, the printout is about ERROR report only.<br />
How to produce a report like those non-simulated whereby it shows the new cost price and the revaluation of inventory? This can help user to know what is the new cost price and the inventory revaluation after &quot;real&quot; calculated cost.<br />
