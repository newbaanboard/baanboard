I also need to provide shedule simulations based on work center availability per Week. Now we are just using the SFC module. <br />
Here are my constraint; :confused: <br />
- The planners enter production orders and releases them as soon as they arrive from Sales even though they will not be produced before (from 1 week to 6 months)<br />
<br />
- They never update the production start and delivery dates.<br />
<br />
What they want to see:<br />
- For a specific work center a list of all orders and planned usage time, planned delivery date, all based on the routing info. <br />
<br />
-Be able to change the number of hours the machine will be available by adding a shift. from this, do a simulation displaying how it will impact machine load and delivery dates.<br />
<br />
Ok nouf said, as anybody done anything like this IN BAAN or is there anything in BAAN that handles this. Any suggestions are welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Max</div></div><hr />
