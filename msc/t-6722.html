<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We are working on BIVc4.<br />
<br />
Please clarify, I am new to EDM.<br />
<br />
We create all items as E-items &amp; then copy these items to item master, through EOBM copy method.<br />
<br />
After going live for 10 months , when we open session tiedm1101m000 (Maintain Engineering Item Revisions), there are manufactured items with first revision as base revision &amp; the subsequent revisions through ECO &amp; the ECO number is mentioned against every revision.<br />
<br />
The problem is that there are some revision released without an ECO as shown in attached file.<br />
<br />
Is this a standard functionality ? <br />
<br />
I think system should not allow any change to be done in a EBOM/PBOM without an ECO, once the base revision has been released. Otherwise what is the use of doing ECO for some changes.<br />
<br />
I may be wrong, please clarify......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">EDM has two areas where changes can be made. Manual or by ECO. <br />
The reason for using ECO is that you can update multiple BOMs with one ECO. You can manually create the EBOM and copy over without an ECO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible to release and copy the revision (of an EBOM) manually. If the user :-<br />
<br />
1. Creates new (Manufactured) E-Item revision.<br />
2. Creates EBOM for E-Item Revision.<br />
3. Releases E-Item Revision.<br />
4. Copies E-Item to Item.<br />
5. Generates E-BOM copy data for E-Item/E-BOM Revision.<br />
6. Finalises Engineering data for E-Item Revision. (Finalisation Method - Without ECO)<br />
<br />
The above procedure will copy Revisions and BOMs to Standard Items/P-BOMs without an ECO.<br />
<br />
Hopes this helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
My query is why system allows to change EBOM/PBOM without an ECO ? <br />
<br />
I think this is debatable in any case !!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">18th September 2002, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">You need the ability to make revision changes without ECO's. We use this for numberic-revision items that aren't yet released to production (and therefore aren't under ECO control), but for which we still want control and visibility to change. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure, but I think this may be required if you're using small projects, as well, and you're not controlling through ECO's. All revisions originate in EDM. Period.<br />
<br />
However, I must agree with your comment. Don't know why I never thought of that myself. Once an item is revised through an ECO it would make sense to restrict all subsequent changes to ECO-only changes.<br />
<br />
User access comes into play too. Other than a couple of super users, we only have one or two people with maintenance access to EDM. You should be able to trust those that you've given this access to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you could do is hide all the sessions that allow manual revision release and manual PBOM update from users. One of the most obvious session to hide is &quot;Generate E-BOM copy data (multi-level)&quot;. By hiding this, users can only generate such data through &quot;Generate E-BOM copy data by ECO&quot;, hence effectively restricting PBOM update to ECO procedure only.<br />
<br />
If you'd like, you can even go even further by restricting the access rights to &quot;print/display only&quot; for several other manual revision control sessions such as &quot;Engineering item revisions&quot; and &quot;Engineering BOMs&quot;. This would force users to use only their ECO counterparts.<br />
