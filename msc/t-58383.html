<br />
We are on Baan ERP 5.0 C.<br />
We are looking at migrating Baan to external application and would like to still be able to run MRP/MPS in Baan. Can Baan modules MRP/MPS (Enterprise Planning)  be used as standalone modules?<br />
<br />
Does Baan has standard API/DAL ready in place for exchange. <br />
<br />
I would appreciate any help regarding this as this is very urgent.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

You would need to feed all the relevant data like BOM, Item aster, planned transactions, stock value etc.. It is doable, but needs to think it through.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vkpacc</div><div class="date">3rd June 2010, 23:32</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use Baan only for planning MPS/MRP, but we need load to Baan all data, what need for MPS/MRP. For example, BOM and routing, all production orders, all purchase orders, all inventory remainders. <br />
<br />
But I am don't understand, if you don't want change Baan for MPS/MRP, why you want to change Baan for another functions?</div></div><hr />
