<br />
 <br />
<br />
We are rolling out the AGS0 and Supply chain module at our BaaN installation. <br />
<br />
While testing the MPS Smoothing functionality we observe that it is not working as defined in BaaN Document P3270A US. <br />
<br />
<br />
This document mentions that, the Monthly requirement is taken to the 1st of <br />
Month per company calendar and demand is split amongst all working day of <br />
the Month. So if  schedule recd. form the customer for the month of Sept. 2005 is keyed in as 20,000 pieces on SCH sales schedule with period start date on sales schedule to be 5th Sept. 2005 (being the first Monday of the month) and customer picking up the product that means no transit time, I should have this demand of 20,000 pieces split in 22 buckets (22 working days for month of Sept. 2005), however BaaN software is splitting the demand into 20 days and still considering first Monday of the month i.e. 5th Sept. as start date for the schedule, whereas per smoothing functionality as detailed in the above doc, it should have 909 pcs planned for the each working day of the week, with 1st Sept. as start date.<br />
<br />
Any help in detailing MPS Smoothing funcitonality is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Did you input the demand directly into the sales schedule or transfer it from the Orginal sales schedule?</div></div><hr />

I beleve I did get what you are asking for but only when processing EDI 830's.</div></div><hr />
