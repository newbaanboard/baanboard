<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">21st November 2006, 00:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a user getting an error &quot;Planned project Inventory Transactions still present&quot; when they are trying to change the status of a Project from Active - Finished.  We've run the report Planned Inventory Transactions by Customized Item and there are several out there and most of them have a sales order on them that doesn't exist.  There was a header for the sales order but no line items.  <br />
<br />
I saw in other postings where it was suggested the user run Rebuild Planned Inventory(tdinv0250m000) would this be viable in this scenerio?  When running this session should there be no users in the system?  Does it take a while to run?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Yes, tdinv0250m000 will do the trick. This session will rebuild both tipcs500 and tdinv150. No users should be performing update actions on these tables, basically meaning that no one should be working in the logistics area. But in order to perform a quick rebuild you can also choose to rebuild the planned transactions for just the one project via the project selection in the special-menu. I suppose that in that case you don't have to worry about users being logged in either when that project is not being actively used anyway.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
