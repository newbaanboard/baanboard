<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">4th December 2007, 07:34</div></div><div class="posttext">So you have an entry in Maintain Period Table for the month of December in Year 2007?? <br />
This sort of an error message will come when there is an entry missing for the period the date(reported) belongs to..In this case the date reported is 03-12-2007 which could only mean that December is not defined for 2007 in the above mentioned session...Check the Start and End Date for the month of December in the above session...<br />
 <br />
For the other items that you said production reported properly, what was the start and end date in the session Report Production Schedules Completed by RPT items {tirpt1201m000}??<br />

<br />
Thanks for your valuable inputs. I agreed with you that the problem was due to the company calender. Because, when we planning the quantity of production order is much high in the normal circumstances. So the calender calculate the time which was shows in the routing of that item. It was cross the next financial year. <br />
<br />
So, we create the company calender for next two years and run session update company calender. Then process for that production order. Now it works fine.<br />
<br />
Once again thanks for all of you.<br />
