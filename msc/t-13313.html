<br />
Say I have item A with production rate 1 pcs/hour with man/machine occupancy set to 1 in the Routing Operations (tirou1502m000)<br />
At first, I set 1 machine and 1 employee in Work Center (tirou0501m000) and simulate demand for 16 pcs. The result came out fine, with 8 hours/day capacity resulting 8 hours/day load for 2 days.<br />
<br />
Then I change the number of machine and employee to 2 in Work Center (tirou0501m000) by adding one more machine and employee and update the resources. After that I simulate again.<br />
The result is very strange. In Resource Master Plan (cprmp3501m000) I can see the total capacity is now 16 hours/day but the load remains 8 hours/day, leaving 8 hours capacity free. Thus the system still advices 2 days production time while it could have been finished within 1 day, given the new resources (the man/machine occupancy is still set to 1 in the routing operation session).<br />
<br />
Anybody has any experience on this? Help please :confused: <br />
My setting on basic day cap is 8 hrs/day and weekly cap is 40 hrs/day<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sri_baan</div><div class="date">16th October 2003, 07:50</div></div><div class="posttext">By your explanation it means that U have increased UR Work Centre Capacity, but the Production rate of the item remains same as 1pc/Hr.<br />
<br />
The result what U have got is perfect. If U want the remaining 8 hrs to be allocated to the same item then change the production rate or run time etc in Task Information.<br />
Otherwise some other item will consume this capacity avaiable.<br />

<br />
Thanks for ur reply.<br />
<br />
If I change the information in the task/routing, then I would have to keep on changing and calculating the rates (outside Baan) whenever I have new resources.<br />
<br />
If so, then what is the use of &quot;Resource Occupation&quot; information in the Routing Operations (tirou1102s000) session?<br />
Is it not the static data information about the standard production rate with standard resource allocation?<br />
<br />
By logic, if I have 1pc/hr and 1-1 man-machine standard data, then with 2-2 man-machine information, the system should be able to see that the applicable rate is now twice the standard (2pc/hr).<br />
<br />
Am I thinking correctly? or have I misunderstood the logic in Baan?<br />
<br />
Please give me more advice. Thanks a lot.. :cool:<br />
<br />

<br />
I understand UR using WLC for UR planning. In which case the system will consider only the work centre capacity mentioned in Resources (in EP ).<br />
<br />
I suggest U to define a Work centre with the cummulative hrs available after taking into consideration of the number of machines ( of similar nature ) and working for how many hours.<br />
<br />
In UR case make the capacity of the work centre as 16 Hrs. <br />
And also see that U update the week capacity in work centre.<br />
<br />
PL try with the above set up and let me know whether it solves UR problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to the answer of ur question, what is the use of Resource occupation. This is used to calculate the available capacity but can't act a Constraint for Enterprise planning. This is used in charts and figures to do the manula Capacity allocations and production releases without the usage of WLC.<br />

<br />
This is what I have tried:<br />
<br />
I delete all additional man/machine. So the number is now 1.<br />
After that I doubled the basic day and week capacity twice (16 hrs/day and 80hrs/wk). When I update the resources, the number of machine and operator in Work Center becomes half.<br />
<br />
So I change the number of machine and employee back and keep the basic day-week capacity to 16-80 hrs/day.<br />
<br />
The resulting total available resource is back to 8 hrs thus no free capacity. How can this be ??<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions is highly welcomed :) <br />
<br />
Confused,<br />
 :confused: <br />

btw, I'm not using WLC, just Infinite Planning :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Richard</div><div class="date">18th October 2003, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We discovered this same problem when going from 5B to 5C.  Baan change the logic on the calculation of lead time and cost by handling the man occupation and machine occupation differently.  In previous versions of Baan you were able to double you capacity of a man work center just by changing the resoure units on both the routing and the work center. In C if you increase the resource units it now thinks that you are using two people to do the same amount of work.  The work around was exactly as stated below, which was to change your cycle time.  Having over 25,000 routings in my sytstem which are document controlled for ISO I found that to be a bad idea.  We went back to Baan and told them that they/we had a problem with the fact that they just hung out anyone using anything before 5C with a huge problem.  We convinced them that they needed a way around the problem that would be useable by everyone.  We worked with them and spec'd out logic that would return to the Baan 4 and 5B logic and calculate that same way it used to.  The way they did this was with some parameter settings that allow you to choose which set of logic you want to use, the currentl logic which was put in for the Scheduler or the old logic which we all use and understand.  <br />
<br />
We just went live on 5c migrating from 5b and the logic is working well.  We will have to tweek a few routings because it behaves a little differently using que/transfer delay (wait time/slack), and using transfer lot qty versus operation overlap.  <br />
<br />
If you are interested get ahold of Baan and tell them you want to look at the solution that they proided Tyco for the routing lead time issue.  I do have a copy of the spec, if you e-mail me I can send it to you.  I believe you will find that the solution works exactly how you are expecting you capacity, lead-time and cost to come out based on what you were describing.   Baan was supposed to make this available to all after we tested it, but you know Baan, unless you ask they won't tell, and they want people using a couple of very expensive tools called Planner and Scheduler.</div></div><hr />
