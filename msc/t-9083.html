    I have problem in choosing the forecast method, when I maintain plan items. <br />
    Our product has typical season factor, every Jan, Feb , there is few sales order while sales order will climb durging the Mar , Apri, and in Jul and Aug it will reach to the peak, after that , it will be down and Dec will reach to low point. <br />
    Could somebody has the experience to recommend which method should I choose to meet the business pattern ?<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see by your profile this is Baan 4, so some questions concerning your forecasts.  Are you consuming forecast as actual orders are received, if so what method do you have flagged.  The time fence setup is another issue, as well as lead times of the items you are producing.  Sounds like there are several criteria to consider before you make your choice.  Please contact me to discuss this in greater detail.<br />
