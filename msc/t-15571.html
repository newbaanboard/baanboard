<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">informatica</div><div class="date">4th June 2004, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I am working with infinite capacity in Baan V. So, if three orders have to be done on june 20, and the orders need exactly 72 hours (24 hours per order) to be produced on one machine, the orders are scheduled to start on june 20 on that machine.<br />
<br />
what we want to do is to work with planning against finite capacity where the system would see that the machine is saturated and reschedule on of the three orders.<br />
<br />
what is neccesary to do in order to change parameters, sesions  ?<br />
<br />
We will aprecciate your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janneman</div><div class="date">4th June 2004, 23:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Not possible to plan finite in ERP itself, finite is possible with the SCS Planner addon, also a SSA/Baan product. The SCS-Planner works on the level of planned EP-orders.<br />
When only finite scheduling of SFC orders is needed (execution level) SCS-Scheduler is a posibility.<br />
It is specially mentioned for that task.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">7th June 2004, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Finite planning can be done in Baan V via the work load control option. This can be done using the Master Plan but only in the Master Based planning area (See order horizon and Planning horizon). Link items to a master plan unit. Indicate on the resource that it is a constraint and I think it should be critical as well. Set work load control parameters against the plan unit. <br />
That should do it.</div></div><hr />

Work load control only works on planned orders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">7th June 2004, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Flip is exactly correct.  WLC in Baan V EP actually works fairly well.  The best use of it is to limit the amount of constraints you define.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are working at present with Infinite capacity planning, Can anybody help me with some documentation / help material on how to get started with WLC - for finite planning.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">9th June 2004, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">WLC will provide finite capacity planning only on MPS (or &quot;master based planning&quot; as BaanERP calls it) and not on MRP (&quot;order based planning&quot;). But if that's just what you're looking for, then it can work for you<br />

<br />
Thanks Paul P for the reply. But unfortunately in our case we have to use MPS as well as MRP and most of the capacity problems occur for the MRP items (Order based planning).<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For finite planning on MRP, you'd have to go for BaanSCS Planner, for example, as Janneman said. It has a built in connection to BaanERP. I don't know if it has similar thing on BaanIV. I've never worked on such integration yet, so I'm afraid I can't help you much in this matter<br />

Thanks lots for your answers. It´s exactly what i wanted. I entered three orders to be completed by june 22nd, using one machine and the orders were scheduled at different days according the finite cappacity.<br />
 <br />
I used the work load control option linked with the Master Plan. It´s important to set the work load control parameters against the plan unit before running simulation orders.<br />
 <br />
