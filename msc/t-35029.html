<br />
situation: <br />
<br />
after release production order , a warehousing transfer order will auto create based on BOM. <br />
<br />
issue: <br />
<br />
<br />
if the production order produces over 100 finished goods, how to let the warehousing order being generated piece by piece upto user, which means not to generate only one warehousing order to the production order because warehouse transfers raw material to wip by days, or weeks.  However, proudction department won't create small quantity of production order, because the BOM inaccurcy makes the production order closing tough. <br />
<br />
thank you alot -jim</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the way I understand you question is correct, instructions below might help<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
    You can control the material to issue in the &quot;Initiate Inventory Issue&quot; seesion by any of the ffg<br />
     1. date: only initiate those materials on operation that will only start for a particular date.. (requisite:cycle time set up should be correct)   <br />
     2. by operation: initiate invy issue for the operation you wanted to issue materials ahead of others..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimouyang</div><div class="date">30th April 2007, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you for the answer.  half of my question you give answer , however the important part is: <br />
<br />
initiate by operation is one part, <br />
<br />
initiate by desired quantity out of the production order is issue. let me give an example: <br />
<br />
<br />
1. manufacture item : A00001 , its: BOM B0001,B0002<br />
<br />
2. create a production order for 100 A00001 ( let say only one operation)<br />
<br />
3. after released production order, a transfer order generated automaitcally, <br />
<br />
B0001 100, B0002 100 in the one transfer order list. <br />
<br />
<br />
How can I generate the transfer order multiple times, <br />
<br />
B0001 20, B0002 20, today<br />
B0001 30, B0002 30 , tomorrow<br />
B0001 50, B0003 50 , next week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ggeneral</div><div class="date">1st May 2007, 04:35</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case, what you have to control is the picking list &quot;put away&quot; process of that corresponding production order ,<br />
   1. From the Picking list Session (whinh4525m100), modify the Qty by only putting the qty you want to pick, say 20 only out of 100 for item A. By default, the qty is equal to the whole order qty (or available qty if less).<br />
   2. The next time you want to get the balance qty, you have to generate outbound advise/generate picking list again. The new generated picking list now contains 80qty<br />
   3. Do step #1 if you desire partial again<br />
<br />
Important: Take note of the RUN number generated per outbound advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimouyang</div><div class="date">1st May 2007, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">wow, dear Mr. Ggeneral, I believe the whinh4525m100 is correct. however, I could not find that session either from run session nor find session.  <br />
<br />
my baanerp version: 7.1d.08.161</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ggeneral</div><div class="date">2nd May 2007, 02:37</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, it might be a different sesion number but I also believe that you shouls have a &quot;picking list&quot; session.<br />
This is the same process where your warehouse personnel &quot;pick&quot; materials when they issue to production. They should do this to withdraw materials from stock.<br />
<br />
Try looking from the Warehouse module, &quot;Outbound/Inspection&quot; sub-module</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimouyang</div><div class="date">2nd May 2007, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">probably, you already know that I understood the session; whinh4525m100=whinh2525m100;  But my problem is still, and I kindly can conclude that BAAN does not provide this function: <br />
<br />
if using outbound picking list to correct quantity, i have to correct piece by piece all the item, eg, <br />
<br />
set B0001 to 30, and B0002 to 30 again; I have over 3000 item in the picking list. how can i set the all 3000 item one time. <br />
<br />
the initiate inventory inventory issue (tisfc0207m000) does not provide quantity input.  I think that BAAN presume the BOM is correct anyway, which means to close one production as easy as to close 10 production orders. production department can divide the A0001 100 into 10 production orders that could meet the warehouse deparment item prepareing requirment.  However over 10% BOM inaccuracy makes the closing one production order difficult.  <br />
<br />
Thank you Ggeneral for your support.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think i understand your problem.<br />
<br />
if you want to partially initiate than go to material issue for production order ==&gt; Select line &amp; Click ====&gt; go to TO ISSUE, put qty as you want to issue and than press Tab balance qty will be shown in subsequent delivery than initiate you found that partial qty is issued as you want.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimouyang</div><div class="date">8th May 2007, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you atender for your reply. however, your answer is not what i want: <br />
<br />
1. a transfer order created during release/save a production order<br />
2. the quantity of the transfer order is the same as production order<br />
<br />
I need to shut down the trigger of generation : transfer, (but keep: production issue, production receive) , and let me generate the transfer order based on the production order with quantity selection manually. OR during the generating picking process whinh4525m100, add a proportion selection for dividing all items in that transfer order and auto re-advice the remain. <br />
<br />
your answer is about single line production issue, which is used in my production deparment daily for adjusting the mistakes BOM created. <br />
<br />
I think my problem is easy if baan modifies a bit of the code.  The reason I post here is for my wonder if  there is already a solution.</div></div><hr />
