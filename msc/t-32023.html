<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donnie</div><div class="date">1st March 2007, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I have this situation<br />
the BOM of item T looks like this :<br />
<br />
item T : subitem 1 = U (4 pcs) warehouse CD<br />
<br />
The routing of item T contains two different workcenter with two different shop floor warehouses<br />
<br />
Workcenter 001 shopfloor warehouse W001<br />
Workcenter 002 shopfloor warehouse W002<br />
<br />
Item U has both for warehouse W001 and W002 in warehouse-item session the supply sistem set to order controlled/single<br />
<br />
I insert a production order for item T and when I release it ERP LN changes the warehouse in estimated materials from CD to W001 and generates a transfer order from warehouse CD to warehouse W001.<br />
In my opinion this is not right. In production order the warehouse should be change to W002 and ERP LN should generate two transfer order: one to to carry out  my item from CD to W001 and one to carry out my item from W001 to W002. Where is my fault? Is there a way to set up my system in the way I hope it should work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">2nd March 2007, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Not used LN.  But from my understanding of WIP (aka Shopfloor) warehouses in Baan IVc4 I believe that when the production order is released it should be issued from W001 for the operation linked to work center 001 and W002 when the operation is linked to work center 002.  Sounds like a bug...<br />
<br />
Let me know how you get on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bond007</div><div class="date">5th March 2007, 10:35</div></div><div class="posttext">System will generate only three orders.<br />
1) From warehouse to shop floor warehouse.(Transfer)<br />
2) From shop floor warehouse to work center.(Issue)<br />
3) From workcenter to warehouse.(Receipt)<br />
<br />
Now yuor question is, why system is not generating warehouse transfer order for W001 to W002<br />
<br />
Let us consider<br />
Parent Item is X, &amp; child item is Y<br />
Operations are 10 &amp; 20<br />
<br />
When you completing operation 10 what item your getting? Neither X nor Y, it is in between X &amp; Y.<br />
<br />
Because after 10 th operation is completed there is value addition on item Y therefor u can not say that item as Y &amp; you can not say that item as X because 20 th operation u have not completed yet. <br />
<br />
Warehouse order is generated only when there is some item.<br />
<br />
But in above case there is no item is manufactured between op 10 &amp; 20. therfore system is not generating any warehouse order.<br />
<br />
I think this will resolve ur problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donnie</div><div class="date">6th March 2007, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, thanks for you answer but I don't agree with you. As you said after 10 th operation is completed there is value addition on item Y but I don't want to track this kind of information (ie: the addition is really low) but I want to track where I have to carry my item and where is my item. Using LN as you suggest, I have to creat a BOM level for each item trasformation even if the my item's value has not incresead. Moreover the only way I have to track items trasformation is changing codes. That sounds tricky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bond007</div><div class="date">6th March 2007, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Kindly, try to answer the following questions<br />
<br />
1) Between operation 10th &amp; 20th which item you are manufacturing?<br />
2) can you generate any kind of order without item?<br />
<br />
(You can not track WIP items by warehose in the system.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donnie</div><div class="date">6th March 2007, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">For my company I'm manufacturing item Y because Y with operation 10 completed is like item Y. As you know there is a difference between what a consultant learn on the system and the real world. I don't want to say that ERP LN has a bug but that the feature we are discussing about may be improved (if there isn't a standard solution).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bond007</div><div class="date">8th March 2007, 08:39</div></div><div class="posttext">You can map this but procedure is very lengthy &amp; time consuming.</div></div><hr />
