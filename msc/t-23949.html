<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">4th May 2005, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no check list needed in order to simply run MRP  the question is what do you have to have to be sure that the MRP results are things you should be acting on.  In order to get useful results there are many requirements, including (but not strictly limited to):<br />
	Demand  either in the form of customer orders and/or forecasts.<br />
	Accurate bills of material for the items being sold / forecasted.<br />
	Accurate on hand inventory balances.<br />
	Good lead times in the form of:<br />
		Routers for manufactured items.<br />
		Supply (Lead times) for purchased items.<br />
	Be sure items are set as planned items.  Anything set to be manually planned or SIC will not be looked at in MRP.<br />
<br />
Then, in BaaN 4, if you are using Projects, these must be in place for the customized items for the PRP run.</div></div><hr />
