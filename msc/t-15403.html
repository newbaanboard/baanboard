<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pradeepcr</div><div class="date">20th May 2004, 11:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
I am new to manufacturing in Baan IVC4. I created an item with item type manufacturing. I have defined the BOM and all the cost price calculation codes and all the operations and operation rate codes. When I calculate the cost price for the item it only shows the material costs and not the operation costs.<br />
In the item data there is a field cost price calculation code in which there is cost type. Here i have defined code with cost type material. System is not allowing me to define a code with cost type operation costs. Is this the reason why the operation costs are not getting calculated.<br />
I would appreciate if anyone can help me out with this.<br />
<br />
thanks &amp; regards<br />

<br />
It is not the cost type in item data that determines whether the operation costs shown.  When you calculate the standard cost price, the operation costs are generated based on the routing.<br />
The routing details the operations performed using tasks/work centres/machines. The work centre details the operation rates to be used for the operation(S) and the setup/production rate/run time of each operation on the routing determines what the operation rate will be.<br />
<br />
Hope this resolves your problem<br />

This involves defining the item data, the logistic tables (such as warehouses and seasonal patterns), the supplier data, the routing data, and the cost price calculation in the ITM, MCS, COM, ROU and CPR modules. The debit and credit accounts must be defined in the General Ledger (GLD) module. The (purchase) order types must be defined in the Purchase Control (PUR) module.<br />
<br />
Hope this gets you up an running,<br />
