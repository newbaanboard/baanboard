  Just need to confitm this.<br />
  In Baan IV ...<br />
  After a Production Order is closed, is the planning is deleted.<br />
  In Baan V<br />
  After a Production Order is closed, is the planning is NOT deleted.<br />
  I am assuming the new status field does the trick.<br />
<br />
  Thanks a ton.<br />

I'm sorry to inform you but the production planning is indeed deleted when you declare that the production order is completed (that's even before you close the production order)<br />

Then why have they introduced the Status Flag in Planning?<br />

The production order operation status will tell you whether each operation is still Planned, already Started, or Active. On top of that you can set each operation status to Blocked. This very useful if you want to prevent any activities for that particular operation for some reason (maintenance, customer delaying order, etc), especially if you have direct link between shop floor and the front office (e.g. using barcode terminals) where the production operators pretty much receive their to-do-list right from Baan-ERP. And finally, you can set each operation status to Completed if you want to stop a production operation (e.g. customer cancels the remaining order). This is also very useful when such direct link exist between shop floor and front office.<br />

Just a confirmation.... <br />
<br />
Should'nt the planning be deleted only when you 'close' the production order and not when you 'complete' it ?<br />
I tried the same thing on Baan V, It does not delete the planning until I close it. Is this a parameter setting somewhere ?<br />
Thanks for your time...<br />
<br />

Are we going to have a Midsized John anytime soon :) ?<br />
<br />
The production planning won't be deleted when you set the individual operation status to Completed. They're still there so you can revert the status of each individual operation from Completed back to Active. But if you set the production order status to Completed, it was gone as far as I can remember (did they make change to the logic or did I remember wrongly?). That's why you can't revert the production order status from Completed to Active, for example. You can still, however, report production hours and even issues materials even though the order status is Completed. And of course, all's dead when the order status is Closed<br />

<br />
 If the production order is set to 'completed', all the operations are also in the status 'completed' and are not deleted. As you said, They are deleted only when you put the status of order to 'closed'.<br />
<br />
What is the need to have the status of the operation 'closed' ? You cannot modify it and the record is deleted when the order is closed. Tried all possibilities, but could never come up with a instance of the operation being in a &quot;closed&quot; status. Has anyone seen such a status ?<br />
<br />
Another question...<br />
If you have a production order with say... 10 operations.. all operations are in 'planned' status.<br />
<br />
1. I go to operation 1 and clock in some hrs, the status of the operation is now 'active'.<br />
<br />
2. If I go to operation 5 and clock in some hours, the status of the operation 5, becomes 'Active' and all the prior operations remain 'planned'., except for operation 1, which is 'active'.<br />
<br />
3. I do the same thing on operation 7. Its status is now 'Active'.<br />
<br />
I now have operations 1, 5 &amp; 7 in status 'Active'.<br />
<br />
Questions : Which is my CURRENT operation ? :confused: <br />
<br />
Please advice. Thanks<br />
<br />

<br />
The only difference which I noticed between completed orders and closed orders with respect to production planning is that even though the order is completed the records are still available in Production planning for display purpose only. But once the order is closed the records are deleted from Production Planning.<br />

<br />
In most of real manufacturing companies, there's no such thing as the CURRENT operation of a production order. The preceedind operations will still be running even as the succeeding operations are running<br />
<br />
Dear Rhanumansai,<br />
<br />
Closing the production order has very high importance with respect to cost accounting. It is in this step that the variances are calculated and allocated to Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS)<br />

<br />
Thanks for the update on COGS. I was also wondering about little John's question about operations being in status &quot;Active&quot;. In Baan IV I only came across Production orders being in active or completed or closed etc status, but I never came across operations being in status - &quot;active&quot; - is it an added functionality in Baan V?.<br />
<br />
Further I was also wondering about  some opeartions being in &quot;planned&quot; status and some operations being in &quot;active&quot; status. <br />
<br />
For eg. if I have defined opeartion1 to 7 in routing of an item without posting production to let's say operation 3 , I cannot post production to operation 4 (subsequent operation) even logically with out processing operation 3 for the item I cannot start processing operation 4 for the item except under exceptional cases.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The preceedind operations will still be running even as the succeeding operations are running&quot;<br />
<br />
Further to this, I take it that you are talking about splits or some quantities moving ahead till the others on the same order catch up.<br />
Ex : operation 40... lets say 5 parts are here. lets say a paint job needs to be redone on 2, but the remaining 3 are good. So the three move to operation 50, and the 2 at oper 40 catch up later.<br />
These 3 can move further along also.<br />
<br />
Now at operation 40,  are you going to Rep. Op Complete 3 ? (ROC). OR.. would you just report qty completed as 3 and NOT complete the operation ?<br />
If you do not ROC the operation and move to the next operation 50... the opening qty on that operation will be 5 or 3 ? I assume.. 5.<br />
<br />
So, If i were to look at my dispatch list for the workcenters on the shop floor... the work center that expects to get the job for operation 50 with qty 5, in reality is getting only 3.<br />
Wont such situations mess things up ? <br />
I'm new to Baan V... please bear with my knowledge on this subject. <br />
Thanks for your reply<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<br />
By default BaanERP doesn't try to manage production activities in the shop floor right to the daily detail level. Rather it only tries to manage it up to production order detail level. However, if you'd like BaanERP to spit out daily production instruction, it can be easily customised probably from the Utilization by Day Overview data. But bear in mind that to achieve this detail level, your planners must be rigorous in updating the production progress and plan in BaanERP.<br />
