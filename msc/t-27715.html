<br />
Does MRP plan &quot;planned&quot; production advices and &quot;firm planned&quot; production advices in different ways?<br />
<br />
After running MRP (completely new) for a particular item, Baan generated numerous rechedule messages.  I then changed the required production orders so that after the next MRP run Baan no longer generated any reschedule messages.<br />
<br />
I then changed the status of some of the MRP Production advices generated by MRP during the last run to from &quot;planned&quot; to &quot;firm planned&quot;.<br />
<br />
On the next MRP run Baan generated reschedule messages for some of the &quot;firm planned&quot; production advices - despite the fact that it had previously planned them to these dates!?!?<br />
<br />
Having only changed the status of the MRP Production order, I do not understand why Baan suggests a new date?  Has anybody seen a similar problem?  It appears to me that Baan plans &quot;planned&quot; production advices and &quot;firm planned&quot; production advices in different ways?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
