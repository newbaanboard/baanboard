i have the folowing problem:<br />
I'm on Vc.<br />
We have a routing with a routing unit that is different from 1 (suppose 100).<br />
In this routing we have some tasks with fixed duration time (suppose 100 min).<br />
When we plan a production order via cp or even manually maintain a production order <br />
for an item with this routing, then the production time for this routing is given<br />
as fixed duration time divided by routing unit in production planning.<br />
In our case the time is 100 min / 100 = 1 min.<br />
In my opinion this is wrong (PEG says this is standard functionallity).<br />
Fixed duration time is fixed duration time! no matter if routing unit or lot size <br />
is 1, 2, 3 or 10000.<br />
Now my question to people who are on Baan IV:<br />
<br />
Is the funtionality the same or is it different?</div></div><hr />

<br />
BaanIV doesn't support fixed duration production operation by default. You need a work around in BaanIV to model that<br />
