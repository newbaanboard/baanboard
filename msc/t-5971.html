What's the best way to handle BOM changes? My production people would enter production orders for a manufactured item. If the BOM changes for that item, looks like they have to either delete or cancel these production orders and re-enter new ones to reflect the changed BOM. It's tedious if they've entered a number of production orders already.<br />
<br />
I just thought I would ask you guys as my production people are all ready to kill my engineering guys. <br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if the order isn't released yet, changing of routing or planning method will reset the BOM as well.<br />
But your production people should take care of the effective date in the production order. If the date is too old the changes in the standard BOM may not be taken into account.<br />
