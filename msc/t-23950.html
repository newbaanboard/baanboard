<br />
We are using BaaN 5c.<br />
<br />
I am trying to allocate one employee between different work centres. For that I made a set up as follows:-<br />
<br />
Created workcentre calenders for each work centres and also created one employee calender for an employee.<br />
<br />
I have attached the employee with One workcenter. After creating the calenders, I try to attach the employee availability type with each workcentres in different week, the system is not showing the allocation correctly.<br />
<br />
Am I missing some link? Can anybody give suggestions to allocate same employee to different work centres in different date?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

You can keep such complicated work centre assignment of operators in BaanERP for recording purpose only. BaanERP will not actually use such complicated scheme to determine production order resource assignment. BaanERP only needs to know when work centre or employee are available, but won't go so far as to check which operator are available at which work centre when<br />
