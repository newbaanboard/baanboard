<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanqueque</div><div class="date">22nd August 2011, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">When planning production orders routing is missing randomly. (different orders and different items, I can see no pattern, sometimes the routing is there and sometimes it is not.). When clicking &quot;replan&quot; the routing occurs and problem solved. But since this is happening everyday and on many orders/items there must be some underlying problem? <br />
<br />
Planning horizons are changed and are now put to 2038 instead of before (1970) but problem is still there.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what could be wrong?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you checked the effective date of the routing operations? Make them older and recheck by creating planned Production orders.<br />

It turned out that the problem was that the planning ran with multiple bshells. It worked allright with single bshells. Infor made a solution and it is now fixed.<br />
Thank you anyway.</div></div><hr />
