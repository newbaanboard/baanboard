Unless you look at the extremely complicated script for MRP this will be impossible to know and even then it depends on the setup of your data and what specific modules you use or don't use. <br />
What problem are you trying to solve by knowing the amount of tables used by MRP?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">27th August 2002, 13:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Like stated before, check the souces or run this command line:<br />
bic_info6.1 otimrp1210 | grep table<br />
<br />
This will give an impression on what tables are used.<br />
You can also run without the grep statement and then check for the string statemens (SQL statements).<br />
<br />
You can also run the session with the DBSLOG statement to see all what it is doing, but this is strongly dissuaded due to the size of the logfile generated and the time taken (probably over 2 times normal run time).</div></div><hr />

Else go to Tools-&gt;Applicaiton Development-&gt; Sessions-&gt;<br />
Print Current sessions for Package VRC.<br />
Give the ' ti ' package and enter the 'mrp1210m000' in session field and check the 'tables' and check the display.<br />
This display includes a list of tables used in the session given.</div></div><hr />
