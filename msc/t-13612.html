<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ukspmc</div><div class="date">13th November 2003, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone help me turn off the standard reschedule-in processing that occurs in the following situation. <br />
On day 1 a sales order line is entered for delivery on say 12th Dec and a purchase order is placed to satisfy that demand. On Day 2 another sales order line is entered for the item, but the required date is 20th November.  MRP then generates a planned purchase order for delivery 12th DEC and a reschedule in message telling me to pull in the original Purchase order to 20th November. What I need is for mrp to generate a planned purchase order for 20th Nov and no reschedule-in message.</div></div><hr />

It seems that Baan prefers &quot;old&quot; orders to rechedule than generating a new order with an earlier delivery date :( <br />
I suppose this is a general policy in the MRP-engine.<br />

what you descripted, is the normal and correct feature of the Baan MRP.<br />
Baan first wants to move purchase or shop flor orders. When changing/moving orders is not enough, the MRP generates new planned orders for purchase or shop flor.<br />
If not, it could result in too much orders.<br />
I think, the complete procedure for MRP is documentated, but I'm not sure in which docu (knowledge base-CD ore online help ?).<br />
But if you are interested in it, i can look for it...<br />
best regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gary P</div><div class="date">14th November 2003, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Martin is correct. Every MRP system I've worked with (6 including BaaN) approaches this scenario in the same way. The logic is quite simple. From a functional perspectice it's usually easier for a buyer to manipulate delivery dates on orders which are already placed than to launch new orders, particularly if the new demand is within the vendor's lead time. <br />
However, I would check your MRP parameters, to see if Baan offers a way around the logic. For example I know you can turn exception messages for rescheduling on and off. What happens if you turn the message off? Will MRP generate a new order instead of a reschedule message? Might be worth a shot.</div></div><hr />
