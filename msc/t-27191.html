In B4, this is quite commonly used to update customized item data in this manner. From B5 onwards it is not as if tcibd001.csel will be known during the project structure generation process. Item data is kept in arrays throughout the process. Only right before inserting item data, assignments to table fields are being made. <br />
So you'd have to update the arrays instead of table fields and be able to determine the right array pointers. There's no way you'd get this working on B5 or LN</div></div><hr />
