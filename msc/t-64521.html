<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">29th August 2013, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">when we run the cost price by project report for a specific project it is showing a line costs for a cost component that is a cost type General Costs.  I cannot for the life of me find out where these costs are coming from.  I was able to tie another project's costs for the same component exactly with some purchase orders that had Standard items on them that were of item type Cost.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me some insight where it would be finding these costs?  They are pretty significant as well.</div></div><hr />
