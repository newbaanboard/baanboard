    How about finish good ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When the stock valuation is FTP , the system generates production / receipt when production order quantity is completed at standard cost . <br />
<br />
When the material issued for order it generates , production /issues at standard cost of raw material .<br />
<br />
When the production orders are closed or project costs are calculated , it generates the production /result for the difference between the actual WIP cost and standard cost of completed goods.<br />
<br />
So u need to design yr chart of accounts keeping in view this flow of transaction generation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
       Thanks for your reply!<br />
        You are right, my problem is how to reduce the more reported quantity FG. For example, I can use the session ticst0101m000 issue the negative quantity to outbound the more material, it is right to decrease production/issue, for operation cost and receipt integration how to do now. <br />
       It is not correct for financial to integration those transactions in this month.<br />
       My option is make a voucher to reverse those more amounts, return material and do nothing for FG/operation cost, as long as report actually the production order, accountant should make correct voucher again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I understand your problem: client recorded 500 complete, then recorded another 3500 complete for a total of 4000. SFC order status is Complete. The actual (physical) qty completed was 3500, so 500 too many have been completed in Baan.<br />
<br />
As a result: finished inventory is 500 too high; component inventory is too low (assuming components were issued/backflushed for the full 4000 completed); labor postings and production results are incorrect (assuming order was closed).<br />
<br />
There is no uncomplete function in Baan SFC so the qty that has been completed (the production receipt) cannot be simply reversed. <br />
<br />
I think you have three options:<br />
<br />
Option A:<br />
1)             Close the order.<br />
2)	Inventory adjustment to reduce 500 units of the manufactured item.<br />
3)	Inventory adjustments to recover appropriate units of the materials components.<br />
4)	Accountant analyzes and enters manual journal voucher to reverse incorrect portions of the results, labor absorption, etc. and offset these against the inventory adjustment postings.<br />
<br />
Option B:<br />
1)             Close the order.<br />
2)	Enter a rework order to effectively disassemble or unmanufacture 500 units.<br />
3)	Review inventory to be sure that it is correct; adjust if necessary.<br />
4)	Accountant analyzes postings and enters manual journal voucher to correct any significant ledger errors (there should be few/no corrections).<br />
<br />
Option C (only if the order has not been closed):<br />
1)	Issue negative components for the 500 excess units completed. That will correct component inventory.<br />
2)	Close the order.<br />
3)	Inventory adjustment to reduce 500 units of the manufactured item.<br />
4)	Accountant analyzes and enters manual journal voucher to reverse incorrect portions of the results, labor absorption, etc. and offset these against the inventory adjustment. <br />
<br />
I personally would choose Option A for expediency unless the client has experience with using rework orders, or has heavily customized reports from tfgld410 or the SFC order tables, or if this is apt to be a problem that recurs frequently (in which case you need to review controls!).<br />
<br />
Remember that Im primarily finance  not SFC  so listen to others in case they have better suggestions. <br />

User reporting production order may not have any orders partially completed at the end of the month.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, as u said at the end of the month u need to pass JV for partially completed not-closed orders.</div></div><hr />
