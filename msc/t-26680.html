<br />
Creating a Production Order (SFC Order) and a BOM component is present in more than one phantom assemblies in the BOM structure; I found that sometimes BaaN add up quantities and creates one line for the total quanity of the components in Estimated Materials and some times it creates two different lines with quantities as per the BOM structure.<br />
<br />
Does anyone knows how this Estimated Material logic works?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">22nd March 2006, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">No, isn't the warehouse that decides to agregate the component in one line.<br />
<br />
I've been running some testing and seems that it creates multiple lines even if the warehouse is the same. I have the same component under three differnet phantom assembly with same warehouse and creates three different lines in Estimated Materials for the three of them.<br />
<br />
Does anyone has an idea what could be?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">24th April 2006, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">If Baan finds a phantom item in the BOM of a manufactured item, it uses the BOM of that phantom item to create the Estimated Material list for the manufactured item.  Because you have 3 different phantoms, you will get the BOM for all 3 phantoms in your Estimated Material list, independently from each other.  Therefore, the common raw material is listed 3 times.<br />

Hope this explains it.<br />

<br />
While calculating estimated material, the non-phantom componets and lower level products of phantom componets, are  sorted and combined per operation,item,w/h,length,width. reason being the same item may apear when phantoms are used.<br />
<br />
Keeping item same, if any of the parameter (i.e operation,w/h,length or width)changes, then an additional estimated material line will be created for the same item.<br />
