<br />
Can you give your thoughts on the following questions:<br />
<br />
1)In sch , we have frozen days functionality . If  MRP run is started on Saturday evening and if it runs half on Saturday and half on Sunday morning then which date MRP should consider for calculating frozen date . Should it consider the start date of MRP run (Saturday)  or the system date ( the day when it is running means Saturday for some item and Sunday for some item).<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Is it mandatory that frozen period should always end just one day before starting of week . Which means since Monday is starting day of the week then should the frozen period end on Sunday . Because if it is ending in between the week then its giving bad results.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />
Jayesh and Bhaskar</div></div><hr />

<br />
The frozen period is calculated from the MRP run date (system date) of the particular item, not the start date of the MRP run.<br />
The frozen period also includes this date as the first date frozen.<br />
<br />
Do you set your frozen periods up in your SCH contracts using Calender or Working days? If it is Working days, are your weekends set as working days?<br />
