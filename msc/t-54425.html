<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sjohnson</div><div class="date">2nd December 2008, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you manage the control of scrap factors on an item. Say something simple like a piece of hardware and you determine you have a 10% scrap rate when it's used on all BOMs. You can set a scrap rate in Items-Production on the item, but this will only work when the item is then added to a BOM. Existing BOMs with the item are not updated with the scrap factor. ( My testing may not be complete on this )<br />
<br />
If the item is used on 100 different boms, do you need to manually update the scrap factor on each P-BOM where it's used or is there a simpler way to manage this.<br />
<br />
Also, the scrap factor may change if you improve your processes, so it needs to be globally updated somehow.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
Did you ever figure out a solution to this; globally updating existing BOM's after a Item Master scrap factor change?  Thanks.<br />
