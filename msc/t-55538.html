We want to delete the PO lines for which receipt is not done through a customized session. As there are many PO lines , it is tedious to delete one by one through maintain purchase order session. <br />
<br />
Which are the tables from which we need to delete / update the PO line information in case of delete through customized session ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I think you should refer two table i.e. tdpur040 &amp; tdpur041 for your customised session based on PO/Date/supplier Range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nileshsamsonite</div><div class="date">6th April 2009, 06:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
What about tdpur045, tdppur051 tables. <br />
<br />
Is there any other tables which are affecting after deleteing any po line manualy through maintain purchase order session. <br />
I want to give the same effect of deletion through the customized session. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

As fas as I know below mentioned answers might be solve your query.<br />
(1) tdpur045 related to receipt but it will not be considered  because you want to delete only those PO- Lines, against which nothing is received.<br />
(2) tdpur051 is related to PO line history, In normal deletion of line ,nothing has been done by user by any session regarding this table as it is auto-updated history table.<br />
(3) I think there are not other table which is effecting as per your requirement</div></div><hr />

You should use AFS to delete PO line.<br />

<br />
Can I ask why you want to delete the PO Lines, you can simply &quot;CANCEL&quot; the line.</div></div><hr />

Before every MRP we are deleting the PO lines against which receipt is not taken ( receipt qty is zero ) . <br />
<br />
how this can be achieved through AFS ?<br />

<br />
There seems to be some process issue here which needs to be corrected, so that the Purchase Orders Lines are not created in the first place. After the planned MRP Purchase Orders are generated by MRP, the planner should only confirm and transfer those order that are definitely going to be purchased. After that, any modifications should happen to the Purchase Order Lines directly by the responsible users.<br />
<br />
Maybe to clean up the slate, you may need to delete these records one time, but that also should be responsibility of the users, not Information Systems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I faced the same problem and resolved thru customised table created where it  will list these type of orders. The users can select Yes from the option given<br />
