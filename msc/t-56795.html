<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpchheda</div><div class="date">17th September 2009, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">We have recently reinstalled Baan IV c4 in a new server. With this we are facing a problem. After approval for any receipt in session tdpur4121m000, the status changed to &quot;A&quot;. but the field &quot;Approved&quot; is still allowed to change next time you open the session tdpur4121m000.<br />
<br />
Previoulsy (in old server) once any item is Approved, then it is not allowed to change. Even if we tried to click on field &quot;Approved&quot; it goes to next field &quot; Backorder&quot;<br />
<br />
I have also checked tcmcs0139m000 Maintain Order step for step tdpur4121m000. The reexecute valve is same in both the places. (In old &amp; New)<br />
<br />
What could ne the other setting, so that once Aproval is made, users are not allowed to changed it?<br />
<br />
PS: Pat : Sorry to put this thread in wrong forum, becuase Distribution forum was not geting loaded and giving me error. Tried many times.<br />
