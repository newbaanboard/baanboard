<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sfronczak</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 00:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We are in the process of implementing BaaN 4C4 and have questions on the set up of consignment.  We would like to receive the purchase orders into a consignment warehouse, then issue the parts from this warehouse to production orders.  At the end of each day we would like to use total parts issued to be given to the vendor.  That report would trigger the vendor to send in an invoice.  The trouble is how to integrate this on the financial side as it has been requested that this inventory should not appear on the balance sheet. Please note ILC is not being implemented.</div></div><hr />
