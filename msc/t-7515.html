<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brewskizzle</div><div class="date">6th November 2002, 03:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
Does anybody know the meaning of &quot;Assayed Item&quot; field on the form 5 of the Item Master (tiitm0101m000) on BAAN IV c4.<br />
<br />
I know it's used for Lot controlled Process Item. But what is this field used for after all?? And when do I need to set this field to &quot;Yes&quot;?? I checked the help contents, but it didn't help me much as usual...<br />
<br />
Please help me... Thanks     =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vavs123</div><div class="date">6th November 2002, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The term assayed means rated.  I have not used it before but my understanding is if you have an item that has a potency of 50 percent and one that has 25 percent you would need to use twice as much of the second as the first.  This is used in the process area when you are determining formulas.  I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bhaskar Reddy</div><div class="date">11th November 2002, 07:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally Assayed Items is one  type of process item  where its potency varies from lot to lot so  Assayed  item must also be a Lot controlled item.<br />
<br />
A scalable material provides the ability to adjust the batch size based on the material quantity available during production.   <br />
<br />
In the situation where the components come from multiple lots with different potencies, they must be defined as assayed items.<br />
<br />
When the assayed item is received the potency of the delivered goods is entered.  Baan automatically determines the inventory delivered based upon the standard potency and the actual potency.  <br />
For instance:<br />
<br />
Standard potency of 90% per kg<br />
<br />
Purchase Receipt 130 kg @ 65% potency<br />
<br />
Inventory  =  ((65/90)*130 =&gt; 93.8889 kg<br />
<br />
This means that using the 130kg received would be equivalent to 93.8889 kg at the standard potency.<br />
<br />
Using this method is not necessary to adjust the formula qty since for each lot delivered Baan records the...<br />
<br />
Lot Number, Delivered Qty, Qty @ Std Potency<br />
<br />
When generating outbound advice the correct qty (based on the formula and lot potency) will be issued.<br />
<br />
For example,<br />
<br />
Items:               M1 (Manufactured Std Item) made from      1 kg of P1  (Purchased Process Assay Item Std Potency 90%)<br />
 <br />
Purchase Orders:         No- 82 for 130 kg, No- 83 for 100 kg<br />
<br />
Lots:                 18, 21 respectively<br />
<br />
Lot Potency:      65% =&gt; 93.88 kg, 95% =&gt; 105.55 kg respectively<br />
<br />
Prod. Orders:     100015 for 100 off  M1<br />
 <br />
Outbound Advice:  P1  Lot  18  130 kg  =&gt; 93.88 kg @ Std Potency<br />
<br />
                            P1 Lot  22   5.7 kg   =&gt;   6.02 kg @ Std. Potency<br />
Normally this field will be set to YES or NO the wile creating the process item  in the session tiitm0101m000, <br />
<br />
The filed value in the session tiitm0130s000 is defaulted from the session tiitm0101m000 for all of its containerized items.<br />
<br />
Once this field is set , you can't change for the item and  containers. However You can change the filed value in the session tiitm101m000.</div></div><hr />
