<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">28th April 2006, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,	<br />
	Is it possible to setup the company calendar to block certain dates for delivery? The requirement is that our logistics department wants to close their docking area certain days during the year. During these days they donÂ’t want any deliveries scheduled. The company calendar that we have setup has weekends and holidays setup but that would apply for both receipts and issues. <br />
<br />
	So, is it possible to either use the company calendar or something else to specify certain dates as blocked for receiving so that MRP can see these dates and scheduled the deliveries before are after these blocked dates?<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
