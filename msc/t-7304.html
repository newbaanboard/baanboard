The only available limitations in my case are BOM level and horizon.  The horizon is easy, but the BOM level has a twist.  I have a generic item with roughly 1000 subcomponents below it.  Each of these subcomponents contains actual purchased and/or manufactured items. When the main item is moved into production, based on the configuration, the first level item is changed to a phantom so that all of the subcomponents are exposed.  My question is this, does that make the original second level item now a first level item below the main item?  The low level code on the items I have looked at show 1 but that may be a function of the phantom item.  I have not found a report which will show all of the levels of the BOM in it's production state to verify.  Any ideas out there?</div></div><hr />

If you'd just like to limit the number of components calculated in MRP (for performance sake or other reasons), you can probably set those that you don't want calculated to be planned manually instead of planned by MRP. However, this may be desirable or not desirable depending on your actual condition there. I'm writing this in reply to your first 3 sentences.<br />

Thank you for the reply.  The number of components is too great to allow any manual planning.  What I am trying to do is work with both the BOM level/Low level code and the planning horizon.  If both of these work I should be able to reduce the cycle time for MRP to a workable frame.</div></div><hr />
