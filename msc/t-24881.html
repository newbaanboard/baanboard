<br />
We have Production Orders on our system which are at the status of Active but when we try to release them via the session tisfc0204m000 Release Production Orders nothing happens and we get the message &quot;No data found&quot;.<br />
<br />
We have just upgraded from 4c3 to 4c4 so maybe we do not understand some of the new functionality or we have a bug in the newer version.<br />
