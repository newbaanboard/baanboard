<br />
Currently we are in the process of updating our routing operations.<br />
We are adding setup times for some operations.<br />
Currently lot sizes are set to value of 1. <br />
Because of this we are seeing huge changes in standard costs when we add setup times. Would setting of econ order quantity in tcibd2100s000 solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Also in order to do this do we have to change the order method to Econ order qty. If we do so will it affect other areas like planning?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">6th December 2012, 13:47</div></div><div class="posttext">There is also a session, cprao3200m000, that seeks to optimise batch sizes (EOQ) and order intervals together.  That might be more use than just setting an EOQ.  Bear in mind that the EOQ calculation will need for each item the annual issue, cost of holding stock and cost of placing an order line in order to return a meaningful result</div></div><hr />
