In ITK ( Integration Tool Kit) we are facing few problems,( ITK version 2.4)<br />
While transferring data from Baan to scheduler huge amount of data related to employee tables transfered.<br />
Are there any filters available in ITK to transfer only selected employee data from Baan to scheduler?<br />
Are there any filters available in ITK to transfer only selected data for few project codes from Baan to scheduler?( Customized routings)<br />
<br />
Can we run first load static without employee in ITK ?<br />
We will create dummy employees in scheduler as per requirement afterwards.<br />
Then  how to proceed in ITK?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For your queries -<br />
<br />
1)Yes, you can select the range of employees that need to be transferred from BAAN to Scheduler, but only the range you can select, there's no such check box available to select only few employees, you can only go for a specific range of employee code at ITK.<br />
<br />
2) Yes, you can select the range for the specific customized items as well for routings, but be sure only the range.<br />
<br />
3) Yes you can run the first static load without choosing employee in ITK<br />
<br />
4) You can have your dummy employee in Scheduler, but there's also no harm at all in case if you use the baan migrated employees, i believe employee at your organization is not critical, so its does not matter if you migrate the baan employee to your scheduler and use them randomly (but be sure about using of those employees with qualified team).<br />
<br />
5) In case you want to use dummy employee only then uncheck the employee check box during data migration process through ITK.<br />
<br />
