I was wondering if anyone knew if it was possible to have more then one standard cost for a purchased item in Baan IVb?  If so, how can this be done?  If not, are there any suggestions as to how this can be done?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

It's not possible to have more than one Standard Cost per item in IVb.<br />
You can have other cost prices. Insert a new calculation code (set up Purchase Price Priority), build a cost price model for the new code (Maintain Surcharges) and calculate the cost price for the new calculation code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not possible to have Two Standard Cost for an Item, But it can be updated regularly (Min period of One Day).<br />
<br />
Can we know for what purpose you are looking out for Two Standard Costs for an Item ??. This info might help U with better answers from all. <br />

It's still not possible to use two different standard cost prices at the same time, for instance if you want to calculate different standard cost prices for the same item at different warehouses.</div></div><hr />
