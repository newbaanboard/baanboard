I would like to find out more about this if anyone can elaborate.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">9th September 2005, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">In Hours Accounting each transaction has the possibility to track actual man and machine hours.  There are man/machine ratio's to play with as needed.<br />
<br />
Estimated / Backflushed man and machine hours are also possible.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you could explain more of the situation you are trying to get to we could help more.  Have a look at Baan Hours Accounting (Manufacturing / Hours Accounting / Hours Accounting / Enter Hours Accounting - tihra1101m000).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">9th September 2005, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently we are tracking only man hours and not machine hours.  We have acquired new machinery that will reduce the amount of time it takes to make our product, however the actual man's time will remain the same (ie. loading the material and removing the material)  I was told by hour materials manager and shop foreman that Baan will not allow you to track both  I found this hard to believe from a cost accounting standpoint, their may be other areas that I am not aware of in the mfg area that prohibit this from occuring.  I am aware that I can setup Cost Price Componet codes to track this information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">9th September 2005, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">How are they tracking the man hours now?  Is it actual man hours through Hours Accounting or Estimated Hours through Backflushing..?  Either way you can do both, but I am not a functional expert, not sure of everything involved in backflushing.<br />
<br />
For actual through Hours Accouting, you will need 'Machine' tasks.  If all of your Tasks are set up as Non-Machine, you may have to enter new tasks and routing setups.<br />
<br />
Once you have a task that allows a machine, in hours accounting you will be allowed to enter a machine (it will default to your setup), and then both the man and machine hours will calculate.  <br />
<br />
I could easily be missing something from their propsective...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">9th September 2005, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">We currently are inputing actual man hours through hours accounting.  I felt the same way with rearding the tasks and operations having to be edited/created, etc.<br />
<br />
I find it difficult to beleive that and ERP application these day's can not handle both types of hours.  As you stated I also may be overlooking something on their side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">10th September 2005, 02:51</div></div><div class="posttext">By tracking I assume you wish to accumulate the 'actual' hours rather than the theorietical hours.  This being the case any suggestion other than use Hours Accounting would be off the mark.   <br />
<br />
Hours Accounting handles the processing of hours whether the be employee or machine hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">12th September 2005, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">You are correct we are recording the Actual hours and not the estimated hours (man hours that is).  We are not recording the machine hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">15th September 2005, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">The machine hours are recorded under employee code of zero</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">15th September 2005, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, under your setup that's probably true.  Depending on the setup, they can be under employee 0, they can be under an assigned backflush employee (estimated hours), or they can be right on the normal employee lines, if the line has a machine.<br />
If you don't care to track the machine hours by employee, you can enter them into employee 0.   But if you want the machine hours to match what the employee hours are, then you would want it on the employee line so only 1 entry is required.</div></div><hr />
