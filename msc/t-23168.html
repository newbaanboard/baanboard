<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmathew</div><div class="date">15th February 2005, 08:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been using the session &quot;Backflush Materials and Hours&quot; (tisfc0220m000) for purchased items including lot controlled items. While this session is run, in certain cases of lot controlled items, the actual quantity calculated is less by 0.0001 when compared to the estimated quantity. Hence we have to take care of these manually which is not practical. What is the reason for this problem and how can it be rectified? Please let us know if this is a bug or the reason for this.<br />
<br />
If the same is done through Outbound process this problem does not exist and it occurs only while Backflushing through the above mentioned session.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glisha</div><div class="date">22nd February 2005, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed this problem with Baan 5.0c. I developed customization for automatic lot generation and I faced the backflushing problem.<br />
<br />
I wasn't so sure what the problem was with my customization or Baan standard procedure. I tested manually Baan and saw the actual problem. If you put little amount (i.e. 0,0001) of finished good in &quot;Report Orders Completed&quot;, backflushing of purchased material will make a mistake. <br />
<br />
Only thing I could do is that I am going to do manual backflushing at the end of production order or I am going to exclude the posibility of doing backflushing at all.</div></div><hr />
