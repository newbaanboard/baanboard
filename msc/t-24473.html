<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Incorrect quantities are placed in Subsequent Deliveries field, when user modifies issue field and the SFC parameter &quot;Manual issuing&quot; (in tisfc0100m000) is set to yes. This occurs when the user uses the tab key or the arrow key. The value of the last displayed occurrence overwrites all the occurrences.<br />
<br />
Hope this can help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moon Lok</div><div class="date">7th July 2005, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">After a check on your problem, I wonder the problem may be re-appeared after the solution #75484 was patched. If you would like to try, you may backward install the solution #75438 (a solution just before 75484) manually on your TEST company.<br />
<br />
On the other hand. Have you installed solution #108234 which is also related to the issue you have faced.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />
