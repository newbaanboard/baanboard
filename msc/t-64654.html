<br />
My name is Jamie and I work for an engineering team based in England. <br />
<br />
We have very basic knowledge of the in depth uses of baan, and use it for the simple item inputs through item masters and purchasing. So please forgive me if my question seems a little simple. <br />
<br />
We currently sell all our spares from our base in England, but we are currently setting up this facility from a base over in China also. This therefore means we have set up a completely seperate company on Baan for the chinese branch. <br />
<br />
Question:<br />
<br />
So basically I have a long list of items, and kits in the item masters which i need to copy over from one company to another. Please can anyone advise if and how this is possible, opposed to having to re-type out all the individual parts again on the new company which will take weeks. <br />
<br />
I hope someone can help, this is proving a difficult situation, and any help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
<br />
Jamie</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will need to extract the master data of that item for all its master tables like item general and sub entities. Now, you can create ascii files for every master table which has that item. Then use exchange scheme to to upload the item in the new company.<br />
<br />
The second way can be to create a script which reads the data for that item in the master tables and write the same data in the new company.<br />
<br />
If you are sound in programming you can try the second way. Make sure you understand the tables which needs to be updated for that item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sitamjs</div><div class="date">27th September 2013, 22:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Another approach is to export data for master data tables Tools sessions to Create Sequential Dumps to pre data, Create Table From Sequential Dump to post data to new company after executing session tccom0214m000 to correct company numbers. Above mentioned sessions are Tools sessions and you might need Admin's help unless you have super user access in LN.</div></div><hr />

I agree with the above answer. But it will copy complete table not a single item. So beware. Else you might lose all your data.</div></div><hr />

Hello Jamie,<br />
easiest and fastes way is th create sequential dump of tables, but not only tiitm001.<br />
Only item master will lead to reference errors in &quot;create table from seq. dump&quot;.<br />
(Your profile says Old BaaN, it maybe BaaN IV or older ?)<br />
You have to create all referenced / related tables to item master (e. g. mcs tables like Countries, Currency a.s.o.)<br />
<br />
Attached you'll find a document for copy companies in BIV.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
