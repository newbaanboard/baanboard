<br />
The problem I am having is that our business may require a tweak to operations text based on the product that is being built. Info such as CNC settings, machine configs, oven times, etc.<br />
We want to copy an item, copy the routings, and copy the text over too. When I do this now, the text is assigned to the same text number link and I cannot customize without it editing the original  :(  Grrr.:mad: <br />
<br />
In short, Operations text is not unique per item, I need it to be. ANy help ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th November 2006, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">You might want to check with Baan support.  I am on 4c4 SP 20 and I can copy the routing two different ways.  Both ways create a new text number on the routing.  The first copy was from tppdm0110m000 - yes to copy routing.  The second test was using the zoom option off of tirou2110m000. Both created me a new text number for the new routing.  Might be something else that needs to be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">9th November 2006, 22:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Great thanks Mark !  I never tried form the Special Menu. I just used the COpy button ( rookie  :)  )  on the session..<br />
I tis also funny becuase we just put in a new server and we are migrating from SP4 to SP 22.<br />
<br />
We expect a lot of headaches  :( ...<br />
<br />
Thanks, I'll report back if those suggestions work as far back as SP4 ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th November 2006, 22:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Well speaking from experience - if you have minimized customizations then the headaches are few.  But do expect a lot of changes.  We just moved to 20 and your saying 22 is already ready?  I thought 21 was suppose to come out in september.  And then again maybe the A&amp;D version is one behind other extensions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">9th November 2006, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I got my SP number incorrect, it was the latest info from Infor ..... probably 21<br />
<br />
We've customized a few sessions that we will need rewritten. Sales orders, quotations, item master and some custom sessions that will probably just port right over. We have triggers to do things Baan wouldn't in those sessions so we're expecting a bit of a rough go in a couple areas, and making sure financials go into the right places  :) ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">10th November 2006, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, my backup server SP4 did copy text over and sever the link, my China test system did not ( similar layout in structure as it derived from our test server )<br />
<br />
Checked the text settings for external editor and set those up.<br />
<br />
Reset my China test server. Voila :)  It now copies routings and text without linking them .<br />
<br />
I don't know know how or why, but it did work  :)  thanks Mark for the confirmation that it does indeed work  ;)</div></div><hr />
