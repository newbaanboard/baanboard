<br />
     We are using Baan IV c4 under windows environment. I just want to know if we can impose a control on users such that unless and until production order of child assembly is closed, the system should not allow closing of it's parent assembly's production order so that inventory of parent assembly's production order is not posted in warehouse.<br />
<br />
     Seeking all of yours help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think it is advisable to force that as a solution. <br />
<br />
There might be cases where, for example, On a lower level production order of 15 pcs, you might partially deliver to stock.. say 5 out of the 15 pcs.<br />
<br />
These 5 pcs get issued to the top level order for the end item. This is delivered to stock and eventually shipped out. As long as all the components are issued for any given order, you should be able to 'close' that order.<br />
One Lower level order can satisfy the demand of multiple top level orders... It need not be always one-to-one.<br />
<br />
