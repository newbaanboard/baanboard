Factory A manufacture and supplies the parts to B and factory B does the assembly of these parts and sells the final product to the customer. Factory B also sells spares to customers of the assembled product as an after sales service. We have to decide if we set-up one logistics company for both or two, one for each. We have already decided to set-up two financial companies as these are currently two separate legal entities. Can anyone tell me what the pro's and con's of single vs multi logistics are?</div></div><hr />
