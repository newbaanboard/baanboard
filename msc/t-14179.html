I've been trying to interpret Baan's code on this - we have some code picked up in solutions - but it's rather cryptic.<br />
<br />
Does anyone understand exactly what this message means? I'm assuming there's a maximum allowable operation number for any given routing but how is that number calculated?<br />
<br />
I can produce a production order for this item in our test environment but not in our production environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">15th January 2004, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We figured it out. It was a parameter setting. No worries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Care to share what parameter setting you have worked out?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">16th January 2004, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">The parameter in SFC, Initial Value for Renumbering Operations is the one. We have six logistics companies, 100 through 600. In Companies 200 - 600 it was set at 100. In Company 100 it was set at 999 - this was an oversight during the company setup.<br />
<br />
I discovered the parameter problem before Baan Support could start investigating but they did supply me an explanation. According to Baan Support, when SFC is creating a production order and it comes across a phantom in a PBOM and the phantom itself does not have a routing, it uses this value to create a pseudo-routing for the phantom. The value in the parameter is used as a starting number and this operation numbers are incremented by the value in Step Size for Renumbering Operations. In our case that is 10.<br />
<br />
The maximum allowable value for these routing operations is 999. Since this parameter was set at 999, the system was immediately overrunning its maximum allowed value.<br />
<br />
The irony is that only Company 100 is using phantoms in their true sense so if we'd had this parameter misset in another company it probably wouldn't have been a problem. We were puzzled at first that we had this problem with some items and not others: even items with extensive and long routings would go through just fine and items with short routings would get the error.<br />
<br />
Oh, well. Live and learn.</div></div><hr />
