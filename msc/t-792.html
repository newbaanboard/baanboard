<br />
About PCF in Baan V. I checked our Baan V system and PCF is still present.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael Phifer</div><div class="date">30th January 2002, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The BaanERP Configurator is a configurator that can be used to virtually configure anything (for example, a product model). The BaanERP Configurator uses the latest object-oriented concepts and technologies.<br />
<br />
It appears to be a more user friendly product with greater flexability than the Baan Product Configurator.   Although I have not looked at its depictions, I believe that the resulting views are better than the ones from the Product Configurator.</div></div><hr />
