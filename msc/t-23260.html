<br />
I write this trhead to be sure that i don't make any mistakes.<br />
<br />
We have not implemented the &quot;ILC&quot; module. You are agree with me that i can't use lot control if &quot;ILC&quot; is not implemented. &quot;PCS&quot; is not implemented too.<br />
<br />
My problem is : <br />
<br />
I have manufatured item with a theoric bom list. Thus my cost price is theoric. When i do production order , i can change my bom list material.<br />
But my cost price of my production order is different than the cost price of the item. How can i  manage the cost price of my item after to have realised the production order? I think it's impossible but it's to be sure.<br />
But now if you have some ideas can you tell me?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
<br />

<br />
Routing &amp; BOM are set up to calculate the standard price. By standard price, it means that you agree to fix (standardise) the value of the product at that price, for certain period of time which is deemed appropriate by your accounting dept.<br />
<br />
Now, during execution of production order, you may find that actual production cost will differ than the one implied by the standard price. However, since you agreed early on about the standard price, BaanERP will proceed and value the finished good still at that standard price. BaanERP will also automatically book the difference as variance.<br />
<br />
That's how standard costing work<br />

<br />
your production order will use cp of manuf. item when you report prod order completed. Inventory value of received manufactured items will be based on present cost price at moment of reception (report prod.orders completed). Therefore do not care about started orders, you can change cp, inventory value of receptions will be calculated with updated cp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you very much <br />
<br />
If i undertand well , the variance is in finance and not on item fiche. <br />
But i try to calculate the cp of this item after production completed and the standard cost price doesn't change. (The last standard cost price date is different than today). Is there maybe a parameter to change?<br />
<br />
But now if the varainace is only in finance , how can i have the rigth sotck value if i use &quot;tdinv6230m000&quot; session?<br />
<br />
I have an other problem: we can change only one time the standard cost price per day, if i have two different production order on the same manufactured item , i 'll have problem to know the stock value.<br />
<br />
Now can i use project module to solve this problem?<br />
I try to implemente the PCS module, it's ok but the only problem is that when i recaculate the cost price of the specific item , i didn't have the operation cost , i have only the material cost. How is possible?There is a parameter ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
<br />
Best regards.</div></div><hr />

ANSWERS ARE INSERTED..<br />
If i undertand well , the variance is in finance and not on item fiche. <br />

YES: CP DEPENDS only on routing and prod. BOM. Does not depend on actual production costs and you can nor recalculate cp from actual production. You can modify only BOM and routings and then recalculate cp....<br />
<br />
Is there maybe a parameter to change?<br />
- NO,THAT IS the principle and fixed feature of cp calculation.<br />
Inventory value does not depend on actual prod. cost. Otherwise be careful: cp calculation revalue inventory stock (I mean existing stock)<br />
<br />
But now if the varainace is only in finance , how can i have the rigth sotck value if i use &quot;tdinv6230m000&quot; session?<br />
- YOU CAN NOT HAVE stock value derived from actual costs.<br />
  (or customization but I can not recommend it: fix cp has more advantage)<br />
<br />
I have an other problem: we can change only one time the standard cost price per day, if i have two different production order on the same manufactured item , i 'll have problem to know the stock value.<br />
- I THINK IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO RECALCULATE TWO TIMES per day... I do not like this feature when I am testing in BAAN, BAAN does not overwrite standard cp line for same date (=today).<br />
