Dealing with Rejections:<br />
I have a Question. We are implementing QMS and I have one Confusing Issue. It is not possible for me to Close and SFC Order as long as I have several Inspection Orders for It. With Multiple Samples it is Possible but the moment I have more than One Inspection order, the Inspection Orders cannot be closed. Please note that this is a continuous sampling. I need a solution to this. <br />
<br />
The inspection order needs to be closed otherwise the production order cannot close.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Baan Closing of production orders means, Closing of order for all practical purposes./ also Finanlcial closing . So to close the production order all the open inspection orders shoul dbe with the status &quot;Processed&quot; However you can have open (Free) inspection orders with quantity zero . These inspection orders will be delete automatically when compleitng the order itself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kigaro</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 07:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response. Actually, I wanted QMS To be the final approver instead of going through the approval process to close the processed orders. I am still searching for the solution. Thanks about the tip on zero Quantities.<br />
<br />
By the way, as long as the Order status is Processed, there is no way the production order can be closed. This is my worry and thus no Financial implication. <br />
<br />
Apart from that, How will I tackle the rejected inventory since in realy practice, we recycle the Material. That is, we refine it again.</div></div><hr />
