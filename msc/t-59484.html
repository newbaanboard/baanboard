<br />
trying to see how the system is working as far as the calculate cost of the project session is concerned.<br />
<br />
What we have is a project that has 2 production orders <br />
The first one is closed with no delivered quantity.  If we run the actual costs by production order, we have 2042.99 as material cost<br />
The second one is still active with a delivered quantity of 13500.  If we run the actual costs by production order, we have 5793.91 as material cost<br />
<br />
When we ran tipcs3250m000, it created a PCS/Act.Cost of goods sold of 27,580,365.00<br />
It looks like it took the delivered quantity of the second production order and multiplied it by the actual cost of the first one.<br />
<br />
Could it be because the second production order is still active?<br />
<br />
i do not have the source code for tipcs3250m000 so i can't look in the script to understand the logic.  Can anyboby explain to me what tipcs3250m000 does?<br />
Or better yet, can anybody send me the script of tipcs3250m000 (in a notepad format).<br />
<br />
We're on BaanIV c4<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />
