Baan IVc4<br />
We are starting to implement the configurator, <br />
and we would like to set up distinct pricing for various currencies.<br />
<br />
Allowing Baan to do the currency conversion to move generic price list entries between currencies will not do what we need.<br />
<br />
I have thought of two options for solving this problem:<br />
1) Create a feature 'Currency' and then use that feature in my generic price list constraints.<br />
OR<br />
2) From within my validation constraint, read the sales order header, and retreive the currency.<br />
<br />
Has any one had experience \ recommendations on this issue before ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

This will only work if your conversions are rather simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">13th November 2004, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 2 lines in generic price lists - 1 for £ &amp; 1 for Euros - although you could add more. Most of our pricing is based on a cost plus model so we generate a cost (which happens to be in £) then add a margin then in the Euro sales price list it calculates using a fixed exchange rate which is actually held in a file. We also store the fixed exchange rate for reference in the variant.<br />
<br />
I think if the sales order currency is not £ or Euros it converts using the Baan system exchange rates (so this is a floating price).<br />
<br />
Hope this gives you another option.<br />
