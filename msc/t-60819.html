<br />
A customer submits an order for a customized (ETO) product which we have never produced before.  The request needs to be sent to engineering to create new part numbers, BOMs and routings.  But also the raw materials have long lead times, therefore we wish to order the critical raw materials (anticipation) before the engineering process is complete to streamline the order-to-shipping lead time.  We are currently using this project order entry screen called “logbook”, creating work orders for purchasing the raw materials off of the project, then deleting those work orders and creating new ones After the sales order has been created for actual production.  We don’t create a sales order until after the item number is configured and entered into Baan, which can take several weeks.  <br />
<br />
This seems like an unwieldy process to go thru.  Isn’t it possible to create the sales order upon receipt of the customer request then update the order later once the new part number is configured/created?  How do we do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">priyanko</div><div class="date">9th July 2011, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are my 2 cents but would need some major customization.<br />
<br />
You need to implement the Baan configurator. The configurator would have several inputs in the form. Based on the inputs put by sales or marketing it will automatically configure the end item, it's bom and routing. <br />
The bom would typically made up of the major critical items, this will be useful to start the procurement process. Once the Engineering is ready with product bom and it's assembly part. The Bom can revised and the same will be effective in the already created Sales Order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks like you have b40_c4 and not b50_c or ERP LN.<br />
In that case I would indeed suggest to use a sales order in combination with PCS Project and BAAN Configurator.<br />
PCS Project can be used to capture all engineering related costs.<br />
<br />
Using TP Project in b40_c4 for your ETO process would be cumbersome and time consuming.<br />
However, if you would be using b50_c or ERP LN then it would be a different story.</div></div><hr />

What should be the process for creating a sales order then on a new ETO item, step by step?<br />
<br />
Also, is TDTDW a standard Baan module or is it a custom built application?</div></div><hr />
