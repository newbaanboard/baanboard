<br />
I have just a small question. I generated a production order for manufactured item, defined routing and then defined 3 Rounting tasks. After that, I use the session &quot;generate subcontracting purchase order&quot; to generate the Purchase order. Baan generated 3 purchase orders, one for each line of routing task even though the subcontractor is same. <br />
<br />
Is this the Baan standard behavior?<br />
Is there any possibility that we generate only one purchase order for all routing tasks if the subcontractor is same, and separate purchase orders only if the subcontractor is different?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I use the subcontracting and when they are many operations in the production order, for the same subcontrater Baan create only a purchase order...</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I must check? if there are some specific way to define the tasks to generate the production order? Please tell a bit what information you provided and which sequence to generate the production order so that there should be only one purchase order generated. May be I am missing some thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

2 - The subcontrating rates must be create for the subcontractor<br />
3 - When you run tisfc2250m000 (Generate Subcontracting Orders) with the correct limits (operation and dates) the system generate in my case a purchase order and print a report .</div></div><hr />
