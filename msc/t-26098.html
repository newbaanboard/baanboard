<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">28th January 2006, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally, a 'maintain' refers to an actual maintenance session, where you modify the field values and push the 'save' button (4GL),  Like Maintain Sales Orders, but an 'Update' session would be an option where you would fill in ranges, and some possible flag options, then push 'continue' to run a process that may update tables, may or may not print a report, like 'Generate Planned Purchase Orders for Sales Orders'.<br />
<br />
Process is vague term.  It can be used to refer to the running of a any session, each session you run is given a process ID by the operating system - as in 'my process is hung'.  OR it can just be a general term for what steps you take to perform something... OR it is used similar to what an 'Update' session means, a 'Process Session' would be like an update session...  probably other meanings too..</div></div><hr />
