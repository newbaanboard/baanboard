(I have post wrongly earlier at Tools, so i post here correctly at this section)<br />
Can you please help on my understanding and some questions pertaining resheduling messages (timrp1535m000) ?<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

Brad<br />
<br />
Working calendar for 09-09-2006 is OFF<br />
Some MRP parameter:<br />
- Length MRP Time Horizon in Days = 2500 <br />
- Create Exception Message = Yes<br />
- Cancel = Yes<br />
<br />
Situation Description: <br />
Purchase Order # 208130 with qty=2140<br />
Prod. Order# 512513 with qty= 2000<br />
Prod Order# 512535 with qty=140 <br />
The prod. Order# 512535 qty then is reduced from 140 to 50.<br />
After Generate MRP, result as per attached.<br />
<br />
Questions (refer attached file):<br />
How to read the Rescheduling Message? <br />
Q1. It showed purchase order# 208130 with order qty 2140 but is the system recommended me to Reschedule-out for qty total 140 (qty 50 and qty 90) of the order qty of 2140?<br />
How to do reschedule-out it? <br />
Is it changing the Purch.Order Total qty of 2140 to qty 2000, then create two purchase order lines for qty 50 and qty 90 respectively with their requirement dates?<br />
<br />
Q2a. I breakdown purchase qty below, but is requirement data recommend by system is as per my understanding?<br />
Q2b. Is the 21-06-2014 is due to Length MRP Time Horizon in Days = 2500 (=6.8 years)? Then is the requirement = previous 11-09-2006 + 6.8 year + OFF &amp; non-working days = 21-06-2014 ?<br />
<br />
Purchase  Expected_transaction                Requirement Date <br />
2000        Prod# 512513 at 10-09-06          09-09-06 (OFF), so 10-09-06 <br />
50           Prod# 512535 at 12-09-06          11-09-06<br />
90           Nil                                           21-06-2014 ??<br />
<br />
Q3. There are no cancellation messages in the Exception Messages.<br />
There is a surplus of purchase order qty of 140, so there should be a reduction of purchase order qty from 2140 to 2000.<br />
In Baan help, Cancel means The material is no longer required.<br />
What actually does cancel means, is it to delete whole required material  and/or to reduce part of the quantity required ?<br />
<br />
Q4. Why there is no cancellation messages when there is a surplus due to the reduction of production order from 140 to 50?<br />

<br />
It was and still seems to be the policy in Baan not to cancel partial orders. From your questions and example, I can assume that you have the MRP parameter set to reschedule partial quantities. This parameter can be useful but cumbersome. If a partial quantity is not need then instead of canceling it the planner is simply told to reschedule the excess out to the horizon to let the planner know this will cause an excess. If you want you can contact me directly<br />

<br />
How can I know that the Reschedule-out is due a quantity change or demand moved date?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erplncons</div><div class="date">17th June 2015, 07:29</div></div><div class="posttext">You can always check the planned inventory movement of the MRP items (display / print) and it should give you the details of requirements, safety stock and orders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">18th June 2015, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understand correctly, I have to do the netting of the transactions to determine if am short(for a pull in) or exceed(for a push out) the requirements at the date of the firm order?. or there is another way to look at this?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erplncons</div><div class="date">22nd June 2015, 08:06</div></div><div class="posttext">BaaN does these calculations for MRP items. You may use sessions timrp1510m000 or timrp1410m000 to get all the details in one screen / report</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">22nd June 2015, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand that MRP does the netting of the on hand and requirements and supply. No problem with that. <br />
<br />
My question is when requirement changes from 100 units to 90 units, BaaN create a &quot;Push-Out&quot; Reschedule Message; this message could be due the quantity reduced as mentioned above here(dates did not move) or requirement was pushed further on time(dates moved) but still 100 units.<br />
<br />
How do I know either situation only looking at the Plan Inventory Movements by Item? I should do the netting myself to see what was the reason for the Reschedule message?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
