<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason Patte</div><div class="date">14th September 2006, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">One of my end users accidentally reported an order complete but now we need to cancel it.  <br />
<br />
Cannot cancel production order and received the following message:&quot;hours already posted to order&quot;.  How can you reverse the hours so the order can be removed forever? <br />
<br />
it seems, also, impact the registering of jobs and datas entered, because production order still remain as active.<br />
<br />
Can someone provide some help on this topic to avoid a table maintenance?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

  A Production order can be reset to completed from closed but i dont think you can undo the posting of the inventory to stock. Just in the same fashion i dont think there is any provision to undo the posting of hours accounting. <br />
<br />
But then thats what i know..Anyone else seen any hidden session that does this? <br />

You can book the hours in negative, but you will still not be able to cancel. As the order is already completed you cannot go back! Close the production order and make a new one.</div></div><hr />
