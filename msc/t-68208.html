<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stacyglasgow</div><div class="date">30th September 2015, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently implemented the Manufacturer Part Number session in LN. We checked the MPN box in the Item Master under Purchasing sub-entities and then uploaded all of our manufacturer and manufacturer parts related to our internal part numbers. We are not using a &quot;Preferred Manufacturer&quot; (so none are checked&quot;, instead, we wanted this to be fairly free form, allowing us to list multiple approved manufacturers all available to order. In some cases we may have 7 different manufacturer part numbers for one of our internal part numbers and we have several thousand different internal part numbers. We are planning to make it so all part numbers listed in LN will print on the PO instead of selecting a Preferred Manufacturer and linking it to a specific supplier (as the session implies). So, we did all this, the MPN info is uploaded and now we are receiving parts and getting an error on the scanner as shown in the images stopping receipt. <br />
For the record, there is no Preferred manufacturer or related part listed on the PO line, nor for the part in the MPN session or anywhere else, there  is just listings of manufacturer parts numbers and names in the MPN session. The warehouse manager can do something to get it received, I am trying to pin him down now to see what. But it appears to me the transactions are getting stuck at this check using the scanners stopping the rest of transaction steps and I am guessing he is going into LN directly and forcing it through the receipt step. <br />
<br />
Error messages on our receipt scanner:<br />
&quot;Manufacturer Part Number cannot be empty on receipt line WHR 392726-10, because a preferred MPN is filled on the purchase order line&quot;<br />
&quot;The Manufacturer Part Number Field is Required in the Receipt Line&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">30th September 2015, 21:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't use MPN but from your message I can't figure out if the Preferred MPN field is filled in your Purchase Order line. From the error, it seems that it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stacyglasgow</div><div class="date">30th September 2015, 21:58</div></div><div class="posttext">No, the &quot;Preferred&quot; is not even set up at all, just the MPN's are set up with no preferred set. So, I think it is defaulting to since we did not define one we now have to say what we received once it arrives. The PO prompts nothing on creation or release as far as I can tell. So receiving has to go in and define what actual part number we received, which we don't care about. We only care that it is our internal part number. We use the MPN to keep track of what is approved but not to define which one we buy if that makes sense. We just turned on MPN a week ago, so that is why this is now happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A similar KB 1059532 exists on InforXtreme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">30th September 2015, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">If you go to Infor site and look at KB 1059532, the error message is exactly what you posted here. The resolution reads as follows:<br />
<br />
&quot;The message is maybe not completely correct. But as an MPN item is filled on the Purchase Order Line with a MPN-set, the receipt must be done for one of the MPNs in the MPN-set.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stacyglasgow</div><div class="date">1st October 2015, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys, that helps. It is unfortunate but it helps. It would be really nice if that could be ignored in our use case since it causes another step in the process that we don't need. However, we may turn this into an opportunity and make this our QA step for purchased off the shelf parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stacyglasgow</div><div class="date">1st October 2015, 22:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Wierd thing is in our duplicate test company it is not an issue, yet in our production company it is. Our data guy thinks maybe it is because we uploaded the data in the live company and just created them in the test company. So I am really not sure what to think at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">2nd October 2015, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">uploading data is fine IF you know what you're doing, otherwise it could give you issues. it is recommended to use DAL always.</div></div><hr />
