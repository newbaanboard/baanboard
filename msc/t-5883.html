So one final end Item might have 3000-4000 Items out of which 700-800 might be manufacturing Items. Now Engineering dept will maintain the BOM in EDM and copy that to Production BOM. Depending on the work load the production people will make a call to make the Item in the shop floor<br />
or to buy it out. If they buy then they will make the Item as purchased Item in the Item master and accordingly will run MRP. But now when the Engg dept makes a revision and tries to copy<br />
the Final item BOM some of the items it will not copy because the item type has been changed in the Item master. Has any one faced this problem before? Any workarounds?<br />

Can you pls. elaborate what this PCS solution is ?<br />

Project Control found under manufacturing. PCS is used in a make to order environment. You can copy the std. item structure into a project and change the BOM, routing etc without affecting the std. BOM etc. You can allso have different revisions in different projects if needed for the same item. <br />
In your case you could change the item to purchase once you have copied it to PCS and this way the PBOM stays standard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PCS doesn't work for as as they would become customized items in this case. We want to do without PCS using EBOM and PBOM. The case looks genuine and I feel at many places such a situation might exist and baan should offer some workaround.<br />

Only thing is tiedm1230 cnnot be run for that assembly as Item type will not match</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">25th July 2002, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Please try this also..<br />
<br />
In the session tiedm1220m000 get the record for latest revicion of EBOM. <br />
<br />
Now from special Recopy BOM lines &amp; then check the consistency of EBOM.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">26th July 2002, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the Item type is Manf  in EDM and Purchase in Item master I cannot maitain copy data if I try that Item from tiedm1230m000. So there will be no data in tiedm1220m000 for that latest revision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure whether I understand your problem correctly. but I tried to create a scenario similar to as told by you. It is working fine with me.<br />
<br />
Can you please elaborate your problem in more detail, so that I can simulate at my end?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Amarpreet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">26th July 2002, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Amarpreet,<br />
<br />
Now there was no problem as we found that it is copying the data if the session tiedm1230m000 is run for the next higher level item.<br />
<br />
Let me give by example<br />
<br />
Assume XYZ is my final Item. It has BOM in EDM with A1,A2,B1,B2 as components. Assume B1 is a manf item in EDM as has BOM as T1 T2 T3. Now B1 is made purchase in Item master but is still manf item in EDM. Now a new revision is made for B1 and we want to copy that to PBOM. Earlier we tried to use tiedm1230m000 for B1 and rightly it was giving error that B1 is a Purchased item in Item master. We were wondering how to copy to PBOM without changing Item type for B1 in Item master. Then we were told to run the session tiedm1230m000 for Item XYZ which is a manf item in both EDM and SFC and we found that B1 BOM is copied.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only issue is we will be having 800-1000 manf items in EDM and it is difficult to see what is the final item for this and whether the item type is changed in Item master etc.<br />
<br />
But in any case the functionality is OK</div></div><hr />

<br />
OR,<br />
<br />
Why doesn't the engineering depts update their EBOM's after production has determined the real origin of the part.<br />
