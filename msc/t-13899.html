<br />
Does anyone know where to set the time unit for slack time in Production Planning session ?<br />
<br />
Baan Help says that there are 2 time units, days and hours but I don't know where is the setting.<br />
When I tried to change trough GTM, the update fails.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Hendra</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can not set slack time, only calculate it. If the production order of 1000 pcs is due in 2 weeks and to produce 1000 pcs you need 1 week, then the slack time is 1 week. The more slack time you have, the more you can afford not to start production right now. Slack time of 1 week, for example, means that you don't have to start production now, but the latest time you can delay it to is 1 week from now<br />

<br />
Thanks for your explanation. I was actually looking for the setting of time units for Slack Time, not how to set the slack time.<br />
<br />
However, I've got the answer already. It's in the Work Center session.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">5th March 2008, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">The Transfer Delay of current operation coupled with Queue time of next operation result in Slack time for the current operation. It is not adding up. I checked thoroughly with both work centres' calendar etc...<br />
<br />
Precisely, I am unable to arrive at Earliest Finish Date and Latest Finish Date of Current Operation by adding up Production Start Date + queue time + setup time + cycle time and transfer delay; And ideally, to this, if I add the Queue time of next operation, should be the Latest finish time and the difference between Earliest Finish date of current operation and  Production start date of second operation should give the Slack of first operation. But it does not add up. <br />
<br />
Any  help greatly appreciated. Thanks</div></div><hr />
