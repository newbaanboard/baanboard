<br />
Initially the production rate was rounded off to Item inventory unit and maybe that is why decimal were not allowed.<br />
Check with infor support, i think they have released a solution in this regard in late 2012.<br />
Excerpts from KB 22902252<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
The production rate for the routing operations was always rounded to the inventory unit of the item. This resulted that it was not possible to define a production rate of 0.5/h for an item with an inventory unit of pieces with a rounding of 1.0.<br />
<br />
Resolution:<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
The production rate for the routing operations is now not rounded anymore to the inventory unit of the item. <br />
<br />
