<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">4th January 2003, 01:11</div></div><div class="posttext">We use session tihra1101m000  to book production order hours. We book hours by machine number rather than employee number and so Baan uses employee 0 to process it. We have 3 production departments that book their own hours and so at any one time more than one user can be booking hours using this mythical employee 0. <br />
The session is a little weird in that it seems to use some temporary array to store the entered records but they don't get saved (and the employee 0 get unlocked) until the user presses the save button or exits.<br />
The locking is by employee so this causes some problems as the 3 departments are not saving and so locking each other out. I don't blame them too much as the sessions looks and behaves as if it had saved the record.<br />
<br />
I have logged this with BGS but am getting no joy as 1. they seem to think we are in a minority in booking hours by machine 2. they call this new functionality rather than possibly sloppy programming in the first place.<br />
<br />
My questions to the board are:<br />
<br />
1. Does anybody else book hours by machine?<br />
2. Does anybody else experience this problem?<br />
3. If so, how do you work around it?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
