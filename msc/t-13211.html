<br />
Has anyone experience of doing this, or can someone point me in the right direction to find further info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dmcgrath</div><div class="date">6th October 2003, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Not used it.<br />
The files in question are available in the 'samples' directory of the Baan client installation. The readme file provides some information on the usage of the excel files.<br />
<br />
Hopes this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newtobaan</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We regularly use the Excel sheet to upload MPS forecast. We actually have the demand load into Sales budget and then copy the budget using Baan session to the demand forecast field. Works quite smoothly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ukspmc</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to both of you, I have now found the details and it looks to be exactly the solution I was looking for. <br />
However, although I can populate the spreadsheet I cannot get it to  connect to Baan. Could you explain what I need to do to connect to the correct company and correct Baan system</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 16:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Start with the baan.xls spreadsheet as it is much simpler functionality.  <br />
<br />
Things I have figured out:<br />
-you can't be logged into BAAN on the machine that you run the excel spreadsheet on.  <br />
-it will only run the default (the one with the checkmark) baan configuration file.  <br />
-if you want it to ask for a password still, that is ok.<br />
<br />
This should get you at least to the point of working spreadsheets.  However, I have never used the more complexe loading functionality so can't help you there.<br />
<br />

have you ever used exchange schemes in baan?<br />
if so then convert your excel spreadsheet into a .csv(comma separated file)<br />
load through ftp into your unix login path(ur user directory) <br />
and sepcify the path in the exchange scheme .<br />
The MPS data can be loaded into BaaN,using this utility.<br />
we use the exchange schemes regularly for loading MPS/MRP inputs.<br />
<br />
This exchange scheme is under Utilities folder of Tools module.<br />
<br />
NOTE: The field inputs given in the excel sheet should be exactly as you are defining the fields in the exchange scheme.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Any other details regarding exchange scheme do contact.<br />

The Master Schedulers create a .txt file file using Excel with the data formatted with Pipes between filed Scenario|Level|Plan item|period|forecast to be loaded.  We FTP that to unix, and has a session written that we run that picks the file up and uploads it to the demand forecast line.  The master schedulers love it, we have a 104 weekly periods and they hated loading a change.</div></div><hr />
