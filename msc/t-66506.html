<br />
Our company is using Baan IV (B40c.93).  We have never been very good at production planning, and based on everything I have read, one of our biggest issues is our &quot;Machines&quot; session (tirou0102m000) is not being utilized.<br />
<br />
One of the machines I am trying to enter into the table is our welding machines.  We have 30 of them working a total of 7 hours per day each or 35 hours per week.  Therefore our basic week capacity should be 30*7*5 = 1050 hrs/week and our basic day capacity should be 30*7 = 210 hrs/day, but when I try to enter anything exceeding 999 for the basic week capacity or exceeding 99 for the basic day capacity it generates an error &quot;Basic week capacity not allowed&quot; or &quot;Basic day capacity not allowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong?  Do I have to split these 30 machines up?  We don't always know which welding machine will be used....<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />
