<br />
could you tell me the advantage of PCF for costing.<br />
<br />
Actually we need to have clear information concerning the cost of our products.<br />
<br />
It seems that PCS can help to get clear information on that.<br />
<br />
My question with PCS, is it possible to have one standard bom for each product, or we must have one BOM for each customer ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your answer !<br />

In PCS, one can create Budget as standard BOM and can be copied to project and do the necessary changes as per requirement of project. Its like Maintaining standard Template for copying to the required projects. <br />
In Project (PCS), all cost associated with the specific customer will get captured in one bucket. Thats the advantage and and you can use in Hybrid structure also like BOM of Standard + Customised Item.</div></div><hr />
