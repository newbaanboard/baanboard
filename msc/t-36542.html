<br />
<br />
How we will get the wip of process item by process module and wip cost in process module of BAAN IVC<br />
and how distinguish between WIP material cost,WIP Operation cost ,WIP overhead cost.<br />
<br />

<br />
there's a session in Baan IVc4: Print Work-In-Process (pspmg0450m000)<br />
It will give you a report per each order batch which status is not &quot;closed&quot; by the time you print the report.<br />
It will show you WIP for each raw material, operation cost as well as overhead cost.<br />
<br />
The weakness of this report is: you can't specify which period you want to print the WIP report because the options available are only production batch no &amp; currency. So, at the end of the month, it will be hard to compare the WIP amount shown in this report to WIP amount shown in GL (Finance). Unless, you can stop the production people from updating the production batch data during finance &quot;close period&quot; time.<br />

Knowing material value of WIP is simple. I haven't worked in batches, but for production order one can create a report from ticst001. I created this report to cycle count the WIP. The Baan report is by work order, but I needed a report by item. I am sure a logic can be arrived for operation also from ticst002.<br />
