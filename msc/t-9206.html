This happens in session tibom1110m000, tipcs2150m000<br />
<br />
You have a bom line with a text , you duplicate the bom line and the text is also copied.<br />
You save the new copied line, and when you change the new text, the original text is also changed.(or vice versa)<br />
<br />
When we check in the session maintain text, we see that while copying the text, a new text is not created.<br />
So the system points to the same text in both the BOM lines and hence the issue.<br />
This is happening for both normal and super user.<br />
<br />
We have the latest session solution, latest standard program and the latest text solution.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest any directions/solutions to this issue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">11th March 2003, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no solution - if you haven't the sources. The problem is that a text field in the Baan table, by example tibom010, is simply a number that points to a text, stored in the tttxtXXX tables. A text can be copied (generating a new text pointer, so creating a brand new one text, that can be maintained indipendently from the original one) or simply linked to the existing one. In the second case the texts are - in fact - the same text. <br />
It seems that the session you use links the text and not copy to a new one. This obviously isn't correct.<br />
If you have access to the general table display (ttaad4500) you can check that the number stored in the occurrences of the original bom and the target one are the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">11th March 2003, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">How exactly are you &quot;duplicating a BOM line&quot;? In a IVc4 environment, I can copy the PBOM (or a section containing the line in question) to a new PBOM and the text is carried over, but with a new text number. If I try to copy and duplicate the line within the same PBOM, the text doesn't even come with it. Are you creating/changing BOM lines in EDM first and copying them over, or are you working strictly in tibom?<br />
<br />
To clarify what zardoz was saying -  Text is created using one of three methods. CREATE - creates a new text field identified by a new, unique text number; DUPLICATE - copies an existing text field exactly, but assigns a new unique text number to it. Now it is a unique text field that can be edited separately from the original; SELECT - Simply links to the original text field, using the same text number. Editing one then makes a change to both because they are, in fact, the same text field. This seems to be what's happening to you.<br />
<br />
There is an easier way to find the text number of a text field. With the text field open (using standard Baan text editor), go to File, Print. The screen that comes up here lists the text number. You can then cancel out without having to actually print.<br />
<br />
Back to the original question - how exactly are you duplicating the BOM lines? Between BOMs? Within a BOM? EDM?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The text will be the Same.  If you go into the Copied text and Deleted then do the Create Text this will create new text for the copied item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">What am I missing here? I have never been able to copy anything with text and have the new item (item, BOM line, etc) point to the same text. It always copies the existing text into a new text instance, duplicating the original (just like a Save As action).  What are you doing so that the text is the same?<br />
<br />
Also, you indicate going to the copied text and deleting it. Using the standard Baan text editor, the command is Disconnect, rather than Delete (actually deleting a text requires a different session - tttxt1210m000). Are you using Baan's text editor? Perhaps more importantly, kinley - are you using the Baan text editor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">When I say Delete I mean you go into the text and delete all the text.  When you save text that has no text It will make the text field zero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">14th March 2003, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, you're right, I'd forgotten that. But you have to be careful. If the new text is actually just pointing to the original text, deleting it for the new instance will also delete it for the original instance. It might still be attached to the original item, but the text will be blank.</div></div><hr />
