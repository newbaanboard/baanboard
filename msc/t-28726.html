<br />
I am able to generate the effectivity units , but not able to understand the whole procedure and the use of unit effectivity. <br />
<br />
can you plz explain the funda of Unit Effectivity...<br />
<br />
Thanks n Regards,<br />

<br />
Unit Effectivity is used to control variations of an item. You can use unit effectivity to model deviations from a standard end item so you do not require separate item codes and bills of materials for every combination of item variations. The deviations typically consist of small deviations of the end item.  <br />
Unit Effectivity typically apply changes for the end item when: <br />
<br />
 There are few changes to the end item. <br />
 The changes apply to a relatively small subsets of the end item.<br />
 The changes are a result of customer request.<br />
<br />
Unit effectivity is applicable in two ways: <br />
1. By Series: <br />
Effectivity units are used to define exceptions for an item series, or series subset. You can use this approach in low -volume production of complex products, for example, in aerospace and defense industries. Series are defined for a specific end item, for example, an airplane. Exceptions are then defined per series, for example for numbers 50-100 of an items series you define a unique option. <br />
2. By Sales Order: <br />
Effectivity units are used to configure items on individual sales order lines. You can use this approach in high-volume industries, such as electronics industries. <br />
<br />
Hope this satisfies your queries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be great if you could explain this approach with a specific example. The things you explained are also available in the SSA help, but these explanations donot solve my problem.<br />
<br />
for example; if there if rectangaular metal sheet (raw material) of thickness say 5mm(milli meters) and its widthXlength is 1250X1000<br />
<br />
now say there is another sheet with same length and width specifications but a different thickness it might be 6mm, 7mm or 8mm<br />
<br />
Is it possible to generate only a single item code for sheet and explain the variations in the thickness of the sheet  with the help of unit effectivity?<br />
<br />
if yes... please detail the procedure<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
<br />

After that you have to maintain BOM with all options. You have to define exceptions for BOM line with the help of requirements &amp; effectivity units. Exceptions decides wheather to omit or not the bom line.</div></div><hr />
