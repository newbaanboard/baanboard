I hope aneyone can help me with my problem in BaaN 5.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I have to compare 2 different BOM´s which are almost equal and the result should be a list where I can find the different items and the value if a item in or decrease.<br />
Our BOM´s have a depth from 1 to 5 steps with a lot of parts in it.<br />
<br />
Every Idea is welcome, now I solve the problem in this way:<br />
I export every BOM to Excel and compare it there.<br />

<br />
You do have some choices here, take a look at the where used component functionality, or best solution is to build a Baan SQL query to do the comparison.  Have someone in the IT dept look into this, it is quite straight forward, and reduce the need for you to do all this excel work!!:) <br />
<br />
Also, if you are some rules in the part numbering, then that should tell you if the parts are the very same, or different.  <br />
<br />
Let me know if that helps,<br />
:cool:</div></div><hr />

(but you need some patience yet)</div></div><hr />

two diffent PBOMs. (Sigle and Multi-level)<br />
Same E-BOM diff. revisions... this is hard to do, because effectiviness of the components.(single - multi-level)<br />
