We have maintained the Standard Routing for an Item, like Cycle Time, Queue Time, Move Time. We are not using the Lot Quantity, due to chain System. If we complete First operation for a single piece, its move forward to the next operation and so on till last operation. Assume every operation has 5 minutes cycle time. We make a production order for 1000 Pcs. System calculate the Delivery date after two days. But according to the production user they produce 850 pcs in 8 hrs from the production start.<br />
<br />
This problem is comming in almost all items. Please suggest how can we resolve this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

Cycle time must be defined by operation, you can use routing unit qty = 850 if necessary.<br />
and, is it possible to use transfer batch qty to be 850 pcs?</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your response, We have maintain all time in the routing operations, But when I calculate or make a production order for a particular quantity, the start time and the delivery time apeared in the production order. but that time is not justified, because the system show 36 hours (assume) but the production department produce that quantity in much less than that time.<br />
<br />
what to do for calculate the exect time as per the production department takes during the production.<br />
<br />

<br />
In the routing operations there is a check box for &quot;transfer batch less than production batch&quot;. Select this and give the transfer quantity as one for all operations. Then the next operation will be planned immediately after a single job in the prevoius operation is completed. This can be defined at the routing level or you can modify in the production order also.<br />
