<br />
Sub: Manufacturing Package - Routing - Work Center.<br />
<br />
We have a situation wherein there is more than 1 employee working at a particular Work Center,but as far as i know BaaN does not have provision to enter more than 1 employee at the work center or more than one work center in the Maintain Employee Session. We would like to ask if there is any provision or session/solution where this problem is addressed.<br />
<br />
Your immediate response is highly appreciated,<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Best Regards,</div></div><hr />

There is no restriction as to the number of employees that get linked to a workcenter. It is indeed not possible to indicate that the same employee is part of multiple work centers. However while recording actual hours people of several work centers can work on the order of a specific work center, not necessarily the one of the employee(s).<br />
Please clarify what is your problem/limitation experienced?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply, my question is  <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
The Manufactured item is set to BackFlushing Hours:YES in Maintain Item Data <br />
Session.<br />
<br />
If i define  4  employees in Maintain Employees session assigning them to the  same work center and leave the Employee field 0 in work center, during the creation of routing  i am getting the message &quot;Backflush Employee is not filled for the work center&quot;, my concern is if i assign one employee to the work center does BaaN treat it as one to one relationship and ignore the other employees linked in the Maintain Employees Session?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Best Regards,</div></div><hr />

Either you have employees record time or you backflush to one employee, often enough not a real person but an employee set up specificly for the use of backflushing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">4th October 2007, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Also in system you have the ability to either backflush material or hours or both or none. If you just want to backfkush material and do actual on hours that is also possible. In thsi way you can report the hours by each employee.<br />
