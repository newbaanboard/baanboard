<br />
Does anyone know the setting to make the reject field in the Report Order Complete session active ?<br />
<br />
When creating a newly released production order, and then when reporting complete directly in the Report Order Complete session, I find that the reject filed is sometime active and sometime is not.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">9th November 2004, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Might be because of type of yield. Continious will not allowe you to fill reject. Could also be because of values filled on last operation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The yield type is discrete and I have only one operation.<br />
<br />
The strange thing is, if my production order doesn't have any operation (no routing) then the reject field is open. But when I insert one operation, the field is not accessible.<br />
<br />
Any idea what is causing this?<br />
<br />

<br />
The quantity of the manufactured item that must be rejected because it is faulty.<br />
This field can only be filled manually if no operations are linked to a production order.<br />
If backflushing is applied, reporting a quantity as rejected results in the issue of a corresponding quantity of materials.<br />
As soon as Warehouse Management finishes the outbound procedure for these materials, the value of the To Reject field is added to the Quantity Rejected field and the To Reject field is set to zero.</div></div><hr />
