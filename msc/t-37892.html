<br />
We are on Ln 6.1 FP2 and we have not been able to succeed with uploading data through exchange scheme for cprpd100. When we insert a record manually the system generates planned orders but when we upload data through exchange scheme (DAL enabled) the system does not generate planned orders although the record goes into the table .<br />
<br />
Help required on the matter please.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />

Are you sure that you are entering into all the tables that matters. Perhaps you could do a profile(for e.g: SQL Profiler) or equivalent to see which all tables get filled up when you enter a record manually. I guess you might be missing a table or a flag in the table you are pushing data into. Another suggestion would be is to check the datatype of your scheme and of the data you are pushing. Might be setting a wrong value in one of the enum fields...<br />

We faced the same problem but finally it is because of this table, in Baan V. May be in LN also the same is the case. Another option is keep changing something in the fields in 'item ordering data' and 'item planning data' and save. And then try planning. That way you can get confirmation that some entry is missed during entry and explore further based on the influencing field.<br />
