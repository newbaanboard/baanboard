<br />
Looking in Hours Accounting by Production Order and by Employee I do not see any record for the production order in question. <br />
<br />
1) Why does this prevent the receipt?<br />
<br />
2) If there where no subcontracting purchase order would this cause any other problems?<br />
<br />
3) Is there a logical reason for the order to have no Hours recorded? <br />
<br />
I have not had reason to really look through this session before but from what I am seeing there are other orders that appear to not have hours where I would expect that they should.<br />
<br />
I think we're on baan50Oc<br />
Windows XP 2002.<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought I should add that there are 3 operations to the production order. The subcontracting operation is the last one. I have tried reporting the first two complete to see if this would help, I thought this might generate the records it seemed to be expecting in the hours accounting table but it did not and I still could not book the receipt.</div></div><hr />
