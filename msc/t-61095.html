<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">techwriter</div><div class="date">2nd September 2011, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to capture production time (touch) and cycle time (no-touch) in the same operation on a routing?  ie. an operator spends 15 mins. applying epoxy, then the part cures for 8 hours.  Is there a way to combine the application and cure steps in the same operation, capture the full lead time, without charging addition cost for the cycle time?<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you looking for setup time and production time together at your production order table or something else?..please elaborate your issue. Post some screen shots to understand it in better way.<br />
FYI, setup time and production time can be defined separately in together at production order table.<br />
<br />

It shows 2 copies of routes; our current set up and our preferred set up. I just don't know if we can make the preferred way work. I hope you understand the question, it's a hard one to explain.<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Operation Wait Time is the time that the items stay at a Work Center after the operation is completed, before being moved to the next operation. <br />
<br />
Wait Time is considered in the Production Lead Time for the item. <br />
