<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hsaenz</div><div class="date">29th November 2005, 23:12</div></div><div class="posttext">When MPS/MRP run and the item master has an order lead time and a safety time.  For example item 001 has order lead time of 60 days and a safety time of 5 days.  The SCH Purchase contract has a frozen period of 28 days.  <br />
<br />
How does BaaN handle requirements for an 830 Purchase Schedule?  If you have another requirement in 30 days for that supplier and the requirement is within the order lead time and safety time on item master, will baan put the requirement out to after the 65 days?  or does BaaN put it after the frozen period of 28 days? or does the requirement come out when it is required?  please advise.</div></div><hr />

It simply takes the safety time off the contract and backs up the demand, in your case 5 days. So in a sense you have a 33 day frozen period of supply pegged against the demand. You can contact me for more detail explaination if you want to.</div></div><hr />
