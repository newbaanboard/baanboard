I want to have an item in the estimated BOM so that planning could plan for that item. But at the item receiving that item I would post the inventory for components of that parent so I don't want the inventory of the parent to be considered in Production order processing except creating a planned order. So lets say My top level item is ABCD and then ABCD has A,B, C &amp; D in its estimated BOM. Now A is composed of B, C &amp; D; so I want to create a purchase order for A but would receive them as a post to component so I don't want the inventory of A to be considered anywhere once the planning is done on A. Please let me know if you have any suggestion on this.<br />

I am working on BaaN V.<br />

In which case it never exists in inventory and all transactions are done on its components.</div></div><hr />

One thing is not clear that why you want to generate planned order for A as you dont want to maintain inventory of A. This is not possible in system. System only create planned orders for inventory items. Hence there is two work around solutions for this scenario.<br />
1. Make A phantom item. (Even there is option to maintain phantom item inventory.) Them when you will create production order, that time in estimated line you will find the child items of A. Planning engine also will generate planned order for child items only, not of A. While issuing you will only issue the child items.<br />
2. Other view is make A kit item and maintain child items in kit component. Then you can find A in estimated line of production order. But planning engine will generate planned orders of child items, not A. A will not be a inventory item, while issuing system will consider child items for outbound.</div></div><hr />

I want to plan for item A so that I don't have to send multiple orders to the supplier. So based on A's order supplier would send me all it's component in a box so in that box I will receive B,C &amp; D; I could post the inventory to these children through post to component functionality while receiving the order for A but now the open question is How would I make the system not to consider A at all in the processing of the production order of ABCD even though it is in the estimated BOM. If I could make that happen then everything else would work the way I want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">8th July 2010, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having trouble understanding this.  If you want to receive all the parts for A from a supplier in a box, and sell A complete with other items as well (B,C,D) I cannot see why you need concern yourself with A's components at all.  Surely A (complete) is just a purchased item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">13th July 2010, 05:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi baan sanu.<br />
FG consist of A and E<br />
You will need to make A as a phantom item with BOM consist of B,C,D.<br />
Then the planning will consider B,C,D to be replenished.<br />
For this, i think you can do it in Baan V.<br />
<br />
But when you want to create a Purchase Order also for item A , then receive it as B &amp; C&amp; D, i think thats not possible.<br />
<br />
You can make a new List Item (make similar item code,such as A1),which has components B,C and D.<br />
And receipt PO for B,C and D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SSssSS</div><div class="date">2nd December 2011, 01:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I am just wondering if you guys can help me as well. I have a list item(A1) inclduing a kit of components(BCD). <br />
1- Can I have another list item(A2) including(BCDE) with different quantity of BCD?<br />
2- It is required for me to have A1 and A2 in ATP(Authority to Purchase) reports after running MRP instead of having BCDE in that report. How can I set up this?</div></div><hr />
