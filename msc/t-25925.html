<br />
we are getting duplicates in mrp010 tables occasionaly. We run Regen MRP every weekend and Net change MRP everynight. In the last 3 monhts, we have seen about 10 occurances. <br />
<br />
A couple of days back there were 2 records for the same MRP production order, item, transaction date, position#, Qty etc..in mrp010 table (only the sequence number was different). This is leading to lower confidence levels in our MRP output.<br />
<br />
has anybody encountered such an issue? Any clues on how to solve the problem?<br />
<br />
Also what is the use of sequence number field in table mrp010?</div></div><hr />

When you run MRP how do you answer the question on form 2 &quot;Maximum Number of MRP Orders per Day&quot;.  If you answer more that one you may get more orders.<br />
In the Item master what do you have for the Order Method?  If it is Fixed Order Quatity and your requirement is greater that the fixed order quantity for that item you may get nore ordres.<br />
In the item master what do you have for Maximum Order Quantity?  If the requirement is greater that the maximum order quantity you may get more orders.<br />
<br />
Check these things out.</div></div><hr />
