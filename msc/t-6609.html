Problem is as follow:<br />
We buy secondhand machine as a customized item and need to take it to pieces. How to make it in Baan? Estimated material is 1 part, result of &quot;productionÂ” is a list of parts.  We need to calculate labor put into disassembling too.  <br />
Any idea will be appreciated!<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

<br />
Insert a rework order for the customized item. <br />
1)Insert one or many operations in production planning, <br />
2) Put all items that is taken of the machine and that is going to be put in a warehouse as a negative issue in estimated material, 3) Issue the material, <br />
4) Normal hours accounting against the operation you inserted,<br />
5) Complete operations and order,<br />
6) Close the order<br />

<br />
I'm not familiar with rework orders, so I have additional questions. <br />
I understand minus estimated materials and reporting operations.<br />
But what will happen with customized item? Is it still on hand on PSC? Rework Order is described in help as &quot;.....show the finished product as a component....&quot; Do you know what it means?<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanana</div><div class="date">9th September 2002, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;.....show the finished product as a component....&quot;  means that the finished product itself (in your case - the customized item) is also in the material list of the production order.<br />
Issuing the manufactured item to &quot;itself&quot; is the essense of rewok.<br />
So practically what will happen in terms of material flow is as follows:<br />
Issue to the order:<br />
- The customized item. (due to the nature of rework)<br />
Receipts from the order:<br />
- The items with negative qty<br />
- The cusomized item which you are producing - since in your case it is disassembly, you need to somehow discard of that quantity.<br />
Some suggestions for that: <br />
   * Use a logical warehouse in the production order, one that is logistically not nettable and cab be disregarded financially (by neutralizing financial transactions to it). You need to decide how to &quot;empty&quot; that warehouse from time to time.<br />
    * Reject the finished quantity at the end of the disassembly process - but be careful, I'm not sure about all the implications (logistic and financial)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baanana has answered your question regarding the rework functionallity. <br />
To get a rework order, there is a field at the production order (form 2 or 3) that has to be set to yes.<br />

<br />
Thanks Sturla and Baanana.<br />
I Think this is good idea to make rework production order for 1 psc of customized item, but during completion make order completed wit delivered = 0.<br />
<br />
I'm also confusing with parts received from customized items during disassembling. Because of they value I have to store them on project as customized items.  There is a decision to use these items in production first (instead of standard new items). But I have no idea how to take into consideration SIC (tdinv3201 - Planned Inventory Orders). Is it possible to make SIC for customized items (they were on project on specified warehouse, item codes are equal to standard items codes)? <br />
Another idea is to found method to store all these items as standard in different warehouses with different cost prices. But I'm not sure is it possible.<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
Anna</div></div><hr />

If you want to make customized items out of the parts you receive from the disassembly, these parts are going to be stocked as project items. <br />
If you want to use these parts as standard parts or as customized parts in another project, it's possible to transfer the items by using a PCS Warehous order (use the functionallity project to warehouse or project to project).<br />
There is no functionallity in Baan IV that makes it possible to run a job (like PRP, INV, MRP) to look up project inventory without allocations and get advices to use them in other projects or as standard items (this is, as far as I know, possible if you use the &quot;big&quot; project module and A&amp;D extention).<br />
All transfer of customized  items have to be done manually.<br />
It's maybe better to transfer these items to a warehouse (nettable) as standard items, because it makes it easier to have control and reuse these items if there is a demand (MRP will see them).<br />

<br />
I try to find the best solution for these &quot;old&quot; items. <br />
One of the solution is to make them standard with standard item code + e.g. &quot;o&quot; (that means old), store them in a separate warehouse and enter as alternative items for the same &quot;new&quot; item. But this solution is not the best. &quot;Old&quot; items can not be sold to the customer.  How to separate that demand for production can order can respect alternative items, but demand for sales order can not?<br />
