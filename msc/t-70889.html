<br />
anybody has the script for tisfc0101m000?<br />
i just want to read it and check it.<br />
<br />
we're changing the delivery date (planning method is set to backward).<br />
<br />
my problem is it's doing weird things for quantities in maintain estimated materials (tisfc0110m000) and enter material issue for production order (ticst0101m000)<br />
<br />
if i can read the script, i could understand the issue.<br />

I would recommend contacting infor and asking them to look at or explain what is happening.  I could see it changing dates for the estimated material, but not the quantities.  I could imagine with an A&amp;D environment this getting real interesting with the pegged material.  I also have a feeling it would use DLL's to run around and update everything.  Sorry I am not any assistance but we do not own source for me to even look at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">8th March 2018, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be possible that it may be changing the BOM. Though once the order is created, system don't automatically change the Estimated material</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blanchap</div><div class="date">8th March 2018, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
the process start with the BOM.  it also clear the estimated materials and routing if the effective date is not set right.<br />
did contact Infor but the answer that i got was not helpfull.<br />

<br />
I have some questions in regard of the problems you are having. I would like to try and help you.<br />
<br />
Let's see if I understand it correctly:<br />
<br />
Since you started planning backwards, you are experiencing the problem that the quantity of the expected materials in the production order differs from the original BOM?<br />
<br />
Is it just concerning 1 item? Or are all materials changed?<br />
When all materials have been changed, can you tell if it has changed by the same percentage?<br />
<br />
As soon as the materials have been changed in the production order (tisfc0101), it will be changed in the material issue (ticst0101).<br />
<br />
I am using Infor ERP LN and I am planning backwards, but I can't see the planning method changing your material requirements.<br />
<br />
What I can think of is that you might have a percentage of waist setup in you BOM. You can check it in session tibom1110m000. There are three colums <br />
that might give you an explanation. <br />
Columns:<br />
<br />
tibom010.qana<br />
tibom010.scpf<br />
tibom010.scpq<br />
<br />
I don't know what the column names are in English, cause mine are in Dutch.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you somewhat.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
<br />
R. Marges</div></div><hr />
