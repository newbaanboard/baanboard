<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erplncons</div><div class="date">26th April 2016, 07:31</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a business functionality to take care of partial receipts from same production order or breaking many items to be produced under different production orders under one lot. If you think that the users are accidentally picking up the wrong lot numbers, then let the system generate the lot numbers and assign them automatically (to reduce the use intervention). You can built your own logic for generating the lot numbers.</div></div><hr />
