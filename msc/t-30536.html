<br />
I have a customer who wants to know how much excess would we have in terms of $ at the end of program (excess with no demand). Also for this report the situation is bit complex because the PCB board for which my customer wants to know the $ value of excess with no demand has about 50% of parts that are of type (use up and go to future primary). My BOM is calling out for Future primary p/n but I have inventory sitting under &quot;use up and go to&quot; type of p/n. How do I get excess at the end of time in this scenario??? <br />
<br />
Does any one know how do I get this report in BaaN. <br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
