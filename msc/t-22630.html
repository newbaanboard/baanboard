<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sensoft99</div><div class="date">16th December 2004, 07:47</div></div><div class="posttext">When EP (Simulate Orders) generates Planned Orders for a Purchased Item, it looks for the scattered demand and generates many orders taking into consideration the Min Ord Qty (MOQ) and the Order increment. This often leads to over-exposure leading to excess inventory and subsequent cash-flow problems. MOQ and Increment are vendor defined and cant be changed. Order Interval is something we cant be very specific and hence cant play with it. All safety/lead times has been set. If we look at the last few periods of a scenario, the excess purchase advise, if transferred, would result in excess material which may become not usable owing to different reasons - FG becoming obsolete, no more demand for FG etc.<br />
<br />
So, requirement is, if Baan produces multiple planned orders for the same item, it should not look at MOQ after the first planned order for that item and should rather look at Increment quantity so exposure is limited. Can this be achieved by any means? Am doubtful. I would like to hear any inputs or solution, if it exisits.<br />
<br />
I guess the issue is genuine. If EP is only capable of what I am seeing now, please let me know.</div></div><hr />

You will get a signal though, warning for the excess stock.<br />
<br />
If you're worried about the excess stock, you'll have to adjust the MOQ....or set  the orderinterval to an appropriate value.<br />
<br />
Did you try to setup any Demand consumption ?</div></div><hr />
