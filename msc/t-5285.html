<br />
We have manufacturing, and when we go to Report Production Order Completed session, and deliver quantity, a message pops up and says Reported completed quantity cannot be greater than 0. This happens for a particular item only. Wherever we use this item, same problem comes while we deliver the quantity in Report Production order Completed session. <br />
<br />
Can Any body pls explain the reason for this.<br />

Could be a conversion factor problem. Normally happens when you report operations complete and you try and report more complete than a completed operation or you can not update preceding operations. Maybe look at the routing of this item and look for count points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kelyus</div><div class="date">23rd May 2002, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">You should check your rounding factor. You can see &quot;0&quot;  on form but it can be &quot;0.0001&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vavs123</div><div class="date">23rd May 2002, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you reporting operations complete?  Sometimes people report the operation complete with a quantity of 0 and effectively close out the order at that point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I do Reports Operation Complete, the goods are stored in a receipt Location. Afterwards, I have to go and do the inbound to confirm that I have received the goods. Is it possible to setup BaaN in BaaN IV so that when I report Operation complete, the goods are transferred to their directly default locations according to the setup in Maintain Locations by Items.  <br />
<br />
How different is the Reports Operation Complete done in BaaN V?</div></div><hr />

Even though you have ILC switched on you don't have to run inbound advice if you create a warehouse that does not have locations. If you have locations in a warehouse you will have to generate inbound advice.<br />
<br />
BaanV<br />
If you do not specify generate inbound advice, put away as steps in the warehouse order linked to production order receipt the system will automatically execute the steps. This means it will store it in the location with the highest priority. Could be a fixed location etc. You allso have an option when you report production orders complete to direct process inbound data. This means that even if the steps are specified they will be executed by the system but you have the oprtion to manually run the steps.</div></div><hr />

Then you'll need to report operations complete (a quantity) up until that operation before you can 'report production orders complete'.<br />
