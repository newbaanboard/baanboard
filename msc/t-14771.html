Situation... I realized that SIC items are on table timrp010 after MRP runs but are not shown to the user throught the session timrp1510m000, which is ok. <br />
When I transfer the MRP order to SFC that has those SIC items as requirements; all other MRP requirements for that MRP order are updated with the new SFC Order number in timrp010, but the SIC Items. SIC Items are inserted on tdinv150 as requirement for the new SFC Order(wichi is fine),but these SIC items remain on timrp010 table with the old MRP order number (orphans because the MRP Order has been removed by the transfer). <br />
<br />
Queistion... Will these SIC Items be removed when MRP runs again?<br />
<br />
Any other comments are welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
NO, the SIC items won't be removed unless you run a regenerative MRP.<br />
<br />
The SIC items should NOT appear in timrp010! That is a bug!</div></div><hr />

I guess someone changed the order policy from MRP to SIC. If there are MRP-orders present at this time, they might not be deleted during the next MRP run (because they are no longer an MRP-items!).<br />
<br />
When we change MRP-items to SIC, we ensure that existing MRP orders are deleted manually.<br />
<br />
I agree with just_fro that a regenerative run should solve the problem, but sometimes the Baan logic is too perfect ;) <br />

I did enter demand for an assably that has an SIC item in the BOM as component at level 1 then I ran MRP for that Item. It does generates requirements for  those SIC items in MRP010 still.<br />
<br />
What I am doing for validation for a particular customization checking for future demand. If the SIC item in mrp010 still having an MRP Order on MRP020 or MRP021 this demand still planned else (it is an orphan item) I look for planned inventory transactions for that item in tdinv150.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if it is the best way to check this, but is the only way I can see the future demand for SIC items.<br />

Any comments are welcome.<br />

I just looking at this problem again and maybe it has a bit of misunderstanding on the previous posts.<br />
<br />
The SIC Item it has no MRP order itself; the assembly is the one with the MRP Order, which is fine. The SIC has only the order number that is related to.<br />
<br />
So, I transferred the MRP order to SFC order for the assembly and re-run MRP for the assembly in regen mode, I was expecting the SIC demand in timrp010 will be gone after MRP but still there.<br />
<br />
I'll appreciate any comments on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
