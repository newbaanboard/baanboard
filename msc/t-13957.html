<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vwallace</div><div class="date">15th December 2003, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">We're using Baan IVc.    Process Module Routings allow operations to be run in parallel.  Our problem is the following scenario.  We have set up routings that have 9 operations.  Operations 10, 20, 30, 40,and 50 happen sequentially. No problem there.  The remainder of the operations are set to happen in parallel with no overlaps.  Using the functionality of sequencing, we have set the remaining operations to occur in the following order. 80, 60, 70, all flowing to operation 90.<br />
<br />
The problem is that when production batches are created, Baan will sometimes schedule the operations properly, and sometimes not.  Strange things happen (e.g. scheduling Op 80 to start  before the start date of the  batch).  When testing the routings, out of 20 batches created 5 of them may be correct.  No consistency.<br />
<br />
Anyone out there have this problem?  The company has been a little negligent in installing Service Packs.  I believe that we have only installed up to Service Pack 4.  Someone out there please tell me that a subequent Service Pack fixed this.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

(somewhere in 2002 I guess, so when you're at SP4, you're a bit 'behind')<br />
Not sure which one, but give it a try in the knowledgebase....<br />
<br />
Succes!</div></div><hr />
