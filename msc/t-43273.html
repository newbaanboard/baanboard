<br />
I just want to ask about Phantom and/or Work-In-Process Items, How are they treated in the system during Cycle Counting? How are they accounted for?<br />
Thanks.<br />

By definition, you're not completing a work order to this level, so it can't be counted. Same for WIP. Work orders have to be completed to some assembly level for them to be seen as the assembly. Depending on how you have things set up that could be a minor sub-assembly or a completed product, but until a work order's been completed, it's all just individual parts. It makes sense to have enough work order points to give you some relief on this. Cycle counting parts that are in partially completed assemblies is difficult and leads to inaccuracies.</div></div><hr />
