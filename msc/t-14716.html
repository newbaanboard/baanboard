<br />
have you come accross this need.<br />
<br />
We have retail / seasonal business where in items are short lived.<br />
<br />
We have many items, that are not operational but may be useful for statistics. Since we are using B.I the data has been put on to the Datawarehouse already.<br />
<br />
Instead of deleting such items, we want to archive these items into the history company so that it is available for reference purpose.<br />
<br />
Since items leave trace on many tables and with referential integrity on -&gt; would this be possible,  <br />
<br />
any inputs will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
best regards<br />
<br />

<br />
the problem is that we have 30 to 40 thousand items which are non-moving for 4 years.  this we want to get rid of,   starting from its childmost to root the item itself.<br />
<br />
but doing so, using baan front end selects and deletes takes more than 2 Hrs per item.<br />
<br />
any suggestion on using some low level delete commands instead of using the the SELECT FOR UPDATE...<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">7th March 2004, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">if speed is the issue one idea is to dump all the tables that have a reference to the items table. once you have a seq dumps of all these tables use sed,awk to go through the list of items you want to delete and check if they exist in the dump files if they dont delete them from the items table dump.  then restore the items table, as you are working on text files the process should be very quick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we want to have a kind of maintenance sessions / archiving procedure for items. <br />
<br />
But definitely not to handle on the flat dump file; so many tables and so many items involved; speed and  the accracy of removing the individual item trace on the file; live system; database size huge... reorganise not very practical; and everytime to takeout dump,  remove items trace and put the dump back.<br />
<br />
anything you worked on db.eq, db.delete without using the embedded SQL select and FOR UPDATE clauses. I have seen in one of the baan conversion session (tdilc0232m000: Item O/B Priority conversion session from FIFO to By Location). But not quite sure how to put it together for this purpose and also if it will be really fast).  Or like the company correction programs or PUR/SLS archiving we want to have for Items Archiving too.<br />
<br />
thanks and look forward to any other possibilities<br />
