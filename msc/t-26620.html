<br />
I need more information about how to build an integration from a PDM system to Baan IV and ERP LN.<br />
<br />
I know about SSA PLM or PDM and the Java Gateway that handles a fine integration into ERP.<br />
<br />
This integration transfers data based on XML files to Baan's EDM module. Then it runs the some functions in Baan IV EDM. Maybe also some other functions.<br />
<br />
It's maybe &quot;a walk in the park&quot; to transfer the data directly into the EDM tables and also to tiitm001 and tibom010 table as well. But I'm not sure how it affects the already started MRP/PRP planning on the items or the estimated materials. I will guess that it is fine as long as it is transferred as a new version/revision. <br />
<br />
And what about transferring the items to projects, then we are talking about tipcs tables also. Do I then need to transfer first to the edm tables?<br />
<br />
Which sessions in EDM needs to be executed if the E-Items and EBOMs shall be transferred to Projects, and which if the transfer goes to standard Items and BOMs?<br />
<br />
Any information related to this topic is appreciated.</div></div><hr />
