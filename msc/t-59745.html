<br />
i was wondering whether this was a serious request at first. The PBOM is the basis for manufacturing. The EBOM can be input to the PBOM if first an engineering department will overlook things. A Generic BOM is linked to a generic or configurable item. As such you cannot manufacture it: it has all the possible items and options. Based on choices relevant items and options will be selected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
E-BOM :- engineering boms are used to create bom for a new item &amp; this is under controlled revision released (under development) or an existing item having any engineering change.<br />
<br />
<br />
P-BOM :- whereas production boms are used for existing items and those bom are approved by Engineering &amp; Production Dept.<br />
<br />
<br />
Genric BOM :- Generic or general Bill of Materials (BOM) structures make˝ it possible to handle product variants in a convenient way. <br />
User specifications are given dynamically, as the generic BOM is˝ exploded. The system will then generate a conventional BOM for this product variant.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help u !!!</div></div><hr />
