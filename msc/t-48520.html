<br />
When we try to close a PCS project we get error - &quot;Some Inventory variances have not been processed yet&quot;. The project contains standard as well as customised items, we have already closed all the sales ,purchase and production orders and transferred inventory out of the project, but still we get the error (the project is now in finished status). <br />
<br />
Any Ideas what is still pending. Also we have session - process inventory variances , but not sure what its financial implications would be. I checked several related posts but could not get a reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance.<br />

In contrary to Baan IV, LN doesn't create integration postings for e.g. purchase price variances directly. Instead, so called &quot;inventory variances&quot; are created, which you can use to indicate if such a difference is something that should be reflected in the MAUC or not. Those variances have to be processed, otherwise some interim accounts won't be balanced (if you set up the logistics-finance integration the way it's recommended). <br />
