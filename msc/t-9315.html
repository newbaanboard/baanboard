<br />
As we use LOT control and Location control we run into problems with negative BOM items.<br />
<br />
We do not want to use two production orders ( one per item ).<br />
<br />
Is there any other way we can solve this problem ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vavs123</div><div class="date">20th March 2003, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I am confused.  Are you trying to produce 2 components with a single production order or are you trying to return an item to inventory when you report a production completion?<br />
<br />
I had a similar problem in a casting company.  We needed to return the forms around the casting when we moved it to a particular operation.  This would make them available for the next casting.  The concept is similar to how people handle tool constraints in finite planning.  <br />
In our case, we listed the form on the bill of material as a positive number at operation 10 and a negative number at operation 100.  This kept our costing even.  When we reported operation 100 complete all parts were consumed except for the form.  We manually entered a negative outbound and processed.  It was clunky but operational.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Baan</div><div class="date">21st March 2003, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We are a injection moulding company and we have mould with a multiple cavity, this means that we produce two different items in one operation.<br />
<br />
So I have added these items as purchased items with a negative quantity in the Bom for this operation.<br />
So when we report this operation we would like to have these items added in our warehouse.<br />
<br />
I have tried to use the manual routine as discribed in the thread, by filling the negative quantity in the issue field in ticst0101m000 followed by maintaining outbound data tdilc4101m000. This seems to work as discribed. But when I try to release outbound data (tdilc4202m000) I get the message &quot; No data found for report , no report is printed&quot;<br />
 If I check items per warehouse I have negative Allocated stock.<br />
<br />
So I have outbound data but it seems that BaaN doeas not process it.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea what the reason could be ??<br />
