<br />
My client needs to work with average cost price, there is not problem on purchased item, but there is on manufactured items, cause they are valuated at standard (components + hours).<br />
<br />
Another thing is that they country law does not accept this..<br />
<br />
1.- Different cost calculation <br />
purchased - average<br />
manufactured - std cost<br />
<br />
2.-If you buy a purchased item your standard cost price change, obviously after make all the steps involved. <br />
When you revaluate the std cost price, Baan revaluate the item, and all the items where it is part of the Bill of material.<br />
<br />
My client is in Colombia, I don't know if somebody has faced things like this and how could be the best way to solve it.<br />

We ran into the same problem too. To approximate MAUC price on manufactured items, we ask the clients to calculate cost and valuation prices everyday for the manufactured items<br />

<br />
The problem is that I'm using Baan IVc2,  I think MAUC is available on Baan 5.<br />
<br />
Does Baan 5, solve this problem using MAUC?? Because this is one of the options we have... upgrade to Baan 5.<br />

<br />
BaanERP MAUC still does the same thing. It will correctly calculate moving average price for purchased items, but will still use FTP on manufactured items. Upgrading to BaanERP won't solve it. One slightly acceptable solution would be to approximate the average price on manufactured items by updating their std cost everyday, as I said before.<br />
