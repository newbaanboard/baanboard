I'd like to know the reason of this kind of situation.<br />
I have a production order with 3 phases; the first and the second are backflushed while the last phase is not. I' like to use tihra1101m000 to insert hours for the last phase and to complete the order. When I try to process the hours (I've indicate that the last phase is completed) the system gives me the message that previous operation (the second) is not yet completed and so it doen't go on. What I'm wondering is that why if I to something like that from the tisfc0102m000 or tisfc0202m000 it doesn't gives problems (and the system works as I espected) while in the case I've shown it seems to be not correct.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donnie</div><div class="date">26th March 2004, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I've set it to automatic but nothing has changed. The parameter works only with session tisfc0102m000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">26th March 2004, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I have run into this before, and as far as I know this is a standard problem.   I feel it's a bug, because it allows you to enter into hours accounting, but generates an error on processing.  Not good.  <br />
<br />
In Baan V they just remove the functionality of reporting to operations via hours accounting.<br />
<br />
Since I have written several HRA automated processes, what I have done in the past is delink the processes.  During automated processing, I can send the hours to hours accounting and the quantities to sfc, separate transactions.  Probably not much help for someone directly using the Hours Accounting entry system, sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are on Baan IV C4 and we have never encountered such a problem. One thing which I am sure you must have already checked is that qty being reported completed at the third phase (through hours accounting) should be less than or equal to the qty reported completed at the second phase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th March 2004, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, there is no problem if you are reporting less than or equal to the previous operation.  The problem I'm referring to anyway comes up when you are reporting more, or reporting complete on a later operation when a previous is not complete, and wanting the automatic reporting of previous operations parameters in sfc to take place.  Instead you get an error during Process HRA.</div></div><hr />
