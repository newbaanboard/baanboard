<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lotius81</div><div class="date">1st March 2017, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the big problems we run into is properly scheduling orders. In one particular area all of the routing runs through a generic test stand machine set up in the system. There are currently a couple hundred orders scheduled to run that use this generic machine routing. In other areas we have separate machines (blow molding machines) that we sometimes need to reschedule as well. Let's say if someone calls in and I need to shut down a machine for 8 hours. But I also need to shift all of the orders that were scheduled to run against these machines forward 8 hours.<br />
<br />
My question is is there a quick and easy way to reschedule production orders by machine and move them all forward or backward a specific number of hours? Or do orders have to be rescheduled individually, which for us is horribly inefficient.<br />
