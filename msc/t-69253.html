<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LNester</div><div class="date">12th September 2016, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to find an efficient way to charge the actual materials used (scrap components) and add to the estimated materials (so it is part of my future standard).<br />
So my process is too long, I was wondering if anybody knows of a better way:<br />
1) Add the line for the item that was scrapped w special step numbering to identify as scrap.<br />
2) Initiate the inventory <br />
3) Generate and release outbound against the scrap line.<br />
<br />
If anybody has any other process for scrap I would like to know your process please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erplncons</div><div class="date">14th September 2016, 07:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Is your scrap always consistent (% rejects or no of items rejected) or is it variable. If it is variable, do you have some fixed minimal scrap generated percentage, etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LNester</div><div class="date">14th September 2016, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">@erplncons The scrap is 100% variable, Basically we build an item that can be repaired, so the scrap will be whatever you use to repair the unit. Very rarely we will scrap the whole unit without salvaging most components. There is not a lot of pattern on what is scrapped (since the reason why the unit fail is very variable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erplncons</div><div class="date">15th September 2016, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">In this scenario, the best option is to identify the items based on the rejects and copy the rework production order from earlier similar item. This would reduce your efforts in maintaining the customized estimated material for that production order (as this kind of item is already having a completed production order having valid estimated material).<br />
You may make a list of such items and their corresponding production orders in MS Excel / similar software for easy copying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LNester</div><div class="date">19th September 2016, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, for your great suggestion!</div></div><hr />
