<br />
We are looking for a time &amp; attendance/ labor tracking system with a Baan interface for both Baan IVc and V. It should be supported by NT/ MSSQL 7 or 2000.<br />
<br />
The system should support all 4 labor types that exist in the hours accounting table tihra100. i.e. Projects, Production Orders, Service Orders, and Unassigned labor (type 4). The product order collection should allow an employee to work on multiple production orders simultaneously and have an algorithm which allocates the time between orders prior to being imported to Baan.<br />
<br />
The Time &amp; Attendance program should be configurable and support interfaces to major US payroll packages.<br />
<br />
If you use such a system, or can recommend one, we'd like to hear from you.<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />
RB</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">26th September 2002, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a fully integrated package that does what you are looking for:<br />
<br />
1.  Interface to Baan Hours Accounting through separate Time and Attendance sessions.<br />
2.  Entry through DDC (Wanding terminals on shop floor, etc) or through standard Baan Session.  Shop floor entries are wanded as work occurs.<br />
3.  Supports Multi tasking with Hours Splits written properly to Hours Accounting.   Integrated with the Man Ratio as needed.  Configurable so that hours can be split evenly, or follow a heirarchy to have specific tasks earn full credit for hours when splitting with other tasks.<br />
4.  Supports Time and Attendance such as Vacation and Personal Time accruals.  Tracked by Employee, including year to date and previous year balances.<br />
5.  Optionally:  Process Hours Accounting, Report Production Orders Complete<br />
6.  Export to Payroll Interfaces:  Currently Lawson and ADP.  The format has been so far customer specific, even to the same payroll system, as Customers have this set up different.<br />
7.  Supports Project, Production Order, PO Batch and Indirect hours.   Service would be easy to add, but we have not yet had a requirement.<br />
8.  Supports time rounding to shift times with tolerances, incremental rounding of hours also configurable.<br />
9.  Time and Attendance reports, including Daily Time Report, Exceptions Report, Vacation Report, Overtime Report.<br />
10.  Supports approval requirements for overtime or configured by Task.<br />
11.  Uses BOI (AFS) functions to call Baan Hours Accounting - does not use standard source or require updates for Hours Accounting / standard Baan patches.<br />
12.  Calculates Overtime by Day, Week or according to Working Time Table.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this sounds like it may fit for you.<br />

The ones mentioned here work fine (I've installed RMCis in the past).  So will some of the others.  Check out there under &quot;data collection&quot; and you will see some more of the players.</div></div><hr />
