<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">1st July 2004, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Session tisfc1202m000 in Baan V.<br />
Use this session to delay operations that you have planned, to cope with a backlog in production.<br />
<br />
You can use this session for production orders whose status is:<br />
<br />
	Planned<br />
	Documents Printed<br />
	Released<br />
<br />
You cannot use this session for operations reported Completed, or for operations which have had hours posted (that is, Active status). The shift planning to date must be after the previous start date remainder.<br />
<br />
For each order you select, BaanERP changes the start date remainder for the earliest operation which is not Completed to the date you enter in the shift planning to date field.<br />
<br />
The moving methods for the operations in the Production Orders (tisfc0101s000) session are not taken into consideration for shifting on the production order level.  They are only used when shifting single operations. <br />
<br />
<br />
Note  <br />
If the BaanSCS Scheduler is installed, this session is disabled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you mean: finite scheduling.<br />
In B50c there is an integration with SCS Scheduler, which can handle that.<br />

<br />
Finite planning can be done in Baan V via the work load control option. This can be done using the Master Plan but only in the Master Based planning area (See order horizon and Planning horizon). Link items to a master plan unit. Indicate on the resource that it is a constraint and I think it should be critical as well. Set work load control parameters against the plan unit. <br />
That should do it.<br />
