 This is regarding finding a Record , say a receipt No , in the session &quot;Display Receipts &quot; ( Session No : tdpur4531m000 ) , using the &quot;FIND&quot; ( Telescope ) option . <br />
One is taken to the next receipt No , in stead , in BaaN . One has to punch , the previous Receipt No , in order to counter this problem . Also , it takes a few minutes , if u r scrolling upwards , in this session , where as , scrolling downwards , does not take any time lag .<br />
Do any other users of BaaN-IV , C-4 , face similar kind of problems ? Kindly, throw some light on this . This problem does not manifest always. <br />
This case was already logged by us to SSA Global , long time back , but so far , they could not provide us with any solution .<br />
I'm re-opening this case once again , with SSA Global .<br />

<br />
In your example, session tdpur4531m000 (receipts), the index contains 3 fields, i.e. when hitting the 'find' button, there are three fields on the screen. When you fill only the first field with the relevant order number, and leave the second and/or third field with a high value, higher than the one corresponding to your order, the session will jump to the next record. Hope you understand this. Is this your case? When you enter the order number in first field and blanc out the rest of the fields, does this also happen? There is btw a way to avoid this by using Baan's oredefined variable, but this is not relevant for this case...<br />
<br />
Also , it takes a few minutes , if u r scrolling upwards , in this session , where as , scrolling downwards , does not take any time lag <br />
When did you last do an analyze/compute to this table? Did you try reorganizing the table?</div></div><hr />

Dear Sir ,<br />
            U r right . When we make the other two fields blank , the problem does not occur.<br />
           I've noticed similar phenomena , with other Session ( No : tfacp1131s000 ) .<br />
           But ,regarding ur suggestion of re-organising the tables , for countering the slow scrolling problem , I'm help-less.<br />
           U see , I'm an out-right Front-End guy , in BaaN &amp; not a Tools guy.<br />
Our Tools Guy ( Our IT Manager ) has recently left our company . We r at present , having only two raw hands , in that Deptt &amp; I don't think they can manage this job .<br />
           Anyway , I've put up this problem to our Management, we'll soon do something about it.<br />
           Than X , anyway , for the help .<br />
<br />

<br />
Although the reorganizing of the table is not a difficult job, and I could easily guide you step by step which sessions to run and exactly with which parameters, but I wouldn't recommend to touch a system if you don't know what you're doing. Do you have a support contract with SSA? If yes no problem, One Point Support of SSA Global will help you with this. If not, I would then rather pay expensive consultancy rates, if necessary... <br />
<br />
Of course, if you have any further questions/problems, you can always ask us here, and we will always try to help..<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />
