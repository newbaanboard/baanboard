<br />
Actually, I want to generate Planned orders in this way. It is for a Mfg Item. For now, I have no lead times anywhere and Order Interval = 0 in Item Ordering Data. <br />
<br />
Say demand forecast entered is 1001. And <br />
Minimum Order Quantity = Order quantity Increment = 1<br />
Max Order Quantity = 1000<br />
Ordering Method is Lot by Lot and Order policy Anonymous. It is standard item.<br />
<br />
When I run planning, I expect to get 2 planned orders - one for 1000 and another for 1. But I get 2 planned orders - one for 500 and another for 501.<br />
<br />
Can someone advise/help? Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hope someone can help me and confirm if this is standard functionality. For me, what Baan is doing sound wierd.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help</div></div><hr />

Demand forecast is used for MPS part of Enterprise Planning (EP). You might be using MPS with constraint planning turned on, and not MRP. Hence, BaanERP factors in your finite production capacity in each period and split the production plan (not planned production orders) into 2<br />
<br />
PS: I'm assuming that what you got is 2 production plans and not 2 planned production orders as you said<br />

I get Planned Production Orders. I run Simulate Orders to get these. The demand is based on Sales Order. There is no finite capacity planning implemented. <br />

Now, Hope I am clearer</div></div><hr />
