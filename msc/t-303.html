<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sturla</div><div class="date">20th October 2001, 12:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I work for a client that use one itemgroup for all their manufactured items. That makes a lot of things complicated in Baan IVc4, like selecting in reports, global update of sales prices and also a lot of other things. <br />
I have made a logical system system to split up the item group they have in several other item groups for manufactured items (from 1 to about 50 groups), and the change can be done in one or two hours. <br />
The client don't use Baan Finance!<br />
<br />
Does anyone of you see any negative consequenses in changing from one group to many? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

We added several more groups, and changed the item groups on the item master.  We run baan finance, so we had to make sure the integration mapping were OK.  Of course, item default data will have to be revised.  Other than that, we didn't run into any issues.</div></div><hr />

It allows Multi-Level Bracket pricing which we developed specifically for the multi-site client, and also does not invovle changing the Item Master, which could effect the History Files used for other modules.  If you would like more details please email me at tfleming@novasoftinfo.com.  Good Luck.<br />
