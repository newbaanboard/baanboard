Occassionally rejects are made that can be reprocess into 1st Quality.  Am wondering if a co-product or by-product could be used without having a consistant quantity produced each time.  The amount of co-product will vary from 0 - the batch size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ahulikavi</div><div class="date">9th March 2005, 06:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Two ways in which you can handle this.<br />
1. If you are using lot control, you could also use Assay or Potency for each lot produced to denote varying purity.<br />
<br />
2. Use Co-product, only limitation is Co-product cannot be same as main Product. We use this method as follows:<br />
Product A Formula for 100 units contains Co-product B(A of inferior Quality)<br />
When A is Ok Batch completed as A = 100,  B =0<br />
When A is Not Ok Batch completed as A = 0,  B =100<br />
Subsequently use B in manufacturing of A instead of regular Materials (Purification).</div></div><hr />
