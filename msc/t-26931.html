<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">22nd April 2006, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys,<br />
    We are a metal based furniture co. and we use Customized Items a lot in our manufacturing process. Recently though, after we started off with MRP, we ran into problems when generating Planned PRP Orders. As you all are aware that MRP requires Nettable warehouses, therefore we had to convert certain warehouses to nettable by setting the nettable option to Yes in the warehouse table. Listed below is the series of events that led to the problem..<br />
<br />
Item A(Order Policy: To Order) had stock in Warehouse A (Nettable) but its default Warehouse B was nonettable and had no stock.<br />
This item A was used in Sales Order 1 with Warehouse B.<br />
When Generate Planned PRP Orders was run after Generate Project Structure for Sales Order, we found out to our surprise that Baan had created a Planned PRP Warehouse Order (Warehouse to Project: Warehouse A to Warehouse B) and a Planned PRP Production Order for the remainder of the required quantity that wasnt satisfied by the Warehouse to Project Transfer. <br />
<br />
Tests done later concluded that if the required quantity was present in Warehouse A then the Planned PRP Production Order would not have been created at all.<br />
<br />
1) Why would Baan do this? <br />
2) Item A was customized and therefore shouldnt have anything to do with the stock of Standard Item it was customized from. So how can this warehouse transfer be justifiable? <br />
3) Are we missing any parameter setting somewhere? <br />
4) Is it anything to do with Nettable warehouses? If so does it mean that we cant have stock in a nettable warehouse for any &quot;To Order&quot; Item?  <br />
<br />
I would appreciate it very much if anyone can throw some light onto this.<br />
We use Baan4c4 with SP 17 on Sql 7 <br />

P.S: If this sort of issue was mentioned earlier in any thread, kindly point me to it..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">25th April 2006, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Flip. Always great to see a reply..<br />
<br />
Thought of doing that but then its tedious job  to go into lets say 20-30 customized items per order and taking of the Standard Item link. Not only that, this would be a practice the user would have to keep doing and not a one time solution.<br />
<br />
Since time was not something at my disposal i went ahead by creating non nettable warehouses and transferring stock into it from the nettable warehouses. This is a one time solution.<br />
<br />
But what i would like to know is why does Baan behave in this fashion. I agree the customize items get derived from a standard item but these two are quite different and so what good can a transfer of the standard item be...<br />
Just want to understand the logic if there is any and if its all got to do with some parameter settings..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">28th April 2006, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan does not see the items as different. The PCS module is the make to order solution. By deriving from the item you specify that you are now manufacturing this std. item based on an order received. You do not keep stock as this is Make to Order. If you have stock of the std item the system will allocate it.<br />
<br />
If you do not want to use the std item stock:<br />
- Remove derived from info<br />
- Do not keep stock of the std item<br />
- Create another template and derive from that, and do not keep stock of this template.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first sentence of your reply &quot;Baan does not see the items as different.&quot; answers it all and if it holds true there is no point in digging for more answers..<br />
