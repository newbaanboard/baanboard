Could you tell me please how to define BOM to get fixed negative scrap quantity independent of ordered quantity in production order. I could not find way to do that but it should be possible in standard. <br />
Example:<br />
I have production line where during start of this line we gain fixed quantity of recovery scrap independent of ordered quantity in production order (received material from this production line for example copper – it is received in warehouse and sold).<br />
How to define this fixed negative scrap (separate BOM line) in BOM – you must remember that is a material which is receive from manufacturing so defined scrap for this item should be as negative quantity. But there is impossible to enter negative quantity in scrap field in BOM line.<br />
Thank you<br />

<br />
1stly maintain a item code for scrap item. at the time of BOM maintain in the Main item,  just insert a 2nd line for Scrap item code with -ve qty.<br />
<br />
at the time of Production order -ve qty line will be automatically generated in Estimated lines, at the time of Production Order Releasing System automatically generated a extra Warehouse receipt Order. After ROC the Production order just Process the 2nd Warehouse receipt Order.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think your issue is resolved.................................</div></div><hr />

<br />
In BOM we gv per unit qty but in production order it will come accdingly to th finished qty.whetrvr u r gvng for scrap qty or input matrl.<br />
So its better to define the scrap item in  BOm  line with negative qqty,but while releasng th productn order u can fix th negative qty as per your requirement.<br />
