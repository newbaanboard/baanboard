<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">4th August 2009, 09:17</div></div><div class="posttext">We are a manufacturer using SFC module for the production activities.<br />
<br />
Recently, there is a requirement to implement sub-contracting to sub-contract out one of the in-house operation. <br />
<br />
We are able to create the sub-contract operation and successfully generate the sub-contract PO for the vendor.<br />
<br />
However, we are not clear how to handle reject when the vendor works does not pass our QC check. We want the vendor to rework on those part.<br />
<br />
Here are the questions:<br />
1.As we want the vendor to do rework (free of charge), we canâ€™t enter the reject quantity in Baan. So, we do not know how do proceed.<br />
2. How to stop finance from matching the receipt and preventing from paying the vendor whenever there is a reject.<br />
<br />
Mant thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

eg: you have create a subcontracting purch ord with qty 100 pcs for item (X1). then found the reject is 15. <br />
you still need to receive the purch ord first .without complete the related prod ord.<br />
<br />
then you create a new purch ord using cost item which is represent the mfg item (you can use &quot;X1.&quot; ) :<br />
line 1 = with qty &quot;-15&quot; then you can process the shipment like usual.(when you return it to the supplier)<br />
line 2 = with qty &quot;15&quot; then you can receive it. (after you receive it again form the supplier).<br />
<br />
after that then you can proceed to report order complete the related prod ord.</div></div><hr />

Dear Arvind,<br />
<br />
Is there any option in LN FP2 to reject the incoming inventory a Subcontracting Purchase Order???:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">18th August 2009, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan IV the subcontract PO is not for material but only for services. I haen;t tested it but if one can &quot;Maintain Approvals&quot; it can cause rejection. The same can be then updated in production order also. In Baan IV the PO receipt process and productuion operation process doesn't get updated automatically means- the qty completed and rejected. We did some customization to update them.<br />
