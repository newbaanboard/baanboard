<br />
For issue goods - <br />
<br />
Warehouse activities should not be automatic. During running the session 'whinh4525m100 (Picking List)' select your preferred location from 'From Location' field.<br />
<br />
<br />
For storing goods after production -<br />
<br />
Warehouse Activities should not be automatic as we need to choose specific location for storing good.<br />
During performing Report operation complete, once the operation is completed, during saving the same one pop-up window appears as 'Automatically confirm receipt when activating warehouse order inbound line?' --&gt; select 'No'.<br />
<br />
Go to warehousing order--&gt; warehouse receipts --&gt; Receipt Lines --&gt; go to 'Item,Location' tab --&gt; there you can find a field mentioned 'To Location' available --&gt; select your location and save it --&gt; confirm the warehouse receipt --&gt; process rest of the warehousing activities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

In LN<br />
You can use fixed locations for setting specific locations.<br />
In Warehouse - Item details too you can specify the locations.</div></div><hr />
