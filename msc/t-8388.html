<br />
I am a starter for BAAN IV planning and co-operarion modules. si it might be a simple question and hope there's some one can help me:<br />
How to get ATP in BAAN IV? for instance, when sales get a order, how can a company get the promised delivery date for the order?  i think CRP + MRP should be the answer, but would you please provide the detailed process?<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Suppose if you have a forecast of 1000 nos for an item this month and already some customer has placed an order for 600. Now if a new customer demands 700 for the same item, your ATP would be 400 only(1000-600) because you have anticipiated only a demand a 1000 and it is likely that you are not going to delivery the remaining.<br />
<br />
With this as background, please refer the Baan help for further understanding</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply! But it's not exactly what i wanted...<br />
my request is the delivery date avaibalbe to promise according to customer order.<br />
for instance:<br />
a customer placed a order of 1000pcs item A, and hope we advice the promised delivery date.<br />
our production capiblity is 2000pcs/month, and there are 1000 pcs on planning, so the earliest delivery date is 1 month later.<br />
is it possible to get it from BAAN IV?<br />
and how about BAAN V?<br />
<br />
Thanks&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you asking for is not addressed by ATP since it gives a projection of your inventory against the orders.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can define bill of critical materials and simulate MPS and compare the actual capacity requirement against the base line capacity. Graph and chart of rough capacity utilisation can be used. I am explaining this with reference to Baan 4.<br />
<br />

Baan V has this capability.  First, it is important to understand the difference between ATP and CTP.  ATP answers the question:  do I have Economic Stock (Baan terminology) to satisfy the Order Line?  CTP answers the question:  do I have the capability to satisfy the Order Line (or simulated inquiry) based upon my capacity and/or component Economis Stock.  CTP will also analysis component capacity requirements if Economic Stock is not available.<br />
<br />
Baan V can be set-up so that when the CSR keys in the Order Line quantity, the system forces the CTP check.  The CTP check, either capacity CTP, material CTP or both, recommends an Order Line date.  This recommended date populates the date on the Order Line in the Sales Order.   Alternatively, an user can use a simple session to run a CTP simulations without entering a Sales Order Line quantity.<br />
<br />
This can be complicated to set-up but it does work.  Additionally, from a functional perspective, the CSR must be trained to understand what they are looking at and understand planning logic in general.  <br />
<br />
This also requires a high level of Enterprise Planning knowledge to set-up correctly.  The use of Order Based/Master Based planning techniques as well as Critical Capacities and Critical Materials is necessary.<br />
<br />
I have tested this thouroughly, and although I believe very few use this functionality, it can and does work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pamillet</div><div class="date">16th March 2004, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, BaanV has a more complete answer including CTP on component, capacity, family, cycles...<br />
<br />
But you have already an answer in BAANIV !<br />
<br />
A customer order of 1000 and a monthly capacity of 2000...<br />
<br />
Your production plan should be 2000/month, or less depending on the forecast on the product... But it's not mandatory to confirm this production plan and anticipate really the production, you can wait for real orders to decide on production. <br />
<br />
So if you've planned a production for 2000/month, the ATP for this product will be based on this plan. Your plan is only here to calculate the delivery date and BaanIV can do it<br />
<br />
check your MPS parameter (update ATP on line, control... to yes)<br />
enter a sale ordre for your item... message &quot;whitout stock&quot; and try &quot;calculate delivrery date from ATP&quot;...<br />
<br />
(not sure on exact message.... i use it in french !)<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm testing and learning CTP too here, but haven't been able to fully understand what the feature really does.<br />
Would you mind sharing your testing script or scenario?<br />
<br />
You can email it directly to me: hendra@gawab.com<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />
