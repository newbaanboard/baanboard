<br />
Any idea on how do we schedule production in batches ? Here are is the scenario<br />
<br />
- Sales order quantity 3000, to be delivered by Dec 30.<br />
<br />
- Production capacity is 1000 / month only. So we need to start producing from 1st Oct on wards. <br />
<br />
- Expectation is to order materials in three batches with each batch expected by 1st Oct, 1st Nov, 1st Dec. <br />
<br />
- I tried changing MOQ, ECO, Order quantity multiples of etc., which divides the quantity into 3 different planned orders, but &quot;Start date for all the three orders is 1st Oct&quot;.<br />
<br />
- The requirement is to start the production by 1st Oct, not 1st Dec. <br />
<br />
Any suggestion, please help. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Planning should then give you three planned SFC orders with different start and finish dates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">29th August 2013, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I can do that but that again would be dependent on the person entering sales orders ( Based on the capacity production can produce ). That would be the last resort, however I would looking forward to something from system where I can define the capacity &amp; rest system should be able to take care of..</div></div><hr />
