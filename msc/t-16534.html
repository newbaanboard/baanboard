<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justone</div><div class="date">14th September 2004, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently implementing MPS and MRP and during testing I discovered some strange behaviour of MPS. I have a production (SFC) order with delivery date on 18/10/2004 (monday) and sales order (SLS) which also has delivery date on 18/10/2004 (monday). Both orders have the same quantity (3880 pieces), so they should be coupled. When I run MPS generation within session timps3101m000 Maintain MPS, system plans an MPS order for 3880 pieces with delivery date on 15/10/2004 and deliveres the warning message saying &quot;100% of Production order XXXXXX must be rescheduled out from 18/10/2004 and 23/10/2004&quot;. Where is the reason for that kind of behaviour??</div></div><hr />

Is it a nettable or non-nettable warehouse? Also can you see the receipts due to the production order and customer orders in 'Maintain Master Production Schedule.?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gbnbabu</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 04:57</div></div><div class="posttext">MPS generation is also governed by order interval &amp; time fence values. Please check the planned inventory movements by item... At one of the sites - there was a problem in table timps300, where records were not getting refreshed even after re-generation process, leading to wrong interpretation of  MPS outputs. After zapping and re-building the above table, generation went fine. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skosana</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">There can be a whole slew of reasons. But, the Maintian MPS screen itself should be a good starting point. Did you aggregate MPS data when you ran the session? Are there any delivery lead times on the item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justone</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I attached  Item order data, MPS plan picture, MPS planned transactions and INV planned transactions. Warehouse is sinchronized and as you can see from INV picture all sales orders are paired to production orders nad also sinchronized. We generate and aggregate MPS data daily with batch job, because we fill Demand forecast from outer source.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skosana</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">MPS is planning for production completion one day before sales order delivery date. It cannot delete SFC orders so it is asking you to reschedule it out.<br />
<br />
Did you try using 'Backward planned receipt consumption' parameter in 'Maintian Plan codes' session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justone</div><div class="date">16th September 2004, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">If this is true, why didn't MPS force rescheduling for production orders dated 5/10/2004 and 12/10/2004 since they also finish on the delivery date. We tried using 'Backward planned receipt consumption' parameter (it was set for 7 days), but nothing has changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skosana</div><div class="date">16th September 2004, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">It is generating a exception message for that particular order for maintaining the order interval of 7 days as define by you, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">just_fro</div><div class="date">19th September 2004, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Please keep in mind that demand is scheduled to be present at the end of a period and supply is scheduled to be at the start of a period.....(so supply is in time to cover the demand)<br />
At least this was the MPS behaviour last time I maintained it.......don't know if the guys at SSA changed that.<br />
With this info, you should see that Planned receipt consumption of 7 days in combination with 7 day periods won't help.............</div></div><hr />
