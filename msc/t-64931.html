<br />
Both the Purchase &amp; Production Order (incl. Ops) are now fully received &amp; completed, respectively.<br />
<br />
However, the price on the Purchase Order was a generic one and we need to correct this to the exact price for the subcon work.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to amend the price or go through some form of Purchase Returns process to debit and re-book the subcon service at the required price?<br />
<br />
I suspect I know the answer to this one - but I thought I'd ask...<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
