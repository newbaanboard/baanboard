<br />
Baan 5c-Sp15<br />
<br />
1. Can any one clarify the use of  Revenue recognition project defaults in Project Parameters(tipcs0100s000)?  Especially the functionality of the field Percentage of Completion Calculation Method.<br />
<br />
2. While running tipcs3250m000-Calculate cost prices by Project,  the system generates lot of entries in Integration Transactions by Project/Order(tfgld4510m000). Already raised installment invoices are taken into revenue calculation per centage and showing in the report accordingly. <br />
<br />
Actually we want the system to create the entries for revenue only after closing of project.( Not based on the installment invoice railed before closing the project).<br />
<br />
How to fix the same? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
If you want to make full use of the Earned Value Methods (including Percent Complete) in BAAN V then you should consider to implement BAAN Project (tp) as well.<br />
In BAAN V you can make an easy link between a project in tppdm and a project in tipcs. This will allow you to use BAAN Project (tp) for entering the work brake down structures (activities), project budgeting, project actual costing and Earned Value calculations. In tipcs in BAAN Manufacturing you will execute the production of the products concerned and the actual costs of making these products end up in the project in BAAN Project (tp) against one or more activities.<br />
<br />
It takes courage to use BAAN the way it was designed for but in the long run you will have the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
