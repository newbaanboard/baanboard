<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">2nd December 2003, 07:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I'm on Baan V and using Enterprise Planning.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give an insight on how the EP determine the start hour of the day ?<br />
<br />
I have a demand for, let say, item A which will require item B to be produced. The EP shows planned production order for item B correctly, but with incorrect start hour.<br />
The hour starts from 14:00 instead of 08:00 as defined in my calendar.<br />
<br />
I have checked my calendar and actualize it again and again. Still no changes.<br />
<br />
Then I tried to create production order manually. I create production order for Item B (2 pcs, required hours= 2 hrs).<br />
When I entered the start hour 08:00, the system calculates 16:00 for the end hour, but when I entered 14:00, the system calculates 16:00 for the end hours correctly. This is how I found out that the system calculates from 14:00<br />
<br />
Anyone ever face the same problem? Help please..<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />
Hendra</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which calendar did you re-initialise, company calendar or work centre calendar? For production, work centre calendar will override company calendar if you set it so in the mfg paramaters. Also, did you make sure you have enough hours marked as production hours in your calendar (i.e. did you correctly assign the availability type in manufacturing parameters to the hours available for production in your respective calendar) ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">2nd December 2003, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
I use Company Calendar (ROU Params) and I set the availability by scenario according to daily production calendar.<br />
<br />
In resources (cprpd2101s000) I put no calendar to make sure that the system will take company calendar.<br />
<br />
In Employee, calendar field is also left blank.<br />
<br />
Any idea ? :confused:<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />

Any non-available timeintervals ?</div></div><hr />

i'm not sure if i understood your problem right, but what about the planning method? In my opinion Baan is planning backwards, so if the demand for your item B is at 16.00 and you need 2 hours for production then the system calculates 14.00 as the last start time.<br />
if you maintain a production order manually then you are able to change the planning method in tisfc0101s000 from backwards to forward. When you insert 08.00 as start time then the system should calculate 10.00 as end time.<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">3rd December 2003, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The actual calendar has been updated. I can confirm that because there's no tick sign in the calendar code session (tcccp0510m000)<br />
<br />
I ran the update actual calendar session for many times already, but still no changes.<br />
<br />
I do have non-available time intervals specified on Sunday. Does that have any effect to EP?<br />
<br />
Andreas,<br />
What you're saying is exactly what I've been trying. I tried to change the dates manually but the resulting dates is confusing.<br />
<br />
If I change the start time to 08:00 with forward planning, then the end time must be 10:00, but strange thing is that the resulting calculated time is 16:00.<br />
<br />
From here I concluded that the system takes the start time at 14:00 and not 08:00 as defined in my calendar. This is what I've been trying to find out. From where does the system take the start time if it's not from the calendar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">just_fro</div><div class="date">3rd December 2003, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Calendar is allways used.....(that's why the parameter is there)<br />
<br />
Non availibility is seen by EP.....but in your case not the issue (or did you try to plan the order on a Sunday :) )<br />
<br />
Roughly this is what's happening:<br />
startdate has a cumm.leadtime.......when planning, a new date is looked up which has a cumm.leadtime of (startdate + leadtime)<br />
<br />
So all I can think of is still that your Calendar is having some 'non available time' on the day you try to plan the order.......<br />
(after 08:00 the cumm.leadtime might be 'static' until 14:00, resulting in a finishtime of 16:00)<br />
<br />
But we're still guessing.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
My production order is on weekday. <br />
<br />
I thought of what you're thinking myself, and I looked at the date.<br />
But no, the day is on weekday, not weekends.<br />
<br />
Strange huh...  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">just_fro</div><div class="date">5th December 2003, 00:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the next test can provide us some more insight:<br />
change to backward planning and set finish to 14:00, then 13:00 and so on.....<br />
(probably the 10:00 finish results in 16:00 the previous day, but that's an old issue)<br />
<br />
If there still is a 'gap' it definitely is.........uh........strange</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">5th December 2003, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everybody,<br />
<br />
I've given up on this problem. Just_fro, I tried your suggestion, but the result remains.<br />
<br />
We've taken our last resort, restore a backup company.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot everyone..for your time and sharing.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
