<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
	We have a situation where the est. cost of goods sold entries are created when we run the session Calculate Cost Price by Project (tipcs3250m000) even though all the production orders related to that PCS project are either at status completed or closed except for the fact that the PCS project is still active. <br />
<br />
	This happens especially when we change standard cost price on standard items that are on these completed or closed production orders. It is almost looks like the Calculate Cost Price by Project (tipcs3250m000) session is making re-valuation entries for the completed or closed production orders for those items whose standard cost is been changed and happened to be on these production orders. <br />
	<br />
	Trying to understand why BaaN would make such Est. Cost of Goods Sold entries for completed or closed production orders? Is there a way (parameter) to stop it from making these entries?<br />
<br />
	Appreciate your help,<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

You obviously have WIP against Estimated Costs in your pcs parameters and that's why ECOGS are being generated during calculation of your project costs. When a production orders/ warehouse order/ sales order is closed and you re-calculate your project costs, then you'll see new COGS entries being generated and your WIP going down.</div></div><hr />

	Thanks for the feedback.<br />
<br />
	The situation I am talking is where the WIP is already been relieved, COGS is posted and the production order is closed. The only thing that is not done is that the corresponding PCS project is not closed. <br />
<br />
	Every time there is a standard cost change (via calculate cost price (ticpr2210m000) session) on one of the item that is one these production orders, after running the Calculate Cost Price by Project (tipcs3250m000) session, it creates an production result entry for the production order and Est. Cost of Goods Sold entry for the PCS project for the difference of old cost of the item vs. the new cost the standard item.<br />
<br />
	Appreciate you help.<br />

You're doing an estimated calculation as well, are you?<br />
As far as I can see, when doing an estimated calculation then production order results, purchase order results, warehouse order results and warehouse transfer results are being generated, which are all posted to gld410 and will be used for calculating your ACOGS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the workaround solution that you come with in regards to additional integration postings of variances?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

   Is your Work-In-Process Parameter setting in PCS set to &quot;Estimated Costs&quot;?<br />
