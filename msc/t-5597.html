<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">22nd June 2002, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 items, A and B<br />
<br />
Both items are run on the same work center and same machine. We run item A Sunday through Wednesday and item B Thursday through Saturday.<br />
<br />
The only way I know how to reflect this in the system so we get accurate start and finish dates in Planning is to setup 2 work centers, each with its own calendar. Work center 1 would be linked to calendar 1 (Sun-Wed)  which would be linked to item A. Work center 2 would be linked to calendar 2 (Thur-Sat)  which would be linked to item B.<br />
<br />
The problem with this is that then Capacity Planning and the SFC Utilization reports see these as 2 workcenters, when it is actually 1. I could setup a parent work center, but as far as I know capacity planning and  the SFC Utilization reports to not show parent work centers.<br />
<br />
Any other options?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are right, the reports do not show the capacity of the parent work center. I dont know why.<br />
Maybe the graphical views of work center utilization will help you. They do show the capacity also for parent work centers. That's the way we deal with that problem.<br />
