<br />
We have the following scenario at our business.<br />
<br />
We are shut down Week 30,31,32 but there is slight demand on our Purchase Schedules for Week 32. This is due to the fact that some of our Purchase Contracts are set with a receiving pattern of Thursdays only. So quite correctly the system knowing that we are buidling early in Week 33 schedules the material of for the Thursday of Week 32.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know of any methods to get MRP to pull forward this demand to Week 29.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Neal</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was hoping it would be something that simple.<br />
<br />

Purchasing also use the &quot;blank&quot; calendar code. I don't think you can maintain that. But you can always manipulate tirou410 table. It alos depends upon the parameter for company calendar- By company or workcenter.<br />

<br />
We are set up as company calendar by Work Center.  One final question how do you maintain the data in tirou410 ?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

If you do by work center then by updating the calendar will maintain tirou410. Otherwise you need your own script and can update tirou410. Its not difficult to do though.<br />
