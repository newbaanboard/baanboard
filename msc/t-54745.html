<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">13th January 2009, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">It happens from time to time that a customer (A) will delay their order. If the delay is significant we may choose to use their order(A) to fullfill another customers(B) and by delivering their order(B) earlier we are able to keep a production window for the delayed order(A). In effect order A is converted to order B and B is converted to A. In this situation it's usual for the orders to be different and we can spend time swapping the BOMs around (and production orders) to suit the change in production requirement.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a simple and reliable way of managing this? <br />
Should we be making a project to project transfer too?<br />
<br />
Thanking you in anticipation.<br />

I have the same problem too.(i use LN) .<br />
Currently i use Item Transfer from PCS A to PCS B.<br />
If your PCS code didnt have any unique code related to the Customer, then you can change the SO line for A ,filled with PCS B in the line and vice versa.<br />
But we never swap any BOM and production order.</div></div><hr />

We manufacture to customer specs so changing the BOM is necessary if we have to swap production around.<br />
Bond007 you  mentioned a standard methodolgy for project to project transfer, can you point me in the direction of where this can be found.<br />
<br />
