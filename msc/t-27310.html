<br />
I don't know if you remember me but you gave me my first training course on Baan back in 2000. <br />
The automotive industry make use of  e-collaboration for vehicle development, it is normally a requirement to be a supplier to have access and and to use these tools. The sorts of things I have seen are suppliers having access to customers PDM systems and being responisble for maintaing their items within the system and updating the CAD/CAE drawings/models. Most of the manufacturers have portals where you upload and download technical documents. Receive alerts when new engineering standards are released up date product documentation. Some have training documents and videos available for suppliers to learn abouts their requirements for things like  APQP PPAP/FMEA etc.</div></div><hr />

Good to hear from you again after all this time.  What I am really after is the functionality available in the SSA/Baan e-collaboration product for procurement.</div></div><hr />
