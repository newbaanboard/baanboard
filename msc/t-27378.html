  I take it that you want to close customized production orders since you mentioned projects as well. <br />
Here are the procedures i follow. <br />
<br />
Production Order:<br />
A) All the material estimated have to be either issued or put to zero(along with the subsequent delivery) whether the material be purchased or produced. If produced and has a production order of its own, step A to E to be followed.<br />
B) All operations or tasks need to be completed in the Maintain Routing.(Depending on what qty you want to close the production order with and if routing is there for a production order)<br />
C) Process any hours accounting transaction that werent processed with the previous step. This again if routing is present for the order.<br />
D) Once the desired quantity is received, change the status of &quot;Complete Order&quot; to [YES] and click on Rep Complete button.<br />
E) Close Production order.<br />
<br />
Project:<br />
A) If there are any customized purchased items within that project(you want to close), then make sure they are received completely and matched and approved in Finance if link to finance is on.<br />
B) Make sure all customized sales order items within that project are delivered and invoiced and processed. <br />
C) Change the status of the Project to &quot;Finished&quot;<br />
D) Close the project.</div></div><hr />

   I can only tell you based on the subcontracting procedures existing in my organization. We do subcontract part of the operation, in a production order, to a supplier. This means one route or task is a subcontracting task which, would generate a purchase order with a subcontracting item. The receipt of this item is mandatory for the task or operation to be finished and production order to go forward and be completed. <br />
As per step A in projects, here again you need to match and approve this subcontracting purchase order before you could even close the production order. The system doesnt allow you to close otherwise. <br />
In our scenario there arent any projects when it comes to subcontracting but correct me if i am wrong the procedure remains the same. You have to close the production order before you can finish the project.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">26th June 2007, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">hello - I'm having an issue when closing a project in that I get the error Sales order XXXXX not fully processed.  There are no sales delivery lines for said sales order that are attached to the project that I'm trying to close, I've processed delivered sales orders and I've run the tdinv0250m000 session to clean up the planned inventory.  These are all the documented steps I have that should take care of this error.  Is there anything else I can check so we can get this project closed?<br />
<br />
Thanks - Nikkiz</div></div><hr />

   Check if there are any sales orders related to this project which is awaiting confirmation of back orders...<br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">26th June 2007, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">can you tell me what the easiest way to do this would be?  Is there a session I should use?  I ran the session Print Back Order List(tdsls4418m000) for the project in question and got No Data Within Selection! message.  I've also run the Print Sales orders by Item report for said project and i don't see any qty in the backorder column.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">27th June 2007, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the table tipcs500 and see if there are any record(s) pertaining to this project and sales order. I am not sure whether tdinv0250m000 session clears this table along with tdinv150. Apart from this i would also check session Maintain and Confirm Back Orders {tdsls4125m000} to see if this particular sales order exist in there. I know you have used the print back order session but there is a planned delivery date(pdd) in that session and so if the pdd in the sales order is like beyond the provided date then it could throw out a &quot;No Data Found&quot; message...<br />
 <br />
I have not come across a session which shows the sales order and their ordered and delivered quantity, the quantity that appears in the project and how many were produced. If you could produce something like this within or outside baan, it could aid you in troubleshooting project closing errors..<br />
