<br />
We can get  the last operation of a production order from production planning data (tisfc010). But when the order is closed records are deleted from tisfc010. But if i want to know what is the last operation of a closed production order . Is there any other table from which i can get this information directly or indirectly ? <br />
<br />
We are on Baan 5 b. <br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />
Ayoobi</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th August 2005, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on your production order set-up.  I usually search for the order, sort descending by operation and only get one row.  That is how I find the last operation.  On our system we could have operations that run at same time - not many and I can not recall seeing one, but this is what I was told by our assemblers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayoobi</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 13:15</div></div><div class="posttext">We have quite a few production orders whose higest operation number is not the last operation . So i guess i will have to use the actual start date/time to find the last operation of the production order.  <br />

Thanks once again for your help</div></div><hr />
