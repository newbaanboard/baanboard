<br />
We have purchase item with inventory unit as Kgm. This item is used in a PBOM &amp; qty per set is 0.0002.<br />
<br />
As this is a very costly item (INR 65,000 per Kgm), we want to precise this quantity to 0.00015 per set.  But system doesn't allow adding this quantity in PBOM. <br />
<br />
Also it doesn't allow changing inventory unit to gms, as the item is already consumed in some production orders. Inventory on hand, hold,order,allocated inventory,quotation allocation,economic stock is made 0 for this item.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
1. Create a new item with an inv. unit of grams. (You'll have already thought about that, i suppose)<br />
2. Use 'BOM unit' on form of Standard Item Data.<br />
<br />
GN</div></div><hr />

You will then be able to change the value in the item master. <br />
Be warned as your history will now be corrupt for this item.<br />
<br />
The suggestion by Djie to change the BOM unit is by far the best option.</div></div><hr />
