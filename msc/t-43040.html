<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">achavezf</div><div class="date">16th October 2007, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I am using conversion factors for the following units:<br />
1. Rolls (rl)<br />
2. ft (feet)<br />
3. inch (in) This is the base unit.<br />
The 3 units are defined as length in the Units table.<br />
<br />
We create a conversion factor as follows:<br />
Base unit: in<br />
ft	FOOT	12.00000000	0	0.083333	0<br />
m	METER	39.37000000	0	0.025400	0<br />
rl	ROLL	19620.00000000	0	0.000050	0<br />
yd	YARD	36.00000000	0	0.027777	0<br />
<br />
The problem is that we have an item the we buy it in rl and consume it in ft. LN only allows us to put the converstion factors related to units, in this case in. Therefore there is no direct converstion factor between them.<br />
The price of the item is $37 USD/rl and the cost is 0.0126 USD.<br />
<br />
Any idea how Baan creates the conversion? We can't get this number.<br />
Any help It will be appreciate.<br />
 <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">16th October 2007, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">For this you need to create a conversion factor at the Item Level using the Base unit of the Item and then insert the Conversion Factor under that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">achavezf</div><div class="date">17th October 2007, 01:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't.<br />
The problem is that when I try to create ft to rl for the item in specific. LN displays a message that says &quot;Define the conversion factor at general level&quot; and the when I tried to define at general level Baan is not allowing me to put ft in the base unit because ft is not a base unit.<br />
<br />
i hope I made myself clear.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">17th October 2007, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">What are your Base Units:<br />
<br />
        Weight lbs<br />
        Length ft<br />
        Area(m2) sqm<br />
        volume    gl<br />
        Time hr<br />
<br />
     If you have a different base unit for Length then you would have to define the conversion factor based upon that base unit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jennyadr</div><div class="date">1st November 2007, 05:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi <br />
Do you use LN?<br />
<br />
What inventory unit do you use in that item?<br />
<br />
You can use conversion factor in item level.<br />
Input all the conversion in item level, everytime you have a new UOM that only be converted for this item (eg : roll)<br />
<br />
For purchase unit , you can define it in Item Purchase <br />
But for consume it, you can only use one UOM  (Inventory unit).<br />
So you can use many of UOM for sales unit and purchase unit.<br />
but for inventory consumption, it always read the inv unit.<br />
I ve benn through this before, and find lots of problem because of this.<br />
Any other opinion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddy G</div><div class="date">1st November 2007, 09:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the error message &quot;Define conversion factor on general level.&quot; does not block, does it?<br />
<br />
Maybe it is not wise to have the Roll defined as a length. In fact it is a &quot;piece&quot;.<br />
<br />
Factors between length units are rarely item specific and therefore the warning is given I guess.<br />
E.g.: 1 meter = 100 centimeters. That is not different for any item.<br />
(oh.. some venders sell 110 centimeters out of 1 meter, maybe ;-)  )<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you!<br />
<br />

<br />
did you solved your problem ? i'm facing the same now.<br />
<br />
would be thankful if you tell what have you done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seeace</div><div class="date">14th August 2008, 01:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi:<br />
Since your base unit is &quot;in&quot; (inch), you have to define the conversion factor between inch and roll at general level as both of them are for type &quot;length&quot;.<br />
Though this could be huge factor (1 roll = 235440 inch), it should be possible as ERPLN allows conversion factors till 10^6.<br />
As you already have maintained conversion factor between inch and foot, ERPLN would understand it and covert roll to ft.<br />
<br />
Hope this solves your problem</div></div><hr />
