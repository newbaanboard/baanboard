<br />
the MRP recently aborted with the following error message:<br />
&quot;Internal table overflow: too many MRP orders planned for item ...&quot;<br />
This error was obviously caused by a setting in the order data of an RPT item. The system was forced to generate a large number (about 2400!) of production orders with quantity 1.  No doubt a senseless setting and after changing the order data the error was gone. <br />
Is there any restriction for the number of MRP orders per item? Has anybody experienced a similar problem?<br />

I have not experienced this problem but:<br />
If you take a look into the helptext of session timrp1210m000:<br />
Help -&gt; Using session -&gt; SEE ALSO METHODS Generate Planned MRP Orders -&gt; 3. MRP orders for RPT-oriented MRP items (in the middle of the screen):<br />
&quot;Account is taken of the available working time recorded for the relevant bottleneck workcenter&quot;.<br />
Maybe this is the point why the MRP cannot plan more orders then about 2400 orders for that item.<br />

<br />
thanks for your reply. I don't think that the problem is an capacity issue. After adjusting the order data for the item, the system generates a single order with quantity 2400. We do not have a setup time in the routing so capacity requirement is same for one order with quantity 2400 or 2400 orders with quantity 1.<br />
<br />
We logged a case at Baan Support and they haven't an explanation so far :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">14th October 2002, 23:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Your problem, I believe, is inside the MRP session, not capacity plans or Baan tables.  In running MRP, the program builds a table of orders for each item in calculating demand.  When you have too many orders this internal table overflows and you receive the error.  I've run into this problem with extremely deep BOM's that create multiple orders for some common items (screws being a good example).<br />
<br />
If the demand is real, then making the item a floor stock item will remove the problem, as you will not be generating orders for it.<br />
<br />
Expect Baan to come back with documentation of the limit on the number of orders rather than a fix.</div></div><hr />

yes, you are right the problem is within the MRP. We got a confirmation from the Baan developement department for this. They advised us to increase the MRP Time Horizon and it works fine now :D <br />
