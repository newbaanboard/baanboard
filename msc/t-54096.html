<br />
This a new scenario<br />
<br />
I send material in sets. But that material may be like thinner, glue which I have to sent in bluk and not as per the required quantity. On returning only partial quantity will be sent in the form of assembly. how to map this?<br />
<br />
If my raw material gets rejected by the subcontracted during assembluy then on return how to account it as I can only receive the finished product only and there is no provision to account for rejection or unused quantity  of raw material.<br />
<br />
Please elaborate the solution.<br />
<br />
Regards annd thank you <br />

<br />
Yes, you are absolutely correct, that there isn't any functionality of Tracking the rejected BOM material at Subcontractor's End....<br />
<br />
What you can do, Receive the Rejected Quantity from SFC Production (Manual).<br />
<br />
For tracking, make a separate Number Group &amp; No. Series for Subcontracting Rejected Material and maintain the defaults in the session &quot;Default Order type By Origin - whinh0120m000&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know this is not a exact solution, but still you can try this as there isn't any standard functionality for the same.<br />

<br />
You can return material against that production order of that subcontracting order by &quot;Material to issue for Production Order session&quot; by inserting (-) Qty,So you can track for rejection or unused quantity of raw material then process WH orders of that Prodcution order and set Wh procedure with inspection if it is rejected then it will reject otherwise it will come in the stock.<br />
<br />
If more queury then contact me.<br />
