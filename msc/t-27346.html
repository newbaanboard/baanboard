Frequently we find ourselves creating new quotations and generating new product variants with the same option selects because we do not know how to copy from one quotation with variant to a new quotation (bringing across the product variant).<br />
<br />
Can this be done and if so we would sure appreciate your guidance.<br />

We are using Baan IVc4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutus</div><div class="date">27th June 2006, 14:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Your variant is having reference type 'sales quotation' and the reference order of the product variant will probably correspond with your sales quotation number. Such variants can only be used on that specific sales quotation (in order to prevent others from changing this variant (from outside the related quotation)). So you just cannot reuse your variant in other places.<br />
<br />
You'd need a variant with reference type &quot;standard&quot;. Such variants can be used on any quotation, order, project, budget. That means you'd have to create your variant through session 'product variants' (tipcf5101m000), which will make it reference type 'Standard'.</div></div><hr />
