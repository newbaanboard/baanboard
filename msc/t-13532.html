<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">6th November 2003, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I have item A that I sell to Customer 1 and Customer 2. I get a forecast from marketing by customer/item. Customer 1 is a JIT manufacturer who I always want us to have inventory on hand, and customer 2 is a retailer who can wait 3 weeks for delivery. <br />
<br />
I want to be able to build item A make-to-stock for Customer 1, and assemble-to-order for customer 2. Any ideas on how I can do this? <br />
<br />
In Baan5, you can only set your time fences per item, not item/channel - so I have been struggling to come up with a solution on this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is only 1 planitem A.<br />
<br />
The use of channels is not meant for different planning methods.<br />
It's (only) meant for (dis)aggregation of demand in MPS.<br />
<br />
(or they must have changed it since I left last month....)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe?<br />

Not really my department ;)</div></div><hr />
