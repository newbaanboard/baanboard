<br />
at Standard QMS session we can choose origin as 'Warehouse transfer' option but that one is applicable when we perform the TPOP as line supply for the selected item, as per your case that one is not applicable.<br />
Either you can follow simple warehouse inspection activity orelse you can go for storage inspection with easy entry process, but storage inspection only can be performed after receiving the good at project site, unless you may need to go for customization i guess.<br />
