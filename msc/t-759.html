<br />
i've a generic bom like this:<br />
<br />
generic-item<br />
10/1 item1<br />
10/2 item2<br />
<br />
item1 and item2 are manufactured items with their own boms.<br />
<br />
bom-item1<br />
10 item-a<br />
20 item-b<br />
<br />
when generating the project structure for product variant i get the following custumised bom:<br />
<br />
custumised-item<br />
10 proj1item1<br />
<br />
the bom of the item1 doesn't appear. is it supposed to be like that?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance,<br />
m.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it's because you expect to find the BOM for ITEM 1 in the PCS module (as a customized BOM), but it's not there. ITEM 1 is a part of the configuerd item, but it's still a standard (anonymous) item, and you'll find the BOM for ITEM 1 as a standard BOM.<br />
If you want to make ITEM 1 customized, change from standard to customized in the BOM for the Item you configuerd. Baan will then automaticly ask you how to copy ITEM 1 from standard to customized.<br />
I'm mayby wrong, but I do think this is the answer to your problem.<br />

well, both generic-item and item1 became custumised when generating the project structure for the product variant.<br />
what am i still wondering is why wasn't the standard bom of item1 been copied to the custumised item.<br />
by the way, is there a chance to mantain item1 standard when generating the project?<br />

i still need help on my other problem... anyone?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">23rd January 2002, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't worked with PCF, but if your BOM is -<br />
<br />
generic-item <br />
 10/1 item1 <br />
 10/2 item2 <br />
<br />
- both are line 10, so are you inadvertently telling it that item1 has been superceded here by item2? Wouldnt' that keep it from looking at item1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">miguel.leite</div><div class="date">23rd January 2002, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks again for the replies.<br />
well i manage to solve my problem defining item1 as phantom. i am not sure if i understand why it must be phantom, but it works and it's fair enough to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Youp2001</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose it works like this:<br />
<br />
When you generate the product variant structure the single level BOM structure for your generic item will be generated. Based on the standard item data, order policy the field standard item / customized item is filled.<br />
<br />
So in your example the bom would contain a line with proj1item1. In case this is a standard item (order policy of item 1 is anonymous) the BOM for this item will not be made customized.<br />
In case this is a customized item (order policy of item 1 is to order) the BOM for this item will be copied to your project at the moment you execute a PRP-run (it will create all needed customized BOMs in your product structure below level 1). <br />
<br />
Of course by making item1 a phantom item the components from the BOM of item1 are created in the project when generating the product variant structure.</div></div><hr />
