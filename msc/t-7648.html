<br />
We are implementing Lean Manufacturing methods on our shop floor.  One of the inventory techniques is the use of kanban / Two-bin systems in an effort to keep parts there in the appropriate quantities.  Replentishment is physically taking an empty bin back to the stockroom and filling it up.  The amount of inventory to fill the bin is then added to and outbounded from a production order that we use all month long just for this purpose.<br />
<br />
Some of these kanban items reside our BOM and end up in the shop floor production orders to be issued.  The difficulty with this is that the kanban items have already been issued to the kanban bin.  Our current work around is to zero the production order estimated material quantity for any kanban items so that they are not issued to the shop floor a second time (the first time being when the kanban bin was filled).<br />
<br />
As we move to more and more kanban items the variance between planned and actual cost will be come greater which the Finance people find undesiralble.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any other suggestions for workarounds in Baan 4 and do more recent versions of Baan have better ways of handling?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

The items were still issued by the line at each production point and manually replenished by inventory control based on a light signal at the replenishment site.  This kept the material at the line side (replenishment) warehouse stocked to handle the workload.  We set the stock up to have no minimum and no maximum.  I am not sure whether you want to backflush material or not, this may be the underlying issue with finance.  If you want, I can detail this more if I have a few more details on your side.</div></div><hr />
