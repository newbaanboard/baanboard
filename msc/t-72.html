<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marlon</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hallo users, consultants and developers,<br />
Congratulations on this great site!<br />
<br />
I am a cost accountant working for the Plastiflex organisation, producer of flexible plastic hoses. I started working for the company about one year ago and encountered the following problems, which I need your advice on. As I have to regard the complete system I will post this only here although there are Finance questions in this as well.<br />
<br />
In purchasing raw material, I create an invoice based on the price of the previous month (due to the market this is only know by my supplier at a later date in the month  prices are re -calculated by them  ). To me this means that in ITM I always have a different price as when I ordered.  We do an automatic matching and from a accounting point of view everything is OK  meaning the complete order is booked and price differences are booked accordingly. <br />
<br />
My purchase price though is not correct in my master data. This again means that because of the fact that the price difference is NOT booked on item level I take wrong prices in my production, which leads to a wrong calculation in the CPR module. I purchase about 100 tons of this raw material every month.<br />
<br />
Q: is there a possibility to book the price difference in PUR in such a way that there is no need to have a price difference in Finance. <br />
<br />
The solution would be something like I à although I have already received the raw material I still have the opportunity to I to change the order ( or something like that ) on item level. I need to have correct prices in my purchase master data so that when updating purchase prices and standard costing calculations the average purchase price - based on present stock - is done correctly. <br />
<br />
Our production uses 'process' to register our batches. Because I would like to reduce the number of batches inputs (we create about 15.000 batches a year) and quicker way of analysing them I need to know following:<br />
<br />
NOTE: our production procedure is following: first produce the hose (different number) end batch then create second batch rest production  (again different number).<br />
<br />
Q: Is there a way to input sub items (with own formula) into the system and have them back flushed only once? NOTE that the sub items exist only to be able to monitor WIP (very high value)<br />
Q: do I need to change my BOM in order to do so or can I just change my parameters (where do I do that)<br />
I also use hours accounting!<br />
Q: can I just switch from process to manufacturing without having to start from scrap?<br />
<br />
We work with BaaN C4 and have integrated logistics, production, finance, sales and purchase (MRP). <br />
Thanks in advance <br />
All possible solutions are welcomed <br />

<br />
If you update the prices of the PO in the session:<br />
tdpur4122m000 (change prices and discounts after receipt) Baan will not book anything on the price variances. You have to run the session whina1200m000 twice (for consumed and non consumed variances, due to a bug you cannot do this at once).<br />
Baan will counterpost eveything in such a way, that no open entries wil occur on price variances.:)</div></div><hr />
