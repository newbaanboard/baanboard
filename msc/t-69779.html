Today 20-02-17,I have updated the std cost price of a raw material.The price entered was wrong.So when I tried reentering the correct price the system gave the answer as &quot; already updated the curent price today&quot;.So please help me in entering the correct price.Whether you can calculate update the std cost only once a day.<br />
matteris urgent by tomorrows opening because the raw material inventory and consumption has shot up by more than Rs.35 lacs<br />
Tomorrow if I run the integration session of 20-02-17 with the incorrect data,is putting JV the only answer?<br />
Please help.Urgent</div></div><hr />

I am sure there are steps you could take to get it processed again - I just do not know those steps or the fix for the next day.<br />
<br />
PS  - Please only post your question once.  Moderators can move it around if there is a better forum.</div></div><hr />
