In B50c, I have setup the calendar with no availability on week-ends. I also have a Holiday availability type which is also with 'No Availability'. <br />
<br />
If we enter a demand on the monday, MRP will plan it  on the previous friday, which is ok. This proves that the week-end set-up is working fine. <br />
<br />
Let's say I setup tuesday as a holiday. I enter a demand on the tuesday and it gets planned on the previous monday. Ok so far.<br />
So the holiday set-up works fines too.<br />
<br />
But, if I setup monday as a holiday and enter the demand on the tuesday, MRP plans the supply on the saturday !!<br />
<br />
Any ideas on this ??<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
The demand is probally put on the end of the day on friday: friday at 24:00:00 hours.<br />
But since this time does not exists it will be put on saturday 00:00:00 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">30th June 2003, 13:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on Baan IVc4 and have a similar effect when using RPT-items. When reporting production schedules complete, the last production order is automatically replanned by the system. Only on fridays(!) the start remainder is planned to saturday instead of Monday.<br />
We logged a case and got the information that this problem could not be solved without serious impact on the MRP-run. As sdvries already mentioned: it is a problem of time calculation especially at the end/beginning of days.<br />

<br />
We had a simular problem in c4 for standard production orders which were scheduled at a wrong day. This was caused by a corrupted index2 of tirou400. Recreating the table solved the problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheYaz</div><div class="date">30th June 2003, 15:08</div></div><div class="posttext">We'll be doing a little bit more testing today.<br />
<br />
During our previous testing, we used the Special Demand by item session (cpdsp2100m000) to enter the demand. Maybe the time is handled in the background.<br />
<br />
I will post the result of our testing.<br />
<br />
Thks for the replies !</div></div><hr />

By changing the available hours in the day from 00:00...24:00 to now 07:00...17:00, the demand is now on the friday.<br />
