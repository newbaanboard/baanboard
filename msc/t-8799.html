<br />
We have some operation of an item which we have to record only the hours spent. There will not be any quantity completion.  <br />
<br />
For example, We have two work centers like Design dept and cylinder dept.  Both dept. will spend some hours before printing  starts and  will not report any quantity completion.   How can we report  only hours spent on both the depts. thru hours accounting without quantity.   <br />
<br />
Please explain.</div></div><hr />

Wow, the cost from those departments must be so important to you guys, huh? Our current client is also involved with printing, and hence design and cylinder handling. But in their case, they are satisfied with just accounting for them as item surcharges<br />

<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />

Hi paul,<br />
<br />
I understood the surcharge method. But we wanted to record the hours spent on those departments.  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

    <br />
I believe that the solution depends on the level of detail with which is wanted to hold trace of the hours spent from these departments, typically indirect.    <br />
    <br />
If the goal is to track the actual hours spent from these departments on every single SFC order, I hold is had to add a new operation, as initial activity, for each work-center. <br />
The completion of these operations will correspond to the completion of the necessary preliminary activities to start the production of the ordered quantities. The components of the BOM can be linked to the next operations of the production order and picked just when it is necessary.<br />
  <br />
If it is desired to trace only the actual hours spent from these departments on some activities, it is possible to register the hours on project (PCS) or indirect activities. The costs on the order can be stored through item surcharges. In finance the costs of the projects will go to absorb the cost produced by the surcharges.<br />
<br />
Ciao</div></div><hr />
