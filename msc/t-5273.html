<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marc S</div><div class="date">21st May 2002, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to use serial numbers in a similar fashion to the way that lot numbers are used within Baan (we are using Baan Vc).<br />
<br />
We may have many serial numbers within a given lot, and would like to identify in which finished part (also ID'd with a serial number) each individual component ended up in.<br />
<br />
In short, we'd like to issue materials by serial number and/or report operations complete by serial number.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">22nd May 2002, 19:39</div></div><div class="posttext">If you switch to lot sizes of one, you will be able to add serial numbers when you issue the items to production.  You may need to customize to generate the serial numbers, or add them from an external serial number generator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marc S</div><div class="date">22nd May 2002, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that's what I was afraid of.  I ultimately wanted to have a part that had both a lot by &quot;lot&quot; and by &quot;unit&quot; for the same item.<br />
<br />
We would potentially like to block by &quot;lot&quot;, but need traceability by &quot;unit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts would be appreciated.<br />

Thanks,<br />

Make the project represent the lot size you wish.  You may want 10 widgets produced.  Issue the production orders in quantity of 1 and have the item serialized.  You could track and issue the material by serial and still track the lot via projects.  I am basing this suggestion on Baan IV functionality I have used.  I am pretty certain the same configuration can be used in V.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">5th July 2002, 10:48</div></div><div class="posttext">This feature is supposed to be in Baan 5.2a but it's not yet released in APAC so can't say if it's working fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddy G</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not there in B50c indeed.<br />
<br />
But we built this in B52a.<br />
It is not waterproof yet there, but we are fine-tuning this in B52b.<br />
(on demand - maybe- also in B52a)<br />
<br />
It is fully integrated in Warehousing - Production and Service.<br />
As-Built structures can be maintained for Assembly and Shopfloor production. These structures can be copied to Service to do maintenance.<br />
<br />
As we do not yet have much customer input on this we would love to get your input on this.<br />
<br />
========================<br />
Additionally we built something called &quot;Unit Effectivity&quot; in B52a/b<br />
This serves two goals:<br />
 - Pegging to Sales Order Line (via Effectivity Unit)<br />
 - Unit effectivity enables you to model deviations from a standard end item. For example, deviations can be: <br />
    * The use of one component instead of another. This affects the EBOM or the PBOM in BaanERP Manufacturing. <br />
    * The way the end item is produced. This affects the routing or the routing operations in the Routing (ROU) module of BaanERP Manufacturing. <br />
    * The origin of the end-item's parts. This affects the sourcing strategies defined in BaanERP Enterprise Planning. <br />
<br />
Unit Effectivity can be used in combination with Serialized Items.<br />
<br />
As we are fine tuning this functionality, we would love to know:<br />
 - in what way this should work (working procedures).<br />
 - what it should support (functionality).<br />
<br />
