<br />
I got some problem with the backflushing. In the same material list I have component with backflushing and another without. The consumption components without backflushing is made at the beginning of production and will not change under way. <br />
The quantity produced is variable performance in + / -. As a result quantities are recalculated according to the quantities produced depending on the setting tisfc000.umsi. <br />
My problem is how not to recalculate the estimated consumption that are not babackflush and cancel the remaining consumption  materials backflushing if production less than the amount estimated.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe production order, didnt have to be released yet.<br />
You just print out the document, then after the result is final.<br />
eg: first ordered qty is 100 kg, then the actual production result is 80.<br />
You changed the production order qty to 80, then the estimated material will be recalculated to produce this 80.<br />
Just a suggestion :)<br />
