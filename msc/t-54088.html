I get a fatal error when I want to add items to a BOM which have Items-Planning Data. The error occurs when trying to save. The same fatal error also comes when trying to use the session generate order planning with the fields Bottom up or Top down checked.<br />
<br />
log.bshell comes up with a select statement of cprpd730 to cprpd100, but cprpd730 is empty, it is (as far as I know) only used for multisite planning.<br />
<br />
As this happends in all our companies even the stand alone ones I don't think it has something to do with migrated master data, tested it in an empty shell.<br />
<br />
After talking to a consultant he said the key must be cprpd120. Can someone explain me what that table is used for?<br />
<br />
He also said if I get that fatal error it might have something to do with my item number segmentation (domain segmentation), which could be right as it happens in all companies and that is maintained in tools.<br />
<br />
We have 2 records in there which are interesting, 1 for tc which is just 9 for project and 38 for item and 1 for ep which has 3 for cluster 9 for project and 38 for item. Do we need that cluster setup? We are not using it.<br />
<br />
Well any idea where I could search for this error and what could cause the same fatal error when trying to create BOM with Planning Data and generate order planning with Bottom up / Top Down are helpfull.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Infor haven't resolved this yet.</div></div><hr />

This is for version B50_b,B50_c, but hopefully you can quote this to your support team and they will know the LN equivalent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">19th November 2010, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">is it always getting populated in cprpd120 when record is inserted into cprpd100? What if data is loaded into cprpd100 and not into cprpd120. Does any process session populates cprpd120 later?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, its true that once you update the cprpd100, cprpd120 will automatically get updated, there's no any other process/session you need to run later for updating cprpd120.<br />
