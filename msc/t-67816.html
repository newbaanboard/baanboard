<br />
We have a scenario that in a one production flow from a single raw material we receive two types of finished goods in a single production cycle<br />
Could you please suggest me a way to tackle this scenario</div></div><hr />

You can define the BOM for a Finished Good and include other Finished good in negative Qty. In this case when you create a production order for the first one, the second FG will appear in Estimated Material in negative qty. while reporting you need to enter the produced qty in Material issue in negative. <br />
<br />
Impact:-<br />
1. If you are using MAUC as valuation method, then the cost of the produced goods will not be correct. all the operation cost will be loaded on the First FG. <br />
2. Second FG will be posted to Warehouse with Standard Cost price.</div></div><hr />
