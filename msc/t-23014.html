We have different divisions.  Some divisions also make to stock and sell.  I would like to know how, for jobs involving installation, I can handle Production within a project involving installation too. Can I use a system of transfer pricing?</div></div><hr />

Are you planning to use BAAN Project tp in combination with BAAN Manufacturing? Or do you only want to use the tipcs projects within BAAN Manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Please let us know what scenario you are working with.<br />

<br />
I feel we don't know enough about BaaN at present to be able to use tp in combination with Manufacturing. Hence, we are using tipcs within Manufacturing.  However, I feel that we can use Project tp in combination with Manufacturing. The major activity is still manufacturing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In that case I will transfer this thread to the Manufacturing forum because at present you are only using tipcs.<br />
My advise is to open a new thread as well in the Project section if you are interested in the combination between tp and tipcs. <br />
This will be very usefull for you because you also have installation activities going on. Almost all BAAN customers that I know make the mistake of trying to execute these installation activities in tipcs. You can compare that as eating soup with a fork.<br />
Also the valuation methods like 'Transfer Pricing' are handled better through BAAN Project tp. The demand for Enterprise Planning (MP) and Manufacturing can be generated from the activities in BAAN IV Project easily.<br />
In case you would like to know more about how this is done you can contact me at evdborg@hotmail.com.<br />
