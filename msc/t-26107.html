<br />
Now we might have more than one item with the same code so we need to put a sequence number to the end of it.the sequence is created but with random number, we need it to be start from 001 and continue but it give us numbers like 501 then 601 etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
ok .. now I know why.. it takes the 1st digit from the variant number and the other 2 digits is the seqence.. I need it to make a sequence from 3 digit not including the variant number..<br />
<br />
Is it possible...<br />
<br />
<br />
Help appreciated</div></div><hr />

Ik you add ! for each line in the constraint you wil be able to program anything you want. So it would be possible to do a select on the item table and select the last record inserted and add 1 tot the code.<br />

I agree, but that requires that you use the 'object' mode of pcf; the 'interpreter' mode will not work here. (And by the way, switching from interpreter to object mode might become a big problem.)<br />

What could be the problems going to object mode?<br />
Just curious, from a development point of view?<br />

<br />
People that maintain pcf rules are no real programmers. They often have a set of rules and you better don't ask &quot;why aren't you doing it in another / easier way&quot;.<br />
<br />
But when you switch to object mode, you have use a compiler (&quot;what's that?&quot;) and you have to think of dependencies. Imagine you introduce a new product feature =&gt; you'll have to recompile all(!) your generic items.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the benefit is that you could reduce the code with your &quot;rules&quot;, use #includes and/or dlls.<br />

Ah.. ok.<br />
With &quot;development point of view&quot; I was not clear.<br />
I meant: I'm involved in maintenance/development of the PCF module.<br />
So I'm interested in all comments &quot;from the field&quot;, that can help improve PCF functionality/usability etc.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

That sounds unbelievable to me. You're from SSA / baan and you are asking your customers? Really?<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is something that has me driven the last five years: I have to control the product configurator from batch input. What about AFS? Is it possible to create a session &quot;initialialize product variants&quot; (cpva.f .. cpva.t; pcf option I) or &quot;run pcf constraints&quot; (cpva.f .. cpva.t, open pcf and use option E)?<br />

<br />
Everything is possible...<br />
However, for this I do not have an out-of-the-box solution.<br />
I'm not experienced in AFS too, because that is merely used in customisations/integrations stuff.<br />
Wonder if it can handle the complex UI of tipcs5120s000...<br />
<br />
I do know a customer that has made customisations for this in LN.<br />
I'll see, if I can come to know, how they did it so I can let you know.<br />
<br />
And you can always ask for customisations of course!<br />
<br />
