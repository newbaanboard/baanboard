<br />
We are running Baan IV and I have been asked to present to the management team how and what fields Baan uses to back schedule both purchase and production orders (we run MPS/MRP with infinite capacity) and also how it determines a sales order / schedule delivery date.<br />
<br />
From what I have gathered, we enter sales orders in manually and also use EDI. <br />
<br />
1.	Is there a field(s) that will take into account the lead time we give to a customer to ensure that demand does not drop in within lead time (for both order entry and EDI) e.g. if a customers lead time is 8 weeks, delivery date should default to 8 weeks in advance?<br />
2.	What fields are used to back schedule for both a production and purchase order?<br />
<br />
Having just joined the company and with no real experience of Baan can someone please help?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />

It means it takes the delivery date and then calcualte when the production can be started. You may get a exeception and reschedule messages if there is an issue. Baan MPS doesn't suggest a date when order can be delivered. For this you may have to run finite planning engines.<br />

My query related to finding which fields were responsible for calculating the start date of a production &amp; purchase order. In case someone is looking for the same I have so far found the following:<br />
Manufactured MPS Item - Work Centre Resource Unit hr/day, Task Prod Rate, W/C wait time, Item master Order interval &amp; safety time.<br />
MRP Purchase Order - Order Interval, Item master order lead time, Item master safety time<br />
MRP Manufactured Item - Order Interval, Item Master safety time, resource unit hr/day, production rate &amp; safety time<br />
MRP Purchase schedule - Frozen period, Order interval, safety time</div></div><hr />
