<br />
We have errroneus results when we executed MPS in Background at night (3:00am), we don't know if it is due to the fact that customers demands (EDI) are updated in the system by the time MPS is calculating, but in any case when we executed MPS (manually) in the morning the results are fine, so we have some questions about it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Is it possible to start MPS despite EDI customer demans are entering?<br />
<br />
2) Why MPS behaviour is different from night (job scheduled) to when is executed manually during the day?<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />

<br />
Might be because you're not up to date with your software (?)<br />
I remember a bug in the &quot;job-version&quot; (wrong parameters used....like MRP horizon). A search on the knowledgebase with &quot;mps3201 and job&quot; should come up with something...<br />
<br />
I don't think the EDI orders cause problems....<br />
(can you garantee that during daytime nobody enters any demand while MPS is running ?)<br />
<br />
/offtopic: people seem to forget the meaning of MPS....it's LONG term planning and is often confused with MRP....in which all 'nearby' transactions are planned</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan provides two facilities to improve performance for selected applications.<br />
<br />
a) performance boosters and table boosters.<br />
<br />
Each registered session has parameters to state if boosting is off, or on by job, session or individual (with individual logon as a list).<br />
<br />
Check out the performance boosters settings.</div></div><hr />
