<br />
I'm pretty new to Infor and I would like to evaluate something in our purchasing process.  <br />
<br />
We're a manufacturing company and we have a bunch of tools within our inventory that are used to repair our production machines.  At some point we need to send our tool to a shop for repair.  Since the tool is not available anymore because it's physically at the vendor location, I was wondering if we could supply the tool within the P.O. and receive it back once we proceed with the goods receipts.<br />
<br />
We still own the tool thus we need to keep visibility of the quantity but not within our main warehouse.  Therefore what would be the most appropriate way to configure such a process?<br />
<br />
We're using Infor LN 6.1 FP7 by the way.<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
D.</div></div><hr />
