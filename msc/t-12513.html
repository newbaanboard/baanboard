<br />
a couple a days ago I got this problem: in session whinr1542m000 (Inventory by Item, Warehouse, Location and Lot) I see a lot more pcs than in session whwmd2515m100 (Inventory by Item and Warehouse) for the same item and warehouse!?<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me and mention a possible reason...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably it is affected by wrong planned inventory transaction. Try running session whinp1200m000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tzwetan</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Hendra,<br />
<br />
anyway the problem remains the same - I think I am about to adjust the inventory manually...</div></div><hr />

try this program : whcor0200m000<br />
You have to play with different locks in this program (trial and error :-)) ).<br />
Its better to do with only 1 item (or small quantity).<br />
We have the same problems. I believe, it`s happens by correction of production-orders.<br />

I believe there were some cases before which have been consequently corrected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hardy_1</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We have SP8.<br />
It may be it gives a special solution for this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">12th September 2003, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">hardy_1 is right.<br />
<br />
Even after the latest service pack (13), the correction program whcor0200m000 is still applicable. There is also a new solution for reconciling inventory values between logistics and finance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those 2 sessions read their data from 2 different source tables. Upon looking at the source tables (one should be in INR and another in WMD. Not sure which exact one since I have no BaanERP machine in front of me) using General Table Display ttaad4500, did you see inconsistency there? If yes, then probably do the WH correction program. Otherwise, it might just be a case of putting dissimilar parameters into the 2 print sessions<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tzwetan</div><div class="date">17th September 2003, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems the problem with the different inventory in tables whinr140 and whwmd215 will show up as long as this session whcor0200m000 exists. Well, at least it helps...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went through the script of whcor0200m000<br />
<br />
Seems there are lot of preconditions and limitations.<br />
<br />
spoke to Baan Support and they say that it should be advised to run in update mode as a last resort and needs to be executed after a detailed study.<br />
<br />
I ran it in my test systems and successfully corrupted a lot of data because a precondition was not met ( I balanced inventory at the same time as rebuilding locations)<br />
<br />
I would suggest NOT to run whcor0200 without Baan Support.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan provides the correction program for last resort, not because the inventory will always contain mismatch. For example, in all B4/B5 installations we've done, we've never seen one where the inventory from one table to another is inconsistent<br />
