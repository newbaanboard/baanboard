<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpatchen</div><div class="date">10th June 2010, 21:43</div></div><div class="posttext">We would like to use Min Max to generate requisitions for purchase of cost items.  I can't find any info that would allow MRP to Generate the requesition and have the item expensed when received.<br />
<br />
We don't want to inventory the value of these cost items but allow min max to generate the requisitions.<br />
<br />
Bottom line we dont want any value of inventory on the books for these items.  When the receipt is made the process would be to debit expense and credit AP Liability.  But Inventory on hond would be the increased as received and the on hand qty inventory adjusted as needed.<br />
<br />
any thoughts on how to accomplish this would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
