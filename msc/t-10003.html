<br />
Are there solutions, which you did imprted last time?<br />
Take a look into the solutions, which objects were imported.<br />
Or do a ttstpsessinfo on the timrp1211(m/s)000 session and<br />
take a look when it was last updated.<br />

thanks for the reply. We have IVc4 SP10, difficult to find out the list of solutions needed after that. We have also SP11-12 but didn't install it yet. I guess it concerns only tools but not manufacturing. <br />
ttstpsessinfo analyze seems to be OK. we use standard c4 session. The curious thing is sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. :)</div></div><hr />

Which version of portingset are you using?<br />
Did you just updated the portingset?<br />
I am asking this because i did ttstpsessinfo on timrp1210m000 and timrp1211s000 on my oper. system (port. 6.1C.06.05) as well on my testsystem (port. 6.1C.06.07), but for both i got an error: &quot;Error in reading sort file record 61 fields scanned, 74 expected&quot;. I've just made a case for this problem on B.O.S. <br />

Portingset  : 6.1c.06.01. Trying to update it we've encountered with several erors unfortunately i don't remember which in details. But the strange fact is MRP was OK untill some days ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we faced a similar problem several months ago. The solution we got from Baan Support was quite simple: increase the Length MRP Time Horizon in Days (default: 2500) to a higher value and the problem should not occur any more.<br />
This was my post in this forum:<br />

<br />
Thanks for your help. The point is we do not use RPT items so actively so maybe it is another case.  Can you please give some more details concerning increasing the length of MRP time horizon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Old Vens,<br />
<br />
using RPT-items or not should have no impact on the MRP-run. In our case we could reproduce the problem with RPT-items as well as with a standard item.<br />
The Time Horizon can be changed in the MRP Parameters (timrp0100m000). The online help for this field contains the following hint:<br />
.. you can adapt this to your company's needs, but note that: a too long value results in error messages from the MRP program. A too high value results in unnecessary memory usage.. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps a little bit more..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Martin<br />
<br />
I've already found out this quoatation, thank you.<br />
Perhaps indeed out company planning calendar needs some restructruration. we have value of time horizon 6 times less than default. That's because we used another planning method before. <br />
My profile is system administration but wishing to resolve the problem makes me join this process. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">26th May 2003, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, indeed after increasing of  <br />
Length MRP Time Horizon in Days in MRP parameters the situation became more stable. The time required to fulfil MRP planning became sufficiently shorter. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
