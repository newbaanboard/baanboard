<br />
I work at a company where we manufacture parts from sheet metal. We have a problem with our raw material usage. I will use an example to explain:<br />
<br />
To make a large part we need a full sheet of metal 1 metre by 1 metre. Other smaller jobs only need part of the sheet. If a smaller part is made, the remainder of the sheet is returned to stock. If we then have to make a large part, Baan looks at how much material we have. If we have two half metre square off cuts, Baan will think we have enough material. But when the operator goes to pick it he will find we do not have a full sheet and we will have to order one. As the order has already been launched, we will not be able to make the part in the lead time stated to the customer as we have to wait for material to be delivered.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to get Baan to look at what off cuts of sheet it has, rather than what it has in total?<br />
<br />
Please let me know if I have not explained very well. <br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
<br />
Rob</div></div><hr />

Then your total metal sheet inventory will be displayed as sum of all metal sheets individually . U may use variable lot features also . U need to turn on para in ilc para to specify complete issue / receipt of lot only to suite your condition.<br />
<br />
If the physical workflow at your site is such that 1 sheet can be used to manufacture more than 1 items represented in more than 1 production order and users  actually want the balance sheet returned only after all such production orders , u may either need to change user processes to suit ERP or else do some customization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Small workaround for you. <br />
<br />
When you are producing the smaller part, that time you are issuing less material at Baan system, for the remaining part which is still available at baan warehouse, post them to some virtual warehouse or some virtual location within the same warehouse through inventory transfer order and next time when you need to produce the smaller part again, that time issue the material from the virtual warehouse or virtual warehouse location; and for the bigger part always issue material from the main warehouse. <br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />
