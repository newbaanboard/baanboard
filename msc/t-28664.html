<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">23rd December 2006, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">The major extras that come with the implementation of PCS Projects depends on how you are going to create projects, i.e one project for a sales order or one project for an item in a sales order..the general steps are..<br />
Create Projects<br />
Activate Projects<br />
Create Customized Items<br />
Create Project Parts<br />
(these first four steps could be done in two steps within the Special menu of a Sales Order Line session)<br />
Maintain Customized BOMs<br />
Release PRP Production Orders to actual Production Orders<br />
Release PRP Purchase Orders to actual Purchase Orders(if applicable)<br />
Finish and Close Projects.<br />
etc to name the majority of them. <br />
On the positive side, the usage of projects could give you a better control over the proceedings in terms of stock control as well as job costing.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, you would have to map the extra project related entries in the integration sessions..<br />

   It all depends on how big the projects are going to be and what all information you need to track or on the nature of your business. Now this is just my understanding of where Baan Project is applicable. Perhaps someone else who knows a great deal about Baan Project could help you with the detailing part of it...<br />
<br />
Quoting Baan Help: <br />
&quot;BAAN Project is designed to support the management of projects through all stages, from estimating tenders to delivery and throughout the guarantee period. It is especially suited to project-driven companies for the coordination of multiple projects. The goal is cost-effective management of each project according to the time schedule, within the specified budget and to the required quality.&quot;<br />
