           I would like help on how to set equivalent part in part level, not set alternative in BOM level. I have tried using signals and alternative parts in BOM but this method not practical to have massive BOMs that have this kind of issue. Is there any other ways to resolve this so that EP can trigger and inventory can be control? Really appreciate it if anyone could provide me some direction on this. THank you.<br />
