<br />
Does anyone is aware of the exact program code (component) which calculates the production variances namely Production Efficiency, Production Price and Production Additional Office Calculation Variance (material, labour, overheads)?  It can be a program script, DAL, Function, Dll... any component.<br />
<br />
I need to understand the exact script where the variance tables whina116, whina117 and also the logging in integration tables.<br />
<br />
This is in the FTP environment.<br />
<br />
Appreciate the help on this.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
For a start, you may have already done this, but look at this Reference Guide:<br />
<br />
Infor ERP LN 6.1 Financials - Financial Integration and Reconciliation Transactions (U8967D US)<br />
<br />
Chapter 10 - Production Orders, has a section on Production Variances, with an example.<br />

<br />
Variance calculation example and the functional understanding on the calculation is clear.  Even manual calculation, it is fine. <br />
<br />
In Ln, i would like to know the script code /component which handles this calculation.  It is basically starts during the Close production orders session.  But in the background, during the closure of order, it calculates and write the data into integration tables and also in whina116,whina117, whina124 and other related tables.<br />
<br />
I checked the where used table updating the table whina116 and whina117, but could not get the right script code.  If you can share this, that would be of real help to me.<br />
