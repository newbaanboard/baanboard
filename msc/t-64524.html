<br />
I have a production order that's in &quot;completed&quot; status for a while, but there's a production warehouse order still open in it so it can't switch to &quot;closed&quot; status. When I try to delete it (the &quot;issue&quot; transaction that's still open), I get this error message:<br />
<br />
&quot;Only the Parent (Production Warehouse Orders EPP15023 340/2/1) is allowed to delete this specification. Production Warehouse Orders EPP015023 340/3/2 is not the Parent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does someone know what that message means and how to finally delete this open PWO?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
