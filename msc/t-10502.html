<br />
Every now and then we find the need to break the links through revisions, copy data, etc so that we can fix an error on the engineering side and then copy it back over (this is for items that aren't currently under ECO control). In IVb,I could turn off rev control, delete the relationship and reset the revision. We've just migrated to IVc4 and now I find that if there's BOM copy data, I can't delete the relationship and I can't delete the BOM copy data, so I have no &quot;legal&quot; way of fixing an error short of creating a new revision.<br />
<br />
Is there still a way to do this without going to GTM?<br />

Thanks,<br />
