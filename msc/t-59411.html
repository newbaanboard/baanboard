<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RickRepsher</div><div class="date">21st October 2010, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Our company is in the process of scrapping some slow moving inventory.  In the past, we created a project, and then added custom items as boms under that project so we could pick the parts.  <br />
<br />
Initially, Production Control created a project XXXYYY and added multiple custom items to the General Item Data.  For example 'XXXYYY   .1' through 'XXXYYY   .8'.  We then added the items to be scrapped in &quot;chunks&quot; of about 200 items, first to the .1, then .2, and so on.<br />
<br />
On the first day, items were entered into the first two groups.  At the start of the second day, we rolled the project costs (tipcs3250m000) so production could generate the picks to pull the parts.  Two things happened, as expected: (1) Items 'XXXYYY   .1' and 'XXXYYY   .2' now show a cost, and (2) when the project cost roll was finished, we got an error saying<br />
<br />
&quot;XXXYYY   .3 : Note: cost price of item XXXYYY   .3 is zero&quot;<br />
<br />
This error showed for items 'XXXYYY   .3' through 'XXXYYY   .8'<br />
<br />
This all makes sense... the BOM's with parts now have a cost and the ones without generated an error.<br />
<br />
The problem now is, we have entered parts into the rest of the custom items (.3 through .8) and we still get the error, and the items show no cost in GID.<br />
<br />
At first, I though that I might have to go back and run Calculate Cost And Valuation Prices (ticpr2210m000) on the items, but then I remembered that the project area of that screen is grayed out.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Let me also mention that I am a lowly IT person, who now through attrition has been stuck in the position of being the Baan &quot;go to person&quot; with only a tiny bit of knowledge of the product.  In other words... I'm pretty much lost!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">22nd October 2010, 05:22</div></div><div class="posttext">project cost can only be calculated with session tipcs3250m000.<br />
if theres error message , you can print tipcs3471m000 <br />
then check which item is shows zero cost.<br />
also make sure you use correct price calculation code which has assign to this project.<br />
whehter the price cal code is using simulated purch price, or average , or latest, this will also effect the cost price calculation result.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply.  <br />
<br />
I printed out tipcs3471m000 for the project, and as I suspected, items 'XXXYYY .3' through 'XXXYYY .8' show no items, and as a result no cost.  <br />
<br />
But... when I go into tibom1510m000 and look at (for instance) item 'XXXYYY .3', there are 'child' items in the BOM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as I understand your e-mail:<br />
<br />
You have transferred standard items to custom items to get rid of it.<br />
<br />
(1) ticpr and tibom programs are only related to standard items (without project number) and also for standard items within customized boms.<br />
<br />
(2) Your situation is: you have only customized items (manufacturing or purchase?).<br />
If the parts ...3 - ....8 are purchase items you need a purchase price in the tipcs2121m000 session. If they are customized manufacturing items you need a customized bom containg some items below (customized or standard, with costs).<br />
<br />
As quelle mentioned you have to run the &quot;tipcs&quot; programs to calculate costs for customized items.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RickRepsher</div><div class="date">29th October 2010, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently we have a date issue of some sort.  The project was created on 10/18/10.  All of the items under the first two Custom BOMs were entered the same day.  Those two rolled correctly.<br />
<br />
Today, I found out that by going through all of the items under my third custom BOM 'XXXYYY   .3', and changing their effectivity date to 10/18/10 from 10/19/10 (the day they were entered) allowed me to roll the cost.<br />
<br />
Looks like I have to through about 700 items to change their effectivity dates.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Putting Current date in the field &quot;Reference Date&quot; of Project, and on executing the session of â€˜Calculate Cost price by Project', your problem will get resolved most probably.<br />
<br />
You will be not in need to change the effective date and  will get correct cost on doing above mentioned activity.</div></div><hr />

That did it.  Thanks for the help!<br />
