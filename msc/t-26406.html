<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alex_hu</div><div class="date">15th February 2006, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to use the use up logic in Baan IV. The requirement is: the new item is going to replace the old item, but the old item still has stock. So required to use up the old item first and then MRP start to generate manufacture order for new items. <br />
I set the old manufacture item as Phantom in Item Master and BOM, but it seems it does not work. system still generate manufacture order for old items. Is there any other parameter's I should change? Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't you be able to use an alternative item attached to your 'old' item.  That way the system would use the 'old' item until the stock is depleted and then MRP would call for the alternative item (your 'new' item) for use in production?  Then once your old stock is depleted you can change your BOM's to use the new item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">15th February 2006, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">you should be able to just set your effectivity and expiry dates on the PBOM lines. Estimate when you'll run out of the current item and set the dates accordingly. MRP will plan what's needed in each timeframe. You may have to fine tune the date as it gets close, but other than that it's probably the easiest way to handle a cut-in without manually adjusting work orders</div></div><hr />

First I tried to use alternative item, but it does not work. System still generate production order for the old item.<br />
For the second solution, to estimate the time when the old item run out of stock, users can not accept it. There're so many phase out items and it's hard for them to estimated. They wish our system can automatically do it for them. <br />
I think set the old item to be a phantom item in BOM and MRP use the stock of phantom item first. When the old item is out of stock, MRP should not generate orders for phantom items. It's the logic of another ERP system, but I'm not sure it works in Baan IV. Are there any other solutions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alex_hu</div><div class="date">17th February 2006, 05:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I test the logic to use phantom flag in BOM but it does not work.<br />
First I set the old item to be a phantom item in item master and BOM.<br />
Then I create a new BOM, with the old item as the parent item of the new Item.<br />
MRP just ignore the inventory of old item, generate production order for new item directly.<br />
<br />
Now I found some information in Baanboard discussion as below:<br />
2. Item is no longer in use - substituted by another item.<br />
You can use expiry dates in BOM so that the planning will order for the current item only up to the time it is to be used. <br />
In case the change has not be foreseen and there is still inventory available for this old item and you want to consume it before ordering the new item, look at when the economic stock will fall below zero (in inventory movements) and time the effectivity date of the new item for that period. It will not be exact but it will minimize your problem. This calls for close coordination between engineering, production, and warehousing.<br />
Also, this helps solve slow to non-moving inventory problems.<br />

This can be accomplished using Phanthom Items in the BOM. Not an ideal work around, but it does get the job done. Much easier than projecting future economic stock levels.<br />

&quot;This can be accomplished using Phanthom Items in the BOM. Not an ideal work around, but it does get the job done. &quot; It seems that Phantom item does work for use up logic. I need more detail about the solution. Thanks!<br />

By the way, we're using Baan4C4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This way of using up logic should work. No need to put the phantom flag on the item level. It if sufficient to put the phantom flag on the BOM level.<br />
<br />
1. Put the old item as manufactured on the item level<br />
2. Create a new bill of material with the old item as a parent and the new item as its child<br />
3. In the existing BOM, where the old item is used, put this old item as a phantom<br />
<br />
Now MRP/MPS will used up the stock of the old item and then after the stock is used up, there will be new propositions for the new item.<br />
<br />
It would be intresting to create a small report with those items which are phantom and manufactured and used in a BOM, which have on there own a BOM. Just for cleaning up purposes later (manually)<br />
