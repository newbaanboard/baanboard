<br />
We have problem with setup of routing on one machine. That machine is circular shape and on its edge have modules (about 30 modules). That machine can to have separate work order for each module (up to 30 work orders) in one time, or for some gorop of modules can be one work order that depends how mutch same tools we have for one item.<br />
We have 3 or 4 workers on that machine and number of workers is allways same with one work order or with 30 work orders. Costs of production are not same for different numbers of work orders. My question is. What number of Man Occupation filed to set up on routing for items on that machine, or how to set up operations on that items for that machine.</div></div><hr />
