Here is what I have learned.  Rough cut material is generated from the bill of critical materials.  It uses the lead time offset (pretty sure ) to determine start and end dates on manufactured items. It is automatically calculated if you answer yes to the filed Generate Rough Material Requirements.  I am having a problem with it not recognizing the expiry or effectivity date of the items based on the planning periods.  As to why it is generating the rough cut material for your simulated plan, double check the MPS parameter settings.  Make sure your simulated plan is not listed.</div></div><hr />
