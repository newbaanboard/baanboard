Order balance is calculated by date and is updated when MRP in run. <br />
that i also know but how can you give me some logic or example so that it will be easy to understand me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">k_paga</div><div class="date">2nd September 2002, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Consider an item 'A' with inventory on hand-61.<br />
Now any Purchase orders raised for this item 'A' will be considered.<br />
If 2 Puchase orders with planned quanitity 880 and 840 are there resptly.<br />
Your display session will have the first line with Order balance as 941 which is 880 +61.<br />
The next line will have 941+ 840=1781.<br />
These are for Purchase orders.<br />
Then other lines with order balance include MPS raised Production order quantity,which will be reduced from previous total.<br />
Say an MPS Production order with quantity 5 is there,<br />
then the order balance in the next line displayed as 1781-5=1776.<br />
With reference to addition or reduction in the Order balance quantity,note that it cumulates the quantity for a single date and adds/reduces the quantity accordingly.<br />
Consider the previous qunatity obtained-1776.<br />
If you have 3 MPS production orders for the same date 6/9/02 ,with quantity 40,4,3 respectively.<br />
Now the order balance in thses 3 lines will be <br />
1776-47(40+4+3)=1729<br />
Hope this helps.:)</div></div><hr />
