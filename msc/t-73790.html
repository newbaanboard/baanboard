The time tracker only allows you to punch to active Orders and Operations.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes the team misses adding some hours on an operation so we wanted to see if it was possible to open an Operation to add the extra hours.  If so, what are the steps.</div></div><hr />

Our time keeping system allowed us to make corrections, but we still needed to open operations backup when they were completed incorrectly for one reason or the other.  We actually wrote a little API session that took the production order and operation and would go re-open it for the user, but we would not reopen backflushed operations.  I noticed that in the code (but only one site used backflushing).</div></div><hr />
