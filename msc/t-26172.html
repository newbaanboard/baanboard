Does any one know how to set-up maximum allowed task run time in BaaN IVc4? Is it possible at all?<br />
Reason: Some times users make mistakes and enter big numbers in the run time so I want to warn/block them.<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

There's no built in feature in BaanIV to limit duration of a task. Of course, you can customise either directly (if you have development license) or by your company's BaanIV Tools consultant. Another way of preventing such data entry error to become fatal is to have your accounting department monitoring the standard cost for every manufactured item. If the accounting department sees that the standard cost is abnormally high - because the task was accidentally specified to take very long time - then they should ask the product development department to have a look at the spec and see if there has been a wrong spec.<br />
