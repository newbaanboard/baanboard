How is 'Production Result', for material costs, calculated in baan IV c?</div></div><hr />

Production Result is the differenece between ACTUAL and STANDARD Costs. Estimated costs are not part of this calculation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Production Result is calculated as difference of financial value (cost price*qty) of received product and the charged actual costs. Actual costs are coming from actual hours, actual materials and surcharges.<br />
<br />
You can find differences between value of 'Estimated-Actual' and Production Result in several cases, e.g.<br />
 - produced quantity does not equal to Econ. qty. defined in item master (setup times shared to different qties during cost price calc. and prod. order calc.)<br />
- Cost Price has not been refreshed although BOM or ROU were changed<br />
- Changes in Estimated Mat. List (tisfc0110m000)<br />
- etc.<br />
<br />
In this cases, you will find non-zero Prod. Result although you did not produce any rejects and you booked only estimated quties (hours and mats.)</div></div><hr />

I am trying to filter only the Material Usage variance from the Production Result transaction but I have few closed work orders where these does not tie-up.    Here is what I am doing:<br />
<br />
A. Standard Material Cost = Material Cost (from Item Master) x Quantity Delivered on the production order<br />
B. Actual Material Cost = Total dollar of all Material Issues to the production order<br />
<br />
Material Usage Variance = A - B.<br />
<br />
In certain cases, this Material Usage Variance does not tie to the Production(SFC)/Production Result entries that are posted in the integrations.<br />

<br />
It is better to get the Standard cost from ticpr300. Because<br />
1) Material Surcharges may be part of Standard Cost but not part of the material cost used while posting integrations to that account.<br />
2) If there was a Standard Cost roll after the order was closed you will have a different standard cost that was posted while closing the order.<br />
<br />
The reports ticst0401m000,ticst0402m000,ticst1401m000,ticst1402m000 might of good help too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pergerp</div><div class="date">9th September 2004, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Ram,<br />
look on integration lines (tfgld4510m000) of those closed production orders and<br />
 - check calculation by integration lines and you can see which cost prices were applied, by transactions.<br />
 - check if you had &quot;Revaluation&quot; lines; these can modify production result.<br />
 - you can check formula, by Cost Components:<br />
   Receipt - Issue + Reval.(+/-). = Prod Result<br />
<br />
Note that Revaluation can be appied on received and issued materials as well.</div></div><hr />
