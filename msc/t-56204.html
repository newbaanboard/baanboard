<br />
Please help me to understand, how system calculates MAUC while issue an item. <br />
<br />
For example , I have an Item A and latest MAUC is 10.<br />
<br />
At the time of issue it should pick latest MAUC which is 10 but it is picking some other amount, please help me to understand how system picks MAUC at the time of issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
While issue, that means it is going to have a outbound process, so it depends on the outbound method defined in your item warehousing subentity data, by which it will pick the price. Outbound method can be lifo, fifo, or mauc too.<br />
So check on that aspect.<br />
<br />
By latest mauc i assume it should be LIFO method defined.<br />
<br />

Thanks for reply, <br />
<br />
We have defined MAUC as Inventory valuation Method in Item Data by warehouse for all items.<br />
<br />
For outbound priority we have defined as FIFO for all Items, actually it is for material issue, based on inventory date system issue material.<br />
<br />
System is picking latest MAUC for all items but few items it's taking some other value instead of Latest Mauc. Parameters are same for all items. <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
