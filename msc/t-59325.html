<br />
I am using BaanIV.<br />
<br />
After generate MRP, it will create including planned MRP Purchase Orders &amp; Production Orders. Then we basically transfer &amp; confirm those planned orders accordingly to actual order. <br />
<br />
But what about those warehouse order type in table timrp010 in timrp1511m000 (Display Planned Inventory Movements by Order) after the generate MRP.<br />
There is no such session to transfer &amp; confirm it.<br />
Will the warehouse order be gone once production issue is done?<br />
Which session or how to check which production issue will use that warehouse order?<br />
<br />
I encountered some of the warehouse orders in the timrp010, also appear in table tdinv150 and tdinv700 were not deleted after the production issue is done, why?<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How does it works?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

The table timrp010 contains all the open order. OPen order here means order that are present in planning side, order that are actual and have beend transferred to execution module like sales, purchase, production etc.. The order type will tell what kind of order it is. The table tdinv700 contains only the order that have affected the actual inventory e.g. if material is issued to production order then one can find that issue transaction in tdinv700. <br />
The table tdinv150 contains only planned order that are present in excecution model,hence it will not show MRP/MPS/SIC orders.<br />
