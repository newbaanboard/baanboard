<br />
My question is when you set &quot;by work center&quot; on Company Calendar Type in ROU Parameter.  Do you need to set Calendar for all the work centers, include sub-work centers?<br />
<br />
Currently, I am using &quot;By Company&quot; but different Warehouses have their different working time.  Since work centers are not linking to warehouse, there will be a lot of maintain if I switch to by work center.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Question...:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
In B5, each warehouse may have its own calendar. But I don't think that's the case with your installed B4, huh? Sorry couldn't be of much help this time<br />

To ease your pain the calendar can be copied from one workcenter to another (with another restriction: only one week of workcenter A can be copied to a range of week of workcenter B).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

hi Question,<br />
<br />
you speak of workcenters and warehouses.........those are VERY different entities (even in BIV)<br />
<br />
No calendars by warehouse......<br />
<br />
<br />
To save a lot of time in defining Calendars by WC, I would use an exchange scheme .....<br />
You can simply create your import ascii-file in Excel</div></div><hr />
