when we close project,finance cogs and project cost has big variance,<br />
finance cogs:Project (PCS)/COGS (General) +Sales Invoicing (Sales)/COGS from wip<br />
project cost: calculate cost prices by project.<br />
some time maybe baan system error,variance is very big,but almost projects had<br />
variance, finance people had to adjust manually.<br />
i analyze some project with wip transactions,find Project (PCS)/COGS (General)/M01 was abnormal ,it was auto integrated to finance when close project. can anybody tell me what the calculation logic about this transaction?<br />
thank you!</div></div><hr />

  Please you ry to check the time line of the production processes (Issue / Hour processes) I got experiences as the user they completed the last operation as final Level of the FG then we back to issues material as the perivous level production Orders. Then if the processes done before FG shipment the Variance will post th Inventory. but if the processes done after FG shiped the varience will booking to Interim and post to Project varience at the close projects.</div></div><hr />
