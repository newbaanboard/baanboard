<br />
does anybody know how the field effective date in production order was filled and what dependencies exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your help is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The system needs BOM and routing to create production order. Upon creation of production order, It will take whatever BOM and routing that happen to be active on the effective date of the production order (for the specified end item). By manipulating effective date, you can manufacture end item not only according to the latest specification (by leaving the effective date=current date), but also to past specification (by setting the effective date to a date in the past when certain specification was active).<br />
<br />
The production order effective date (in BaanIV, or reference date as it is called in BaanERP) initially defaults to current date.<br />

<br />
thank you for the informations. Now I have another question about the filing of the field effective date. <br />
<br />
when i create a production order out of an mrp-orderproposal with backwardplanning the effectiv date is set to the planned delivery date of the production order, if i do the same with forwardplanning the effictiv date is set to the startdate of the production order. is this baan-standard proceeding? is it possible to change the logik over an baan-parameter? <br />
<br />
thank you for your help!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bhaskar Reddy</div><div class="date">14th July 2003, 05:38</div></div><div class="posttext">If the planning method is forward then  the effective date of the production order is taken as start date of the production order. The same is applicable if the order is transferred .<br />
<br />
If the planning method is backward then on transfer of the planned order to production the effective date will be the delivery date of the production order.<br />
The reason being that the operation have to be planned backward so the system checks for the routing operations that are effective on the planned delivery date and uses on those routing for the production order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 05:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, Bhaskar Reddy.<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention that the effective date field can also be filled up automatically, if the production order were transferred from MRP. Thanks for adding the info<br />

Hi Everyone<br />
<br />
We found this logic does not work sometime. In our case, we always found strange reference date which is maybe several months ago, nor equals to start date or delivery date.<br />
<br />
It is very confusing. Is the baan EP not stalbe?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddy G</div><div class="date">14th December 2006, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course EP is as stable as a rock...<br />
<br />
The logic to determine the Reference Date is:<br />
 - for Project Items: the Project Reference Date.<br />
 - for Configured Items: the configuration date of the Product Variant.<br />
 - for others, depending on the planning method of the Planned Order:<br />
<br />
 Forward: Planned Start Date of the Planned Order<br />
 Backward: Planned Finish Date of the Planned Order<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you...<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Eddy</div></div><hr />
