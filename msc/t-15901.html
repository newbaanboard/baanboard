<br />
I don't know the details, but can send them to you on request.<br />

It has a functionality for defining single item with multiple attributes. Here item can be defined in terms of length and inventory can be viewed along with specification.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maverick4u</div><div class="date">5th August 2004, 09:14</div></div><div class="posttext">As nilesh said it is a product suitable for cable industry.Baan Cable(Proloq)<br />
is a soln. based on baan4 and developed for industries that deal with items<br />
with a lenght nature.In the software such items are called as dimension items.<br />
<br />
The software is completly integrated with the Baan Packages(ti and td).Also<br />
you have the facility to use both baan MRP and Cable MRP to explode actual<br />
orders.<br />
<br />
Our company has been successfully using the solution for the past 8 years ,<br />
the only drawback is...no version upgrades are possible. We were planning<br />
to go on baan5 a few months back but since the solution is only available in <br />
4c4 and SSA global has no plans to come up with the soln. for Baan5 and <br />
Gemini we dropped the idea. Now we lookin for alternate ERP's. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddy G</div><div class="date">16th August 2004, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed there is some unclarity about the future of BaanIV Cable. But SSA will continue to support this application. We still maintain it (to give an example: SSA just launched a webclient, this webclient is also made available for the Cable customers)<br />
W still sell it, we still implement it and we also customize it, if needed.<br />
In general: it is an active product for SSA as we have more active products/extensions on BaanIV.<br />
<br />
On the other hand it is true that we at the moment don't have a Baan5 version nor a SSA ERP LN 6 version of the Cable extension. It is the SSA strategy only to build and upgrade products / extensions in case there is a solid business case. This general rules also applies for the Cable extension. Based on requests from a couple of customers and prospects we now are investigating the feasibility of an upgrade of the Cable extension to the ERP LN 6 release. Both in financial and conceptual terms. Honestly, the future of this extension is better then 1 -2 years ago.<br />
So please contact me (alassche@baan.com, I am the Director of the Dimensions&amp;Cable competence center) (or via your SSA contact), then we can have a discussion about your specific situation. I am wiling to discuss your needs and how it fits in our plans and also how we can incorporate your situation in this business case analyses.<br />
