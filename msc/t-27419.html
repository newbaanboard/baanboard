<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ianmerlane</div><div class="date">22nd June 2006, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm working for client rolling out BaanIV who is interested in implementing BaanIV Project (TP). What are the major differences (or advantages) between TP and PCS and is there a substantial overhead in implementing (and using) TP? I cannot find too many details on TP and who is using it. Is there an interface between TP and Microsoft Project?<br />
Any help on this matter would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">30th June 2006, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">PCS is mostly the make to order solution. It is linked to manufacturing and the PCS item can be tracked from start to finish.<br />
TP is used to manage a project. The project plan can be managed from budget to closure. If an item needs to be manufactured you can link the PCS project as well.<br />
TP projects module is much more complex than the PCS solution as it has more functionality.<br />
There is a standard interface between TP projects and MS Projects.</div></div><hr />
