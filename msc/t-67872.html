I'd like to confirm on how do i go around a problem i have. I can't delete a line that has been received. Besides deleting the entire PO, is there a work around for this? Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes that is possible in LN. What you need to do is, go to Purchase Order Parameters (tdpur0100m400) session. Under Parameter 2 tab, there is a field called Delete Order Data if Received Completely. Set it to &quot;Order Line&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, run the session Delete Purchase Orders(tdpur4224m000) for your Order.<br />
<br />
Please Note - <br />
<br />
1. Run the delete purchase orders session only if it has one line <br />
2. If it has multiple lines, run the session only if you want to delete all the lines which are fully received.<br />
3. The Purchase Order Line should be fully received<br />
4. Once done, revert the changes in Parameters to how it was.<br />
5. There is no warning message, so make sure you give proper selection.<br />
6. Simulate it on your Test Environment before running it in Production.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is what the business process is:<br />
- Run the session Maintain Backorders (tdpur4130m000) and make the remaining order quantity (the Back Order Quantity) to zero.<br />
<br />
This will 'functionally' close out the Purchase Order.<br />
<br />
After that, if the balance quantity is still required, the option is to add another line to the same purchase order or to create a new purchase order.<br />
<br />
The old order remains in the system as reference for the quantity that was received.</div></div><hr />
