<br />
I am beginning to understand the palnning module (MPS/MRP) in baan4, but i am having a very difficult time to understand it.<br />
<br />
So as a head start wanted to understand what is the generic flow/algorithm of calculating MPS/MRP Orders in baan4. <br />
I see so many table fields in Item Master (Order Method,Order Lead Time,Safety Time,Order Interval) &amp; Plan Items Session that influence MPS/MRP Orders , but dont know how and what exactly is the purpose of each field. <br />
<br />
Any document will be highly appreciable in resolving our MPS issues.<br />
I have also checked old threads, but couldnt find any for my purpose.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

If you read Oliver Wright book it will defintely help in understanding it. In later version of Baan the planning got more involved and has become very Baan specific. While Baan IV is still very close to textbook.<br />
