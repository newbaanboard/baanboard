<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sigit Taylor</div><div class="date">20th November 2006, 09:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Friends,<br />
I have problem in Module Shop Floor Control.<br />
We used BaaN 5.0c serveice pack 14.<br />
<br />
We have a product that can contain different material. For example: the product is A.<br />
<br />
A can be made by using item B with routing 10: Assembling Process<br />
A can also be made by using item C with routing 20: COS Process.<br />
<br />
B contain : X, Y, Z<br />
C contain : P, Q, X, Z <br />
<br />
Our problem is:<br />
When we create production order product A with routing 10: Assembling process. We have to change QTY needed for C = 0 pcs in BOM. And than calculate it.<br />
If we want to produce product A routing 20: COS Process that contain child item C. We have to change QTY needed for B = 0 pcs.<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
We will input QTY B and C = 1 pcs in BOM.<br />
How to set the linking of Routing and BOM?<br />
if we choose routing 10 when create production order means that we will produce product A with child item B, and chose routing 20 with child item C.<br />
<br />
Please help me about this flexiblity.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much. <br />
Best Regards,<br />
<br />

<br />
from production bills of material, you can zoom to Material routing relations (tibom0140m000) through specific menu. Here you can attach perticular BOM item to specific routing and routing operation. Read also the session help.<br />
<br />
May be this would help...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have set it to link material (chile item) to  product (parent item) for specific routing.<br />
But, after create production order and then release it, all the material appear not only material for routing I have filled in production order but also other material.<br />
<br />
Thank yo very much for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nidyar</div><div class="date">23rd November 2006, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I am afraid whether you have a standard functionality in BaaN for alternate BOM like alternate routings. However try if you could use the field expiry date if your sub-level items are seasonal. Or you may have to delete the irrelevent items from the estimated materials sessions before you release the order. Also you can maintain all the material in BOM and while entering the actual consumption, make the quantity zero for the irrelevent material.<br />
These are all the options I can see. May be you can put up the requirement of alternate BOM with SSA.</div></div><hr />

I think we can use PCF to configure:<br />
- Product / Item Code<br />
- Product itself by having different options and<br />
- Routing of an Item<br />
Have tried PCF for configuring your routing? I think this should solve your problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am having the same problem.  I need alternative BOM depending on the alternative Routing that is selected.<br />
<br />
Have you find a solution ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">20th April 2012, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Im using FP7, we can use unit effectivity for your problem.<br />
<br />
In Baan 5, im afraid you can not combine those 2 things (bom and routing). but i think you can do this:<br />
<br />
1. Use Engineering Data Management.<br />
Create Revision 1 which is using C<br />
and Revision 2 which is using B<br />
Still the latest revision is used to calculate the standard cost price (revision 2).<br />
<br />
2. Create Alternative Routing <br />
<br />
Standard Routing will use Operation 10 = Assembly process<br />
Alternative routing will use Operation 20 = COS Process.<br />
<br />
Still the standard routing  is used to calculate the standard cost price (Assembly Process).<br />
<br />
3. Everytime Create Production Order, system will be by default taking the standard cost price option (Material B and Assembly Process).<br />
<br />
So you can choose Revision 1 and then select Alternative  Routing.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As per Nidyar, it's true, there's no such alternate BOM like alternate routing in Baan V, you can have the flexibility to use unit effectivity from LN onwards. You need to maintain the material routing relationship here and further need to delete the extra material from estimated material line at production order before release the order.<br />
