Ver: BaaN VC<br />
<br />
After Master Planning When the session is run to transfer the Confirmed Planned Orders, System gives an error Report saying<br />
<br />
&quot; Operation 60 of Item AP39 is not within the Resource's Operation Horizon, Transfer Not Possible&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried with various horizon with the max number also!! in the session Resources cprpd2500m000 and also followed by Rebuild Resource session. ( even tried deleting the operation, but the error switched to Operation 50 :) )<br />
<br />
Has anyone comeacross this error while Transferring Planned Orders from Master Plan to SFC, If so Pl suggest the procedure to overcome this .....<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I struggled with this issue.  First, make certain that each task and work center within the routing for the planned production order you are transferring has a production time associated with it.  In other words, don't have zero as a production time in either the task or workcenter.  Let me know if this corrects it...</div></div><hr />
