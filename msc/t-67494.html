<br />
We have set up man occupancy as one against a work centre and our manufacturing times are within the routing of our assemblies.<br />
<br />
However Baan seems to generate planned start dates all on the same date even though man occupancy is set to one. <br />
<br />
Is there something we are overlooking?<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
<br />
We are using Baan 4C4</div></div><hr />

So you have to check all these set up details for one test item and check all the above details to arrive at the desired data.<br />
If you are facing some specific problem, then please mention those specific details.</div></div><hr />
