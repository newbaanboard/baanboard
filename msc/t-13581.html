<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question regarding Baan5 and forecast consumption. <br />
<br />
Lets say I have item A that I have a forecast for this month = 100 units. I have 4 weekly buckets, and I divide my forecast equally among the weeks, giving me 4 weekly forecasts of 25 units per week. My forecast time fence is 0. My capacity is 25 per week.<br />
<br />
During week 1, there are 0 sales, but the system will plan for 25 based on the forecast. During week 2, there are also no sales, and the system will not tell me to build any because I have 25 in stock already, enough to cover this week's forecast of 25 units. Week 3 is the same, 0 sales, and 0 produciton requirements becasue I have 25 in stock, enough to cover this week's demand.<br />
<br />
Now, in week 4, a customer orders 75 units, and I do not have enough capacity to meet demand. <br />
<br />
How can I get the system to drive all of the forecast requirements each week even if there is no customer demand? We keep getting stuck in this situation, where all of the demand comes in at the end of the month, and I have not built enough inventory</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Jerry said, you might want to increase the safety stock to handle sudden big order at the end of the month.<br />
<br />
Another way is, you might want to set the forecast consumption day, in Scenarios (cprpd4500m000) - forecast tab.<br />
The information here determines how the system will calculate the forecast as a demand. You can experiment with it until you have desired number.<br />
<br />
You can also make use of inventory plan. The system will generate production advice to keep the inventory plan to a determined level. But again, you must supply the figure.<br />
<br />
I think if you set the forecast time fence other than 0, the system would ignore the forecast until the time fence date, thus not giving any production advice at all if the forecast fall before the time fence date. Do correct me if I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
When you've tried it, please Let me know the outcomes. Hope it helps.<br />

Hi Hendra,<br />
<br />
May I know if the setting forecast consumption can be set at plan item level or cluster level ?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
