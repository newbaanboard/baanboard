<br />
Our current system configuration calculates a production orders start date by using the production rate per hour and the work centre hr/day values. So if we enter a large sales order for delivery on 31st March, the system calculates the start date as 23rd March. My planners want to run so that:<br />
The production order start and end dates will always be the same as the sales order due date i.e. they want to run with infinite capacity. <br />
<br />
Is this possible and what fields can I amend? The only way so far I have found to do this is the amend the production rate per hour to 9999999 - however, this is changes the standard cost of the item - a definate no no!<br />
I have also increased the work centre hr/day to 99.99 but we have low run rates and large orders so that the start date is still changed.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something obvious!<br />
<br />
Thanking you in advance.</div></div><hr />

1)detail plan. ==&gt;the way just you are used.<br />
2)rough plan.==&gt;only use the LT to calculate.<br />
<br />
You can set the WO(Fishish production LT time as Zero). so, when the system use the rought plan, it will only set 0 days ahead. (the same day as your entry date)<br />
<br />
then, how can the system use the rough plan way other than detail plan way. there is a parameter you can use.<br />
in the item plan data, cprpd100m000, the Fixed LT of SFC. this value control which plan way to use, to use the detail plan way(user production rate and order qty to calculate )or rough plan way(just read the LT to set start date).</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, we are using Baan IV and the screen you mentioned does not exist in our version or we do not have the necesasary module?? <br />
As a workaround, I have set all work centre capacity hrs/day to 99.9. I have also set the max. order qty to the almost equal the maximum capacity possible per day. This way, although more production orders are created, they will all start and end on the due date of the sales order. I would be grateful if someone could come up with a way to only produce 1 production order.<br />

Thanks again</div></div><hr />
