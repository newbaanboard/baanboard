<br />
I have a parent item with many child items. Some have Item Type=manufactured while others have Item Type=purchased.<br />
<br />
Manufactured Items are available for backflushing in their respective WIP WHs. Purchased Items are available for backflushing in their respective Raw Material WHs.<br />
<br />
When I report production order complete for the Parent Item, I want the manufactured child items to be backflushed from their respective WIP WHs and the Purchased child items to be backflushed from their respective Raw Material WHs.<br />
<br />
How to do this ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The manufactured child item which is a component of your parent item should have &quot;blackfush if material&quot; checked as well as &quot;blackfush material&quot; checked.<br />
<br />
The above setting will allow you to process your scenario.<br />

Otherwise, as you are aware that Baan will backflush from the BOM and thats get deafulted to estimated material. If nothing works then a small customization can help- change the warehouse in Estimated BOM .<br />

Wish things were as simple !<br />
As far as I know, BaaN will backflush from any one WH. If the child items are available in several different WHs, I have to carry out Inventory transfers to bring all the required material to that WH, which BaaN uses for bachflushing the child items. I don't want to do this ( Parent has about 2500 child items, mass production, daily production order reporting, short supply of child items, rejections... can you imagine the muck I am in ? )</div></div><hr />

You are right that I have multiple WIP WHs. What customization ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you say you have multiple wip warehouse. By that do you mean those warehouse are of type WIP in baan.<br />
<br />
How many work centers do you have for production purpose.<br />
Hopefully u shd know that for a particular work center you can have only one work center for sourcing your intermediate products. As far as i see there should not be any problem for backflusing from your WIP warehouse.<br />
<br />
Bring all your concerned raw materials and components for sourcing to ur wip warehouse...for this there are various methods which are out of the context.<br />
So basically u ned to set up a replishment type , pull system.<br />
And then backflushing can take place from a particular source warehouse..<br />
Of what I understand a single type of material say type A can only be sourced frm a single warehouse, not from a multiple warehouse.<br />
<br />
If the replishment system for your WIP is properly setup, I see no problem.<br />
<br />
In LN6.1 for backflushing one needs to also check direct proc from warehouse order line. which automatically process your outbound frm source warehouse. I am not aware of the same setup in baan4c. Please also investigate regarding the same.<br />

1. Yes, WHs are of type WIP.<br />
<br />
2. We have approximately 150 work centres<br />
<br />
3. &quot;Hopefully u shd know that for a particular work center you can have only one work center for sourcing your intermediate products..&quot; -&gt; I didn't understand this statement :-)<br />
<br />
4. &quot;As far as i see there should not be any problem for backflusing from your WIP warehouse.&quot;.-&gt; If I want to backflush from any one WH, there is no problem. But when I want to backflush different child items from different WHs to account for consumption of child items of the same parent, I don't know how to do it.<br />
<br />
5. &quot;If the replishment system for your WIP is properly setup, I see no problem..&quot; -&gt; How to do this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">priyanko</div><div class="date">1st April 2009, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">3. Sorry it was a typo.  &quot;Hopefully u shd know that for a particular work center, there can be only one WIP warehouse&quot;.<br />
<br />
4. different child items from different warehouse can be backflushed...<br />
but same child item present in different warehouse and then u wanna source and backflsuh same child item frm diff warehouse will be a problem.<br />
<br />
The setup is very simple. you gotta tell me how u are setting up the routing lines, and production planning lines.<br />
<br />
5. to answer for the replishment system, I gotta understand the full scenario.<br />
<br />
you can mail me directly at priyankodutta@gmail.com</div></div><hr />
