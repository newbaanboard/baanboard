They also said that this is so Planning Dept can view and plan around what is coming back to the company.<br />
They said that they canâ€™t view the non-nettable warehouses in their MPS reports, so they need to use the nettable warehouses (FGS, QA, RIP) so their report pulls what is coming back.<br />
My question is if there is another way to accomplish what they are needing without placing inventory into a FGS whse and then pulling it out which causes several inventory timing issues if things do not get pulled out as planned?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the reqmt is tat some reports is not taking the data, then that report can be changed. On the other hand,nettable warehouse is from planning perspecive and if the plamning wants to see all the warehouses then question is why you have non-nettable warehouse at all in ur set up?<br />
