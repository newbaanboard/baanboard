<br />
I have never used the 866, however I will try to make a couple of points.<br />
<br />
First of all, the 866 is a Supply Chain Transaction.  Since you are using the 866, I can guess that you are running one of the Supply Chain Flavors of 1Vc4.<br />
<br />
With that being said, I currently run NAS0.  Within that flavor, MRP cannot read any Supply Chain Schedules period.  Only MPS can do that.<br />
<br />
In addition, a Production Sequence usually only specifies either the order in which product is loaded onto a truck, or the order in which shipments must take place.  The 830 (Sales Schedule) and 862 (shipping schedule) control the requirements themselves.  I don't believe that MPS has any need to read the 866  Production Sequence Schedules.<br />
<br />
Again, this is only a perception not based on actual experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hsaenz</div><div class="date">24th July 2008, 19:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your response.  I have resolved the issue.  There is a parameter on the Supply Chain Sales Contract form 5 that allows this.  MRP does pick up SalesSchedules, Production Sequence Schedules, and Shipping Schedules and plans for them.  If a Shipping Schedule exists it uses that otherwise it will roll up to the Sales Schedule.  Same logic applies to the Production Sequence.  The 866 is not only a sequence scheduler it also carries demand just like the 862 and 830 transactions.  I attached 3 sample screen shots that show the 830, 862, and 830 demand being driven by MRP.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
We have similar problem. In our case, we just want MRP to plan sales schedules and give us planned production orders. I see sales schedules in planed inventory (tdinv150) but could not succeed on MRP side. MRP does not take sales schedules into calculation no matter what we do. (Also in script of timrp5000 function I see sales schedules are ignored and we're using BaanIV)<br />
<br />
By the date of topic, I know it's hard to get any response but I want to try my luck out.</div></div><hr />
