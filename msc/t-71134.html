<br />
I am looking for a comprehensive variance report for price and efficiency as well as add'n calc office variances. I have a query right now but it doesn't total the so-called variances for the particular order I'm focused on. We often have a lot of re-work and labour / subcontract in our BOM's , so they are rather complicated.<br />
<br />
I have all the data that I need from LN but I don't know how to identify Price and efficiency variances by cost component. Does anyone know what populates tables [Whina116] and [Whina117]? <br />
<br />
I currently am working with [cst300], [cst001] and [cst002], but can't reconcile to those numbers.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />
