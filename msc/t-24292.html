<br />
   We are running on BaaN IV c4, however upto now we have not implemented MRP, reason because we have been told that we cannot plan for 3 shifts in a day since BaaN takes into account days(time fence) rather than hours. Is this true and if so, how are other cos. with three shifts uses MRP and MPS?<br />
<br />
    We are also looking at implementing hours of accounting in BaaN IV C4, we have ILC and Lot implemented. At the moment we are backflushing the hours. Appreciate to know what implications this is going to have on the Finance and what needs to be done.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who told you that Baan's MRP cannot be run on a 3 shifts company?<br />
And what do you mean by baan takes into account days (time fence) and not hours?<br />
<br />
As far as I know it, you can set the calendar to 3 shifts because the production orders take the dates from calendar module.<br />
So if you want to do a 3-shifts planning, then you must set your calendar accordingly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
            Can you please expound on your point on calenders, which calenders are you refering to in BaaN Iv C4.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am referring to the CCP module. Not so sure where it is in baan4, just search for the module by its session name ccp*****m000<br />
<br />
In that session, you can define the availability time and the working hours for each availability.<br />
Then you link this availability to either department or work center. The dept or WC then will take the hours defines in the calendar as its working hours.<br />
<br />
So in your case, define one availability code, say 24hr. Then define working hours 00:00 - 24:00 for that code.<br />
Next, link that code to the WC or Dept and you're done.</div></div><hr />

What it has was something much simpler. But anyhow, it should still be able to allocate resource correctly for companies running 24 hour a day non stop. By the way, Abuibra, have you tried simulating this on test company and found that it can't handle your requirements or you're just taking other people's words for it? If you have tried yourself, which particular feature did you find lacking?<br />

<br />
           With regard to testing it, no I haven't done it, however, my question is how do you allocate resources correctly for companies running 24 hour a day non stop like hours. I will appreciate Paul if you can give me a little bit of hint/direction so that I can start testing it.<br />

The MRP provides more benefit than just hours accounting. I assume that you are a manufacturing company which has to manage the inventory of raw materials and manufactured items. How do you do this without an MRP run?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I suggest to setup a company calendar by work center, adjust capacities and maintain proper operations and routing. The result should give you an idea what can be accomplished. Even if it might not perfectly meet your needs, I'm pretty sure that the additional benefits will be worth the effort.<br />
<br />
By the way: we run a 24 hour production and the MRP on a daily basis. It's not a big deal and we are happy with it  :) .<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

            I have never seen any calender in baan iv c4.<br />

See Manufacturing &gt; Routing &gt; Company Calendar. This menu contains all the sessions you'll need. Don't forget to maintain the ROU parameters (tirou0100m000).<br />

             Why when I set the critical capcity to Machine capacity, it doesn't allow me to have 3 shifts while it does for Man capacity.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">24th June 2005, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Abuibra,<br />
Don't be confused by the number of shifts. This is only applicable for man capacity. In your case the capacity is maintained in capacity unit [h/week] and [h/day], also see hardcopy from our system.<br />

<br />
                   An issue has been raised regarding MPS handling 3 shifts instead it takes the whole day. An explanation for this please..?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">29th June 2005, 02:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to add more explanation on the above question, does MPS allows you to forecast across 3 shifts rather a whole day?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">29th June 2005, 08:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Abuibra,<br />
The MRP and MPS calculation will always lead to allocated hours. It's up to the user to break it down into shifts. I've attached a sample capacity overview for a machine which usually runs in 3 shifts. According to the actual utilization calculated by the MRP, which is roughly 50 hours in week 27, we'll certainly run 2 shifts instead of 3 (1 shift = 8 hours). The gap of 30 hours will be filled up with orders from a similar work center.<br />

<br />
MPS doesn't allow you to forecast on 3 shifts. The smallest time bucket to forecast is one day. But the mechanism for calculating resources is the same as with MRP.<br />
