<br />
We are on BaaN IV C4, SP9, Lot &amp; Location Control Implemented<br />
<br />
             When we close Production Orders, we first get the message :<br />
<br />
1. &quot;Not all materials have been issued&quot;. When we correct this by making the subsequent delivery to &quot;Zero&quot;, we get the following <br />
<br />
2. &quot;Inbound advice not completley released&quot;. How do we solve this?<br />
<br />
      And can any one enlighten me on why do we get the first message &quot;Not all materials have been issued&quot;, for most of our production orders whenever we close Production orders. And how do we avoid it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a common problem for many in the past that are using LOC and LOT. Much of the problem is down to W/house procedures. Against the SFO is default locations where the materials are to be Backflushed from. If the materials are located in another w/house for instance then the materials can not be issued. As the previous e-mail suggested, take a look at the planned transactions, because that way you will identify the location issues.<br />
Also be careful, because you can distort the actual Stock-on-hand by not consuming the materials actually used.<br />

<br />
     I have taken a look at both the two sessions and all the orders are missing. is there any reason for this since we are using the bar code system.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">2nd September 2003, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">run generate inbound advice for all the production orders. <br />
in session tdilc4203m000<br />
( you may get No data within selection.. perfect.)<br />
if u get data then run delete inbound tdilc4213m000 to delete the inbound generated)<br />
<br />
Actually this problem is with tdilc402. Doing the above changes the recieved qnty 0 and shifts it to advised. <br />
<br />
Now you should be able to close the production orders<br />
<br />
Usually this problem will occur because Baan allows us to issue inventory out of reciept location. so the order steps are not fully completed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
     Unfortunately, we have too many orders to do(close) for the processes given above, is there an easier way of doing it in Baan IV C4?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">did u mean to many materials to be inbounded? <br />
<br />
Well in that case.. simply run Generate inbound for the complete range. ( or make a job out of it). It can take time but I know for sure that this is the only way out if we want to close the production orders</div></div><hr />

<br />
       Its the error &quot;Not all materials have been issued &quot; which i would like to fix since we have to go line by line to zero the subsequent delivery.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
