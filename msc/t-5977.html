Solution could be to use count points or set update method for previous operations to none. In this case when you use the session Report Production Order Complete you can not Extra Complete any qty specified at the count point or if parameter set, any operation in the session Report Operations Complete. <br />
Backflushing will issue qty needed for qty completed and can not be restricted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are working BaanIVc4. Is it possible to stop or keep a control on the inventory before posting it to the finished good warehouse.<br />
ie., if the material is not issued in stores (in the system) but physically given for production, is it possible to keep a control, saying that before the completion of all the material has to be issued or punched in the system,  and then only products can be posted to the finished warehouse through the session Report production orders complted. <br />
<br />

Std functionality allowes posting of finished good to the warehouse without issuing any raw materials. <br />
The advantage of this is that the sales delivery is not dependent on the accuracy or delay of entering info of the warehouse issue department. This means delivery can take place and is not linked to your issue business process that could happen at the end of the day in bulk or waiting for possible errors to be cleared up before accurate info can be entered.</div></div><hr />
