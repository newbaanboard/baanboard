<br />
Planned orders are creating as order type &quot;Planned distribution order&quot; for a released BOM. It should be &quot;Planned purchase order&quot;. We checked default supply source in Item planning data and it is &quot;Production/purchase&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can anyone pl. help and revert what could be the possible reason.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ashish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ashishj</div><div class="date">17th December 2014, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I also checked purchase order already created for standard item A. I am not sure weather this could be a reason for system to generate Planned distribution order for the customized item B(Derived from standard A).<br />

Use items general to unlink the derived from item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ashishj</div><div class="date">19th December 2014, 08:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks for the reply. It works fine in this particular requirement. I also want to know the further implication of option &quot;unlink the derived from item&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once custom item has been unlinked then can we use item again for engineering in near future?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">searocket</div><div class="date">23rd December 2014, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Once the item is unlinked it behaves like an independent item.<br />
As long as the PCS project is open the item can be re-used - though it is usual for the item to be customer specific.<br />
We would tend to treat the item as a one-off order, and if the customer wants a repeat we would create another PCS project.<br />
The PCS project should be closed in a reasonably timely fashion to keep the finance side in good order.<br />
hope that helps<br />
