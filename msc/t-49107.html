WeE do not want this 'kit of parts' to be part of the BOM of the item to be repaired, as more often than not it is not required to perform the repair.<br />

I've considered writing a custom session where the user can enter a production order and the phantom, the session will break through the phantom and add the components as Estimated Materials. However I would rather the standard system handle this for me.<br />

When you create a rework order system by default put the parent item number in the estimated BOM and it ignores the BOM completely.  <br />
<br />
From your question I am not clear on if you are creating a production order for phantom item or for item to be repaired?<br />

<br />
I believe phanton item should work just like you've understood. It will break the phantom item and take the components under it.<br />
All you need to do is add the phantom item to the Estimated Materials after you created the rework production order.<br />
<br />
Just make sure that in the Item Production Data you untick the option &quot;Use Phantom Inventory&quot;. However if you don't have any inventory for that phantom item, system should also break it through to its components. It should be the standard functionality.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the replies.<br />
<br />
Hendra: I can't find the field &quot;Use Phantom Inventory&quot; anywhere in Item Data, we're on IVc4, is this an addition in later versions perhaps?<br />
<br />
Arvind: The production order is for another manufactured item, not the phantom. To clarify see the example below.<br />
<br />
Manufactured item &quot;M&quot; is to be reworked. It needs to be on a rework order so that it consumes itself.<br />
<br />
During rework, a predetermined kit of parts &quot;K&quot; whose BOM contains components &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; is used and is added to Estimated Materials.<br />
<br />
Entering &quot;K&quot; on Maintain Estimated Materials creates a shortage for &quot;K&quot; even if it is defined as a Phantom item, rather than breaking through and consuming &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; &amp; &quot;C&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps clarify our problem and somebody can suggest a way around it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />

There is no standard way of doing so in Baan  IV. You can add the components directly to estimated material as oppose to creating a production order for phatom. You would probably need to customize it, but I guess you can come up with some ways of customizing it without much effort. <br />
