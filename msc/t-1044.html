Im wondering how to set this up in Baan in terms of planning and manufacturing....<br />
<br />
For this example, I will use item A. Item A is typically built in plant 1, but when plant 1 is shutdown, we will build it in plant 2. <br />
<br />
Currently this is handled by enering sales orders in one Baan company until the plant is down, then we enter sales orders in the other company. This drives demand in each company seperately. <br />
<br />
Im wondering how to handle this in Baan if we move to one company. Item A can only have one BOM, and so even if we changed the shipping warehouse on the sales order from plant 1 to plant 2 when we reach capacity, when we create a production order for item A, the system will want to pull the components from plant 1, because that is the warehouse on the BOM for each of the components of item A. <br />
<br />
Also, when we hold item A in inventory in Plant 2, but we get an order for plant 1, the system will not tell us to build because it sees these as both nettable warehouses, yet these two plants are in different countries so we actually do want to build them, instead of transferring them.<br />
<br />
Has anybody been through this</div></div><hr />

<br />
this goes deep into the multisite-setup discussion, which is one of the most complex issues arising when dealing with Baan software - because there are so many ways of doing things.<br />
<br />
What is actually very important here: Which Baan version do you use? Baan IV or Baan V(ERP) - the multisite capabilities and possibilities differ a lot in those versions.</div></div><hr />
