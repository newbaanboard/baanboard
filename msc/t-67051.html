Only item in the BOM is a phantom item.  Recently these phantom items are printed on production order materials list.  This never used to happen.  What would cause this?</div></div><hr />

As per the definition and property of Phantom items, there has to be no inventory of these items. The possible causes could be:<br />
1. Somebody has made a sales / production / purchase / RPL order for the phantom item<br />
2. Somebody has made inventory adjustment of the phantom item.<br />
Due to the above reasons, the phantom item looses its &quot;phantomness&quot;. To restore the condition, please remove all the allocations / inventory on order for this phantom item and also make the on hand inventory 0 (zero) for all these phantom items. There should not be any planned inventory movement of the phantom items.<br />
Once you carry out the above, then run the planning engine and it should generate the correct estimated material for the production orders which are confirmed and transferred.<br />
If you still have any issues, then please do let me know.</div></div><hr />

You are right and I'll add that phantom Items must be manufactured without a BOM.  In my case, the phantom item was changed to a purchased item and the sfc module listed the phantom in material list.<br />
Then a factory supervisor, knowing that we do not make phantom items, made inventory adjustment putting a large quantity into stock.<br />
<br />
I opened case with Infor yesterday and they helped.  Looks like our material lists do not have phantom items today and inventory is zero.<br />
