<br />
i'm on 5c but it should work similar in IVc.<br />
Be sure to use object Version of pcf.<br />
<br />
In the Constraint you can not use 4 GL commands because after compiling your constraints work like functions in a dll and there is no GUI. But you can use nearly all 3 GL commands.<br />
For your question it is very easy.<br />
Just declare your desired tables and do a select statement similar to this:<br />
<br />
table ttppp999<br />
<br />
select ttppp999.*<br />
from ttppp999<br />
where .....<br />
selectdo<br />
   validate = true<br />
selectempty<br />
   validate = false<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">3rd September 2002, 23:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The code above is perfectly correct... except that every line that is 3GL needs an exclamation mark (!) in the first column. e.g<br />
<br />
!table ttppp999<br />
<br />
!select ttppp999.*<br />
!from ttppp999<br />
!where .....<br />
!selectdo<br />
     validate = true<br />
!selectempty<br />
     validate = false<br />
!endselect<br />
<br />
BTW, validate is normally true in validation constraints so you can simplify the above.   Also changing &quot;validation&quot; to &quot;V&quot; in the PCF parameters will save your fingers!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for hints,<br />
but in 5c you don't need exclamation marks.<br />
It works like posted before.<br />
Don't know if its different in Baan IV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the help.  Here is a few things I have learned:<br />
<br />
1.  5c does not need the exclamation marks.  IVc does.<br />
<br />
2.  Sometimes Baan Support does an excellent job.  Here are some examples of IVc constraints using 4gl:<br />
<br />
Examples of how to use the Baan 3GL/4GL language in PCF constraints are shown below. <br />
Example 1: <br />
Suppose you want to fill the 'Reference B' field of a sales order with the value of the feature [special].   This can only be done when generating a product variant structure for this sales order, not when configuring the variant.  The most probable place to locate this code is in the Parameter Substitution section of e.g. a BOM constraint.  (Think of Parameter Substitution as the constraint section where information from the constraints is written to the database tables.)  This is done with 3GL statements.  Every 3GL statement is preceded by an exclamation mark.<br />
!   table ttdsls040                             declare every table you want to use <br />
    long orno                                   declare local variables <br />
!   import (&quot;tdsls040.orno&quot;, orno)                      import order number <br />
    tdsls040.orno = orno                                key of record you want to select <br />
!   tdsls040.orno = shiftr$ (tdsls040.orno)             right adjustment   (if necessary) <br />
!   db.eq (ttdsls040,  db.lock)                 select record and lock it <br />
                                                (lock for write operations) <br />
    if not e then <br />
         tdsls040.refb = [special]                      assign feature value to table field <br />
!        db.update (ttdsls040)                  update table in memory <br />
!         commit.transaction ( )                        write table and remove lock <br />
    endif <br />
<br />
Example 2: <br />
Suppose you want to read the latest purchase price of a generic purchased item in a constraint and assign it to the feature [price] or to the system variable 'price', then you could use a very simple constraint like this:<br />
!   table ttiitm001 <br />
!    [price] = tiitm001.1tpr            (validation section of product feature constraint) <br />
!    price = tiitm001.1tpr              (parameter substitution section of generic price list constraint) <br />
In this case you don't have to select the generic item record, since the field you want to read is one of the current record (the current generic item).<br />
  <br />
Example 3: <br />
Suppose you want to limit the option set of the feature [color], based on the customer number.  Usually you would solve this problem by creating a feature [cust] or something, and use the value of this feature in the validation section of the constraint for the feature [color], like this:<br />
if  [cust] = &quot;2024&quot; then <br />
    c: [color] is (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;magenta&quot;) <br />
else <br />
     if [cust] = &quot;....... <br />
This is a tremendous amount of work if you have many customers.  Using 3GL statements can save a lot of work.  The first thing you have to do is create a new table, for example,  &quot;tipcf900&quot;, containing the options per customer.  Or, if there is more than one feature that is dependent on the customer number, the feature options per customer.  Such a table might look like this:<br />
        Record 1        Record 2        Record 3        Record 4        Record 5        Record 6 <br />
cuno    2024    2024    2024    2024    2024    2031 <br />
cpft    color   color   color   color   color   color <br />
copt    red     green   blue    normal  large   blue <br />
<br />
A separate Baan session would need to be created to maintain this table. Once the maintenance session  and the table are defined, the table can be used in the aforementioned validation section, like this:<br />
!   table ttipcf900                             declare table <br />
!   import (&quot;tipcf500.cuno&quot;, tipcf900.cuno)             get customer number from variant <br />
    tipcf900.cpft  =  &quot;   color&quot;                        select feature <br />
    tipcf900.copt = [color]                             manipulate the option set of the feature <br />
!    db.eq (tipcf900)                           select all options with these keys <br />
     if not e then                                      <br />
        validate = false                                validate the selected records <br />
     endif <br />
<br />
<br />
  <br />
Example 4: <br />
Suppose you want to use a constraint to insert an item into the customized BOM during the generation stage rather than entering a large number of components with the same sequence number into the Generic BOM and writing a validation constraint for each component.  This would drastically reduce Generic BOM maintenance and constraint coding while speeding up constraint processing (due to fewer generic BOM lines and constraints).<br />
This requires the definiton of  a DUMMY component in the Generic BOM.  The idea is that you want to replace the item DUMMY with a standard item depending on the selected options.  Technically it is a little difficult to replace DUMMY, because that means that you have to manipulate the customized BOM after it has been generated.  What you can do however, is set &quot;VALIDATE = FALSE&quot; for the component DUMMY and immediately insert a new customized BOM line.  That is done as follows:<br />
!    table ttipcs022                            | # Customized BOM lines <br />
!    table ttipcf500                            | # Product Variant ID's <br />
  <br />
| # to add a new record to ttipcs022, first fill the key fields <br />
!   import  (&quot;tipcf500.refo&quot;, tipcs022.cprj)            | # Project  (from variant) <br />
!   import  (&quot;tipcf500.item&quot;, tipcs022.mitm)    | # Top item <br />
     tipcs022.pono = 10                         | # BOM line position <br />
<br />
| # now fill the other fields of the record <br />
    tipcs022.sitm = ................                    | # the item code <br />
!   tipcs022.opol = toittb.standard             | # standard item <br />
    tipcs022.qana = ...............                     | # net quantity <br />
    tipcs022.cwar = ...                         | # warehouse <br />
!   tipcs022.cpha = tcyesno.no                  | # not a phantom <br />
| # now add the new record to the table and don't validate DUMMY <br />
!   db.insert (ttipcs022) <br />
!   commit.transaction ( ) <br />
    validate = false <br />
That's it.  Of course this will only work when you configure a variant for a project, because the project number was read from the variant.  You can probably also import tipcs020.cprj.<br />
     <br />
  <br />
Example 5: <br />
This constraint reads the order number from the pcf table and uses it to read the customer code for prices and discounts from the sales order header (form 2). It was written in the Before Input section for the feature [cust].<br />
                                                                          <br />
! table ttdsls040               | Declare sales order header table;     <br />
        | No need to declare pcf500 since it    <br />
        | is already active                     <br />
string orno                     | Declare variable to store order #     <br />
! import(&quot;tipcf500.refo&quot;, orno)         | Read order # from pcf500    <br />
                                                                           <br />
! tdsls040.orno = val(orno)     | Convert order # into a numeric        <br />
        | value &amp; set key field in sales        <br />
| order header table                    <br />
! db.eq(ttdsls040)      |Select sales order header record      <br />
 [cust] = tdsls040.pcpr                 | Populate [cust] feature with value    <br />
        | from customer price &amp; statistics      <br />
        | field                                <br />
 Example 6: <br />
|This constraint uses the weight information from the parent item         <br />
|along with calculations based on the selected features to calculate      <br />
|the weight of the customized item.  The resulting weight is written      <br />
|to the customized item record.                                           <br />
!table ttipcs022                                                          <br />
!table ttipcs021                                                          <br />

                                                                          <br />

   weight = weight + 1.35                                                 <br />
   tipcs021.wght = weight                                                 <br />

 Example 7 <br />
Here is a very useful 4GL constraint <br />
it will lookup the estimated cost for a customized item which can then be used in the generic pricing: (Note: you need to generate the product structure can calculate project costs before you can calculate the sales price structure) <br />
