you have to click the &quot;generate outbound advise&quot;..<br />
<br />
view the status pending for this warehouse order by clicking on the &quot;status overview&quot;.. then process what's need to be processed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ggeneral</div><div class="date">9th May 2007, 09:10</div></div><div class="posttext">what are these 12 pcs. are these for issuance (replacement to rejects) or are these for storage (to aacount the rejcted item)?<br />
If these are for issuance, check if these qty are already initiated (initiate inventory issue)..  check if it's already in the &quot;To Issue by Warehouse&quot; column of your Material to Issue by production order session. if not yet, still need to initiate.<br />
<br />
If these are for storage, you have to generate inbound advise</div></div><hr />

<br />
but if you refer to the attachment 2nd page, you will notice that I can't proceed. Is it the version problem?<br />

Thank you.<br />

<br />
the 12pcs are rejected. After it has been rejected, it gives a status of open in outbound. I want to close the order but I can't as it still shows me open status for the 12pcs. I try to generate Outbound Advice but it prompted me 'no data within' as you can see at the attachment(wo.doc). I can't proceed now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ggeneral</div><div class="date">9th May 2007, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">two possible reasons why ity is showing &quot;no data within selection&quot;<br />
<br />
1. From the Shipping selection range form of generate outbound advise session, please check the date.. should be later than your scheduled Production of DB0000372<br />
<br />
2. Inventory issue is not initiated.<br />
    Have you checked the &quot;Material to Issue&quot; session of this production order? Go to the line item and it should be in the &quot;To issue by Warehouse column&quot;, otherwise it is not yet initiated.</div></div><hr />
