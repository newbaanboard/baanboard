<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cameron</div><div class="date">2nd June 2002, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">2 questions in this thread:<br />
(1) Baan allows user to maintain feature description and option description by language. can anybody tell what are they for? or where do we use it?<br />
(2) We received data dump from our sister company, where all feature descriptions and option descriptions are maintained in Spanish, but &quot;description by langauge&quot; are maintained with English description. Can we switch to English description in session &quot;Maintain Product Variant&quot;?</div></div><hr />

(1)<br />
read somewhere that description by language is used on some documents which go to customers.<br />
Normally Baan uses the the descriptions which are in language that is linked to customer.<br />
Never really tried this out.<br />
<br />
(2)<br />
No, i don't think you can do it this way. If you import the dump via Exchange you are able to import the english descriptions into the 'normal' description fields.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

thanks for the advise.<br />
for question (1) i noticed the change after i set &quot;PCF in Customer Language = Yes&quot; in the PCF parameters - where the description in different languages were printed on outgoing documents.<br />
for question (2), in order not to delay my project, i did the way u recommended (import English description via Exchange).<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />
