most probably it's a requirement somewhere else (safety stock perhaps per item or per warehouse?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already run session tdinv0250m000, tdilc0250m000 and also timrp1210m000.<br />
But still can't delete MRP movements for old date.<br />
<br />
I check from display MRP movements then refer order number from MRP Production Batch but when check to session timrp1122m000, there's no that order number, beside that there's order number with status canceled but can't delete from MRP Movements.<br />
<br />
thank you.<br />

  Check your Allocated quantity and SafetyStock quantity in the Item Master for this particular item. MRP deletes the planned orders once the requirement is satisfied so you shouldnt have a problem in removing this entry once Baan makes sure there are no further requirement for this item and the main MRP requirement fields like Allocated and Safety Stock are satisfied by the combination of OnOrder and OnHand qty. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jvranckx</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you should drop the timrp010 table (yes : delete it), recreate it and then run the PRP for all your projects(if you have any), the MPS for all your MPS items (if you have any) and then a regenerative MRP. If the records then show up again there must be a requirement somewhere!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
please check my attachement is about setup the item data.<br />
<br />
i think for drop that table is very risk for our company.<br />
<br />
thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jvranckx</div><div class="date">12th October 2006, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">There is NO risk in dropping the timrp010 table. It is reconstructed by the MRP!! It also does not relate to the on order or allocated quantity in the item file (as opposed to tdinv150). If you drop this table you should also drop the timrp020, timrp021 ... containing the MRP orders and then rerun PRP, MPS and finally MRP. The timrp010 table contains all the information from tdinv150 with everything concerning the order proposals added to it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">just_fro</div><div class="date">21st October 2006, 01:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know what SP you're on, but in a regenerative MRP mrp010, mrp20, mrp21 and mrp22 are dropped since SP9......<br />
(it starts with a 'regular' db.delete, and when that fails for some reason, a db.drop is done...)<br />
<br />
Anyway, since this doesn't seem to work, just drop them manually and run a regenerative MRP 'full range' <br />
(you can try at your testserver first, but there is absolutely no risk)</div></div><hr />

hi everybody ...<br />
<br />
I have SP until 12.<br />
<br />
For my case, I think do manually for delete cause only for some order in movements MRP.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">30th October 2006, 07:43</div></div><div class="posttext">You are wayyy behind in Service Packs robby. Although i havent used MRP when we were on SP 12 so its just a hunch that some modifications must have been done with respect to MRP in the subsequent service packs. When i tried it out on my system MRP did delete the records when there were no requirements and upon running Regenerative MRP Calculation.<br />
So as they say you could manually delete the tables everytime or else apply some latest service packs to fix this problem for good...<br />

I hope the end of the year I can upgrade SP until 21.<br />
