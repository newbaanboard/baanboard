I haven't touched B6 so far, but I assume there are many similarities in costing to B5 that I handled quite frequently<br />
 Item is grouped to item groups which in turn can be used to determine which particular ledger account to book to when transactions involving the item is recorded<br />
 Hmm... you can see the valuation price and standard price each on their own separate sessions in B5, but not in one session. I don't know about B6<br />
 Physical inventory transaction should be the responsibility of the warehousing department, which has no concern regarding (or even prohibited access to) valuation price of the goods they're handling<br />
Go ahead and shoot if you have further questions :)<br />

<br />
I guess those can be found in BaanERP User Manual (although scattered around in different sections instead of lumped into one):<br />
 how to create item group and record item data (including the group it belongs to) should be found in Common Data manual<br />
 you also need to set up the valuation method of each item group which represents physical goods that can be transacted. This should be found in Warehousing (under Warehousing Analysis) manual<br />
 the link between item group, transaction type, and ledger account should be found in financial integration section of the manual<br />
Good luck :)<br />
