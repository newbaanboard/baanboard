<br />
In our Batch processing, I have a main item milk for that inventory &amp; storage unit is Litre. I have entered a conversion factor for litre for e.g.<br />
Base Unit = LTR<br />
<br />
500ml = 0.50000<br />
1Ltr    = 1<br />
2Ltr    = 2<br />
4Ltr    = 4<br />
<br />
We pack this milk in different sizes or in baan language different containers for e.g. 500ml, 1 litre, 2 litre and 4 litre etc. I have created a formula for milk and define my continers as end item in formula managment session (psfrm0110m000) then i have also defined the containers individualy for above sizes and main item (milk) is appearing in material + i have added packing material as bottle.<br />
Like for 500 ml container 0.500 litre milk  and one bottle is required<br />
for 1ltr container 1 litre milk and one bottle is required<br />
for 2ltr cotainer 2 litre milk and one bottle is required<br />
for 4ltr cotainer 4 litre milk and one bottle is required <br />
My problem is when i have calculated cost price system calculated 1 liter cost for all the continers <br />
like for 500 ml container 1 litre milk + 2 bottles cost is appearing in cost price <br />
<br />
for 1ltr container 1 litre milk + 1 bottle cost is appearing, <br />
<br />
for 2ltr continer also 1 litre milk + half bottle cost is appearing<br />
<br />
for 4ltr continer also 1 litre milk + .25 bottle cost is appearing<br />
<br />
Please let me know the solution becuase using continer will reduce the production batches or else user has to create production for every apck or container.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
