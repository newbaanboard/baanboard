<br />
Suppose for a component, the field Backflush if Material in Item master is NO and the field Backflush = YES in session ticst0101m000 (Enter Material Issue for Production Orders) for this component, then will this Item get automatically backflushed or not ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

The help screens are prety good on this (IVc at least)<br />
<br />
To answer your specific question.  No the item will not get backflushed if the item master settings are set to NO.<br />
<br />
If you want to backflush the materials/components for an item then 'bachflush materials' muct be set to YES, then the items that are to be backflushed must have their 'backflush if material' set to YES. <br />
<br />
Also the backflush fields in bom need to be set to YES/NO so that the production order and its associated tables (tisfc010, ticst001, ticst002, tihra100 from memory for sfc - similar tables for pmg.)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<br />
For components (prod material backflush):<br />
BaanERP will look first in the item production data of the components. If there it said that this component should normally be backflushed when it is defined as a component (of an assembly), then when we attach this component to a BOM, BaanERP will initially mark it as a component to be backflushed. However, we can manually override this, e.g. normally this component should be backflushed, but it shouldn't be when used for certain assembly.<br />
Once in production order, the material requirements of the order will initially follow BOM backflush setting. This too, can be manually overrriden, e.g. normally this component should be backflushed for certain assembly, but don't backflush it for this particular production order<br />
<br />
For production operation (prod time backflush):<br />
BaanERP will look at the task whether backflush is allowed for that task. If yes, then BaanERP will initially allow backflush for any routing operation involving this task. However, we can also manually override this, e.g. normally backflush is allowed in a certain task, but when this task is used to assemble a certain thing, backflush should not be allowed.<br />
Once in production order, the operations will initially follow routing backflush setting. This too, can be manually overriden, e.g. normally backflush is allowed for certain operation of assembly of certain thing, but don't allow backflush in this operation for this particular production order<br />
<br />
For end product:<br />
BaanERP will look at the item production data of the end product. If there it says that backflush is allowed during its assembly, then BaanERP will initially allow backflush for any production order involving this end product. This can be manually overriden, e.g. normally backflush is allowed during assembly of this end item, but don't allow it for this particular production order.<br />
This backflush setting in the production order is the master switch. If we don't allow backflush here on production order level, even if the component or the operation could be backflushed (refer to above setting), BaanERP won't allow backflush for this whole prod order<br />
<br />
<br />
In short, for your case, the component will be backflushed if the master material backflush switch in production order is on<br />

<br />
 We have setup all the flags for the items to be backflushed and everything was fine until last two months we got two items which have not been backflushed at all while the rest of the items have been backflushed. Any suggestions will be welcomed to solve the mystery(All the 3 flags for backflushing are &quot;Yes&quot; for these two items).<br />
<br />
We are on Baan IV C4, SP 12<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

 Make sure you have inventory in the warehouse that is associated with the item.  I have seen plenty of inventory in the plant but not in the warehouse we needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
responsible for backflushing or not is the setting 'Bckfl' in Maintain Estimated Materials (ticst001.bfls). The standard value is copied from the setting in the item master, but can be modified manually.<br />
<br />
Scrap factors, bom units &lt;&gt; 1, conversion factors and other quantity relevant settings may cause problem during backflushing. Records which are completly skipped during backflushing, should have other reasons.<br />
<br />

<br />
         WE have inventory in the concerned warehouse, however when these particular item are always left in the receipt location instead ofits respective loaction.  And if this is the cause, then why does it affect only one item or two out six or seven which are all in the receipt locations and are backflushed.<br />
<br />
Anymore insight will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
It could be that the items in question are obsolete. Obsolete items cannot be backflushed. Check the signal code on form 1 of the item master.<br />
