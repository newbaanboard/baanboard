<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">4th March 2008, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you customize this session ticst0101m000? I dont seem to find this ticst001.pers on this form or in the cst001 table as standard... If you added this field by customizing your form &amp; table, then did you run the convert to runtime after changing the tcfpos domain? After doing this, you got to stop and start your shared memory to bring about the changes.. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esanmar</div><div class="date">5th March 2008, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this a cutomized session.<br />
I have made the restart and in the table ticst001.pers the domain is tfcpos which I've modified to 4 digits.<br />
The problem is in the screen, this field makes a zoom to tccom0501s000 and returns the tccom001.emno.<br />
I can't change the domain tfcpos to tcemno, it appears in other programs. <br />
Now it shows a message when an employee of 4 digits is selected and it refresh to zero.<br />
I can't select any employee of 4 digits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">5th March 2008, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">The domain tcfpos is that of a Field Position. What made you choose the domain tcfpos for ticst001.pers field instead of tcemno? Cant you choose tcemno as the domain for ticst001.pers? This way you dont have to mess up with the domain tcfpos and since tcemno comes with 4 digits, it would solve your problem...<br />
<br />
sk<br />
<br />
B.t.w where is tcfpos used? I failed to find any that uses this domain using the session Print Where used domains {ttadv4410m000}...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esanmar</div><div class="date">5th March 2008, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">This session was customized, not by be. The field appears in other customized sessions. The tcfpos domain now is integer 4, but the message still appears.<br />
<br />
When I change the employee to other with 4 digits a message of not allowed employee it shows and it refresh to zero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">6th March 2008, 08:11</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the sessions Display Table Fields By Used Domains {ttadv4524m000} or Print Where Used Domains {ttadv4410m000} to find out which all object uses this domain and if its a matter of few, then change them to another domain.. for e.g tcemno...<br />
<br />
B.t.w., was the tcfpos domain customized to your VRC package in session Maintain Domains {ttadv4100m000}. If not then try doing that. <br />
Since you mentioned that tcfpos is used in other customized sessions, is the length of this domain in all those sessions 4 or default?<br />
<br />
Last but not least, you said you restarted the shared memory, but did you try restarting the server? The reason behind it is that sometimes when the users are connected, stopping and restarting the shared memory doesnt clear the memory at all...<br />
