Has any one had to do this before?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th June 2012, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Not production orders - but we do once a quarter delete all the GRP planned purchase orders and planned production order.  There are thousands of these and we just some quick and dirty BaaN api code we created.  Basically you give it a range of orders, items or project group and away it goes.  <br />
<br />
Of course I am assuming nothing has been done to these production orders that would prevent them from being deleted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">14th June 2012, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no mass update session for it in Baan IV. If the production order status is planned, then you know that not much has happened to it and one can write a custom code to delete the order. It is not that difficult to write that code though, but to answer your question, there is no standard session to delete them in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joepte</div><div class="date">14th June 2012, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Ln sounds nice but I don't know if we ever will make it there...<br />
I am thinking of an api to the cancel production orders session tisfc0203m000 but that means I have to move all these planned production orders to released or active production orders. What session did you call?  Is there a session to call that might allow for deletion as planned orders?<br />
Thanks again for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joepte</div><div class="date">15th June 2012, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I wrote a session to call (api) Cancel Prod Orders tisfc0203m000 - I had to release them but in this case all orders were for 0 qty so it was ok. I was then able to delete them in a range (&gt;16K orders!)<br />
Thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th June 2012, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry - was out of the office yesterday.  The session I used to delete planned GRP production orders is tipgc5110m00b - not sure if that would be the same on your system. So which session did you use to delete them? I was going to try tisfc0101m000, but the order I cancelled seems to running forever.</div></div><hr />
