<br />
Is there a way in BaaN to run MRP without including Active/Released production orders in the run? For example, I have some Active or Released production orders and want to run MRP for the new Sales orders but without including those Active/Released orders. I cannot complete those orders for 7 days because of business reasons but not going to report them anymore.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

The orders that are active are already or should have been covered. Unless there are shortages for those orders. If there are no shortages then the effect of these orders in MRP run is not there. May be you can exlpain what issue these orders are causing to you.<br />
