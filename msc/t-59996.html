<br />
<br />
We have a standard item that has low sales volume. The item is purchased. We are using MRP to order the item. Here is an example of our problem.<br />
<br />
I receive an order on Jan 10 for item ABC with a due date of April 1. We have an overnight job that runs MRP and confirms and transfers planned orders. I now have a purchase order with an April 1 due date.<br />
<br />
I receive an order on Jan 15 for item ABC with a due date of March 1. MRP/Confirm and Transfer runs overnight. Now the system inserts a new purchase order with a due date of April 1 and recommends moving the previous order in. <br />
<br />
Is there anyway to just insert a new purchase order with a due date of March1?  We would rather not manually order the item.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I have the same problem. Did you get a solution in the meantime?</div></div><hr />

As system assumes the PO that is with the supplier has more possibilty of rescheduling vs new PO. But if you don't want this to happen one can easily customize this.<br />
