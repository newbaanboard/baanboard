If the user wants to change something on item the system will display error message Container not found which is logical because could find appropriate recored in tiitm100.<br />
On the other hand these items are not containerized at all. When we created new item in tiitm0101m000 with the same data set the tables tdinv001 and tiitm100 were updated without any issues.<br />
<br />
Is there any chance to find out the reason for that ? We have made difference report and almost every item is purchased. Only a few of them are cost items.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any idea is greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">29th December 2004, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a shot, but is it possible that your data was converted from an earlier version of Baan (or brought over from another system)?   Earlier versions did not have the container table, so if the data was moved, those records would have needed to also be created.  This would explain why old records do not have the entries, but new ones you put in do.  Even cost items, or ones that say 'no' to containerized (Form 5 of the Item Master) will create entries in the container table, but with a blank container, and that entry is needed for reference purposes (as you found!).<br />
<br />
One solution is to write a simple script that will fill in the container records for those that do not already have one.  New items should fill this properly.<br />
<br />
The tdinv001 table should fill in whenever there is data by warehouse...but since the container reference is not found it may not find those records..?  Not sure if this explains why nothing in tdinv001, unless the container reference fixes that, or if there was a data conversion, maybe that was not filled right because of the container..?</div></div><hr />
