<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yana880</div><div class="date">29th March 2012, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
I get PRP rescheduling messages that suggests to split P/O-lines into two lines with different delivery dates. I have never seen MRP do that, it always suggests to move the whole P/O-line. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to prevent PRP Rescheduling to propose to split lines? I can of course disregard from the messages, but I'd prefer not to get them. <br />
<br />
In this specific case I have two prod.orders in the same PCS-project with start dates one week apart. Both SFC's require the same (customized) purchased part. There is one P/O-line for the total quantity with planned delivery date in time for the first production order. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice / Hans</div></div><hr />
