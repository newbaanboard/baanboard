<br />
I need your expertise and help to find a solution for my problem.<br />
We are working with Baan V as ERP. <br />
We have a request to create POs for several items, that will have a fixed delivery date. Demand changes that will follow weekly and MRP that will run weekly should not affect these POs (no signals generated), but if a shortage appears, planned purchase order shall be generated to fill in the gap.<br />
Please tell me how I can obtain in Baan this functionality.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
Angela</div></div><hr />

First you would be getting the planned purchase orders as per your planning setting from the demand you have booked in the system (in terms of sales orders / quotations / extra demand / forecast, etc.). You can confirm and transfer them to make them purchase orders. Or you may create the POs either may be manually (as indicated by you in your post) for many items with fixed delivery period.<br />
After that when you take a weekly planning run, if the demand is more BaaN V planning engine would give some exception messages, etc., which you may ignore.<br />
For shortage quantity, BaaN V planning engine would generate additional planned purchase orders, which you can confirm and transfer to make the purchase orders.<br />
This cycle can continue forever (except for the initial PO making).</div></div><hr />
