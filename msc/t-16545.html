<br />
We have some purchase parts that need some touch up in our floor. <br />
When the parts arrive from the supplier we create a Lot for the parts(purchase lot).<br />
We have to create a rework order for these particular parts and outbound<br />
them to the floor. When the rework is done and want to report production<br />
completed to the store, using the same lot that were issued(purchase lot)<br />
with, BaaN(mantain recipts) does not allow to use a purchase lot when reporting materials <br />
from a production order. We have to keep the original lot for traceability proposes.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an idea to solve this or a walk around?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amartins</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">As a work-around, you could reverse issue the parts from the rework order instead of reporting the parts complete.  This would allow you to put them back into the same purchased lot.  The financial results of the order should be the same as if you had reported the parts complete.<br />

Thanks for this, it is a good idea. Unfortunately we work with MAUC and MAUC will only be updated it through  maintain receipts; so labour will not be carried out in to the itemÂ’s MAUC if we return the material instead of deliver it.  <br />
<br />
I hope we can think in some other option..<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
