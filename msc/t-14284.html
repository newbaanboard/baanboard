I can change the field to search on by the menu choice Sequence and than choose Search Argument II for instance. However after exiting the session tiitm0501m000 and calling the session again the search field returns to item number.<br />
<br />
I'ld like to know how to set the search field (per user) to a certain field. Can this be done and if so how?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">This cannot be done. But there is a -undocumented- feature on BaaN IV that allows to search automatically by search key: just put a comma after the field: by example:<br />
<br />
Item code:  BOLT, <br />
search the item not by code, but by search key<br />
<br />
This is done also on customers and suppliers...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, and this works for Baan 5 as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, i tried but did not succeed in getting it work.<br />
<br />
I pushed the search button.<br />
I entered a description in the field of the item code and place a , behind the description.<br />
The item found was an item of which the item code started with the same letter. I am sure the description is in the Search Key I field of form 1 of itm.<br />
<br />
Can you tell from this why the method you described does not work over here?:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there is a misundertsanding. In tiitm0501m000 (i assume this is the main session 'Items' like in Baan 5 it is tcibd0501m000) the default index is 1, i.e. the field item. So, when you hit the spy-glass the search field will be on item code, and not on search argument. <br />
<br />
What Zardoz was referring to, is that in all (or most) sessions where you enter an item number, for instance sales/purchase order lines, there instead of zooming to tiitm0501m000 to select an item by item code, you can simply on the form-field enter the description followed by ',' and hit the tab, then the system will automatically zoom to tiitm0501m000 ordered by search argument, and pointing to the selected search argument.<br />
<br />
Hope this clears it up a bit.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />

Thanks. I tried in a purchase order and it worked. Alas, not in searching for items in ITM.:mad:</div></div><hr />

If you want to do a search on other key then key1, you have to set the key for the session.<br />

<br />
Hello Klaas,<br />
<br />
Could you please tell: is it possible to set the key for searching on items in tiitm to for instance Search Argument II on a per user basis?<br />
According to others in this thread that can't be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pivo,<br />
<br />
Example: session tiitm0501m000. This usually starts up with key1, being primairy key item. If it is needed once, user can change sequence in the session. If user always needs to start the session in key3, copy the session and change Available index by session. In this case index1 is first key (sort field), you can change the sort from index1 to 3 and change the sort of index5 (search II) to 1. Then the session always starts with index5: search II. Be sure to have the index5 fields on the first form.<br />
<br />
You can even change the startoption, this usually is set to execute find data, think about changing it to execute def.find, so the user doesn't have to press find key anymore. This works best for multi occ subsessions (like tiitm0502s000).<br />
