We are using routings (costing, man power) for our assemblies and lead times for the purchase items.<br />
When we run the Generate Order Planning (MRP) the system takes in consideration the lead time of the supplier plus the production of the routing. I know this is normal.<br />
The problem is as follows:<br />
Suppose I have an end item A with a production time of 1 day and is made of B with a 3 day lead time. The requirement for A is 30 units for the 30th of July. Now the system is asking for B on the 27th of June. The planners need B until the 30th of july and they need the start planned date on 27th of july. One month before we need it.<br />
<br />
Is it possible while running MRP to consider only the lead times of the part and not the time of the routings?</div></div><hr />
