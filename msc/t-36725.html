<br />
 <br />
Prerogatives<br />
<br />
1: We need to record the serial numbers when shipping finished goods (for invoice and warranty purposes)<br />
2: We need to use the negative inventory functionality for finished goods<br />
3: We do not want to record the serial numbers when reporting production orders<br />
<br />
What are the characteristics to be set up in order to this?<br />
<br />
What we have done:<br />
Item set to serial on item base data.  On item-warehousing, you want to have serial tracking but not serial in inventory.  That should be all you need to set for registering the serial at time of shipping but not at time of putting it into inventory.<br />
<br />
Negative inventory is a parameter in inventory handling parameters (outbound tab).<br />
<br />
Results:<br />
The problem is that LN is asking us to record the series when we report the Production Orders. <br />
<br />
In the item-warehousing session we defined the field Register Serial Issue During As Built with both values No and Yes and LN is still asking for the series on the Production Order<br />
<br />
Any clue?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddy G</div><div class="date">27th June 2007, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no way to skip the As-Built registration, because without that you would not be able to do serial tracking. That is the crux I think.<br />
<br />
Wonder if it is possible to create a negative inventory for serialized items?<br />
A situation could be when you sell a serial, while you have to report the SFC order yet. With serials not in inventory that might work...<br />
<br />
The &#8220;Register Serial Issue During As Built&#8221; parameter is about tracking component serial numbers during issuing the materials (outbound) and not about the end item receipt.</div></div><hr />

What is the use of having negative inventory on finished goods? If reporting SFC orders complete, then negative inventory doesn't come into play.<br />
<br />
You can have the possibility to only report the serial number when shiiping the finished goods out of inventory to the customer. Also a parameter to set. This could be the solution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">13th July 2007, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We have built a customized solution for this type of problem.<br />
<br />
1)  Custom software to generate serial numbers and serialized labels.<br />
2)  Custom software through ddc to record serial number travelling down production line (using stationary bar-code scanners)<br />
3)  Custom RF Shipping system to record serial numbers as they are shipped, and link them to sales orders.<br />
4)  Modify packing slips \ invoice reports to print serial numbers on document.<br />
5)  Custom tables with serial number master, transaction logs, etc.<br />
<br />
PM me, and we can discuss further how we implemented our solution.<br />
