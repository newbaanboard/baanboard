<br />
I am on Baan 5 c. I have a situation where the simulate orders does not consider the safety stock while computing planned supply for a particular purchased item. It only considers the demand from higher level items for that item . Does not consider the safety stock. However for other items it considers both the safety stock and the demand from higher level items.<br />
Am i missing something in the setup?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />

Is it the same warehouse where you have requirement flowing in (or main warehouse maintained in various item data).<br />
If it is not, then have you linked this warehouse to the main warehouse of the item as a source?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have an item only tied to one warehouse which is using item ordering data. I've put a safety stock of 10 but the item order plan is not taking that 10 into account.<br />
<br />
My maximum inventory is set to 99999999.999 and I even set my reorder point to 10 to test if it would make a difference but did not.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Ok after testing I've found that if the 'Maintain Master Plan' is enabled in 'Items - Planning' safety stock will NOT  be taken into account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you set &quot; use Item - Ordering data&quot; the data of the item and not the data of item-data-per-Wh are taken.  <br />
<br />
To your statement: Ok after testing I've found that if the 'Maintain Master Plan' is enabled in 'Items - Planning' safety stock will NOT be taken into account......<br />
You may check if you need to generate the &quot;item masterplan&quot; I guess you need cpdsp1201m000.  Hope this helps Greets Roland</div></div><hr />
