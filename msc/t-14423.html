<br />
I have a problem about M-R relations.<br />
<br />
Created 2 routings with 1 operation each, and with different task for each operation.<br />
<br />
Created BOM for that item with components linked to routing 1 and routing 2.<br />
<br />
When creating Production Order using either Routing Code, the system takes the entire BOM, ignoring the M-R Relation though the operation is correctly taken based on Routing Code.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Item A<br />
Routing Code = 001<br />
Operation 10, Task 1<br />
<br />
Routing Code = 002<br />
Operation 10, Task 2<br />
<br />
BOM For A:<br />
Operation = 0<br />
<br />
M-R Relation:<br />
Pos 10: Item A' linked to ROU 001, Op 10<br />
Pos 20: Item A'' linked to ROU 001, Op 10<br />
Pos 30: Item B linked to ROU 002, Op 10<br />
<br />
Create Production Order for item A using Routing Code 001,<br />
Estimated material shown:<br />
1. A'<br />
2. A''<br />
3. B<br />
<br />
The operation shown: Operation 10, Task 1<br />
<br />
Create Production Order for item A using Routing Code 002,<br />
Estimated material shown:<br />
1. A'<br />
2. A''<br />
3. B<br />
<br />
The operation shown: Operation 10, Task 2<br />
<br />
This is very strange to me. Anybody has any suggestion about this? Have I missed some settings here?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
as far as I understand you would like to create a &quot;routing based BOM&quot;. This is not possible. The link between material and routing only concerns backflushing issues - when operations are reported complete.<br />
What you try to intend would lead to a significant gap between MRP and actual material demand: which version of the BOM should be taken into consideration during MRP-run? All materials? Materials based on standard routing?<br />
Changes on the estimated materials for a production order always have to be done manually.<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />

<br />
I understand that only one routing can be set to default, which will be used during MRP run.<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to do is, I want to make multiple routing for the same item but I'm attaching only one item to one routing. When I change the default routing to other routing, I want the BOM lines taken are in accord with the M-R relations.<br />
<br />
Changing to other routing will be done manually in the Production Order session, no through MRP explosion.<br />
<br />

<br />
well, what I mentioned is standard functionality in Baan IV. Maybe there have been changes to this issue in later version of Baan but this would be new for me.<br />

<br />
In BaanV, we also can only do MRP explosion on one default routing only.<br />
<br />
In my case, changing the routing is incidental, and is done manually. Of course what the system has planned would be inaccurate because system is giving advice based on standard routing and not the alternate routing.<br />
<br />
What I want is to have the system generate Estimated Materials based on the routing code I selected in the Production Order.<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing,<br />

What you are trying to do is not possible in Baan.  The BOM is linked to the Item and is therefore the standard BOM to make the item.  The Material to Routing linkage is only used to tell manufacturing (SFC) which operation consumes the material(s).  The ability to have multiple routings for an item is really to allow you to define different manufacturing process (NOT BOM) based on quantity to be manufactured.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you want to do can be achieved with BaanERP, but definitely not using the method you use. Let me get this straight, item A can be produced by:<br />
- either doing task 1 over raw materials A' and A&quot;<br />
- or doing task 2 over raw material B<br />
<br />
Then what you could do is set the BOM of A as follows:<br />
- A consists of A' and A&quot; until 31 Dec 2004<br />
- A consists of B on 1 Jan 2005 onward<br />
And for routing of A:<br />
- A is manufactured using task 1 until 31 Dec 2004<br />
- A is manufactured using task 2 on 1 Jan 2005 onward<br />
You can achieve this using the effective and expiry dates of BOM and routing<br />
<br />
Then whenever you want to produce A using task 1 over raw materials A' and A&quot;, you create a production order with reference date 31 Dec 2004 or before. When you want to produce A using the other method, you create production order with reference date 1 Jan 2005 or later.<br />
<br />
This is just one work around on achieving what you want. Of course, this method can't be used if the client actively revise their product specification, in which case they really need the effective and expiry dates for their R&amp;D tracking<br />

<br />
Just FYI: in newest version (6.0 or 6.1(?) to be released this year) we implemented [/B]Effectivity Units.<br />
This could be used for that.<br />
You can define an Eff.Unit for an end-item. In BOM or ROUting<br />
you can define exceptions specific for that unit.<br />
For example: exclude this material line for this Eff.Unit.<br />
Or: only include that operation for that Eff.Unit.<br />
<br />
After creating a prod. order, you may then specify Eff.Units for it, which will modify the production order for the above mentioned changes.<br />
<br />
Thus you can define different configurations and use them very dynamically!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">16th February 2004, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi DStroud, Paul, and Eddy,<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the input. I guess BaanERP's M-R Relations just can't handle it.<br />
<br />
Paul, I think your solution can work (change the routing code and also the reference date).<br />
You see, the reason why alternative material comes is because there's a machine break down and the planner had to replanned the Production Order using another machine which uses a specific material in order for it to run. So the materials used is basically dependent on the type of machine and this is not a once in a year case, it' s happening almost every week :D <br />
<br />
Eddy, you're using Baan6 yet?<br />
Looking forward to see its features :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
Hendra</div></div><hr />

<br />
...and one of it's features is, that it will be made very easily for you to migrate to it!<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: <br />
