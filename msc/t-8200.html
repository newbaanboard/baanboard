<br />
question : is there for example a capacity-report which gives the oppertunity to see the planned hours for tyhe sub-workcenter in the main-workcenter.<br />
<br />
question : is there a possibility to aggregate the hours for the sub-workcenter to the main-workcenter.<br />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">31st December 2002, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi. I posted a similar message on Baansupport. See below for my question and their answer...<br />
<br />
Case description: <br />
In tirou0501m000 Work Centers I can have mulitple work centers setup, and link them all to a main work center.<br />
<br />
What is the functionality of this main work center? It looks to me that I cannot see the parent work center in Capacity Planning or in the Production Order Planning Displays (such as tisfc1506m000 Work Center Utilization by Day Overview). <br />
 <br />
Solution description: <br />
The capacity utilization for sub workcenters <br />
does not aggregate into the main workcenter for this session.<br />
Within BaaN ERP, the functionality to add sub work center aggregation was dropped because of the problems that arose with implementation. The ability to add sub to main work center aggregation may be added in a later release of BaaN <br />
ERP. Essentially, ERP treats each resource as unique.<br />
<br />
But the functionality is that each work center will be planned separately and their capacity will not be aggregated in this version.Essentially, ERP treats each resource as unique. <br />
<br />
However if you want to see the aggregated capacity of main and sub work centers ( as to capacity use by planned orders, SFC order etc, you can see them in the session cprmp3410m000(resource planning).Also the same functionlaity can be used in tihra3450m000(print Hours history)</div></div><hr />
