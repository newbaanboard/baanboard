<br />
Presently the session tipcs2101m000 (Maintain Projects) allows only six character in the field Project No.. Can we increase the size of the field to seven or more characters?<br />
<br />
Pls provide any additional details on this.<br />
<br />
Bye<br />

Mind that this is customization and not to be advised.<br />
What's the reason for your inquiry ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks fillipd.<br />
<br />
The Purpose of increasing the size of the field is to accomodate year (01 Character), serial no. of project (04 Character) and segments (02 Character).<br />
<br />
You also have mentioned that it is too dangerous to do such change. Could you please explain the nature of the danger and its gravity also.<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />

I can think of at least 30 tables, 50 sessions and 50 reports and that's probably just a fraction of the actual number of related sources</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">1st February 2007, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Refer to guide U8339A US.<br />
<br />
This guide (Enlarging Order Numbers) talks about the domain cprj.  It can be enlarged but their are dependencies.<br />
<br />
Read the Guide and you will have a better idea as to what can be done.</div></div><hr />
