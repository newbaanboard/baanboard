<br />
I use ERP LN FP2<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to process return for subcontracting purchase order?<br />
We find the reject product from the supplier when it has been delivered to the shop floor.<br />
And this item is returnable, so we can deliver it back to the supplier to repair it.<br />
<br />
eg:<br />
the subcont purch ord has qty 100 pcs, and have been received 100 pcs also.<br />
The production order for that subcont.purch order is 100 pcs.<br />
We find reject 20 pcs.We want to send it back to the supplier (we need to record this transaction)<br />
<br />
Can i create a production rework order for this problem?<br />
Any body has experience with this subcontracting process in Baan?<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your consideration :) <br />

The  Production Rework order is one of the best ways to account for subcontracting returns. However it is a bit cumbersome and requires many manual inputs for tracking.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your response <br />
When we use the production rework order, and we generate second Subcont. Purch Order, how you handle this?<br />
The second subcont purch ord is input with zero price ?<br />
and The first one will have partial payment?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Sorry For Delayed response , as I wasy away. There are two ways to handle this . 1) If only inventory and cost of rework are to be captured then the rework order alone is sufficient . Do not generate the additional Subcon PO. If however , the payment to subcontractor / legal regulations are also involved then you need to adopt the subcon po route.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its okey :)<br />
You re right, i have problem if i generate the additional Subcon PO, some regulation problem .<br />
So we decide to use cost item to be add on the subcon PO.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestion<br />
