hi<br />
<br />
We had customers having few problems with their old production orders which have been closed.  Most cases users noted that there are still inbound or outbound order line not completed, but production order is already closed.<br />
<br />
From my observation system allows to close because there is no planning data shown for this prod. order, also tisfc001 is showing zero qty for 'To be Issue' column.  This I suspect due to system bug.  My questions are :<br />
<br />
1) if I were to re-set the production order status from 'Closed' to 'Completed', what are the impact on finance integration, assuming all the ledger had been completed?  Is there anything need to be considered?<br />
<br />
2) Has anyone encounter the above problems, having IB and OB line not completed, no planning data created, and tisfc001 not update correctly, and most are backflush components? <br />
<br />
I appreciate inputs from anyone.  Thanks</div></div><hr />
