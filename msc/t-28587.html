<br />
i need to set a service item in a project so i can have a better picture of the cost of that project.<br />
<br />
i have  project A<br />
with item FOAM<br />
Item FOAM is a purchased item where subcontracting company does it for us and charge us.  I want to track the cost of that service but i do not want to track inventory for FOAM.<br />
<br />
When i go in the customized item table, i'm only able to set the item as a purchased or manufactured.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  :confused: <br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">17th December 2006, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Create a task in the routing of this manufactured item, which has the foam as the material, with a Subcontracting workcenter. After the production order is created for this manufactured item you could generate a subcontracting purchase order. When the purchase order is received, the operation in the production order gets completed and you will get the cost booked into your project. You would need to create a standard item code of type subcontracting which then can be included in the session Maintain Subcontracting Rates that helps in Generating the purchase order with this subcontracting item(more or less like a cost item)..<br />
<br />
If the above is too much, you could use the General Project Cost session in Project(Pcs) control..<br />
<br />
PCS Projects can only be created for Purchased and Manufactured item...as far as Baan4c4 is concerned...<br />
