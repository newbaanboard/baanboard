<br />
In standard Baan 5, planned stock from a production order is available only at finish date of production order. It is a disadvantage in case production order lasts for 3 days. <br />
<br />
For ex: pre pack production order runs for 3 days, but final pack level (superior level) sees stock available only at the end of day 3. In reality, stock is already created at the end of day 1 and 2, but is not available for upper level .<br />
<br />
Is there any way to customize Baan to see what stock is available at the end of day 1 and 2?<br />
<br />
The option to reduce the length of production order is not good for molding/pre pack environment, due to change over time optimization.<br />
<br />
Thank you <br />

<br />
there has been a similiar thread a couple of years ago :) <br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7321<br />
<br />
At that time it occured to my that Eddy G, who shared the discussion, was a guy working for Baan. Maybe they added this functionality in the meantime.. We also would be glad to hear that, because we are facing a similar problem.<br />

<br />
Would you be able to contact Eddy G for his updated feed-back, if at least any round about solution was found? I read the history on this topic, no advise would be good for my case.<br />
<br />
This feature is available in SAP, but site needs to migrate to Baan. <br />
This parameter is a gap in our migration list, project dedicated IT did not give us a solution yet. <br />
<br />
If Baan would be able to support this parameter, would be a revolutionary improvement to all customers by reducing overall leadtimes in supply chain, less warehouse capacity needed, less money stuck in material which looks available later than it really is.<br />
<br />
Are you able to raise this topic high enough to Baan development? Will it be as a feature inside Baan 5/6?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

You are migrating from SAP to Baan??<br />

MRP will know and it will the act as per the quantity reported at operation level. In one of my implementation, this was a issue as MRP was reacting to it causing nervouness (this is like 9 years before so don't remember the details now).  I assumed you have tried the SFC parameters. In Baan IV they are called On &quot;Order Date for production order&quot;. <br />
<br />
As far as a visibilty to see what stock is in that status, I guess it is very straightfoward. Look for any open production order and look for quantity completed at each operation. One can total out accross the production order. I think Baan is lot more flexible than SAP, so one can do whatever. For e.g. we had a requirement where we needed a fixed lead time for a production order(for certain item) and not routing based and as you know as the quantity changes at operation level, Baan adjusts the lead time and we were able to accomplish it.<br />

<br />
I agree with Arvind , I have been part of many SFC implementations as well as process(B4C4) implementation , I have never come across this problem in discreet manufacturing, as we can always split up the operations although this increases the BOM levels but it will definetely work. Also now with Ln we have a very good control on time phased issue of materials through SFC -Warehousing integration.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">30th August 2007, 09:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear avpatil and gem_infor,<br />
<br />
the issue we disussed in  the thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/s...ead.php?t=7321) I mentioned was: what happens if a single operation lasts for a couple of days? Currently the material demand is raised on the day the operation starts and the the inventory transaction of the finished good (if the long lasting operation is the last one) is dated on the end of the operation. In practice the material demand is distributed over the complete runtime of the operation, as well as finished goods have a continuous flow into the inventory. Of course you can report operation complete partially, but the MRP won't take this into account for unstarted operations in the future. <br />
<br />
As far as I know this scenario isn't covered by Baan IV or any of it's extensions. @gem_infor: does LN offer this feature? Would be a great step forward!<br />
<br />
I hope the issue comes clear now.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">30th August 2007, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I think material requirement can be solved by little customization. All we need to do is spread the requirement in planned transaction table (tdinv150) and MRP will read it properly. But the issue is really at the planning stage and not at execution stage. MRP will plan based on the requirement date and won't spread at planning stage. At execution stage we can spread it, but I am not sure if this will be of any advantage.<br />
I don't understand how do you want the MRP to react for the partial quantity completed. May be if you can explain with a small example it would make things clear. If you are asking that the parent of this item needs to see the stock coming that can same be updated in the planned transaction table and MRP will see it. Its a customization, but something that can be done</div></div><hr />

<br />
think of an operation that lasts a week or more and requires huge quantities of certain materials. Would be a nice feature if the MRP doesn't suggest to order the whole quantity for Monday already. If the planner refuses to do so and creates a manual split, he will recieve a lot of rescheduling messages. The same thing happens to the finished goods. Although you have a constant flow into you warehouse, you will have rescheduling messages as long as the inventory doesn't cover a certain level. <br />
<br />
Well, then make smaller orders instead of a huge one, you might say. Not always applicable if the previous opreations requires a minimum order quantity.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I disagree that a &quot;little&quot; customization solves the problem. Too many parameters will affect the split result, such as company calendar, modified production rate and so on..<br />

What I am suggesting doesn't affect other tables. And my customization is only for shop floor order and not for planned MRP/MPS orders.Customization at planning level can be done, but may be more serious thought needs to be given. But at shop floor level, material requirement can be spread by customizing planned transaction table. <br />
<br />
At planning level what I can think off is<br />
After MRP is run, one can split the planned MRP orders over a period, this would be more tricky as one has to peg the source of demand and a components can be common accross the products. Then you may have order interval, safety stock etc coming into play.  Hence, it would need more thinking, but I think a solutuion is possible may be e more difficult. You can even customize MRP result. As you know MRP is run level by level and is normally run in batch jobs. So one approach could be to have MRP run level by level. After every level run, adjust the demand of the components that will drive the demand subsequently. A solution can be done on these lines. <br />

<br />
why you are not using different operations - than you can see for each operation, how many pcs are already finished for that production step.<br />
<br />

<br />
Your proposal may give result for actual receipts. But I do not see it applicable for Lego, because each level has different work centers for planning. Additionally, it is a project where planning is not possible to be done in excel-like I have seen all projects I worked for beforehand, it needs a scheduling tool due to the high volume of items. Currently SAP has a planning board. In case of possible future Baan usage, Line scheduling would be taken into account.<br />
<br />
NExt: same rule needs to be applied for planning the whole supply chain, how parts are seen available for the future or how material is driven into the supply.<br />
<br />
Current conclusion I got from technical support: Baan V does not support this type of functionality =&gt; can not be programmed internally as a customization.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply and let me know if any further ideas<br />
