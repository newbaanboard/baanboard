<br />
<br />
the defination says when we dont want to keep the recorrd for  issue of materail and hours spent on manufacturing an item indvidually that is is called as backflushing. my doubt is the above line says issue of material that means it should happen at time of release of material to shopfloor but in realy scenario we are doing backflusing after the report oprations are completed... <br />
<br />
<br />
can anyone expalain..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">17th February 2010, 20:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly as you say.  Backflushing issues the materials after an operation has been completed.  It is useful if you do not want to do an individual material issue transaction for each order/operation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthil Kumar R</div><div class="date">19th February 2010, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Backflushing is a mechanism in which the qty is issued as per the requirement of completed qty of end item. So it is always after completing the end item, corresponding required material is issued. If really want to have proper accountability it is better to complete operations first and say yes to backflushing and then complete the order. otherwise during order complete say No to receipt automatic and say yes to backflusing then process the end item receipt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">23rd February 2010, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Back flushing is nothing but automatic goods issue. System will automatically posts the goods issue when you confirm the operations.You have no need to make manual issue. It will reduce the effort.  <br />
<br />
Backflushing is automatic accounting (Goods issues - 261 mvt) of material consumed for production, at the time of confirmation. Eg. When a 4 wheeler automobile is rolled out from assy line, 4 wheels &amp; Tyres are deemed to be consumed and issued to production order automatically by way of backflushing by the system.  <br />
<br />
Assy line picks the material from stores/ Assy line and use.  <br />
<br />
No Physical issue &amp; Manual posting ( Goods Issue) by Stores.  <br />
<br />
Backflush is used for material which are a must and having fixed relationship. <br />
<br />
This can be configured in MRP2 Screen,Work centre, Routing and production order.  <br />
<br />
Each has some special function.  <br />
<br />
If you configure this in routing or production order you have no need to activate this in MRP2 or Work center screen. <br />
<br />
MRP2 Screen defines whether material components are backflushed are to be made at the work center.</div></div><hr />
