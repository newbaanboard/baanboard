<br />
I have the Baan IV c4 Automotive Suply Chain and IÂ´m having some problems with the cumulatives requirements of the Purchase Schedules, when a purchase schedule exist for an item and the MRP or MPS generates a new schedule, the &quot;inmediate&quot; and &quot;released&quot; requirements of the old purchase schedule are not considered for the cumulative requirements of the new one, it only considered the receipts and some of the inmediate and relesead requirements of the new one.<br />
<br />
We are in process of implementation and really we are not sure how the module works, i really will apreciate any help or documentation you can give to me.........<br />
<br />
Thanks..........</div></div><hr />

What I have noticed is that BaaN just adds the net requirments to make up &quot;new&quot; cumulative requirements for that individual schedule.<br />
<br />
We have customized our purchase schedule report to show the actual purchase schedule cums, but this does not effect the dispay or history sessions.</div></div><hr />
