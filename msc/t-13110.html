<br />
Just today only I joined in this board and I m very happy to share my views as well as getting help from u all.<br />
<br />
We are using BaaN4c4 and I m representing &quot;Manufacturing&quot;. One of my end users unfortunately reported 2523 jobs where ordered one is 2400 only. This Production Order contains only one operation and attached with QID. QMS Inspectior continued the same mistake and cleared the more quantity too. Now how can I reduce that quantity to 2400. Is there any solution for that? If so, please help me....<br />
<br />
Thank u once again</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your end user Posted the wrong quantity then <br />
<br />
1. If the main Item only posted and the Child items are Issued against the SFC order then you can make an Inventory Adjustment for Correction.<br />
<br />
2. If you have already issued all the child items also, then you have make the Adjustment for all Items.<br />
<br />

If I understand our issue, someone over-reported a production order using session tisfc0202m000 Report Production Orders Completed?<br />
You can report a negative quantity in that session, but you have to also correct the quantites in session tisfc0102m000 Report Operations Completed.<br />
I have attached a work instruction we use, but keep in mind that it will not completely work if you are not backflushing your components.</div></div><hr />
