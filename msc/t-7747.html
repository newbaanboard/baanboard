(No operation costs,no surcharges etc) what drives the change<br />
in the standard cost?<br />
<br />
I understand that with each receipt,the stanadard cost is recalculated and the receipts table gets updated and also the history tables.<br />
<br />
When you choose to use the Baan standard session to update costs for a particular item based on say top down approach,where<br />
does the process look at for the new standard cost? Does this specifically look at one table ready with the new cost or this gets calculated based on a set of logic at this time?<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change on std cost of purchased items itself may be based on several factors:<br />
 changes in average purchase price. Average purchase price is calculated for every new purchase receipt, but std cost isn't. Std cost can only be updated using session &quot;Calculate&quot; ticpr2210m000. However, depending on how you set up your default price calculation code, the main purchase price considered may not be average purchase price, but rather current, latest, or simulated purchase price<br />
  changes in surcharges<br />
<br />
Standard costs can only be updated through the &quot;Calculate&quot; session, ticpr2210m000 (unless you're in B5, where you can update the std cost in the Item Costing Data session, provided that you don't have any stock for the item yet). Everytime it runs, it follows a set logic on determining the current std cost, so it doesn't look for any &quot;temp&quot; tables. It will, however, consult the last active std cost to see if there's any difference with the newly calculated one. If there's difference, the new std cost is recorded, otherwise no.<br />

 Thank you for the explanation.<br />
 <br />
 I Think the Standard cost field in thr receipts table gets filled in based on the Item standard cost at that time.The Recalculation<br />
actually may happen for the average Purchase price each time there is a receipt and this may be posted to Item Master.Agree?<br />
<br />
The Set logic looks at what tables? Inventory values and Item Average Purchase prices  to arrive at the new standard costs? or<br />
is it more than that?<br />
<br />
What happens if there are variants for the same item in the inventory as long as they are considered same items?<br />
If a cost was assigned to them based on some characteristic,<br />
would the Logic sum up all values???<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the reply.</div></div><hr />
