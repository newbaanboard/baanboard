Standard Baan capacity planning is based on production rates, rather than # units per day. <br />
<br />
What is the best way to handle this, in terms of capacity planning?</div></div><hr />

Even though BaaN plans capacity in time vs units isn't your issue simply a mathmatical excercise? I'm not sure about 5.0 so the following is what I would do in 4C. We use run time (minutes per unit) as opposed to production rate so I'll suggest what to do in terms of run time. But it'll also work using production rates, just different math. Define your bottle neck work center as available as a single resource unit, single shift and available 8 hours per day. Your capacity is thus 480 minutes per day. Next define a task with a run time of 4.8 minutes (480 minutes divided by your 100 piece finite capacity in curing). Tie the task to the curing work center. Add this task to your routing(s) for the item(s) in question and in effect you have defined your bottleneck work center's capacity as 100 units per day. Hope this helps.<br />
