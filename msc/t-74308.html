When they clicked the button I would use AFS code to run the session in the back ground to run the session with predefined parameters.  So for example - click the button I might go print shop floor orders for the item.  You can check archives and such for http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=59 to see how this is done.    Wait for an LN expert they will know more about it that me - especially since it sounds like you want to launch the session, pre-fill the item and then let user pick the remaining fields on the session.</div></div><hr />

Hello Mark,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your answer, normally it is easy to pass a variable in customized session but not with standart sessions. I will try AFS when there is not any better solution.<br />
