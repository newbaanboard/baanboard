<br />
 In Baan IVc2 (other IV versions too), there is a &quot;Work Center Utilization by Week&quot; session (tipcs6420m000) which prints Weekly breakdown of data for each workcenter and this is PRP generated data. This data is primarily read off the table tipcs610. (A different format data is present in tipcs611).<br />
<br />
We've migrated to Baan Vc and are looking for similar Weekly breakdown by Workcenter. The data generated by EP is not segregating it by Weeks.. but instead does it by a &quot;start date&quot; and a &quot;end date&quot;. This data is stored in cprrp200 table. Session is cprrp2400m000 (Print Planned Capacity Use).<br />
<br />
I'm looking for cprrp200 data to be segregated in weekly buckets. Is there any such data present in weekly buckets ? (I do not want the data from tisfc011 table). <br />
Has anyone customized data in such a format ?<br />
<br />
(Its strange that Baan decided to remove such a good feature. If I have to segregate the data in weekly buckets myself, I'll more or less have to rewrite the EP code to calculate capacity, resources, calender days, availability etc etc).<br />
<br />
All help is appreciated. Thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">10th January 2005, 23:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at cprmp3501m000 - Resource Master Plan.  This will show you demand and capacity by the periods you have set up for your planning scenarios.<br />
This uses table cprmp101 Capacity Use by Period<br />
<br />
Periods set up in cprpd4120m000.  Set periods as weekly buckets for as far out as you need.  I use weekly (7 days) out about 18 months and then switch to 4 week.<br />
<br />
Can see the same information in a chart via cprmp3701m000.  Personally I find I do better charting by taking data from cprmp1001 to Excel and do my charts there.<br />
<br />
You do, of course, have the Work Center Utilization by Week - tisfc1402m000, but I find that not real useful in doing longer range planning since it only shows active work orders.  That's why for my regular capacity analysis i use reports I generate using data from cprmp101.  I also use multiple planning scenarios to allow for doing &quot;what if's&quot;.</div></div><hr />

thnks for your reply. <br />
The period you mentioned in the &quot;rmp&quot; table is not a what I'm looking for.<br />
If the period is split across weeks, the actual breakup is not done according to the capacity/availability etc.<br />
What I'm looking for, is a literal weekly breakdown of the cprrp200 data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">10th January 2005, 23:41</div></div><div class="posttext">This does work for me.  It might depend on how you have set up your periods and the rolling frequency of your planning scenario.  have been doing this for over three years with weekly periods.  You do have to play a little at the beginning with the reference date you set for a scenario and the rolling frequency.  Then be sure to roll the scenario on a regular basis.  I set up to roll the scenario along with the weekend full ERP run.</div></div><hr />
