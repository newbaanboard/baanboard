<br />
My name is srikanth, i am working as a functional consultant this below is the current error which i am facing<br />
<br />
we have a customization for creating adjustment order through importing data from a csv file,<br />
<br />
once the data has been imported and a adjustment order is created successfully and all the lines are created without any problem.<br />
<br />
all the items are lot controlled so when aver we process the adjustment order we face the below error<br />
<br />
TCSTL0002: ADJUSTMENT ORDER LINES<br />
<br />
TOTAL VARIANCE OF LOTS/SERIALS CANNOT BE GREATER THAN THE ORDDER LINE VARIANCE (0 EA)<br />
<br />
but when we enter the same data manually in adjustment order it is processed successfully.<br />
<br />
so kindly suggest why is the error coming only when we process the adjustment order created through customization but not when we enter manually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If its customized, then you will need to check if under debug mode exactly at which point the problem is caused. You might need the technical consultants help in case you cant debug the program.<br />
<br />
If possible put your code here. That would let people to help you.<br />
<br />
One question, if its a lot controlled item and you are adjusting the quantitly in that lot, check if the date is the same as seen in stock point inventory.</div></div><hr />
