<br />
I have some questions :<br />
<br />
1. What is the relationship between Production Order and Operation ?<br />
2. Can I just use the Operation to replace the production order ? <br />
    In other word, I just use the Operation to capture the actual activity  <br />
    and actual cost of shopfloor (not use the production order)<br />
3. On my company, we have problems on maintain the production order. <br />
    Every week, we release so much production orders. <br />
    And to solve this problem, we decided to replace the function of production<br />
    order with operation. Will this decision solve the problem ?<br />
    <br />
Any suggestions for us ?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

generally speaking every manufactered item can be assigned a routing which consists of one or many operations. This routing decribes the entire process of manufacturing. This step is an option, not a must (Baan IV).<br />
When rising a production order for this item, the routing information is copied into production planning for every operation. If you skip the routing you won't get a production planning entry. These entries can also be deleted manually. Is that what you want to achieve?<br />
A convenient method in handling a large number of production oders might be the RPT (Repetitive Manufacturing) module. It's worth a try  :cool: .<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

<br />
If I may add a few things in addition to what Martin has said.<br />
<br />
1. An operation is normally what it takes to complete one item. For example if you have an item that need to go through 5 process to get done, then you might want to define 5 operations for it. The item here doesn't necessarily be a sellable finished goods.<br />
<br />
2. It might work but you must define clearly which goes as Operation and which goes as Production Order. When using operations, you may be able to capture the cost but not the quantity.<br />
<br />
3. Repetitive can be used but that relies on the nature of your manufacturing environment. You use repetitive only if you make same item with the same process over and over again and with little or no deviations in either the process or the machines used to perform that process (I think quite similar to the process industry). Otherwise it would be as troublesome as regular Production order. Please correct me if I am wrong..<br />
<br />
Using operations might help in reducing the # of production orders issued, but as I said, you need to define clearly which belongs as operations and which others that must use production order as this would change the way your inventory (esp WIP) look like.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you very much for answering my questions.<br />
If you don't mind, i want to ask more questions :D<br />
<br />
1. At this time, our company use only the Report Orders Completed (tisfc0520m000). If one day we also want to use the Report Operations Completed (tisfc0530m000) as a mandatory session, do we need any modification on our master data like BOM, manufacturing parameters, so on ? If yes, what are the modifications that we need ?<br />
<br />
2. If we use the Report Operations Completed (tisfc0530m000), what are the changes that will happen on our inventory system ?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for any questions.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Marsel</div></div><hr />

1) You need operations of course and, if you want to make them mandatory, define those as count points. If you use backflushing, you'll be able to assign the materials to specific operations, so that only those materials are issued which are actually needed.<br />
<br />
2) Your inventory system (I suppose it's Baan as well) isn't affected. The manufactured item can be posted to inventory as soon as the last mandatory operation (count point) is completed. The session can be started with the zoom option from Report Operations Completed (tisfc0530m000) as well.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
