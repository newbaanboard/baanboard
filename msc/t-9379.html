Is this a  functionality issue or it is captured somewhere else? like in Hours Accounting module?<br />
<br />
How are you dealing with this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 04:13</div></div><div class="posttext">You will need to customize to achieve your requirement. A field can be added to the Production Planning table (tisfc010) and one library need to be modified so that whenever the operation is marked as completed, this field is accordingly updated.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, the new field can be added to the form of Report OPerations Complete and the date defaulted to 'today'. This would not need any source code changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It might not be as straight forward, but whenever certain quantity is reported as produced against a production order, an entry will be created in the Financial Integration record with origin of Production and transaction type Completion. The date you're looking for is recorded there<br />

<br />
Paul P: I think the date that is recorded in the integration transaction is when the production order is complete and not the each operation.<br />

Thanks!<br />

<br />
BaanERP does record the completion of each operation in the financial integration record. Sorry, it might not be the case with your BaanIV<br />
