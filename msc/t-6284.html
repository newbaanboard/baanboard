<br />
We have not changed job during the 20 weeks running it at the same time each week <br />
<br />
Is there any particular log file that can be interrogated to assist in understanding reason for this category of error  or can anyone assist in any other suggestions<br />

Thanks in hope !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pls. take a look into $BSE/log directory.<br />
For example log.ba6.1 or log.bshell or the others.<br />
Also you can take a look into Display Job History Messages ttaad5512m000 Sometimes you can find the problem there too.<br />
Are you running Baan on UNIX / ORACLE?<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks , we had already looked in log.bshell to find nothing but your post made us rexamine logs in sure enough in log.informix we found an answer of sorts with err -458 with a message long transaction aborted ! and a recommendation in the err definition to speak to the programmers about the transaction or the aministrators about the log file size . hmmm   !!!<br />
Well we can speak to Baan but the logfile was at 100mb of a 2gb limit ! and it successfully copied it to disk !<br />
<br />
So we are still seeking a reason an a solution  !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tip Naabi0 !<br />
<br />
We did find a date outside the calendar but it was for an order which was excluded from MRP<br />
<br />
However we reran MRP last night and the &quot;problem&quot; did not reappear so we are still uncertain as to the cause</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Djie-En</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Frank,<br />
<br />
May it be the reason that a lot of records should be changed that day? And a lot of orders should be created / replanned?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
GN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi GN !<br />
<br />
Could be but no real changes from previous week or last night's run ( we are told by users)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Further to previous , we were told by Baan to increase logical log size but and MRP ran ok but we are not convinced this was cause of the problem since we had no error log messages and when we reran on our test system without increasing size of logical logs MRP ran through ok !<br />
<br />
Could it be that an application lock could have caused it ?<br />
No user was on the sytem as it was 21:00 Saturday <br />
<br />
Also two of our discs were rebuilding themselves onto the hotspares duting the weekend although we do not know the exact timings so this may have contributed</div></div><hr />
