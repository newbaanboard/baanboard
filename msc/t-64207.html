<br />
The inventory transactions session only lets you transfer PCS items between warehouse and locations and PRP warehouse orders lets you transfer customized items between PCS projects, transfer to standard item inventory and transfer standard item inventory to PCS item inventory.<br />
<br />
I am looking for a way to return PCS purchased items back to PCS inventory. <br />
<br />
Really appreciate any suggestions.<br />
<br />

Release the outbound &amp; receive the material</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">24th June 2013, 18:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Rohit, thanks. We are already doing that for planned returns. The situation we have now is after the production orders are closed.<br />
<br />
On new production orders for the same project they would like to use these purchased items that were issued earlier to a production order and were not actually used.<br />

In LN we can reset the production order status from Closed to completed, then proceed with material issue process with negative qty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">28th June 2013, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">we are using Baan4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mlahey</div><div class="date">15th July 2013, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Reset the production order back to completed using session ticst0203m000  - Reset Production Order Status. Once the production order is completed, you should be able to use Enter Material Issue for Production Order with -ve qty. I've done this lots of times in Baan IV.<br />
<br />
The only time you can't do this is if a cost price calculation has been performed that revalued the inventory after the production order closed. (Only seen this very rarely)</div></div><hr />
