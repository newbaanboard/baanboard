<br />
I got some problem with the production order. By mistake, one of the user ran the procedure &quot;Order Completed&quot; through the session &quot;Report order completed&quot; with the &quot;0&quot; delivered quantity. Now, the production order status is set as &quot;To be completed&quot; with the &quot;0&quot; delivered quantity. The status of all operations in session &quot;Production planning&quot; (tisfc1500m000) is &quot;Completed&quot;. <br />
<br />
The integration transaction &quot;Issue&quot;, &quot;subcontracting&quot; and &quot;Completion&quot; are generated in the finance, but the &quot;Receipt&quot; transaction is not generated as the delivered quantity is &quot;0&quot;. <br />
<br />
I also checked the session warehouse orders (whinh2500m000) and found that &quot;Production In&quot; transaction with the transaction type &quot;Receipt&quot; is not generated as it is usually generated for the Production orders with the delivered quantity. I also checked the session &quot;Receipts&quot; (whinh3520m000) in Warehouse and found that no receipt is exists/generated for this purchase order. I tried to create the Receipt manually in this session but not able to select the Production order from the available open order list (Expected order lines, whinh3820m000).<br />
<br />
Now problme is:<br />
1. How to push the process so that the status of production order updated from &quot;To be completed&quot; to &quot;Completed&quot; and delevered quantity should be updated to ordered quantity?<br />
2. &quot;Receipt&quot; transaction should generate in finance and warehouse with the ordered quantity.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

Because they can still charge time and issue material to the order.  At least that is what I think we do - but we are also on 4c4.</div></div><hr />

Please if you can explain a bit where (in which sessions) and what sort of adjustment can do to bring them into inventory?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th April 2006, 05:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We use the inventory adjustment session tdilc1120m00 (I think that is what it is) to adjust inventory in.  I also think one time they just stuck the parts in inventory and did a cycle count order on them.  I am not sure what they do about MAUC.</div></div><hr />
