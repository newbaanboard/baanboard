We are currently facing a problem of the average price in the item master is calculated wrongly for some of the Purchase items. It takes the last purchase price as the average price. We are unable to find any special characteristics for these items.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else faced similar problem and know the reason for the same. Please help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In second case (avpr calculation based on inventory), if your inventory is zero and you perform new purchase then avpr will equal to ltpr (because old avpr weighted with zero qty)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In LN it's tdpur0100m400 (Purchase Order Parameters), on the &quot;Parameters 2&quot; tab.<br />
<br />
Screen captures attached.<br />
<br />
If you use the Purchases(Cum) setting, you are supposed to run session Equate Balance of Receipts with Inventory Level on a regular basis. That session is tdpur4225m000 in Baan IV and tdipu0201m000 in LN.<br />
