<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bcash3</div><div class="date">9th January 2008, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a need to do purchase order lot sizing using order intervals. Our default setting for order interval is set to 10 days, but we need to increase it for B and C items such that we have the following order intervals that correspond to each ABC code: A=10, B=30, C=60. <br />
Currently, we only use ABC codes for cycle counting purposes, and those ABC codes are calculated outside of Baan in another system using the extended on hand inventory dollars at standard cost, not future demand requirements. I have 2 questions:<br />
<br />
1. Can ABC codes be linked to Order Interval for each part<br />
<br />
2. If they cannot be linked, is there a seperate session in Baan to manage Order Intervals with parameter settings available, or would this be a custom session we would need to create for ourselves?<br />
<br />
I appreciate your thoughts and input.<br />

1. If you are keying in ABC code then you can have a business logic in item master session, though ABC is read ony field in Baan, it can be made as input also.<br />
2. If the external system is updating ABC code then you can also do at that point in time update the order interval based on some rules. <br />
3. The last option would be to create a custom session.<br />

I think all you are asking is if the code is A then 10 days, if B then 20 days and if C then 30 days. Please remember this is in working days. <br />
