<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">25th July 2003, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
We have a similar problem and we run process delivered purchase orders (PDPO?) overnight Monday to Friday. <br />
<br />
However, the problem is more of an inconvienence as it has always cleared within a day or two. <br />
<br />
After a bit of thought and discussion here we assume that PDPO does not always pickup completed receipts etc. and the missed ones take an extra day or so to clear through.<br />
<br />
If you do not run PDPO regularly I would suggest you run PDPO twice (maybe add PDSO in between?).<br />
<br />
Once you have run it twice, try to run PDPO regularly. How often ?depends on the amount of logistic data being created. But I guess you are looking at a minimum of once a week. (we do it daily see above)<br />
<br />
Although not really a logistic session you may find running session tfgld4201m000 (post integrations to finance) on a regular basis could help as it will keep some of the tables tidy.<br />
<br />

<br />
You mention that you have matched the invoice in accounts payable, but has it also been approved?  This is a necessary step in completing the purchase transaction, as if the status is only matched, it can be unmatched and the amount changed.  BaaN will not allow a project to close until the invoice is matched AND approved.<br />
<br />
Also, be sure that there are no lingering backorders regarding the purchase order lines in question.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

This will show how far the order has progressed to completion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">29th July 2003, 22:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - <br />
<br />
Penfold is correct - you would be wise to check the status of the purchase order in the &quot;Display Purchase Order Line Status&quot; session.<br />
<br />
We have had situations where the &quot;Print Purchase Invoice&quot; or &quot;Print Claims&quot; step was skipped, and this held up the purchase order from being processed to history.  If those steps are part of your order type, it is necessary to run them, even if you only print them to your PC screen rather than to paper.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<br />
Thank for prompt reply.<br />
<br />
There is no nay pending back order. Also all orders (Purchase, Production, Sales) status is closed.<br />

Is there any other reason ?<br />
