<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">3rd March 2006, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question regarding the functionality of the Print Work Center Utilization by Week (tisfc1402m000).  On February 18th we upgraded from Baan IV SP 13 to SP19.  Since then I have been receiving calls that this report is not behaving properly.<br />
<br />
If we have production order 100000 with five operations 10-50 and for simplicity let's say that the associated workcenters are A10-A50.  It is my understanding that when the production order is first released to the shop the report will display all five operations, one under its associated workcenter.  When operation 10 is reported complete, and this report is run again only workcenters A20-A50 (operations 20-50) should be displayed.  At least that is what all of my production people are telling me.<br />
<br />
Baan support has told me that all operations will show up on the report until the production order no longer shows up production planning.  Which is true?  Is there a session that updates the production planning?<br />
<br />
I'm not very well versed on the shop floor control side of Baan and any assistance you could provide would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd March 2006, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if this is helpful.  After one upgrade when we completed orders the utilization tables were not being updated.  We got a fix, but I had to run tisfc1201m000(WARNING - it deletes all the records then rebuilds them).  This was back when we were on 4c3.  It was my understanding back then that when some operation was completed these records (tisfc011 table I remember) were deleted.  This prevented them from appearing on the reports(Priority and Utilization).  Sorry I do not remember more, but it has been at least 2 years since I looked at these tables. You might want to check tisfc011 after an operation is completed, see if it is gone from the table, and then see if it is on the report.<br />
<br />
I did find one order on our system that had operation 10 completed.  This operation was not in tisfc011 and did not come out on the utilization report.  I think we are on SP16 or 17.  We have SP19 to install in the next month or so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">6th March 2006, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing like have three different problems, and trying to trouble shoot them as one issue.  Due to a failed batch-job and two separate incidents of user error there appeared to be issues on this report.  I was able to pick and pull and sort it all out and resolve the issues (all of them).  <br />
<br />
Mark thanks again for your suggestion.</div></div><hr />
