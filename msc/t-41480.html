Use this session to subcontract operations which you had not planned to subcontract when you defined their routing. Select a range of operations for each production order that you want to change. These operations are redefined as subcontracting operations, assigned to the subcontractor, work center and machine you enter.<br />
This session updates the planning of the production orders that you select:<br />
The work center is changed to the work center that you have assigned to the subcontractor.<br />
The capacity utilization of the original work center is transferred to the subcontracting work center.<br />
The remaining production time and new production date are calculated.<br />
If you define an operation as subcontracted in this session, and then later want to define it as a nonsubcontracted (internal) operation, you must use the Production Planning (tisfc0110m000) session to reassign a normal (internal) work center as a subcontracting work center.<br />
After you have defined subcontracting operations, you must create purchase orders for those operations in the Generate Subcontracting Purchase Orders (tisfc2250m000) session.</div></div><hr />

Do you use LN?<br />
In LN, i think you can check the enterprise unit of  department for work center for subcontracting and costing work center, compare with the calculation office in default production order data session (for the related production order series).<br />
Because i have use this, but didnt find that message.</div></div><hr />
