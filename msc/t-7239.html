After 10 days we cannot use the items anymore. If we run MRP the System wants to use them like normal item. Even if we use charges and say the items are blocked -the MRP wants to use them. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to make the MRP known that he should not use expired oder blocked items ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
the only way I know to make an item 'invisible' for the MRP is to change the order system from MRP to Manual or SIC. But I have to admit that I'm not an ILC specialist.<br />

If you wanted to manually take them out of production you could transfer them to another warehouse (non-nettable) that is not available to MRP.  I assume that is what you would be doing with overage inventory anyway, to avoid accidental usage.</div></div><hr />
