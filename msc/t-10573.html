The quantity can be posted both from the report operation complete field and the Hours Accounting session. The process Hours Accounting session updates the quantity in tisfc001. <br />
<br />
I have a situation where the Operations are independent of other operations<br />
For Eg.<br />
I have four operations - 10, 20, 30, 40. We can start in any order and finish the operation. At the same time we want to keep a track on the No of Hours spent by a an employee to complete a particular quantity.<br />
When entering hours in session &quot;tihra1101m000&quot; if we have many operations then we are forced to enter hours in above sequence of operations.<br />
If we enter hours for operation 20 first then session gives error report &quot;Qty completed for operation 20 of production is too high&quot;.<br />
How do I take care of this kind of situation where the quantities have to be posted not necessarily in a sequence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are your operations/taska restrictive? If so quantity completed in a subsequent opertion can not be more than the quantity completed in the previous operation. So you can achieve what you want by making operation restricitive as 'No'. However the last operation has to be restrictive.<br />
<br />
You can also achieve what you want by having a dummy operation 50 and in the operation relationship you can maintain <br />
10 -&gt; 50, 20 -&gt; 50 and so on</div></div><hr />

If it is discrete environment then better to define each operation as a Production item and each order can be completed in parallel or in any sequence. This will offcourse lead to more Order handling.<br />

<br />
We try to find something to fix the same problem like that. <br />
<br />
&quot;If we enter hours for operation 20 first then session gives error report &quot;Qty completed for operation 20 of production is too high&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you means by =&gt; Are your operations/taska restrictive? Which paramet is it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Since you are using Baan IV and not process (discrete) to avoid that message occuring, when your operations are in parallel or independent of each other, will require a customization.<br />
<br />
I had developed that customization for one of my customers in Canada.<br />
<br />
Contact whoever customizes your Baan in your Country to handle it.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
