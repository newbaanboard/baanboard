Given the need for system housekeeping to support archiving, what is the correct process to close such a production order?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if you're using LN or BaaN.<br />
<br />
But logically, when you've already completed the operations with some quantities, this means, that you've done the work to some extent. I only see &quot;Short Closing the Order&quot; as an option.<br />
<br />
Correct me if my assumptions are wrong.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">1st November 2017, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your replys.  I am using Baan IVc4.  Our normal process is<br />
Release Production Orders<br />
Print Production Orders<br />
Report Operations Complete<br />
Complete Production Orders<br />
Close Production Orders.<br />
<br />
We presently do not using hours accounting.<br />
<br />
So, when a sales order is cancelled by customer which justified canceling a production order, I have typically deleted any completed operations and cancelled the production order.<br />
<br />
Now our factory manager would like to know the incurred costs of the above scenario, so what should the process be?  Complete the production order with a zero quantity?</div></div><hr />

Your biggest decision is what to do about material that has already been issued to the order during earlier operations. Are you going to back it out and return to stock or consume it anyway? if consuming it anyway you can report a quantity rejected at the last operation completed and then complete the order for 0 end items.</div></div><hr />

Most of our BOMs are phantom items, so material is less of a concern.  But if material is issued to production order, deleting completed operations will put the material back in stock.<br />

<br />
I've read your statement &quot;deleting completed operations will put the material back in stock&quot;, and it is bit surprising for me. Could you elaborate what exactly you're doing (with a screen shot if possible)? <br />
<br />
As rightly said by @Gary, you can either get the material back from the Work Center to the Warehouse, or you can complete the Order with ZERO Quantity.<br />
<br />
Let me know your comments!</div></div><hr />
