<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">achavezf</div><div class="date">12th February 2007, 02:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi every one,<br />
&gt; I am using MBC fucntionallity for future changes and I have problems <br />
&gt; to implement it, here is the example:<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; 1. A newly created finishedgood starts with an engineering item <br />
&gt; revision of &quot; 0&quot;. With MBC (ECO) the new engineering item revision of <br />
&gt; &quot; 1&quot; is created with a future date.If now another MBC (ECO) is done <br />
to <br />
&gt; this same finishedgood, the new engineering item revision becomes &quot; 2 <br />
&gt; &quot; but copied from old engineering item revision  &quot; 0 &quot; because Item <br />
&gt; engineering revision &quot; 1 &quot; is not yet effective. The changes in <br />
&gt; engineering item revision &quot; 2 &quot; do not include revision &quot;<br />
&gt; 1 &quot;.This is a problem.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; 2. And the other issue is that we cannot reschedule date in MBC <br />
(ECO's <br />
&gt; ) in production. I mean if I schedule somethig for 31-03-2007 and for <br />
&gt; some production issue I want to reschedule to 15-02-2007.<br />
&gt; The system does not allow to do it.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Thanks for your help.<br />
&gt;</div></div><hr />

Are you making changes on the same BOM line item of the FG? I need to know this first before I can give my comment on your problem.  Thks</div></div><hr />

Were you able to finalized your MBC? <br />
yes<br />
Are you making changes on the same BOM line item of the FG? <br />
no<br />
<br />
What we are looking for is to have the capability to reschedule MBC related to a date not to an e-item revision<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maspogi</div><div class="date">15th February 2007, 02:22</div></div><div class="posttext">You can not delete or reset the Effectivity date right? It is frozen once approve. In that case you need to remove the PBOM and EBOM relationship. (before you proceed in LIVE company, I would suggest to test this first in your simulation company to find out what will happen). <br />
<br />
In Item master remove the E-item revision control (uncheck=NO). This will  breaks the e-item relationship. Then in E-item revision session (tiedm1100) you can start re-setting the EBOM change up to In-design, then you can now change your date. Return the E-itm revision to YES in Item Master again, Make a new Relationship in tiedm1101. Process again your changes up to Finalize. Hopefully your MBC doesn't interfere. Good luck amigo.</div></div><hr />
