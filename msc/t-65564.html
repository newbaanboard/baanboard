<br />
I want to know if it possible to define horizon to generate INV for my SIC items. for example I want to take on consideration only allocations included  in my lead time +30 days<br />
<br />
Thx:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">24th February 2014, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - if you set the INV parameters of Time Fence and constant to be 1 and 30 respectively, the system should look forward for planned inventory transactions within lead time plus 30 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bybarsse</div><div class="date">25th February 2014, 04:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for the answer<br />
<br />
But I'm not sure to understand:(, <br />
<br />
my issue is that:<br />
In the SIC items family, BaaN generate INVs when my economic stock (on hand+ on order –allocations) is less than my ROP. But, the system includes all allocations (production order or planned production order) even if the planned date is fare away of my lead time (2015-2020). So I’m looking for a solution that makes the system considering only allocations within lead time+30 days when he’ll generate INV’s.<br />
<br />
If you think your answer above is fixing the problem, please give me more details.<br />
<br />
Best regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">25th February 2014, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the setting of the Time-phased order point field in INV Parameters?<br />
<br />
If it is cleared, the system should just check the economic stock against the re-order point.<br />
<br />
If the box is ticked, the system should use the planned transactions to calculate what the economic stock should be at the end of the time fence, and compare that to the re-order point.  I've included a screenshot to show how the settings should be for your requirement.  If that doesn't work, you could send me some screenshots of the problem and i'll try to repeat it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">25th February 2014, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">System donot consider planned transaction like MRP order, planned INV orders. Basically it only considers the order that are present in tdinv150 table. As right said by Jeff the horizon is Time fence * Order lead time + constant. Also for this ot work one needs to set the &quot;Time Phased Order point&quot; to &quot;Yes:<br />

Tank you vert much. It works perfectly and réflecteur my needs. Please I ve Two morte questions:<br />
1 There any same transaction in MRP That helps me to paramètre the system reaction with safety stock (witch date to generate in RFP)?<br />
2- as a new user I need some information about BaaN. Do you Know any good logistic module book?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">3rd March 2014, 12:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
MRP works a little differently from SIC.  Firstly, MRP can generate recommendations for multi-level product structures, while SIC can only explode one BOM level.<br />
<br />
MRP uses the Safety Stock field on the item rather than the Re-order Point in SIC to show the minimum stock that should be present after all demands are satisfied.<br />
<br />
While SIC has fixed period lengths, MRP is flexible at item level by using the order interval.<br />
<br />
Where SIC uses item level time phasing for its horizon (a multiple of the lead time plus a constant), there is an MRP Parameter to set how far into the future the MRP calculation should run.  When Confirming recommendations, there is a date range setting that can limit this for individual batches.<br />
<br />
I can't really help with documents, but I've always found the Baan IV help very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bybarsse</div><div class="date">4th March 2014, 05:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jeff and thanks a lot for the details,<br />
In fact, I understand the difference between a SIC and an MRP order system. But, the big issue in my case, we don't keep BOM for the items because we are running a customise assembly manufacturing. So, we have to manage almost 20,000 items individually most of them are SIC. Also we have some MRP forecast items (critical or expensive ones). But managing forecasts is big work load, because all transactions are manually done  (create an cleaning forecasts). In the other side SIC is not a perfect  ordering system.<br />
Actually, I think there are two ways to improve our supply strategy:<br />
1.	create a mass forecast tool to load the items and the forecast in the system and to clean them after, or<br />
2.	to create a phantom collector (assembly). I thank it should be a manufactured item that I don't have to build but just to put in my MRP<br />
Do you have any idea how to create a manufacturing assembly phantom? or how to create a mass forecast?<br />
By the way could you please show me how the: &quot; MRP Parameter to set how far into the future the MRP calculation should run&quot;<br />
<br />
Thank you very much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">5th March 2014, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you familiar with the statistical forecasting facility within SIC?  If you have lots of SIC items it should be an option, although it does base its calculation on historical usage rather than a build plan.  I've attached a screenshot of the parameter for the horizon in MRP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bybarsse</div><div class="date">7th March 2014, 05:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jeff<br />
I’m not sure to understand “statistical forecasting facility within SIC”. Is it choosing forecast method (moving average/exponential smoothing) to calculate ROP, safely stock and EAI. If it’s that, we are using it. If not please advise. <br />
Also do you have any idea about how to use phantom (create, build plan) without build it or keep it in stock.<br />
<br />
And thank for every thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">11th March 2014, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds as though you are using SIC forecasting.  Underlying it is a normal distribution table, where the relationship of desired service level and number of mean absolute deviations of safety stock is held.  The higher the desired service level, the more multiples of the MAD need to be held.  When the forecast is run it calculates the safety stock needed, then adds the lead-time fill quantity to give the re-order point.<br />
<br />
When you mention phantoms, do you mean the normal situation where the phantom is actually a subassembly that is made and consumed within the next level of manufacture without its own production order?  If so, I'm not familiar with the combination of Phantoms and SIC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">11th March 2014, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">One cannot forecast phantom in SIC. System calculayes the ROP and other parametets  based on actual issues(production issue or sales issue etc). Normally, a phaton has no issue unless you sell or use them. If so then it may forecast such. But remember system sees a stock of phantom it will first use up that inventory. You ma have to elaborate your scenario more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bybarsse</div><div class="date">12th March 2014, 04:12</div></div><div class="posttext">What your are describing reflect perfectly how we are calculating parameters for SIC items. So, there is any better way to manage them? Is that the statistical forecast that you mentioned before? If not please give me more details.<br />
About phantom items. Like I said before, we don’t keep BOMs’ because we are running customize assembly business, we have to manage our entire first level item (20000 sku). Most of them are SIC, but expansive or critical ones are MRP forecast items. And it’s a very demanding work load to create and clean forecast for each part. So I’m asking if it’s possible to create an MRP phantom item, like top collector, in it BOM I’ll put some MRP forecast items (maybe for each supplier I’ll create a phantom with a BOM for all his items). And it’ll be easier to create and clean forecast for the phantom only. But I don’t want to buy or build or stock this phantom. I hope I make it clearer for you Gurus, but I’m not sure if this scenario could exist?<br />
Another question: is it possible to freeze some stock in the system?  Don’t let people issuing the safety stock for the example!<br />
<br />
Thanks for you both:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">12th March 2014, 05:16</div></div><div class="posttext">The basic principle of forecasting is one should only forecast the independent demand. In your case it seems the demand for these 2,000 skus is not completely independent, hence if you try to forecast such, it shall be erroneous. If you can identify the depedency then try to forecast that. There is a concept of generic item and generic BOM and that may fit your need. In such case one may forecast the Generic item, and system will create demand for components of Generic BOM. Since, generic in itself will have no transaction, so the trick will be how to get the forecast for generic. ANd I guess that can be figured out. <br />

I'll try to identify all may parts with independent demand. Could you please show mw how to create generic items with generic BOM’s. It seems filling exactly our needs:). And I’ll start building BOM’s for items with independent demand. <br />
<br />
By the way any suggestion to freeze a specific stock level?  ( to avoid using my safety stock;))<br />
