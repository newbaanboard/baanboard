<br />
Check, in ERP LN 6.1 FP2,<br />
<br />
# tcibd0501m000 ( Itemdata ) and in tcibd0101s000 ( Item - general ) in Grouping Data section the &quot;Cost Component&quot; is attached to that Item. Read the information in Help provided against it.<br />
<br />
# tcmcs0148m000 ( Cost Components ) here the Cost Components are created, which would have been eventually attached to the Items. The extra information is available thru Help in this section.<br />
<br />
The further use of this element thru Production to the Finance part has to be established by you.<br />
<br />
Cost components can be of the following cost types:<br />
Material costs.<br />
Operation costs.<br />
Surcharges on material costs.<br />
Surcharges on operation costs.<br />
WIP transfer costs.<br />
General costs.<br />
<br />
So whatever list you prepare will be distributed in these types only. The list can not be made readily available by anyone else, but should be prepared by you as per business need of your organisation.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.<br />
<br />
For further clarification &amp; help, please consult the onsite Project Consultants &amp; the Key Users, and get it clarified.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />
