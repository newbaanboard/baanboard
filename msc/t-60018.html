You can maintain operation related overhead costs (hourly basis) at ticpr1150m000. Apart from there if you want to maintain some fixed surcharges against the item then you can maintain it at ticpr1110m000 session and you also need to check the 'Surcharges by Item'checkbox provided at Item-Costing session ticpr0107m000 under 'Options'heading.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
Basically, I want to know, if a machine Depriciation of Rs 250000, how can I distributed to it on Items. If that consumed Consumables for Rs 10000, how can include it in the Item cost through surcharge.<br />
<br />
I think, If I defined it through surcharge the cost is fixed. Is there any work around available in the system for recording this.<br />
<br />

<br />
The machine depriciation amount and consumed amount need to be distributed among the items, so that you can get the item std costing, but is there any fixed number of items or do you know the percentage being consumed by each item for the same machine and same consumables?<br />

Good morning,<br />
<br />
We have both conditions,<br />
<br />
1. Basically few machines are used for producing number of items. The production quantity is based on the customer requirements. We don't specify the number of qty, which is to be produced on that machine.<br />
<br />
2. Few machines are specific for a particular items.<br />
<br />
Please suggest, in both conditions, how we get the solutions.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
