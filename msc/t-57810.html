<br />
The 'Definitively Closed' flag will be set to 'yes' when having deleted financial transactions (tcfin1200m000) for your project. The idea is that you cannot reopen projects when financial transactions have been removed, for closing again could cause incorrect COGS transactions. It seems that you want to set this flag for the wrong reasons (at least, not the reason that it is designed for).<br />
