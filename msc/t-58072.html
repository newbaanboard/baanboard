<br />
We have the problem in our business where we find that inaccuracies in our WIP warehouse W01 are causing planning issues.<br />
<br />
Our warehouses are as follows<br />
B01 - Stores<br />
W01 - WIP<br />
D01 - Despatch<br />
<br />
All these warehouses are nettable and we cannot set W01 to non nettable as it is a backflush warehouse.<br />
<br />
We are trying to get our inventory in W01 more accurate but in the meantime is there any way to plan and run MRP on our B01 stores warehouse only.<br />
<br />
Cheers Neal</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arvind in respect of setting the warehouse before and after MRP run, I think the only way to do this would via GTM. Is this safe ? Would I have to be careful about running any other processes at the same time. Could there be any other side effects ?<br />
<br />
Flip In respect of running SIC I think if we went in this direction we'd be throwing away too much of the supply chain areas of the system. Ideally we would like to stick to Sales Schedule demand generating Purchase Schedule demand.<br />

This is/was one of our bottle neck criteria for ERP LN as Baan iV has no such function and you need to implement workarounds as described above</div></div><hr />

The nettable flag is used by planning enigines only. Typically MRP/MPS runs are done in batch mode and after hours, so one can build some rules to acheive this. I don't meant byt GTM, but doing it through program. So when MRP is called (say in batch mode), then set the nettable flag first and once the program is done then reset it. <br />
I have done this in past.<br />

I'll get my test company up to date and try it out.<br />

<br />
We have a &quot;problem&quot;, when BaaN was implemented back in 1999. A solution to avoid planning for some Sales Orders; they decided to put the Plan Delivery Date &quot;way ahead&quot; in the future (2020), they set the MRP time horizon for 2000 days, so, a solution for the fist 14 years. They hard coded reports and sessions with conditions for year 2020. This date is coming closer and you can immagine all work has to be done to solve this.<br />
<br />
I am planning to get rid of the &quot;solution&quot; above here by using the approach you suggested above in the thread, by moving back and forth the &quot;Nettable/Non-Nettable&quot; in the background.<br />
<br />
My question is, why move the flag back and forth instead of moving a Sales Order from a non-nettable to a nettable warehouse when we want this order to be planned?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the only thing one needs to change is to change warehouse in tdinv150. But then there will be lot of transactions,so changing the flag is an easier option. Also, if you change the warehouse for those orders then you will need to adjust the allocated quantity in tdinv001 and also update tdinv150, tdsls041, tdsls045. You can keep them in the new warehosue and when time comes you can switch the warehouse. Either approach will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">22nd March 2013, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Avpatil,<br />
<br />
thanks for your prompt reply. <br />
<br />
When I change back and forth the warehouse in the Sales Order from non-nettable to nettable, all tables are proplery updated with the new warehouse code; tdsls041, tdsls045, tdinv150 right after the warehouse is changed. The only thing is the allocated inventory that it gets increased by the new order qty which I believe is fine.<br />
<br />
I ran MRP and, does what supposed to do, does not plan for a non-nettable whse.<br />
<br />
I could create a nettable warehouse(nettable) for sales order entry and move the flag to non-nettable when MRP runs but, I still not seeing the difference with changing the warehouse at Sales Order level. We do change the Plan Delivery Date anyways for every sales order line when time to plan.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
Thanks again and I appreciate your inputs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">22nd March 2013, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">You can achieve same thing <br />
<br />
1. by putting a non nettable warehouse on sales order lines- Actually you don't even have to change sales order line, just tdinv150 warehouse is enough.<br />
<br />
2. Or by changing the netteable flag in warehouse.<br />
<br />
So either of this will work. You may want to check if any other process is getting affected due to this work around like any reports etc..</div></div><hr />
