Usually, the standard cost will only be updated annually, but I have seen where releasing the order too soon has been an issue.  I have also seen where accounting has an issue with this, especially on production orders with significant production cycle time.<br />
<br />
It has been a year since I touched Baan, but I believe there is an option on the Production Order session that allows you to update the costs (BOM/routing) associated with the production order with the current date (or specified date).  I'm not certain if you can change this once released.  If memory serves me, releasing created the warehouse orders for the components.  This makes me think that you can't 'reset' to standard once released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">29th March 2004, 22:55</div></div><div class="posttext">The Estimated Cost of the Order are based upon when the Order is created.  You can replan the order until the Order is released.  At release the Estimated Cost are frozen.  If the Routing or Bill of Materials are modified you will have your variance between Estimated (Standard) and Actua Cost which is what Finance looks at.  Hope this helpsl</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is still possible to modify the estimated materials and routing even after release of production order and no variance will be reported, subject to the condition that actual processing of production orders (issue of materials or reporting of production quantities) has not started (ie the order status is not in active state).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">30th March 2004, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">So...if you have released the production order, but have not touched the associated, component warehouse orders, and you go into Estimated Materials and change components, what happens to the warehouse orders?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are on Baan IV and I am talking about SFC module. By Warehouse orders are referring to PRP warehouse orders or some thing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">31st March 2004, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">In BaaN 5 you have the option of when to freeze estimated costs for production orders.  In tisfc0502m000 - Default Production Order Data you can select to freeze estimates at Order Creation; at Order Release; or Before the first WIP transaction.  So, it is possible to make changes to the order that would not get reported as variance if this is set and changes were made before the first WIP transaction.</div></div><hr />
