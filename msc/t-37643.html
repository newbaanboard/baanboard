<br />
At the moment when we enter 2 sales orders in de system for 1 partnumer with delivery on the same day. After generating MRP I get 1 order for the total quantity. I would like to get 2 different productionorders 1 for each sales order. How can I do this?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

Which type of Mfg environment are you in? In our case, we generate production order for every sales order automatically as we are in STO environment.<br />
<br />
Anyway you can try to set &quot;Maximum number of MRP orders in a day&quot; while generating MRP. See if it makes some difference. MRP by concept tries to collect all the requirement. I am nost sure what implication it may have on the subsequent level items in BOM? So will you also need to generate one for one production/purchase order for subsequent level. Then I guess, Project is the best route, but then it adds some transaction, though lot of them can be automated easily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">18th June 2007, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">LFL (lot for Lot) will not result this. LFL only means the order quantity will equal the demand (if other things like Order multiple, Order interval etc doesn't come play into picture).</div></div><hr />

Then it is not possible for MRP to generate purchase/production order to correspding demand. However, you may be able to do some customization.  Other option would be to use project.<br />
