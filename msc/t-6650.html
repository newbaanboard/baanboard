We want to be able to copy e-items and e-boms to two different logistic companies so both item masters have the same revision level for an item.  It seams that there will be a problem with the finalization process, any ideas? <br />

Thanks in advance for any input.</div></div><hr />

I have no specific experience in sharing EDM tables but sharing in general. Sharing EDM tables seems like a possible thing to do but you'll have to analyze other reference tables which will have to be shared as well, for example: Item Groups, Engineering Item Groups,Units, Projects (PCS) - if used.<br />

Good lucK!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baaner</div><div class="date">12th September 2002, 12:52</div></div><div class="posttext">We implemented an external EDM software developed by a customer that did update the tables in a multisite enviroment. We didn´t share the EDM tables though... I think it´s feasible to do, but having in mind some possible problems, like consistency of data from the EDM to the ITM tables (do the 2 companies have the same codes, both in ITM and EDM?) Also, you would have to develop something not to update tables like tiedm101 when you make the copy, or not share that table, in which case you would have to develop something to work with that table...</div></div><hr />

However, my Baan IV Multisite documentation (very old), lists EDM tables that can be shared so I assume there are no insurmountable obstacles. It does not, however, indicate which other tables (e.g., ITM) must also be shared so I would use caution and look for other tables that would be logical to share.<br />
