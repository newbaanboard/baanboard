<br />
I am hoping to track materials through the completed routings.   Is this possible?<br />
<br />
<br />
For instance, I have an order that has machinging and finishing on it.  If I complete the maching routings and not the finishing routing, then the machining materials will be issued to the machining warehouse, correct?</div></div><hr />

If the material is needed at op 70, why plan for it when op 10 is scheduled to start?  Especially for production orders with extremely long cycle times.  Plan for it to coincide when op 70 is scheduled to start.</div></div><hr />
