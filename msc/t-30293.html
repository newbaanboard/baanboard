We fancy to use Project Budget part under that manufacturing module. We produced items (produck). We define projects for  each products. When we deliver it to customer, We want to follow extra budget for this product. Because we provide warranty with 2 years for each product. After deliverid it,<br />
we want to calculate budget among product warranty time. In this way we can calculate real project budget. <br />
<br />
HOW CAN WE HANDLE THIS ? <br />
<br />
IS IT TRUE TO USE PROJECT BUDGET? <br />
<br />
ARE THERE ANY easy WAY to handle it in baan standarts ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks ALL</div></div><hr />

If providing a 2 year warranty is important enough for your business you should use BAAN the way it was intended and make sure warranties are defined in BAAN IV Service. Then you can link tssma to tipcs for the financial integration transactions and you will have the full picture in Finance instead of Manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, and it has been a long time ago I worked on the integration between tipcs and tssma in IV.<br />
It will not be easy to find any documentation on this specific matter as there is hardly anybody left in the BAAN community who is familiar with the integration between tipcs and tssma.<br />
I am very sure the solution I suggested can be done this way but unfortunately I do not have a BAAN IV system at my disposal to test it out for you.<br />
<br />
However, if you are interested in the solution I propose then your company can benefit from utilizing BAAN IV Service for the service &amp; maintenance business that is done during and possibly after the 2 year sales warranty.<br />
If you decide to build the solution within tipcs you will not use BAAN the way it was intended and this will only lead to all sorts of issues and problems down the road.</div></div><hr />
