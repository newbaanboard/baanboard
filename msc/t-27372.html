<br />
We are on Baan IVb. We intend to go to Baan IVc4 and also to implement the new automotive extension AGS2. <br />
<br />
Should we install IVc4 and the automotive extension and then migrate our data or should we go to IVc4, migrate our data and then install automotive.<br />
<br />
If we install automotive after migrating the data, will we lose the data in the tables that the automotive extension modifies?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />

To avoid losing the AGS tables, you have to install 4c4 ags2 then migrate.  Are you planning to upgrade hardware?  We acquired a new box which meant we could avoid retaining the old b2 objects and VRCs on the shiny new 4c4 box.  Also it meant far less risk to the business of messing with the old live box until everything was tested properly, plus the fallback for cutover meant we could revert to the old system easily.<br />
<br />
What database are you using?  We had some fun with Informix database during the process!  If you need any help mail me at:<br />

Cheers, Andy</div></div><hr />
