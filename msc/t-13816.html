<br />
In purchase receipt - in case of rejection recorded in Maintain approvals, Rejected quantities got updated as Back order in the same Purchase order and in Inspect location the rejected quantity got reduced (say 100 nos received and available in Inspect location, in which 2 got rejected and 98 only available in Inspect location after maintain Approvals for Inbound).  <br />
<br />
Is it possible to bring 2 nos back to Our stock in Hold location for disposition - to Use as is or to rework and Use or to return to supplier. <br />
<br />
if we accept 100 nos thru Maintain approvals, we could not capture the rejection level against the supplier and not able  to get supplier reliability analysis (thru customisation)<br />
 <br />
If anyother work around, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks In advance</div></div><hr />

Once a qty is rejected logically it should go again thru the inspectin proces either thru reoffer with or without rework etc.Now the best way is make a new receipt for such qty against the same PO, keep a seperate receipt series. This normally takes care of all the parameters, finance, inventory, quality, vendor rating etc. Still if u have any specific query feel free to ask.<br />
