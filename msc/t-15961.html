<br />
Without the time stamp, we are not able to calculate the lead time and the waiting time between operations.<br />
<br />
Without the user ID, we are not able to identify the user who reported an operation complete. This imformation is especially useful for QC operation. Now, we have to base on paper (outside BaaN) to trace who is the QC who approved an in-process QC operation or final QC.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a better idea ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khyou99</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 07:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps auditing is my last choice. Retrieving data from audit tray is not as efficient as retrieving data from database table.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of adding fields to table tisfc010 to store the user id and the time stamp when an operation is reported complete. Anyone implemented this before ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 08:05</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a separate table parallel to tisfc010 wherein we update date,time  and user when the operation is finished . As a policy we do not amend the Baan standard tables, though u can do it technically very easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">malutz</div><div class="date">14th July 2004, 08:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We choose a simular approach. We designed a table called atisfc010 with the same fields as the original plus timestamp and user and function (Insert, Update, Delete). Then we wrote a trigger for the Baan Table ttisfc010. Within this trigger we update the atisfc010 with data records.<br />
<br />
This way no Baan table or script had to be modified.<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />

although you lose this info if you purge this table.</div></div><hr />
