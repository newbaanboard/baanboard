<br />
Production Order 0001 release for FSG A - 1000pcs<br />
Material X &amp; Y issued - 1000pcs each to processing.<br />
There are 5 routing operations for making FSG A.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question here is that if at the end of this production order only 500pcs fully completed.<br />
<br />
balance material X &amp; Y 500pcs which been release and semi process in opertion 20,30. how can i reuse it &amp; transfer for another production order.<br />

All you can do is create one more production order and remove the operations that are not reqd. This will create some variances. But then there is no balance entry for other side. I don;t knwo how ERP LN will handle it though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yunuskhan</div><div class="date">16th May 2012, 07:50</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestion is: - <br />
There will be three steps:<br />
1.	Partially complete the Production Order 0001 with 500pcs.<br />
2.	Return the balance material (X&amp;Y =500pcs) to RM warehouse by making negative issue qty in session ticst0101m000 and maintain inbound.<br />
3.          Release new order for semi finish good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexlow</div><div class="date">17th May 2012, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">seem theres not other way, have to create semi fsg code for each phase and set it as multilevel bom.<br />
<br />
tested setting the semi fsg as phantom but it doesn't allow me to return it back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here the problem is the identity of the semi-finished item, after the 2-3 operations the raw materials are transferred to different item which is currently not existing in Baan/LN system, so until we have them in Baan/LN, we can not issue them against the second (another) production order. Again to make them existing within Baan/LN we need to define the item code for the intermediate items (semi finished items) and we need to receive the same item for a particular warehouse/location before we re-issue them for another production order. Hence even though physically you can maintain and issue semi finished items to another production order, when its time to maintain the same in Baan/LN, you need to create another production order for the semi-finished item.<br />
We are helpless in this regard.<br />
