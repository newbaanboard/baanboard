We are facing this issue for teh past 2 months. Any comments/ suggestions on the below mentioned issue are most welcome.  (we are using discrete manufacturing)<br />
<br />
We are using Simulated purchase prices for updating the Std cost prices. We recorded the new simulated purchase prices for 3 raw materials and ran the session Calculate Cost prices for all raw materials (Range R to RZZZZ)with BOTTOM UP option and UPDATE COST PRICES: Yes option. The system updated the finished goods prices as per the new simulated purchase prices of raw materials, but the 3 raw material standard cost prices did not get updated (the old standard cost prices were being displayed in the item master session). The next day we updated the standard cost prices of 3 raw materials only using the same session, the raw material prices got updated in the item master.<br />
This problem is being faced only for the past 2 months. Previously we have been following this procedure for more than 3 years without any problem. We have not done any customisation or upgrade of BaaN for the past 1 year. ( We are on BaaN 4c4-SP4 and Informix IDS 7.31 is our DB, We have Baan application/database servers hosted on HP-UX servers)<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

look in the standard-cost-calculation-code.<br />
There ise defined the range, which purchase prise is base for calculation.<br />
In your case I think, the standard-purchse-prise is set before the simulatetd purchase prise in this range.<br />
Also have a look, if the simulatetd purchase price is defined for the standard-calculation-code.<br />
greetings<br />
