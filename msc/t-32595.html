<br />
When we report one prod order, wrong figure has been put and the status was set to be completed.  And now, we want to change the quantities finished. <br />
<br />
So does the system has this kind of mechanics to allow us correct the figure?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Daniel</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your only option is to adjust through warehousing or cycle counting that I know of.</div></div><hr />

this can be corrected through GTM,Change the status of operation completed field of tisfc010.then do the -ve hra and then post to the inventory by doing rep. completd in tisfc0202m000 session.It will help u.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">27th March 2007, 07:36</div></div><div class="posttext">yashwant, have you tested the implication in Baan Finance module of your suggestion? Wouldn't the variance analysis be wrongly booked in the end if people follow your suggestion? If you haven't tested this far, test it that far before suggesting such thing<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anil Menezes</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you tell me if you have reported excess qty completion in the prod order, if yes then you can issue additional material even in completed status of the order. I think this will take care of the final item cost in the finance module.<br />
But changing the status of the order through GTM is not advisable.<br />
Afters excess material issue then you can go for closing of the PO which will post the variaces entry in the finance module.<br />
<br />
But if the reported qty completion is less than the ordered qty of the PO then create an additional production order and report qty completed in this new PO. You have to check if you have to issue additioanal material or simply completed the difference qty in this prod order without issuing the material in this order.<br />
This will also take care of the final product cost.<br />
Please do not use the GTM for this type of correction.</div></div><hr />

I think all of your opnion is correct. But it also depends on the situation. Some time we can use this method. Some time others can be used.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank to all of u.</div></div><hr />
