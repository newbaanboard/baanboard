This top level item is not a phantom. The exploded BOM contains many anonymous manufactured phantoms.<br />
<br />
When generating the project structure for the sales orders tipcs2240s000 the project structure does not generate past a phantom.<br />
<br />
Is this normal? We must copy the standard product structure to the project to get the structure into the project tipcs2230m000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">8th May 2007, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems you have a customized(Order Policy: To Order) item inside a phantom item. I guess Generate Project structure doesnt customize a phantom item. When you release this into a production order it just removes the phantom item from the pbom of the main item and replaces it with the component of the phantom item..<br />
<br />
This is normal i am sure. What you could do however is go to the customized bom of the phantom item and change the Item Category of the Item you need to customize from &quot;Standard Item&quot; to &quot;Customized Item&quot;. IT will immediately ask you if you want to copy the product structure for this item from its standard version and if you click yes then it would create another customized item within that project. This when you transfer to a production order will create two production orders, one for the main item and one for the customized item inside the phantom...<br />
<br />
Hope its clear and it helps you to solve your problem...<br />
