Please help.<br />
<br />
Situation:<br />
Users have been using Triton and BaanIV for many years.<br />
In Display Planned Inventory Movement by Item (timrp1510m000), there are NO MOVEMENT and NO updating of planned quantity for a transaction in that session whenever the respective transaction is performed.  Movement or updating in that session occurs only when MRP is generate again.<br />
<br />
But recently, movement or updating in that session occurs whenever a respective transaction is performed and eventhough MRP is not generate again.<br />
<br />
<br />
REQUEST &amp; QUESTION:<br />
Is there any existing Triton or BaanIV customers out there experiencing such situation:  In Display Planned Inventory Movement by Item (timrp1510m000), there are NO MOVEMENT and NO updating of planned quantity for a transaction in that session whenever the respective transaction is performed.  Movement or updating in that session occurs only when MRP is generate again.?  Is this normal?<br />

<br />
basicly it's normal. The MRP is a kind of snapshot ot the inventory situation when the MRP run is started.<br />
However, some sessions such as 'Maintain Deliveries' do perform an update of the table (which does not really make sense to me). I'm not sure if this 'feature' was always present or introduced with a patch. <br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

Thanks for your feedback.  Our users have been using for many years.<br />
But only recently (few months ago), movement or updating in that session occurs whenever a respective transaction is performed and eventhough MRP is not generate again.  <br />
<br />
I do agree with you maybe the recently movement or updating in that session occurs is due to introduction of a patch. Before the introduction of a patch, maybe there are no movement or updating in that session until a generate MRP is performed.<br />
