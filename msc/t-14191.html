<br />
For example, I have the following BOM in logistic company 411:<br />
A is made of B<br />
and the following  BOM in logistic company 511<br />
Z is made of B<br />
<br />
What  I want is to run the MRP from the company 411 and see the requirements of both companies (A,B,Z)<br />
<br />
How is the correct way to model this functionality?<br />
How does Baan 5 work this?<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciate<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I've got it in hard copy.  I will send it if I have an e-copy.<br />
<br />
There are some other tasks besides defining supply relationships.  It helps to have consistent calendar structures.  You also need to define a multi-site planning scenario.<br />
<br />
I have not touched Baan in several months, but I have been able to get what you are describing working in several implementations.</div></div><hr />
