   Anyone had been feel that MRP planning is very slow in LN6.1 FP2 Unicode version.<br />
   My site have 100,000 plan items and 6,000,000's records in BOM.<br />
   Even we used best UNIX server and tunning Oracle performance,<br />
   it still spent 5 hours for planning only.<br />
<br />
   Does anyone had related statistic data for sharing.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

As I know, Baan's MRP engine is famous for its slow performance.:D</div></div><hr />

We have order planning in LN 6.1 which is same as MRP :D<br />
you have a big database to run MRP which is basic reason, but would like to know whether you have multi logistics scenario and share work centre situationsâ€¦?<br />
Also speed will depend on options selected while you run a MRP say Net planning change, update within time fence, pegging relations, planner signals etc etc<br />
