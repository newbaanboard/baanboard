<br />
I have one issue about backflush in BaaN IV.   BOM structure like below:<br />
Main board ( item: A)<br />
   |__ Sub board (item: B)<br />
   |                |_ Component C   usage: 1 pcs<br />
   |                |_ Component D   usage: 1 pcs<br />
   |_ other components<br />
For item B, We have production order: 1122 with quantity:5000.  this order has been reported 2 times. <br />
<br />
First time:  report 2088 pcs for order 1122, this is OK for backflush<br />
Second time:  report 2912 pcs (=5000-2088) for remaining quantity of order 1122, buckflush for item B is OK, that means inventory for B is totally 5000, but for component C or D, the backflushed quantity is 5824 which is double of usage. for all the components under that BOM have same problem. <br />
<br />
Can you help me ?</div></div><hr />

  So do you mean to say that you have received 5000pcs of Item B but backflushed (2088 + 5824)7912 pcs of Item C &amp; Item D?<br />

 <br />
I have seen some cases on Baanboard related to issues happening twice and all..Major updates have been released in later on service packs(&gt; 12) and so quite naturally one would point at your service packs. Whats your organizations policy on service packs? If you were to approach Infor, they would first tell you to upgrade your service packs..<br />
Unless someone here knows exactly how to solve this without applying service packs or any solutions, i would recommend upgrading your SP as well...<br />
