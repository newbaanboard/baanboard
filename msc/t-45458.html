<br />
We have some finish goods that need to be returned to warehouse in material with de-Assembly action.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One way (though tedious) is to go the concerned production order through which the finished good was posted to inventory and enter the part to be returned to warehouse as negative quantity and then issue.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">5th December 2007, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">This would not solve as then one will be left with parent item. You will still need to consume parent. In Baan IV the way to do is create a production order for parent and have all the component be negative quantity. Also add parent to the estimated material and then issue all of them. This will result in stock of compnents as well parent inventory is taken care of. Also, no variances would be generated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiran Gholap</div><div class="date">22nd January 2008, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Both the solutions provided above are correct but are applied to two different scenarios. <br />
<br />
1. De-assembly when the production order is not yet reported completed<br />
2. De-assembly when the production order is completed and manufactured to be dismentled item is in inventory. <br />
<br />
In ERP LN 6.1 it can be done as below<br />
<br />
For the first scenario same production order is to be to be used to dismentle and return the components to warehouse. A task of De-assembly can be added in production planning to capture De-assembly work hours and related costs.<br />
For second scenario a rework order can be created for the manufactured item to be dismentled and components to be returned are to be added in estimated materials with -ve quantity.<br />
<br />
For both the scenarios production order is to be completed with NIL quantity.</div></div><hr />
