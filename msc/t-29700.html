We get the error message when we try to save PO line: &quot;Cost Price Structure not present for this date &quot; I try to change the date, no luck.<br />
<br />
I go into ticpr0100m000 and make sure the years to look back is greater than the last CP Date for the Item.  This seems OK.<br />
<br />
I cannot run ticpr2210m000 calc cost prices I get the error &quot;Cost Price Strucutre not present for this date&quot;<br />
<br />
I cannot calculate std costs because I have economic stock ...<br />
<br />
Eeep !  I'm not sure what to look at next. Anyone run into this before ?:confused: :(</div></div><hr />

Go into the Lines of your Purchase Order and enter this item in the item code with all the necessary details that you would want to put against this item in the PO. Next i.e before saving this entry, go to Form 4 and change the Order Date to the date that is shown in field Last CP Trans. Date for this item in Item Master. Baan allows you to change this field (Order Date) in the PO Lines..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 08:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats great thanks, that fixed one of my problems  :)  yay ...<br />
<br />
I also had to copy this data to a new company number where the company will continue business without old history ( converting data to Multibyte )<br />
<br />
I have copied over tables I think are relevent. I ran this same example that you gave me and it did not work in the other company.  :(<br />
<br />
Can you tell what tables that  perhaps changing the date in this field may be looking for cost price strucutre ? Perhaps I have missing something important to copy over ...<br />
<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />

What is the error message you get when you try to enter the data in the Order Date?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Yes, tfgld9004 was run. But let's go one step back to the original company that I did your tests with that worked.<br />
<br />
I can place the PO fine, but still cannot update the cost price for that item, still says 2004.<br />
<br />
How to correct and update the cost price date ? I thought it was ticpr2210m000 but I had no luck .....Cost Price Data not Found error still  :( ...<br />
<br />
Eventually, there has to be a way to update that last CP date in item master right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">If there has been no change in the price of this item since 2004, then while running the session ticpr2210m000 it wouldnt change anything..<br />
<br />
Can you tell me exactly what date is shown in the filed Last CP Trans. Date in Item Master for this particular Item code?<br />
<br />
sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Duh on me. I guess if there is nothing to change, Baan just wont pop up a new date if nothing new has been entered ...  :o   I thought perhaps if nothing had changed but the price is still active since 04-01-2004 that it would be just fine ....  so Baan will not say that you ran a price update if you never made a change. Ok ...  interesting ...<br />
<br />
<br />
I changed purchase price by .0001 and reran ticpr2210m000 to calc std costs.  No change to the item :( ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">10th January 2007, 10:55</div></div><div class="posttext">The cost price of a Purchased Item only(i stand to be corrected) changes when the new price in a purchase order is matched and approved in Finance sessions that does invoice matching with orders. It wouldnt be a bad idea in getting someone else to confirm what i just said...but based on our company setup, this is how the cost price of a purchased item changes...<br />
