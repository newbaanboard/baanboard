<br />
It is not possible in standard Baan to prevent the user from reporting more than what is planned in &quot;report operations completed&quot;. The tolerance of +/- can be achieved by customization only. If you have the source code it is not a major problem, otherwise you can design a startup session which will ask for order no and quantity, the quantity specified to be validated against the planned quantity and if it is within the allowed tolerance, then you can zoom to report operations complete.<br />
<br />
The allocations can be handled depending on the parameter setup.  Assuming that you are in automatic backflushing mode and ILC implemented, you manually set a negative allocation in maintain estimated materials and get the material back to the inventory by generating outbound advice.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
