Can you please help to answer this.<br />
1. In currency of the Print Cost Prices by Item (ticpr2400m000), I believed that the currency rate refers to the Currency Rate (tcmcs0108m000). Refer below, what rate it will use 1.68, 1.55 or 1.7 ?<br />
Note: In Currency Rate (tcmcs0108m000), there are three types of Exchange Rate Type which are:<br />
DEF = Default Rate with currency rate = 1.68<br />
PUR = Purchase Rate with curency rate = 1.55<br />
SLS = Saleas Rate with currency rate = 1.7<br />
<br />
One more important question:<br />
2. In your answer for question 1, why do you think it select that exchange rate type and not the other two exchange rate types?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
If you use a dependent currency system (see 'companies': tcemm1170m000) then the conversion to the entered currency is done by using the internal currency rate (see same session). I can imagine that in your case 'DEF' is the internal rate as defined for the company.<br />
<br />
As far as I understand in an independent currency system the cost prices of items are stored in one or more currencies so if the cost price of an item is present in the entered currency in ticpr2400m000, then I suppose no conversion will take place at all.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Thanks for your valuable feedback.<br />
Based on our tcemmm1170s000, we are using the dependent currency system with 3 exchange rates DEF,PUR and SLS.<br />
Also in Currency Rate (tcmcs0108m000), there are three types of Exchange Rate Type which are:<br />
DEF = Default Rate with currency rate = 1.68<br />
PUR = Purchase Rate with curency rate = 1.55<br />
SLS = Saleas Rate with currency rate = 1.7<br />
<br />
We expect the currency in the Print Cost Prices by Item (ticpr2400m000) should refer to DEF as also expected from you.<br />
However, the printout showed the report used PUR with the currency rate of 1.55.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea why it did not use the expected DEF (the internal rate)  as expected by you and me?<br />
Then will this system using of PUR instead of DEF will give a wrong costing reporting?<br />
<br />
Hope you have further idea why it react like that way.<br />

Sorry, I have overlooked in other company.<br />
In the correct company, the exchange rate in tcemmm1170s000 is PUR for internal.<br />
<br />
It explained the print cost by item is using the PUR rate.<br />
<br />
CASE CLOSED.<br />
THANKS .<br />
