<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">30th June 2003, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets say we make three items, A, B, and C. <br />
<br />
When we run the items in the following sequence, we have the following setup/chnageover times:<br />
<br />
A, B, C<br />
setup for A = 1 hour<br />
setup for B = 2 hours<br />
setup for C = 1 hour<br />
<br />
C, B, A<br />
setup for A = 30 minutes<br />
setup for B = 6 hours<br />
setup for C = 2 hours<br />
<br />
<br />
How do we account for this in the routers in terms of both cost and planning? The setup time depends on the combination of what is run and when it is run, so I cannot put a single time into the router. I need to ba able to capture the costs, and to add this into the lead time for planning purposes</div></div><hr />

On what version are you?<br />
This is information from BaanERP 5.0c: see below.<br />
<br />

Backgrounds on setup classes and setup states in iBaan ERP and BaanSCS<br />
An important means to save time during production is to cut down on setup times. The benefits of saving setup times during production can be enormous. Moreover, saving setup times as much as possible reflects the situation on the shop floor in reality. Setup classes and setup states are used in iBaan ERP and BaanSCS to achieve a cutdown on setup times.<br />
Example<br />
If you want to spray-paint an item green during a specific operation, you must set up the required machine, which takes some time. If you subsequently use the same operation to spray-paint an item red, the machine must be set up again for the red paint. To reduce setup times, you can best schedule successively all production orders in which items are spray-painted red . The orders that involve green items can also be scheduled successively.<br />
Moreover, to set up a machine from using green paint to using red paint could cost more time than a machineÂ’s changeover from red to green. In this example it means that you can better first process the red orders, after which you can process the green orders.<br />
Setup times in BaanSCS<br />
<br />
BaanSCS Scheduler and BaanSCS Planner offer the possibility to define setup optimization rules. These rules allow you to limit setup times when scheduling production orders. For this purpose, BaanSCS uses a matrix (time in minutes).<br />
Color:  TO <br />
Green Red White <br />
FROM Green 0 100 100 <br />
Red 90 0 100 <br />
White 80 50 0 <br />
<br />
According to this matrix, it takes 100 minutes to set up a machine from red to white. To set up a machine from white to red costs 50 minutes. <br />
In BaanSCS, the subject of the matrix equals the setup class. In this case, the setup class is color. Furthermore, a setup class consists of setup states. The setup states of the setup class are green, red, and white.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, we are on baan5.0b (hoping to move to 5c in the next 6 months)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 07:29</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're on BaaN ERP only, that kind of detailed setup cannot be handled. You're gonna need BaaN SCS (Scheduler)<br />
<br />
BaaN Information (from Eddy) is a SCS Scheduler feature.</div></div><hr />
