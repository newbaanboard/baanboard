I am trying to use the configurator session through Sales Order but when i try to use the generic item it gives me an error message &quot; Product Variant has no Product Variant options&quot; when i try to generate the product variant from within the sales order line session.<br />
<br />
can anyone tell me what might be causing the problem.<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Couple of options.<br />
<br />
1.  Have you created any features for the generic item?  The product variant needs features to create itself.<br />
<br />
2. When you set up your product features the 'select option' could be ticked.<br />
Have you created any options for this feature.<br />
To do this highlight the line / specific/ options by feature.<br />
<br />
Hope this might help.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zakir_h</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 13:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
yes indeed i have set up all the features, options, and also ticked the 'sel option' check box. I have also tested the generic item using product variant. and if i use an already created product variant in the sales order line it works but it generates a purchase item instead of a project item.<br />
<br />
hope i am now clear in explaining my problem.but it doesnot work if i want to create the product variant through the sales order lines session.<br />
<br />
:confused: <br />

<br />
You should use 'Generate [Project] structure for SO'<br />
This can be found if you highlight the order line and specific.<br />
<br />
This should create your item and give it a project number too.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the above does not help, can you clarify at what point you get the error:-<br />
<br />
When you enter your generic item in the sales order line then tab past, does it ask if you want to start the configurator?<br />
<br />
Once you have finished and save the configurator and you go back onto the order line to enter the quantity?<br />
<br />
Or when you try to generate? <br />
<br />

and it doesn't allow me to any further unless i start the configurator session manually and then use the product variant number in sales order line..but then again...i see the strange thing happen that is it generates the purchase order instead of the project item.<br />
<br />
hope i am clear now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pieter van de L</div><div class="date">14th March 2007, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason it generates ap purchased items is because you must devine a generic bom or generic routing. In that case a manufactured item is generated. The way the item code is generated should be maintained in the pcf parameters within manufacturing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraP</div><div class="date">14th March 2007, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I use configurator a lot and have never come across this error.<br />
<br />
When you enter your generic item and it asks you if you want to start the configurator, if you say no tab down and then press the configurator button on the right hand side, do you still get the error message?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraP</div><div class="date">14th March 2007, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally managed to recreate your error message.<br />
<br />
It looks like the product features have not been attached to the generic item.<br />
<br />
I created a new generic item but did not attach any features, tried to use it in sales order lines and got the error message.<br />
<br />
tipcf1101m000 - make sure you have features to generic item in here.</div></div><hr />

It happened even if you have a correct generic item with features attached. The only way that was found to bypass this issue was... using a new product variant :( !!!<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zakir_h</div><div class="date">15th March 2007, 08:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Sandra,<br />
i have double checked and i do have the product features attached to the generic item in the session tipcf1101m000. <br />
but as sylvians suggested , i do not want to use a new product variant from outside the sales order line as the end users will crib saying one step is extra even though logically it is not the case.<br />
<br />
i am wondering if mine is not a geniune problem since i have very less replies /support and none of the baan gurus have replied....<br />
There should be something for sure which is going wrong it could be either a solution to be installed or ... or functionally i might be doing something wrong...<br />
<br />

<br />
I keep looking and trying to find out why this is happening.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure as this would cause the same problem, the expiry date in the features by Generic item, this hasn't got a current date has it?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Sandra</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zakir_h</div><div class="date">17th March 2007, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">the expiry date field is blank for all the features.<br />

Sorry for the late update....got busy with some other schedule... u were right about the dates.. only thing, it was not the expiry dates but the sales order date and the effective dates of the product features were out of range.... i.e; the sales order date was older than the date the generic item was created.<br />
Thanks<br />
