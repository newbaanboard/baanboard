<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">27th August 2002, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no such thing as a partial operation. <br />
Subcontracting can be defined as a (full) operation, whatever takes place before or after the subcontracting will also be defined as operations.<br />
The operations together will be part of a routing, and as such the subcontracting step may be seen as a partial routing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then, you can modify material issue, and put the same component in two operations differents, then you can subcontrating each operation with different suppliers</div></div><hr />

The problem is mine... my English isnt the best.... <br />
supose that i have a order for qty:1000 of item &quot;aaa&quot;<br />
This order has a routing and supose that an operation of casting.<br />
Normally i have cast 1000 itens &quot;aaa&quot;. But if i want to casting 500 itens e subcontract 300 an subcontractor and 200 to another, i dont know to make that. <br />
<br />
The Baan permits subcontract an operation (qty full) and not part s the quantity.<br />
<br />

That way, if one work center (subcontractor) gets overloaded, Baan will automatically suggest the next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your problem has to be handeled at different production orders (according to your exampel you have to split your order in 3 new orders wit qty 500+300+200).<br />
When you use Subcontracting in Baan, you actually purchase an operation(tisfc010) from a supplier (subcontracter). From the operation at the production order do you generate a purcase order and order line, and you can't generate more than one purcase order line per operation.<br />

This is well outside of my area of expertise, too. But I wonder if we're trying to make this too hard.<br />
<br />
You say &quot;Normally i have cast 1000 itens &quot;aaa&quot;. But if i want to casting 500 itens e subcontract 300 an subcontractor and 200 to another..&quot;<br />
<br />
Is it correct to assume that this something that is determined manually for each SFC order? <br />
<br />
When do you decide whether to subcontract and, if so, how many to subcontract and to who? Is it before the order is entered? Before it is released? After it has been released?<br />

I would like to see Francescos suggestion tested. But if you are comfortable with manually planning the allocation between the internal and subcontracted operations, and if you are not currently using Capacity planning, I suspect that introducing capacity constraints on multiple work centers may be more involved than it is worth,<br />
<br />
The most intuitive solution for the user would be to be able to maintain the BOM (estimated materials) or the Routing for the specific SFC order. I think that this can be accomplished using phantoms. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that my specialty is finance, not manufacturing or planning, so members with SFC expertise will to have critique this. See also this thread: http://www.baanforums.com/baanboard/showthread.php?threadid=5426 <br />
<br />
Assume the manufactured item is X. Item X currently has a single level BOM with three components: A, -B, and -C. The routing for Item-X has 2 operations: 001 (Casting) and 002 (Assembly). Operation 001 (Casting) is linked to work center WC1.<br />
<br />
In the manufacturing process, Items B and C are processed in Operation 001 (Casting) and the resulting product is assembled with Item A in Operation 002 (Assembly)<br />
<br />
The BOM for Item X is:<br />
·	10  A, 1 ea.<br />
·	20  B, 1 ea.<br />
·	30 --C, 1 ea.<br />
<br />
Create phantom items BA, BB and BC, each with the following BOM:<br />
·	10  B, 1 ea.<br />
·	20  C, 1 ea.<br />
<br />
The routing for BA has one operation: 001 (Casting), linked to work center WC1.<br />
<br />
The routing for BB has one operation: 001 (Casting), linked to work center WS1. WS1 is a subcontracting work center linked to supplier S1.<br />
<br />
The routing for BC has one operation: 001 (Casting), linked to work center WS2. WS2 is a subcontracting work center linked to supplier S2.<br />
<br />
Change the BOM for Item X to:<br />
·	10  A, 1 ea.<br />
·	20  BA, 1 ea.<br />
Change the routing for X so that there is only one operation: 002 (assembly).<br />
<br />
When you enter a production order for 1000 units of X, the estimated materials (production BOM) will be:<br />
·	1000 units of A<br />
·	1000 units of BA<br />
The actual materials requirement will be 1000 units each of items A, B and C. The casting of phantom BA is done internally.<br />
<br />
If you wish to cast 500 units internally, and subcontract 300 castings at supplier S1 and subcontract 200 castings at supplier S2, Maintain the estimated materials to:<br />
·	1000 units of A<br />
·	500 units of BA<br />
·	300 units of BB<br />
·	200 units of BC<br />
The total materials requirement will be 1000 units each of items A, B and C. 500 of the castings will be completed via the internal operation, 300 will be subcontracted to supplier S1 and 200 will be subcontracted to supplier S2.<br />
<br />
Seems too easy. Feasibility may even depend on the complexity of the BOM and routing for the casting. And specifically whether you can maintain estimated materials at the phantom level. Hopefully, a manufacturing guru can tell us if this will work, and, if so, what are the caveats.<br />

I go test the solution proposed....<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sturla</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Scott 2001 and Pbarbosa,<br />
<br />
I liked Scotts idea, so I did some testing, and found out that I would have done it a little bit different than Scott suggest.<br />
<br />
Lets assume that we still use item X with the same BOM (A,B &amp; C) and routing (10-Casting &amp; 20-assembly) as Scott use. Another assumption is that this is something that is done occasionally (not according to the default routing). Its also a condition that its possible to link items in BOM to operation (see BOM-parameters).<br />
I dont like the idea of using phantoms for this instance, because you normally dont issue phantom items directly from a warehouse(you can do it, if you have them in stock, but then do you first have to produce the phantom items at another SFC-order).<br />
<br />
If you have a planned SFC-order for 1000 ea of X, the estimated material (ticst001) will look like:<br />
<br />
Pos ;	Item ;	Qty ; 	Operation<br />
10 ;	A ;	1000 ea ;	20<br />
20 ;	B ;	1000 ea ;	10<br />
30 ; 	C ;	1000 ea ;	10<br />
<br />
The production planning (tisfc010) will look like:<br />
<br />
Operation ;Task ;	  WC ;	Start time ;	End time<br />
10 ;            Casting;   WC1 ;	S ;            	S+1<br />
20 ;            Assembly;WC2 ;	S+1 ;        	S+2<br />
<br />
You have to maintain the production planning, and insert the subcontracting operations. Its important to get the same start and end time at the operation you insert:<br />
<br />
Operation	;Task ;	WC ;	Start time;End time<br />
10 ;	Casting ;	WC1 ;	S ;	 S+1<br />
11 ;	Casting ;	WS1 (sc) ;S ;	 S+1<br />
12 ;	Casting ;	WS2 (sc) ;S ;	 S+1<br />
20 ;	Assembly;WC2 ;	S+1 ;	 S+2<br />
<br />
After you have maintained the production planning you have to maintain the estimated material:<br />
<br />
Pos ;	Item ;	Qty ;	Operation<br />
10 ;	A ;	1000 ea ;	20<br />
20 ;	B ;	500 ea ;	10<br />
21 ;	B ;	300 ea ;	11<br />
22 ;	B ;	200 ea ;	12<br />
30 ;	C ;	500 ea ;	10<br />
31 ;	C ;	300 ea ;	11<br />
32 ;	C ;	200 ea ;	12<br />
<br />
If its done this way, you can release the order and generate subcontracting orders (purchase order) for the different suppliers (supplier linked to WS1 &amp; WS2) for the correct number of operations you want to purchase. You will also control your production planning, and issue the correct number of components (A,B &amp; C). The Material Issue Note will help you to control the number of components to ship from your warehouse to the different work centers.<br />
<br />
Its also possible to plan your production and use different subcontractors in your preferred/ default routing, but that is another and more complex procedure. <br />

I like that solution! It's elegant, straightforward and it avoids all the questions about material issues for phantoms.<br />

<br />
Did you have a chance to test either suggestion? I just noticed another thread regarding subcontracting linked to a phantom item. The query relates to 5.0c, not IVC, but even though the subcontracted item was a phantom, the subcontract purchase order picked up the qty of the main SFC item, not the phantom. <br />
<br />
See http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?threadid=6578<br />
<br />
So I wonder if either suggestion provided a solution or if you are still stuck?<br />
