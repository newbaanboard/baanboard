<br />
<br />
I remember bumping into it once, but now I can't find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">20th August 2005, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe you are looking for the following flag in SFC Parameters [on Form 3 in BAAN IVc3 - Maintain SFC Parameters tisfc0101m000]:<br />
<br />
<br />
Reporting Method for Previous Operations<br />
<br />
<br />
This has values &quot;Automatic&quot; &quot;Interactive&quot; or &quot;None&quot;. Look up the field help for more details.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Note that changing this flag will apply to operations of ALL production orders from that point on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lordofe</div><div class="date">23rd August 2005, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with that SFC parameter you still need to complete the operations sequentially.  There is some other parameter that allows non sequential operations.<br />
<br />
I want to be able to complete (100) on operation 40 even though I may have completed (0) at operation 30.  Because it doesn't matter in which sequence I complete the tasks, and we could float this decision based on scheduling.<br />
<br />
anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">23rd August 2005, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not functional to that level.  Does this mean 'Parallel Operations'?  Just because it's mentioned by Eddy G in this other post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=24815) .<br />
<br />
- maybe talking to him would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lordofe</div><div class="date">24th August 2005, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I am going to drill holes in a board with one machine and tape the edges with the another machine.<br />
<br />
At the time I write the production order I put the drilling at op 30 and the taping at op 40.<br />
<br />
BUT on the shop floor we decide to complete operation 40 before operation 30 b/c of bottleneck at 30.  operation 40 is not dependent on 30 (op 40 can be completed non sequentially.)<br />
<br />
Is there a way to free up the operation sequence?  right now I can only complete op 40 to the quantity of the op 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">25th August 2005, 05:58</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no such parameter. You can:<br />
 create parallel routing as Lisa suggested, but it requires up to 2 extra phantom item codes, and if you have operations before the two you mentioned, the structure of operations under production order becomes messy to look at<br />
 only asks the user to record the output once drilling AND taping have been done. You'd have to combine the work centres and average their hourly costs. But this may create a headache on its own<br />
Other people may be able to offer up more options<br />
