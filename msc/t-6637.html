If you haven't updated the standard cost of the manufactured (end) item since the order was closed, the status can be reset to &quot;Complete&quot; via Reset Production Order Status (ticst0203m000).<br />

what if you have updated the cost price components?. Do you then stand Buckley's of changing the status?<br />

When you say updated the cost price components, I assume that you mean updated the std cost price of the components.<br />
<br />
The official answer per Knowledge Quest is:<br />
If the cost price for the end item or for a material component has been recalculated, it is not allowed to re-activate the order. Re-activating would result in a revaluation based on the cost price as calculated during the period that the order is closed. Consequently, a wrong production result is obtained because of a wrong work-in-process value.<br />
<br />
So the short answer is &quot;no.&quot; I dont think Ive ever tested, however, to confirm that it &quot;works as advertised.&quot; <br />
<br />
The other case worth noting is that if the SFC order is closed, if the order is linked to a project, and if the project has also been closed, then you stand no Buckleys even if the std cost of the end item hasnt been updated.<br />

<br />
the &quot;good&quot; news is that at lest we are not going to use Projects, so maybe, just maybe we might stand a chance of proving BAAN wrong. (Heaven Forbid) :-)<br />
