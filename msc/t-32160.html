<br />
We stock inventory and sell in each.<br />
We price in 100metres.<br />
<br />
At the moment our item is set up in metres and priced in 100metres, although you can enter a dimension when raising a sales order, it does not allow you to view stock by length (only metres of item) and we can't use shop floor control because we need to know what length to manufacture.<br />
<br />
My first attempt was to use PCF and one of the features would be 'Length', this worked great until pricing, somehow I need a conversion between each and metres.  I have tried changing the pricing to each but if you see in the example below I would end up being hung by finance for losing money.<br />
<br />
148 each x 2.6metres - £99.00 100metres = £380.95<br />
148 each x 2.6metres - £2.57 each = £380.36<br />
<br />
I tried amending the system to incorportate 4 decimal places into price but then got complaints for users and had to convert back to 2.<br />
<br />
We don't want to set up an item for each length as this can differ with every order, we want to be able to view the stock of the length and be able to use SFC.<br />
<br />
Has anybody got any suggestions?:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, you need a conversion factor between your inventory unit and every other unit you are using (like meter, 100meter, ...) in your generic item.<br />
Have you considered using generic price lists ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraP</div><div class="date">6th March 2007, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using the generic price list to convert the price from 100m to each but as my example shows this gives me the issue with the decimal places.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something about generic price lists?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never used generic prices, however I have an idea...<br />
To avoid the issue with decimal places, you can round the price for each using the function &quot;round&quot; in a constraint:<br />
<br />
price = round(price_for_each_not_rounded;2;2)<br />
<br />
where the 1st &quot;2&quot; is the number of decimal places, and the 2nd &quot;2&quot; is the rule for rounding (0 -&gt; lower;  1 -&gt; std; 2 -&gt; upper).<br />
<br />
Using this function, the exact price for each 2.6metres item (£2.574) will be rounded at £2.58!<br />
=&gt; 148 each x 2.6metres - £2.58 each = £381.84<br />
<br />
Hope this help...<br />
<br />
Sylvain</div></div><hr />

Thanks for reply though ;)</div></div><hr />
