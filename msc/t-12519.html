Can anybody help me out in finding a way to link a project defined in Manufacturing (in table tipcs020) to Baan Projects (i.e tppdm600)??<br />
In tipcs020 there is a field &quot;Link to Baan Projects : (yes/no)&quot;, which is not visible on the form, but present in the table. How this field is getting value &quot;yes&quot;??<br />
<br />

<br />
Th Orders are created in Baan TP for Customized item requirement for a TP Project and then transfered to PCS from TP Projects Module &quot; Planned Warehouse Orders ( manufacturing )&quot;.<br />
<br />
It would better If U also tell UR scenario for this purpose.<br />

I am a novice in BaaN. I have some basic queries regarding the projects....<br />
1. what is the importance of the relation between TP &amp; PCS projects?<br />
2. If a manual Purchase order is created on a PCS project can the information be transferred to TP project?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanking you in Advance</div></div><hr />

PCS is the execution of the production process. Items can be manufactured and then transferred to TP. You need the link Between TP and PCS that can be manually created or by adding the PCS item onto your Budget. Transferring the PCS item moves the item cost to TP as material cost<br />
<br />
2. If a manual Purchase order is created on a PCS project can the information be transferred to TP project?<br />
An item is transferred to TP. If the PO was for a component and then was issued to the item that has actual costing then the cost will be transferred. The other way of getting cost to the TP project is via journal. Can be done from Finance module</div></div><hr />
