I have a little problem in doing planning in Baan ERP using EP module.<br />
<br />
Let's say that I have the following process:<br />
A - B - C - D (each of them are different work centers and the item code changes after every process)<br />
<br />
Suppose I'm running a simulate master-plan/order session and the resulting planned orders show (thru Resource Master Plan session) that work center C is the bottleneck one and some periods are overloaded. So I maintain the planned orders for work center C and make manual date adjustment. After done with them, I change the planned order status to &quot;Firm-Planned&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem is, how to make the planned orders' date in the preceding ( A &amp; B) and subsequent ( D) workcenter to follow the changes I already made in workcenter C?<br />
<br />
If I simply run the simulate master-plan/order session again, it won't do. The dates just don't match with the one I manually adjust.<br />
<br />
Anyone has any solutions please?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />

Baan's solution is called scheduler.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel UR problem can be solved by using Work Load Control ( Constraint based Planning ) Module. It really works in Baan 5.<br />
<br />
Although the item code changes at each work centre, Connect then in a sequnce by bringing a Parent to A B C D Items in BOM and link them relevant operations ( work centre ).<br />
<br />
Pl let us know of any feedback.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the advice. We want to stay away from scheduler for the time being since it is quite complex. So I guess I'll try the WLC first.<br />
<br />
Will let you know the results.<br />

Thanks,<br />
