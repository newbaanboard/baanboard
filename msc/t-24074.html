What you can do is then:<br />
 firstly separate the person maintaining the allowed raw materials (should be production planning personnel) and person requesting raw material issue (production execution personnel). I assume this is already done<br />
 In table field authorisation, give the production planning personnel access to &quot;Estimated quantity&quot; and &quot;subsequent quantity&quot; field in the raw material request screen in BaanERP, but not for the &quot;to issue quantity&quot; field. Then give the production execution personnel access to &quot;to issue quantity&quot;, but not to &quot;estimated quantity&quot; and &quot;subsequent quantity&quot; fields, in the same screen<br />
Voila! You have perfect separation of responsibilities although the 2 functions are using the exact same screen in BaanERP<br />
