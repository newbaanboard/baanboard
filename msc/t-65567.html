<br />
We are on Baan 5c<br />
Could anyone help me as to how Baan calculates the estimated hours for a production order?Does it only look at the cycle times in the routing operations maintained for the end item in tirou1502m000? Actually we have changed routings and we want to replicate what the hours could have been with the new routings for production orders already closed.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">24th February 2014, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">If what you are looking for is the estimated consumed hours that would appear in the order's estimated costs, then I think the calculation for a single operation is:<br />
<br />
((cycle time * order quantity) * (man occupation for production)) + (setup time * man occupation for setup)<br />
<br />
I think there is a parameter that indicates if setup time should be included in the calculation.<br />
<br />
If the operation is flagged for fixed duration, the cycle time is used in the above calculation but not multiplied by the order quantity, making it:<br />
<br />
(cycle time * man occupation for production) + (setup time * man occupation for setup)<br />
<br />
<br />
If the same calculation is done for each operation and summed, the total should be the order's estimated consumed hours.  If elapsed time rather than consumed is needed, the various lead time elements such as queue, wait and move times can be set up; these add to the duration of the order but not its estimated costs.</div></div><hr />

 Really appreciate it.<br />
So for an end item the estimated hours would be the sum of operations for all the BOM items under it OR operations of only phantom items need to be considered for items under the main item?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">25th February 2014, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that only phantom components will roll-up operation times into the end item.  Normally, an end-item's component costs are considered to be rolled up into the material costs for the end item production order.  LN has the option of cost component charts that allow component costs to come across as a list of cost components, but I think in 5.0c they are just included in the material value.  So the end item estimated hours should only be for operations within the end-item's routings (including phantoms)</div></div><hr />
