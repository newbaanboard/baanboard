<br />
When a SFC Production order (transfer type order) is formed against the PRODUCTION ORDER for transfering the material from the main warehouse to the shopfloor warehouse than in that order USE WAREHOUSE ORDER PRICE comes automatically ticked. So how can i avoid that USE WAREHOUSE ORDER PRICE tick. Is there any procedure to avoid checking that tick when the sfc production order (transfer type) is formed automatically.<br />

<br />
The tick for Use Warehouse Order Price is defaulted to Yes/No based on various conditions which is based on the kind of Warehouse Order , Valuation method defined and a few other things.<br />
<br />
Like for Purchase/Purchase Schedules its never used. For Warehouse to warehouse transfers, its not used in case of Shop floor warehouse for a floor stock item. For Project / Project manual orders its always used. Also, in case of Sales/Production, if the material is being returned or if its a WIP Transfer it will be used. <br />
<br />
One thing what you can try is, you can use FTP valuation method for the Item-Warehouse. It will never be checked then. But again, keep in mind that it should not affect your on-going business logics.<br />
<br />
Or the second way is to do a smaller customization to uncheck it before processing the warehouse order.</div></div><hr />
