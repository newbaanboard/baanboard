There are some options to handle it.<br />
1. You should be able to initiate the inventory as you issue them from stock room. In that way it will move into WIP<br />
2. If you are using shop floor warehouses then transfer the inventory to shop floor warehouse from stock room, and if you have backflushing turned on then system will consume inventory as the operation is complete. <br />
<br />
I think either of the option would work (I prefer option 2), but these are more transaction oriented. This is something that you would need to consider.<br />
