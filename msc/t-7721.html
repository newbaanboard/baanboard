<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We are implementing a Baan V system - converting from Baan IV - with a go-live of 1/1/03. While most things are going well, we are now running planning runs (Simulate Orders, etc.) and seeing very, very long run times.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if I can get a quick survey of run times experienced by Baan V users for regenerative and net change planning runs.<br />
<br />
I'm just looking for a gauge to tell us if we have a problem. Please tell me the estimated number of items your planning and the run times of your net change and regenerative runs.<br />
<br />
For instance, in Baan IV we plan around 1 million items and our regen runs are six hours while our net change runs are two hours.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These guys analyze the queries during a run and can quite quickly see whether things can be improved or not.<br />
<br />
You might mail to: POptimiz@baan.nl <br />
<br />
Hope they can help you.<br />
