<br />
We want to use an old revision for the production of a new item. Is there a way to accomplish this? <br />
We have a manufactured item M1(revision4) which has component C1(revision 4). Earlier revisions are 3, 2 and 1. Now, we have a new manufactured item M2 for which we want to use C1(revision 3). Is there a way to accomplish this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baazigar</div><div class="date">24th March 2006, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">try putting the effective date for the c1 item as the effective date of revision 3 when it is put in the BOM of M2 item.  let us know if this works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">24th March 2006, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't use effectivitiy dates in EDM. Manufacturing is date-centric, but EDM is revision-centric. When you put item C1 in an EBOM, it automatically assumes current revision. I don't know of any way around this. By standard engineering practices you can only have one revision that's valid and current at any given moment. What if you're using item C1, rev 2 and you want to make a change to it, but not the already-defined change to rev 3? Where would you go?<br />
<br />
What you have to do is create a new part number the equates to the earlier rev part. Depending on your numbering system, you might be able to use dash numbers or some other method to show that it's a derivative of an existing item and I would definitely use some text notes to point these items to each other to help show the relationship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsiyengar</div><div class="date">24th March 2006, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">If you change the reference date on the Production order and put in a date that is before the new revision is effective and in the period when the required revision was effective then it should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">24th March 2006, 19:29</div></div><div class="posttext">True, but very cumbersome and manual. Whenever you put up an order you have to remember to set the date back to some previous period. And if another change is made to the BOM, how does your date pull some items in a previous period and others form the current date? It just gets messier and messier. If you're using EDM, you have nothing to indicate any of this in EDM, which is the master data. EDM will always indicate the current rev. Personally, I think that the system has many capabilities and it's best to use them to your advantage rather than to see how many ways you can go around it. Most controls are there for a good reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the feedback. I agree with Jim's view and it is better to create a new part number.<br />
