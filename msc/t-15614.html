<br />
I conducted a class in Baan V Enterprise Planning for a private client.  Prior to my scheduled class, a colleague was conducting a class and made an inappropriate sexual joke.  The client immediately suspended the class and asked the consultant to leave.<br />
<br />
I was scheduled the next week.  I was made aware of the past events and knew the sensitivity of the client.  Imagine my self restraint in having to say the term 'Master Based Planning' at least a couple of hundred times during the course of a two week class...needless to say, I deserved a big bonus for making it through that!</div></div><hr />
