<br />
When I release a new revision in EDM for a manufactured engineering item, the revision appears automaticaly in the item (tiitm0101m000).<br />
However, when I do the same thing with a purchased engineering item, that doesn't work. I have to copy the engineering item to the standard item. And since all the fields like product type or signal code are not maintained in our case in EDM, the system resets these fields in tiitm0101m000 with a blank value.<br />
<br />
Why such a difference between manufactured and purchased items ? <br />
Is it a bug ?<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me on this subject ?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scotty</div><div class="date">20th February 2003, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for answering, <br />
The relationship already exists.<br />
I didn't understand the first question. What did you mean by your first question ? What is the item master ?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">20th February 2003, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">On the item master (Maintain Item data (tiitm0101m000) - there are 2 fields called Revison Contolled/Update E-Item, these two fields must be set to YES in order to update the standard item with the latest revision number of the E-item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">21st February 2003, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">We use EDM and ECO's fully, copying over all changes, so I never noticed this before, but I just did some checking. <br />
<br />
I found that even if an item is purchased, the revision doesn't automatically carry over to production. Only if the item is copied over will the new revision show.<br />
<br />
Manufactured items are a little more interesting. A newly released revision is not visible right away in production. Copy the item over - still shows the old revision. I have seen this before and think it has to do with copying the BOM over. But before copying the BOM, I tried changing it to purchased, and the new revision automatically showed up! Better yet, when I switched it back to purchased, the revision went back to the &quot;old&quot; revision!<br />
<br />
Now with it back to manufactured, I copied the BOM over and the new revision was visible from tiitm.<br />
<br />
So there are a couple of conclusions I get from this. First of all, I don't know how you're able to see new revisions, even on purchased items, without copying the item over. It doesn't work that way on my system (IVb2). Second, Baan obviously wants you to copy a new BOM over if you update a manufactured item, which makes sense if you think about it. Changing a manufactured item pretty much by definition means changing something in a BOM, so if there's a new revision, it's forcing you to bring that new BOM over before the revision is visible.<br />
<br />
I think the bottom line for you is that if you're going to use revisions, you need to use the  engineering item master completely, not just as a necessary evil - a place to put a part number so you can have a revision. Once you have it set up, you'll find it really isn't that bad. Copying numbers over is very quick and painless. You may also want to consider whether changing your default item data might make things easier when you copy engineering data to production.</div></div><hr />

Obviously, the system doesn't react the same way in c4. BaaN told me that they had changed a few things to make the revision update easier. I believe they mean that in the latest versions we don't have to copy the BOM for manufactured items. Somehow, I've got the feeling that they could have forgotten the case of purchased items. I don't see why if the revision appears automatically tiitm0101 for manuf. items, it would'nt be the same for purchased items, given that they are much easy to handle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">21st February 2003, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you got my curiosity going, so I checked this in a IVc4 environment, as I should have from the start (we're getting ready to upgrade, so we have the environment set up for testing). It is, indeed, different in IVc4.<br />
<br />
I can't explain why they do it this way, to me it made more sense in IVb. Now a purchased item's new revision doesn't show until you copy the item, but the manufactured item's revision shows up as soon as it's released, as you indicated, but with one important exception -<br />
<br />
It only shows right away if you have no BOM for the new revision. If there is a BOM for the new revision, the revision field in tiit0101m000 goes blank until the BOM is copied over. Copying the BOM then makes the revision show in the item master.<br />
<br />
I'd have to assume, then, that you don't have any BOM's for your manufactured items?<br />
<br />
I guess your safest bet is still to copy any items that have had a change, as well as copying the BOM's for manufactured items. This also ensures that all your relationships are up to date and you have less potential for problems.</div></div><hr />
