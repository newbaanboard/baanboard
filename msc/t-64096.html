<br />
We ran the session tisfc0206m000 via job processing and realized some of production orders were still in status Active. Then we also tried to run tisfc0206m000 only for one particular order with no outcome. <br />
<br />
(Options Check on completion of oper - yes, Check on quantity Delivered - Yes, Post non completed inventory Yes, Accept Zero completion No)<br />
<br />
So we entered session tisfc0202m000. Manually it was possible to complete the order and post inventory after answering question Post inventory.<br />
<br />
Anyone with idea where might be the difference between those 2 sessions ? <br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
