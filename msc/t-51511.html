<br />
My situation is as follow : a sales order is created and not approved, when MRP (based on order plan)  is performed, the requirements relevant the sales order will be considered. But I wish the requirements derived from the sales order be taken into account only after the sales order be approved, how should I do?  Our operation environment is LN 6.1  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

For unapproved orders, instead of Sales Orders, you can use Sales Quaotations as one of the work-arounds.<br />
Second work-around is at the time of creating sales order, use a warehouse which is not considered in enterprise planning. Before approving the sales order, change the warehouse to your standard warehouse, which is considered in enterprise planning and then approve the sales order.</div></div><hr />

  You can use a Non-nettable warehouse code in the sales order line before approving the sales order. after the sales order approved, then change the Non-nettable warehouse to Nettable warehouse.</div></div><hr />
