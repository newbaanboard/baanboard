<br />
My client wishes to incorporate the work centre capacity as a Constraint during the Production Planning. <br />
Hence I wish to gather the experience of the Consultants who have implemented Planning with Constraints ( capacity or Material or both ). Kindly share them in detail.<br />
<br />
I have an info, that BaaN IV Constraint Planning Module doesnt give correct results with too many levels of BOM and also materials!!.<br />
<br />
Am looking out for info on BaaN IV Contraint Planning Module and Baan V Planning with Constraint.<br />
<br />

It is not able to do finite capacity planning however. <br />
<br />
In BaanERP 5.0c there is an integration with BaanSCS Planner and/or Scheduler.<br />
These should be able to handle finite capacity planning.<br />
<br />

<br />
I am about to complete my simulations on Planning with Constraints in BaaN V.<br />
BaaN V Master Planning with Work Load Control, system gives accurate results with Finite Work Center Capacity (Constraints).<br />
<br />
System Considers both Material and Work Center Capacity Constraints for its Master Item Planning not for the Order Based Planning (MRP) Items.<br />
<br />
This plan also comes with priority for Item Planning.<br />
I would certainly reccommend baan Vc if any one is looking for a solution of Controlling flow of order of different items thru a work centre which certainly will have its Capacity Constraints.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddy G</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">OK. I was thinking at a more detailed level: the production orders.<br />
Though capacity may be sufficient for the period you planned the production orders, still they  are not smoothly planned over time.<br />
Even not in B5.0c.<br />
<br />
If you also need that, I think you should go for B5.0c + Baan SCS Planner/Scheduler<br />
<br />
<br />
But, maybe there is somebody who can serve Sridhar Joshi better with a Baan IV solution ...?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">16th August 2002, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan EP does have a finite capacity scheduling engine.  It also considers constrainted materials.  What it doesn't do that SCS Scheduler does is to optimize multiple constraints.  Now, having said that, Baan EP can arrive at a better result my running multiple interations of the plan as well as building a constrainted plan on the basis of an existing Master Plan (as opposed to an infinite plan).  Doing this will allow the planner to arrive at a more optimized solution.</div></div><hr />
