<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">12th July 2006, 04:39</div></div><div class="posttext">We need to create a production order for a sub assembly. We have the main item as a MPS manufatured item and the sub assembly as a MRP manufactured item. We are able to create the MRP production order, but its not in the units we required.<br />
<br />
Here is my example <br />
The main component uses the subcomponent in meters (LENGTH)<br />
The sub component is a roll of tape that is .5M wide and 100M long<br />
The sub component is made from a roll of tape 1M wide and 100 M long.<br />
<br />
The MRP production order  needs to tell me to cut .5 m wide X 100 M long from the roll of tape that is 1M wide.<br />
Additional Question:<br />
What happens to the remainder of the roll (Inventory ?)<br />
How can this sub component be consumed in M and the MRP production order be created to cut rolls <br />
If anyone has a similar process I would appreciate any direction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">savitr</div><div class="date">13th July 2006, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">pls draw the multilevel structure along with inventory unit and required qty with units, so as to make it clearer.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">15th July 2006, 04:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Please see attached example</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">savitr</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 09:04</div></div><div class="posttext">what i found from attached sheet is that all multilevel items have 1000 cm common. <br />
If yr inventory unit is in cms which u could safely make as 1000 cms seems fix in all cases.(your price unit could be different e.g. kgs, etc), just feed the cms requierd in BOM of these items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok from my example if we use cms what happens with the remainder of my raw component. I will use this raw component to make other sub assemblies with different widths. Is there a way to say that my raw component is now only so wide and 1000 cm long? So that when I need to cut a certain width, the system will know that my inventory item is not wide enough?</div></div><hr />

This indeed is an interesting problem, sounds like it's coming from the paper industry.<br />
Anyway, is it correct that you always slice parts off the 'master' roll (19000000A)? In other words you'll never cut the roll lenghtwise?<br />
<br />
Even if your inventory unit is any kind of 'slices', the system will always summarize these slices to a total inventory, but not every roll is able to fulfill the demand of a production order due to insufficient width.<br />
<br />
Let me know if I got you right with your problem, please.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g_someshwar</div><div class="date">18th July 2006, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear itannous, What i understand from your problem is u r using the raw material in 1000cm length bundles( just leave about width). Is it right. If so, u try like this, Create the raw material as 1X1000cm as a unit. and in BOM, If u require 5X1000cm sheet, define the raw material as 5 units. pl. let me know will it work out. I will be thankful if u give me reply, stating constraints in executing the above, since i am a beginner in BAAN.</div></div><hr />

discusions which are emanating thru this forum and as i have already suggested,  is that put yr invnetory unit in cms/mm/meters. create yr BOM with requirement in this unit. Yr balance length would be in yr this inventory unit. Use of inventory will also be in this inventory unit. create appropriate conversion factor for yr purchase unit.</div></div><hr />

That is correct, the length is not really the issue, it is the width. After cutting several widths, how do we know the balance width remaining in the raw component.</div></div><hr />

I'm afraid Baan does not offer a simple solution for that problem. <br />
The workaround that I see is based on the assumption that the slices you cut are standardized, let's say multiple of 1cm. If the master roll (19000000A) is 100cm in width, you have to create items for every cm:<br />
<br />
19000001A : width = 1cm<br />
19000002A : width = 2cm<br />
19000003A : width = 3cm<br />
19000004A : width = 4cm<br />
...<br />
19000090A : width = 90cm<br />
...<br />
19000099A : width = 99cm<br />
19000000A : width = 100cm (master roll)<br />
<br />
The BOM for a production order of a 4cm slice, if only master rolls are available, would look like this:<br />
<br />
19000000A : quantity +1<br />
19000096A : quantity -1<br />
<br />
After issuing the materials for the production order your inventory of master rolls will be deducted by 1 roll, the inventory of 96cm rolls is raised by 1. Perfect, isn't it :D ? <br />
No idea if this is applicable for you. The disadvantage is obvious: a lot of items and the estimated materials for every production order has to be modified manually.. :o . <br />
The MRP run will create a demand for master rolls only (standard BOM). This issue might be solved by the PCF module in Baan. Unfortunately I'm not familiar with it.<br />
<br />
If all this fails, there should be an extension for Baan IV, called Baan Dimensions, for such kind of problems. Did you ever hear of it?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
There is a specific extension for Baan IV called Multi Dimensions. This extension is developed to deal with different flexible characteristics like lenght, width, thickness, colour, quality etc.<br />
<br />
The extension has been developed for customers in the Metals, Paper, Plastics and textile industry. It deals with processes like cutting, slitting etc, and it will also enable you to cut the tape with a with of 1 meter into two pieces of each 0,5 meters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">11th October 2006, 03:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you know if this is available from BaaN and is part of regular maintenance agreement?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marcel Schipper</div><div class="date">11th October 2006, 11:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan IV Multi Dimensions is available at Baan. Since it is an extension licences will have to be bought from Baan. It can be included in the standard maintenance contract. <br />
<br />
For more information you can contact your account manager and ask him for information on Baan IV Multi Dimensions. <br />
<br />
I am at Baan the consultant responsible for all functional issues related to Baan IV Mult Dimensions</div></div><hr />
