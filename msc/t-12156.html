We are currently getting thousands of item error type signals stating that for a particular customised item the project status must be active or simulated. These are all for closed projects.<br />
We simulate orders in regen mode nightly across all our items (standard and customised). We do not want to disable item error signals as there are some genuine signals generated which need actioned. <br />
Baan support state that this is a genuine signal and will not recognise this as a bug.<br />
We cannot separate out closed projects from the active ones when simulating orders, and do not wish to archive closed projects immediately after closure.<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Change the planner to a dummy planner for  the customised items once the project is closed (if no. of items are large then a small correction program would do the trick ). Do not maintain any signals for this planner. I think this should do the trick . <br />
