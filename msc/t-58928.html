    Has anyone out here experienced a situation (in Baan4c4) where in all the estimated materials inside all Active Production Orders got issued in a mysterious manner? In a matter of 10 minutes, 6,900 lines of material issue took place that affected around 700 odd production orders. The possibility of this happening due to someone running the Issue Inventory (for all production orders) by mistake (or on purpose) is the first conclusion but our relevant setup prevents this from happening. The user whose name got recorded in the tdinv700 table against all these records of material issue is someone who left the company few months back and who doesn't have permission to run the session Issue Inventory {tisfc0207m000}. In fact none of the users who are responsible for material issues, have permission to this session and all they have is access to Issue Stock {tisfc0207s000} through which it is near to impossible to make a global issue. There is no indication on the Baan server event viewer that the user logged in at that particular time or day. Given all these, how could something like this happen? :confused:<br />

     None of them have access to Backflush Materials and Hours {tisfc0220m000}. This option was removed from their menu at the time of menu allocation and additionally they do not have permission to run this session. The clean up process has started but we want to understand how this is happening so as to prevent it from happening again. <br />

<br />
1. Do you use backflushing? <br />
If not, then i think its not tisfc0220m000 which is used to issued the material.<br />
Because it means they have to thick the backflushing check box in 700 prod ord .<br />
<br />
2. For this 700 prod ord, is there still any value in subsequent delivery?<br />
To be able to issued all material in 700 prod ord, the field to issue must have some value first, which i think its not possible to be filled manually for 700 prod ord in 10 minutes.<br />
In baan 4 is there any session to transfer from field subsequent delivery to  field to issue ? (in LN has this function in session Material to Issue for Production Order).<br />
<br />
3.have you also locked access to run program? because we can run any session from here.</div></div><hr />
