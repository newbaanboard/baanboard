<br />
Take a look into the application locks.<br />
Probably the session has been killed and the user has logon again, but still there is an application lock on it.<br />
If so, remove it.<br />

I think an application-lock won't result in such an error.<br />
<br />
I rather think:<br />
 - either really another user was there.<br />
 - or (worst case) this is an application error.<br />

<br />
I think you are right.<br />
I don't think it is a bug, if so you should get a fatal error, i suppose.<br />
Maybe it has to do with the ILC parameter in tdilc0100m000:<br />
<br />
Hi Abuibra, <br />
Has the parameter been set<br />
Block Location for Cycle Counting Orders: to YES?<br />
<br />

<br />
If this messages comes while no concurrent users are causing it, then it is 'always' an application problem.<br />
It should be reported to Baan's CS&amp;S to get is solved I think.<br />
<br />
Even some parameter-setting should not cause this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanTech</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">The key when entering details for cycle counting orders is order+sequence (tdilc501).  When using form type 3 against<br />
this table all occurences (sequences) for the order are shown.<br />
It could be possible that someone has entered details for an <br />
item and that the second user has tried to enter new details<br />
without getting the values entered by the first user via refresh.<br />
<br />
The inventory being counted is blocked but it doesn't look like<br />
there is any (appl.lock) logic to prevent multiple users from<br />
entering data on the same cycle counting order and order lines.</div></div><hr />
