<br />
i would like to know if anyone has any idea on the subject above.<br />
Basically, my product has go several workstation before become as finish goods.<br />
Each workstation has their own production order.<br />
For example, i have 4 workstation which are WA, WB, WC and WD.<br />
At WA, we have produced part no. ZZ1 with lot number L1.<br />
Next process, we sent ZZ1 to WB. At WB, it produced ZZ2 and the lot number is still same L1. It is because we use same lot to produce ZZ2.<br />
At WC, with same lot L1, we assemble and produce part ZZ3.<br />
At WD, we produced part ZZ4 and used Lot L1.<br />
<br />
as far i know, whenever we maintain receipt production order, we will generate new lot number. and item backflush will control by system.<br />
<br />
therefore, i would like to know, how i can carry the same lot and at same time im not give extra work to my users.<br />
<br />
your advice is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
thank you.</div></div><hr />

Lot code is created in conjunction with the item code. Since your item codes are different, I suppose you can have same lot number for different items. However this needs to be either created manually or you have to create a logic for lot code creation in such a way that it produced always same set of lot numbers for various items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
may i know how i can create a logic to lot code?<br />
because at Mask, it is very limited to setup a lot format.</div></div><hr />

BaaN gives quite a many options for you to configure the lots. e. g. I suppose if you have new lot numbers starting from 1 for every calendar year, then you can create them and apply this logic for all the items. Only thing is you have to close all the production orders at the year end and create new production orders for all the items in the beginning of the new year in the same sequence.<br />
If the above does not suit you or find it cumbersome, then you may have some small customization to create lot codes as per your requirements.</div></div><hr />
