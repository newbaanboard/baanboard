<br />
I have a production order (Active) with planned output of qty 1.<br />
<br />
2 Operations for qty 1.<br />
<br />
Report Operarations Complete has planned input and output of 2.<br />
Op 1 - Started<br />
Op 2 - Active<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated on how to reduce the Report Operations Complete to 1.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance<br />

<br />
In SFC Parameters (tisfc0500m000) if the Allow Correction of Previous Operations is checked or not under Planning Tab.<br />
<br />
Also check if the Inspection Order related to Production Order doesn't show more quantity reported. If these things are fine, you can change the quantities. <br />
<br />
I have assumed, there is no Back-flushing scenario in your case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, what you suggest is ok.<br />
<br />
I just dont get how this can happen and how to change the quantities.<br />
<br />
Everything from prod order to prod planning is quantity 1.<br />
<br />
But the complete operations at def.complete (planned input) is 2.<br />
<br />
How do i change it? I have corrected the ops when it has been incorrectly altered through the route to 2 or 0 and backed them out, but never at the start?<br />
<br />
Again thanks for you help. Its much appreciated.<br />

<br />
Have you reported the quantities at order level as well? In that case,<br />
<br />
Go to the report order completed session, and put negative quantity (-1) in the additional qty to deliver. <br />
Now, as the 'On Last Operation' qty is greater than the 'Delivered' qty, you will find the option 'Decrease Qty Operations' enabled in the specific menu.<br />
If you use the 'Decrease Qty operations' on the Report Orders Completed session, it will decrease the quantities on all operation lines also. No need to change it manually on all the operation lines. Also, the 'Backflush Done' is decreased automatically.<br />
<br />
If its not the case, some snapshots can provide some hints.</div></div><hr />
