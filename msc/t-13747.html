<br />
We have scenario like following :-<br />
<br />
1. Sales Order is created for an Item which is Assembly to order<br />
    also its BOM contains so many sub assembly items.<br />
<br />
2. Need to generate Project structure for Main Item as well as <br />
    sub assembly items under the same project<br />
<br />
3. Generate PRP production orders for Main &amp; Sub-Assembly Items<br />
    under same project number <br />
<br />
4. Convert  PRP to actual Production orders (multilple) using the<br />
    same project Number. <br />
<br />
Can any one explain how we can generate project structure for Sub-Assembly items (BOM of Main items) under the same project number.  Becuase while generating PRP, system generates only for  Main Item not for its BOMs.  <br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Noorul Haq.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you can do it in this way. Define multilevel BOM and routing for the main item for which sales order is made and further continue the same exercise for all manufactured items in BOM of the main item. In this way all the items are linked till the lowest level. <br />
Then define the main item in maintain project parts Â– tipcs2111m000  for the required quantity  for which sales order is made. <br />
Now when you generate planned PRP orders for the project, PRP production orders will be generated for all the items till the lowest level and PRP purchase orders will get generated for the purchased items defined in the project.<br />
<br />
I hope this will resolve your problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Sun-assembly items need to be To Order.  If they are Anonymous then PRP will not generate production orders for them.<br />
<br />
When you look at the Customised BoM at any given level, the sub-assemblies within it should show as Customised Items, not Standard items.</div></div><hr />
