<br />
In Triton, movement or updating in Display Planned Inventory Movement by Item (timrp1510m000) will NOT occur whenever any respective transaction is performed. The movement occurs only when MRP is generate again.(see attached file).<br />
<br />
However upon upgraded to BaanIV, the functionality changed such that  movement or updating in that session occurs whenever any respective transaction is performed. (i.e Movement occurs eventhough MRP is not generate again)<br />
<br />
QUESTIONS:<br />
1. Upon upgraded to BaanIV, the movement changes whenever a respective transaction is performed , why? <br />
<br />
2. Why in Triton, the movement in that session never occurs until the MRP is performed again? (based on the attached files) <br />
<br />
3. Is there any setting/program script in Triton that prevent the movement in that session?<br />

This was so in Triton and is still so in BaaN IV</div></div><hr />
