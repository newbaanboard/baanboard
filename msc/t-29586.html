<br />
I would really appreciate your help in suggestions on how this problem can be resolved.<br />
<br />
We have some production orders which were completed in first week of january with a completion date of january first week. Unfortunately, these should have come in December.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest as to what could be the best and easiest way to take these into December?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

I dont think Baan would allow for backdating production orders be it any version. I stand to be corrected on other versions of Baan but can confidently say that its not possible in Baan 4c4. If it is, please do let me know...<br />

<br />
It is possible to enter a completion date in the past, but no longer if the order is already completed.  <br />
If you enter a completion date in the past, don't automatically generate an inbound advice.  Instead, receive the produced goods manually and change the receipt date, also in the past, and then put away the goods.  The only thing is that the inventory date of the lot (if you are using lot numbers) is not correct.<br />
If the receipts are already done with a wrong date, you can no longer correct them, unless you would start making changes via GTM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am wondering if there could be a possible solution through Finance wherein we could pass manual JVs and reverse the values of Jan and pass them onto Dec.:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note that this only goes for production orders that are not already completed.<br />
You should use the receipts session located in inbound.  Since I'm using BaaN 5b, I don't know the equivalent in BaaN 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">9th January 2007, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello filipd,<br />
<br />
This is Bikash here again. As I asked earlier, what is the RECEIPT session number that you are using (may be in BaaN 5b). Please let me know. There is NO session in Baan IV where you can backdate for the Production or PRP Issue or Receipt. You can only backdate for Sales and Purchase. Waiting ...</div></div><hr />
