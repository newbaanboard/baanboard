<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vavs123</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to generate both 830 and 862 transactions for the same supplier and the same part.  I linked the creation of the 830 to the printing of the purchase schedule and the creation of the 862 to the printing of the delivery schedule.  My question is whether this is even possible.  In order to create a delivery schedule, I had to have an associated contract and position, but I don't recall having to set up a purchase schedule.  Is one created automatically?  Any help would be great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kjmcmanus</div><div class="date">21st November 2002, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We too are running BaanIVc4 NAS, and are in the process of implementing Purchasing Supply Chain (Sales Supply Chain launched 6 months ago). My own experience shows that you can't have a Delivery Schedule (862OUT) without having first set up the Purchase Schedule (830OUT), which itself must be linked to a supply chain contract. This also applies on the Sales side, no Shipping Schedule (862IN) allowed without first defining the Sales Schedule (830IN).<br />
<br />
If you try to insert a delivery schedule it will error with message &quot;Schedule not found&quot; referring to the purchase schedule.<br />
