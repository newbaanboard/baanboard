As you are aware the quantity to deliver comes from quantity approved by QMS, after approval by QMS it is only logical that the quantity approved by QMS should be posted to inventory. If it is still needed to change the qty to deliver, then some quantity has to be rejected.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
As per your info., the quantity of 868 has been &quot;delivered&quot; which means the qty has already been cleared by qms.So that lot is over. Now the message about 1348 qty must be for a different lot which has been reported by production. The message indicates that qms has already inspected the qty and you are trying to report a different qty than qms. So you should go back to qms and check for the variation or alternately check wether some step is missed out in QMS. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
