When you attempt to cancel, the status is changed to 'To Be Cancelled'.  A negative 'to issue from warehouse' quantity is generated.  <br />
<br />
How does the processing of returned material happen.  Can't seem to generate inbound/outbound or view the details through the receipts session.<br />
<br />
I would just like to 'close' the order out and not worry about the material issued, just let it flow through as material variances.</div></div><hr />

this will cleave all inventory in shop order and when you close it will be posted to varience accounts</div></div><hr />
