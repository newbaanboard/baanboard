<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">enotarko</div><div class="date">27th June 2012, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I've received an export of ticst021 in a foreign language in Excel format. I'm wondering, if anyone can help me in deciphering the structure?<br />
I'm new to BAAN and can't seem to find documentation about how the data is stored in the database (Oracle, in this case).<br />
<br />
I've attached an example. I've managed to translate a few columns: field name, description, domain, data type, physical length, reference table and reference mode. <br />
<br />
I'd like to know what do columns domain, reference table and reference mode mean? What does mandatory mean? Do the following tables have a specific meaning? tdilc006, tdsls092, tdsls093,  tcmcs001, tiitm001, tttxt001, tdsls094<br />
<br />
I'm also wondering, if anyone who knows the structure, can tell me what could &quot;Pred.&quot; and &quot;Akt.&quot; columns (Yes/No) possibly mean? I have a feeling &quot;Akt.&quot; might mean Activated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
With domains you can restrict e.g. a string field to contain only capitals, numeric e.g. only to contain the numbers 1 to 10. Also the format can be defined.<br />
<br />
With reference tables you make sure that you can only have order lines if the order exists. Since baan doesn't use specific database logic (we support different ones), this kind of information is stored in the baan dictionary, not in the database.<br />
<br />
Reference mode can be e.g. mandatory (so field value must exists in the reference table) or mandatory unless empty.<br />
<br />
Akt. is indeed activated, the other column in front of it is Mandatory yes/no.<br />
<br />
tdilc006: blocking reasons <br />
tdsls092: not present on the server which I have available right now <br />
tdsls093; same<br />
tcmcs001: Units<br />
tiitm001: Item data<br />
tttxt001: Containts texts numbers as stored in your table, must be used with tttxt010<br />
tdsls094: not available right here.<br />
<br />

Btw, I found out what tdsls might mean: Table names are also standardised for example &quot;tdsls040&quot; is &quot;sales order header&quot; table. &quot;td&quot; stands for &quot;Distribution&quot; Package, &quot;sls&quot; for sales module (which is part of the Distribution Package) and 040 is a running number.<br />
<br />
Is there a document explaining baan's data model (in detail, explaining the tables etc.) anywhere?</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
years ago, there a BaaN broshure with the title &quot;Do you speak baanisch ?&quot; exists.<br />
Another source is a AD (Administration) coursebook.<br />
<br />
But it's simple :<br />
<br />
Package     Module      9999   M/S  000<br />
<br />
tc              mcs          0102    m     000<br />
<br />
Means :<br />
<br />
Package = Common<br />
MODULE = Master Common Data (System Tables)<br />
<br />
Sessioncode :<br />
<br />
At position 2 the type of session is coded :<br />
1 = Maintain<br />
2 = Update<br />
4 = Print<br />
5 = Display<br />
<br />
In position 1,3,4 the main table for the session is coded.<br />
In example its table tcmcs002 = Currencys<br />
<br />
M = Mainsession<br />
S = Subsession<br />
<br />
If the last the numbers are 000 it's normaly a standard from BaaN .<br />
<br />
Hope it helps a little bit, to understand what tisfc0501m000 means ? ;-)<br />
<br />
<br />
