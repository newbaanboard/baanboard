	I have a purchased customized item which I would like to remove from the inventory. I tried to do an inventory adjustment using Enter Inventory Transaction tdilc1120m000 session but every time you fill in the project number, the only option in the Transaction Type field is Inventory Transfer and it does not let you change it to Inventory Adjustment.<br />
<br />
	Can anyone help me on how I can scrap some inventory on customized items?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help,<br />

   You wouldnt be able to do an adjustment directly on to a PCS item. For this purpose, you would have to transfer this item to a standard item and then adjust it off from there. If you have to create a new item code for this purpose, you could block this item after you comit the above mentioned transaction. <br />
<br />
The sessions you would need to conduct the above mentioned transaction are<br />
1) Maintain Planned PRP Warehouse Orders (Wrh to Project) {tipcs5130m000}<br />
2) Confirm Planned PRP Warehouse Orders (Wrh to Project) {tipcs5230m000}. This could be done in step 1 too..<br />
3) Transfer Planned PRP Warehouse Orders (Wrh to Project {tipcs5270m000}.<br />
<br />
Once you are done with these three steps, you could do an inventory adjustment on the transferred item.<br />
<br />
Alternative to the above step would be to write off your stock in PCS. This is done through session Close Project {tipcs2250m000}. Once you enter the project number, enter the value that you want to write off and click continue. <br />

Note: If you are going ahead with these transaction, i would recommend creating a new item code so as to capture the costs correctly. In case you transfer to an existing item, the transferred item would take up the existing standard item cost and so you might have differences...</div></div><hr />
