<br />
Is it possible to setup a purchased item in LN so it has a small BOM under it. Say item A  which is made up of B and C.  Item A is purchased. When item A is received, LN actualy receives item B and C into inventory, not item A. <br />
<br />
In our case, the vendor will not supply the parts individualy so we need to purchase the set of parts under one item number but receive the individual items.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, This is possible in LN .For this scenario, you have to  go  for &quot;List Item Functionality&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">13th January 2009, 11:26</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use a normal Manufactured / Purchased item with 'Phantom' set to 'Yes' in Item Production Data. Define your components in the BOM, When you create a PO for this item, the 'Inventory Handling' field in PO LInes automatically defaults to 'By Component', i.e. you will be receiving the components and not the main item.<br />
Therefore when you receive, you receive the main item, but the system will update the inventory of the components (using the receipt BOM).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sjohnson</div><div class="date">13th January 2009, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. I'll have a look at this functionality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the time of processing of Purchase order It is giving attached message while Inventory handling fileds in purchase order lines is &quot;By Component&quot; .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">15th January 2009, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Umesh,<br />
I'm not able to replicate the error message you are getting, not sure if it is b'coz of difference in FP2 &amp; 3.<br />
Mine setup is simple, I defined Item A as phantom item and then attached item B and Item C to its BOM. Costed all 3 items and then raised PO on item A. The 'Inventory Handling' field on 'Receiving' tab of the PO Lines session is automatically set to 'By Component' and there is no error message while creating the PO or during processing of the same.<br />
On Baan Knowledge base also there are some incidents mentioning the same issue but on lower versions of baan, all mentioning about a field &quot;Posting Status&quot; on PO Line session, I don't see any field like that on PO Line at my end. Could you please confirm the same at your end also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">15th January 2009, 12:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Johnson,<br />
Were you able to process the PO line for the phantom item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">helloakshay</div><div class="date">15th January 2009, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Johnson,<br />
Were you able to process the PO line for the phantom item?<br />
<br />
dear, i have also made the simulation at my end and it has worked with no problem.<br />
i think this may be the effect of retrofitting solutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sjohnson</div><div class="date">15th January 2009, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">All,<br />

I tried the phantom method as per above posts but still end up receiving top level item into inventory, even though it is set as a phantom on session tiipd0101m000 ( items - production ). Is there somewhere elese this needs to be set? <br />
<br />
I also had a look at the 'list' functionality. This seems like a good fit for our senario but it did not work. Probobly because I need to setup a specific item group for list items. <br />
<br />
We're on FP3.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">16th January 2009, 05:38</div></div><div class="posttext">we're also on FP3 and both the options are working fine at our end...<br />
<br />
Can you check the 'Receiving' tab of PO Lines session (in single occ.), the value of Inventory Handling should default to &quot;By Components&quot; if the selected item is a Phantom item (i.e. phantom field in item production data set to yes and BOM is maintained for this phantom item) or if the selected item is a List item (i.e. Item type is List and item type spec. is Kit and List components are defined for this list item)<br />
<br />
Also check if there is any customized component at your end...<br />
<br />
If there is no customized component and still the above two options are not working (even with all correct setup), then log an incident with infor and let them have a look at your software components</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sjohnson</div><div class="date">16th January 2009, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked the 'by components field' as you suggested on the PO line and this was indeed the problem. Both processes ( Phantom and list ) now function correctly.  Is there any advantage / disadvantage to using one method other the other?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Umesh Mittal</div><div class="date">19th January 2009, 09:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Rkathait,<br />
<br />
I have checked &quot;Phantom Functionality &quot;  on another server, It is working fine.Probelm was due to some updation in that server.<br />
<br />
Thanks once again......</div></div><hr />

<br />
No major advantages or disadvantages as such, if the item is purchased then use list/kit item functionality and if it is manufactured inhouse (i.e. assembled) then use manufactured/phantom item functionality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sjohnson</div><div class="date">21st January 2009, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sjohnson</div><div class="date">27th January 2009, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a follow-up question,<br />
If Kit item A has components B and C,  and you have demand for item C, I would have expected EP to create a planned PO for item A. In my testing I get a planned PO for item C??  Is there something else I need to setup so that planning recommends the purchase of item A instead of the actual component?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
