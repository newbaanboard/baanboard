<br />
We can change the item type from purchase to manufacturing, set the phantom flags to use phantom inventory, the phantom shows on the production order up to phantom inventory, but the question is how does it post to finance?  We did not change the item group.<br />
<br />
Goal is to use up the phantom inventory and post correctly to finance.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

For. E.g: Computer System could be a Phantom because it contains a CPU, Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse etc...<br />
Therefore what really gets issued in the system are the CPU's or monitors etc..Not the Computer System. <br />
The phantoms give away to the underlying manufactured or purchased items as and when they are issued or delivered..So i dont see any financial effect caused by the Phantom item...<br />
