<br />
during confirmation of sale quotation zoom project field &amp; give first free number for project.<br />
<br />
You generated sale quotation from budget project so whenever confirmation/processing sale quotation into sales order then we have to specify project first free number to create single project which is copy of your budget project as we can't use same budget project into logistics transactions.It is only for budgeting purpose.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
