<br />
The question first of all to expereinced people using Baan V particularily in MRP-DRP planning. We use baan IVc4 for several years and so to  suit our needs in resource palnning we launch mrp and drp sessions (separetley, often via jobs). Sometimes it causes problems esp. if jobs are launched in series. <br />
<br />
The question is - is it true that fifth version of baan uses the single method of resource planning - including mrp,drp all in one and maybe smth. else? <br />
<br />
We haven't got the Vth yet so we'll be pleased to get some details of this kind.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

There are 2 planning methods in V. Enterprise planning and SIC. EP includes the MPS, MPR, DRP and PCS planning in one system. Added functionality in DRP is the cluster. In IV the setup is done by warehouse but in V it is done by cluster. A cluster can be one or many warehouses.</div></div><hr />

Thanks,<br />
<br />
And EP planning - it run in the same manner as IV? The same procedures, the same technology as IVth?<br />
Shall we have the opportunity to launch planning (EP) using one trigger or the procedures still keeping separately launched and controlled?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">In EP there are Master Planning and Order Planning. Both can be started from one session. The planning is done via one session and no sequencing is needed. Only sequencing is between SIC,  TP (Big project Planning) and EP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it 'll be more clear  when we'll got Baan V distribution. That is the question of future</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">One other important thing, and excuse my lack of knowledge of Baan IV, is that Baan V Enterprise Planning will not only allow you to run MPS, MRP, DRP etc... through one session...but it will also allow you to kick these planning functions off in multiple logistics companies using just one session in one company.<br />
<br />
I'm not certain how this was done in Baan IV.<br />
<br />
I have been a planner, materials manager, supply chain director etc...basically a functional user who has done some consulting work and I will say that Baan V EP, once understood, works extremely well compared to standard offerings in other ERP packages.</div></div><hr />
