<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">26th July 2006, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now we use Single Logistics multi finance<br />
set up. Few months ago we brought in a small plant in California  into the<br />
same set up. Main plant is in NY<br />
However we have some common parts used in both locations and since both the<br />
warehouses are nettable,  plannig engine 'netts' the demand in NY with<br />
inventory in California or vice versa. When we go to the production orders,<br />
user realize the inventory is in California and that's the issue.<br />
<br />
We know this could be handled fine using two logistics companies, but we dont want to go that route as its pretty complex<br />
<br />
We are not looking for a silver bullet, rather soliciting ideas from you experts so we could handle the situation using single logistics set up. Any thoughts/ideas would be very useful<br />

2. Windows 2000 Advanced Server(NT)<br />
3. MS SQL 2000<br />
