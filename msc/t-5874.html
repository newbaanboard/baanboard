Or use report orders completed globally and accept zero completions but you end up with lots of zero orders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe there is somebody who can use SQL and update the table by taking a look to the 'Last update date:'. The date is, according to me, earlier than today. <br />
(But there are several fields, which you should change.)<br />

<br />
It is &quot;knowing&quot; what needs to be undone which we were hoping someone may have pioneered as Baan obviously did not expect people to make this type of error !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because of such actions of users, we tell all our users by such kind of sessions to choose one ordernumber and then save the form by ==&gt; OPTIONS: ==&gt; SAVE DEFAULTS.<br />
Then they HAVE to change the value.<br />

Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael Phifer</div><div class="date">18th July 2002, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I DO NOT recommend correcting this error by modifying the tables.   Even if the individual &quot;Knows&quot; what they are doing.   Baan has so many links, dependencies and relationships; that even the most knowledgeable person could inadvertently make errors.   In table maintenance, these errors are NOT easily found, identified and fixed.<br />
<br />
You are much better off deleting each order and resubmitting them.   I know it is slow and tedeous, but it is the safest approach.<br />
