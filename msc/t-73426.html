<br />
I am an engineer working on improving a specific product line's efficiency and the best way to accomplish this is through building multiple sub-assemblies at a time and combining said sub-assemblies in a final build. <br />
<br />
My production manager tells me that it is impossible to account for the time spent on each sub-assembly in the final project and thus sub-assemblies are not a viable solution. This leads us to taking an entire BOM and phantomizing the entire build into over 200 parts.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to create work-orders for 10 of a single sub-assembly and having the time for one of those sub-assemblies roll into the final time accounting for the overall project for a single final unit? Any resource i can be pointed to would be appreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

We could build 30 of component and peg it to 15 potential customers.  Each customer got an equal share of the cost of building those components.  Technically I guess you could say the hours did not roll into the next higher, but the cost did.  I am not sure about the commercial version of baan.<br />
<br />
I would think there is a way to do what you are asking.  I am just not sure how in the non-A&amp;D world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you include all of the production orders for the subassemblies in the project along with the production order for the final assembly you should be fine. You will need to be sure that labor is being captured by it's own cost price component but then you should be able to report labor for the whole project.<br />
