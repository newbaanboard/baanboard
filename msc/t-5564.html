1. For Lot items in the Items Master, do we have to set the Flags for BackFlush Materials &amp; BackFlush if Materials to &quot;NO&quot;?<br />
<br />
2. After Completiong &amp; Closing the production orders , we print Actual Costs by production Orders, however, the hours are always Zero. How do we post the hours for Lot items? <br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

I am not sure, but my idea about the lot issue is, that the way lots are handled in manufacuring is non conclusive. Lots are used in distribution and (within Baan, speaking about Baan IV) assigned at the moment the items are put in the warehouses (using tdilc4113s000 on closing production orders).<br />
<br />
My guess then would be that you cannot assign hours and costs to the lots themselves. They should end up on the item code (without lotcode)...</div></div><hr />

2. You should not be able to close the order if no hours were posted? Is your terminology correct? Sounds like the setup is incorrect. Check routing for bflush = yes. check Parameters for bflush timing and if you want to bflush materials you need to switch it on in the parameters.</div></div><hr />
