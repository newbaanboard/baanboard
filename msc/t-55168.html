<br />
We're thinking about implementing and using Enterprise Planning module of LN 6.1. I'm trying to understand the level of difficultly to undertake this, I was thinking of getting some consultants in to configure and setup (plus training).<br />
<br />
Has anybody any experience of this? Is it about 5 days work for a consultant?<br />
Any gotches!!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />

<br />
EP in Ln6.1 is not difficult to implement. I assume that you are in discrete <br />
<br />
manufacturing business. Only the mapping and set-up needs to be done<br />
<br />
properly and your inventories need to be accurate(assuming you are already <br />
<br />
implemented and running other modules).<br />
<br />
Best of Luck.</div></div><hr />

Five days ... assuming that the estimate has been given with that in mind could be right.<br />
<br />
I will say one thing and that is to be careful not to make it too complex.  You should have an idea of what the results will be and what your staff will be able to handle.  You do not want to disillusion everyone by implementing something that does not reflect reality or the physical capabilities of your company.<br />
<br />
If you'd like further advise or independent help with it then let me know.<br />
<br />
Note: The training time required would really depend on the number of dept/staff as there may be different needs for each area.<br />
