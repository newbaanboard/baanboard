BaaN Vc<br />
----------<br />
Can somebody help please? We are in serious problem.<br />
When we do cycle counting and click on process line, the message comes &quot;Too many surcharges&quot; and then gives the nessage Processing complete. But when i take the valuation the amount comes as zero.<br />
Morover in the table whwmd215 it updates the stock but does not do so in whinr140.<br />
In the session whina1512m000 MAUC is still zero.<br />
<br />
I have defined totally 58 surcharges for the item with triggering point as Receipt.<br />
<br />
Can somebody advise as to what could be the problem? Obviously it seems to be the surcharges, but I have alreday run the cost pricing and i feel it is too late now to change the surcharges.</div></div><hr />
