<br />
We need to copy some standard items which need some adjustments. Now we have some items on which I can unlink derived from item and some items this options is greyed out.<br />
<br />
I took two items in which I see no differences in settings, but the one item if copied I have the option to unlink derived from and the ohter item I have not.<br />
<br />
Both these standard items are purchase items.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

For All standard item is grey.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;problem&quot; is not in the item list itself. Maybe the problem is not clear enough. We have let say a standard generic item, this items has a BOM with more items, these can be generic or standard items. Now the customer wants this item but just with another option.<br />
<br />
Then in Dashboard items:<br />
We build the standard generic item, copy this item to a new item X. Then we go into the BOM and pick the item that has to change. We copy this item with &quot;Customized item structure copy to customized item structure&quot; or &quot;Standard item structure copy to customized item structure&quot;. When we copy from a standard item structure, it is important to unlink the derived from item. For most of our standard items this option is available after the copy process, but we have some items in which this opion is greyed out.<br />
<br />
The question now is why this is greyed out for some parts, or better what causes Baan to make this option available or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
