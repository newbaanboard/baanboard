<br />
This scenario is in Baan Vc.<br />
<br />
I have a production order for 10 pcs. At Operation 50, I reject 6pcs and Report Operation Complete (ROC) Oper 50. I'm left with 4 pcs on Operation 60. Operation 60 is a Subcontracting Operation. I Generate a Subcontracting Purchase order using the standard session... and It creates a Pur Ord for 4 pcs. I send out the 4 pcs for outside processing and recieve them back in.<br />
At Operation 70, I release that I should not have rejected 6 pcs... but rejected only 1 pcs. <br />
Baan will let me go and Un-ROC the operations until operation 50, correct the reject Qty to 1 and complete 9 pcs.<br />
<br />
Here is my problem. I've already created a Pur Order for 4 pcs. Is it possible to create another purchase order on the same operation for these remaining 5 pcs. Baan stops me from creating another Pur Ord for the same operation.<br />
<br />
How do I work around this. I tried adding a new position to the old Pur Order for 5 pcs, But I cannot receive it back into the prod order.<br />
 (Dont want to pursue the option of creating a dummy item on a manual Pur order, add it to the prod order BOM and receive it into stock and issue it to the prod order).<br />
<br />
<br />
All help is appreciated. Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
