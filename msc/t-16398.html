<br />
We have a gases industry where the input is one item but the output is 3 final products at the same time.<br />
<br />
Notes : <br />
1- we don't have a standard ratio for these products.<br />
2- When we produce one of these products we can't cancel the production of the other products.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our questions are :<br />
<br />
1- Is there a way to produce the 3 items using one production order.<br />
2- In case of BOM for one of the products the input is one item but there is many outputs will be produced with this product so how can we make this BOM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In process industries like that, indeed it's a common occurence to have co-products beside the main product. In manufacturing industries (as opposed to process industries), co-products are rare, except in cases like injection moulding etc. Hence, for process industries, Baan created a special Baan Process module, which is available in BaanIV, but unfortunately unavailable in BaanERP.<br />

Protean seems to be the Process solution in Baan6 and will be an add on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Adding negative line in BOM does take care of the distribution and manufacturing aspects of co-products, but how about financial aspects? The main product and all co-products will not have the correct standard cost for one thing. Also, the variance analysis of the production order will come out with wrong amount. But of course, everything's OK if the client is not using Baan Finance module<br />
