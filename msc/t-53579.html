<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">7th September 2008, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi folks,<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a clever way to handle a warehouse of metal (or, in my case, wooden) plates. I want to be able to do (manual) material handling in pieces (so, take out &quot;1/2 plate&quot; from warehouse, and use it for two(!) production orders). So the stock unit should be &quot;plate&quot;. However, to have a proper material costs estimation, I want the item unit to be m², and I want the material on the production order itself booked according to the quanitity of the respective BOMs. <br />
<br />
If I do backflushing, I have my production orders fine, but the stock of the plates will end up in m² then (and I will have to manually deal with the scrap, to have a precise stock quantity), and I will have no information any longer, how these total m² are split up in half plates/total plates and so on, which is important for doing the purchase.<br />
<br />
If I'd mark the plates as pick stock (is this the correct english label? &quot;Greifvorrat&quot; in german), I could do the material handling as I want (using adjustment orders), however this material doesn't show up in the estimated and actual costs of the production order and items. However, these plates make up nearly 100% of the material costs so I need to have those costs.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for is a way to have some sort of backflushing on the production order without having actual material movements in the warehouse, so I can do this manually and *decoupled* from actual production orders. I'm pretty sure that there is nothing in the standard here, but still I'd like to heare about how others are handling their stock of plates. <br />

May be you can define no decimal places for plate unit and see if this works out. I think you may end up in odd numbers like 1.2 plates etc...<br />
