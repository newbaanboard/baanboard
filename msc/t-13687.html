<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dmcgrath</div><div class="date">21st November 2003, 13:07</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a problem of production being overbooked.<br />
<br />
At present our options to remove this overbooking is to inventory adjust the finished good item and then enter material issue for the production order and manually change the quantity to be issued or enter a negative issue if the material(s) have already been issued.<br />
<br />
Example.<br />
<br />
Finished good item 3000949.<br />
Has a BOM containing 12 raw materials<br />
(The sub assemblies are phantoms)<br />
<br />
So if 500 are booked instead of 50 on production order 123456 we have to inventory adjust 300949 by -450.<br />
Then, in enter material issue for production orders for order 123456 we have to either reduce the quantity to be issued by 450 multiplied by the BOM quantity for all 12 raw materials or if the materials have been issued enter a negative issue quantity of 450 multiplied by the BOM quantity and then run issue inventory to correct the raw material stock.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our problem with this is that we have many finished goods items that have a hundred or more raw materials and so reversing these overbookings can be very time consuming.<br />
<br />
Ideally, we would like to be able to report a negative quantity complete in session report production schedules complete by RPT item. Which would then create the negative issue for all the raw materials.<br />
<br />
I'm presuming our only option is to customise the session.<br />
<br />
Is there a better method than that described above to correct the overbooking that is standard functionality in Baan? <br />
<br />
Has anyone else faced similar problems, if so what have you done to make the process easier and less time consuming?<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if the functionality of later versions of Baan allow a negative production booking to take place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">21st November 2003, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on BaanIVc4 and as far as I know this is the only supported procedure for negative bookings on production orders. We have exactly the same problem and haven't found a better solution either.<br />
Another disadvantage of this procedure for us is, that the inventory of the manufactured item can not be adjusted in that way and has to be done seperatly. So sometimes we use rework orders for that issue, despite the fact that all estimated materials have to be entered manually.<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />

<br />
Maybe life can be made easier. Use inventory transaction, using an afs session to handle the stock correction. All is needed as basic information is production order number and quantity overbooked. The afs session subsequently can handle the necessary stock transactions (by going throug production bom). In this way no customization is needed in Baan, a report adjustment might be enough to get the job done.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<br />
if your finance people don't mind (in our case stock correction is regarded as something illegal :rolleyes: ), this will be a nice solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dmcgrath</div><div class="date">24th November 2003, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Martin/Klaas for your comments.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately as Martin suggested our finance people would not be happy with any solution that requires Inventory Adjustments to be made, this being another reason why we wish to move away from the current method of correcting overbooking.<br />
<br />
Looks like we need to investigate a customisation as I had original thought<br />
