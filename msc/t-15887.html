<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">6th July 2004, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 production lines. I only have one crew of workers, so I can only run one line on a given day. Each product I build either runs down line 1 or line 2 (not both), so my routings are setup so that line 1 is a work center, and line 2 is a separate work center, and each item is either linked to line 1 or 2 in the routing. In work centers session, I have production line 1 and production line 2 setup as separate work centers. Both have basic day capacity = 16 hours (we work two 8 hour shifts).<br />
<br />
My problem is that when I look in Work Center Utilization by Day Overview session, it shows me that both production lines are available all day, every day (each is available for 16 hours, based on the work center basic day availability field). The fact of the matter is that today, I might run production line 1, tomorrow I might run production line 2, and the next day I might run 1/2 the day on production line 1, &amp; 1/2 the day on production line 2. But I NEVER have a day where both lines are available for production for 16 hours. I do not know how I am going to run until the day before I make the production schedule. But Baan is showing me I have both lines available each day, which makes using the Capacity Planning features impossible. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I might better set up this scenario to make this a useful tool? I could stup each work center as 8 hours available each day, but this will be unrealistic as well!<br />

THANKS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">6th July 2004, 22:38</div></div><div class="posttext">For each work center setup a calendar for the days that you wish to run that work center.  Produce Item A on even days and Item B on Odd days.  This is what you need to look at if you use the same calendar you are saying you have two work centers and they are both available on the same day.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
