I thought of sharing this. We develped an HTML based Bill of Material through Baan.<br />
It has two section, one - Indented BOM and other Summarized section. All the part numbers has hyperlinks for the specification of compnents and that can be accessed via internet. We emailed such BOM to our manufacturers and it has helped us a lot in giving the information more quicker and easier. You may also like this. See the attachment.<br />

I have seen a lot during my 14 years in the ERP arena and have to say a nice piece of work. Especially when you realize it is done for BAAN IV which is not that easy to expose.<br />
Good that you share this kind of information with the rest of the user community.<br />
Did you build this yourself?<br />

Yes I did this my self. It took 2-3 days tomake it work. All it is doing is creating a HTML file from Baan (using Baan Reports), Emailing HTML file (we have command line email client for Windows that is called from Baan), and doing sftp to our servers for the hyperlink. SImple concept, but when put together can be powerful.<br />

<br />
Very good job. I am doing the same but at SQL Server Level and the output will be in our report writer.<br />
<br />
I will post my queries (SQL Server) once I have completed them.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">10th May 2006, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using Baan BOM logic, so I need not worry about exploding BOM. The BOM logic can be quite involved like revision, effective date, item type changes to Manufacture to purchase etc. <br />
I would be interested to see SQL code. <br />
