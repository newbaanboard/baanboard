<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carlb85</div><div class="date">8th January 2023, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everybody, I wolud like to have a table of all articles which we have in our company to make some analyses in power bi.<br />
<br />
The list of article in our company is very long and so it takes a long time to get this date from a query with EasySQL.<br />
<br />
Because I donâ€™t want to create this table every time again for all arcticles I would like to update this table only for new articles which are created after the last update of my query. <br />
<br />
Is there any field in BaaN where I could get the information when an artice was createtd in Baan. If I looked up right there is no field like this in table tiitm001. <br />
<br />
Do you have any solution? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th January 2023, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">If was doing it I would create our own table.  When they inserted a new item, then I would update our own item table with the date the record was created.  Then in easy SQL you could join the tables and check the create date.<br />
<br />
I never really used power BI so not sure what is involved - I think we used to export full tables when we used baan as our ERP system and then on the BI side they would run processes in the back ground to just pull what was updated from the records, rather than reloading the whole things.  This was all automated as far as I know.  I was never really knowledgeable about what goes on in that side of the house.   Maybe someone else has some other suggestions.</div></div><hr />
