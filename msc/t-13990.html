<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Richard</div><div class="date">26th December 2003, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on 5c and since I am not a finance person I won't answer you question the way you asked it, but I think I can provide you some valuable information.  Baan changed their way of calculating cost and lead time when the went from 4c, 5b to 5c.  The used to calculate man and machine work centers differently, now they cost them the same.  If you have a machine the cost for that work center would by calculated using the number of resource units to run the machine, and the cycle time was just the run rate.  For a man work center you would but in a cycle (run time) equal to one resource unit doing the task, and the cost would be calculated using those numbers. If you wanted to increase you output a man work center, you would at more resource units to the work center (on the routing). In 5c they started treating a man work center the same as a machine work center.  Now if you add more resource units to a man work center it does the math the same as a machine and your cost go up.  Baan solution to this was to decrease your cycle time by the amount of resource you wanted to increase by to keep your cost the same as in 4 and 5b.  We didn't accept this and had them change the code to make it work the same as it did in 4 and 5b.  They did this with parameter settings and re-activating some fields that they had deactivated.<br />

Hope this  helps,<br />

<br />
Actual costing in B40c4  is because of localization of B40c4 and is based on Central govt tax on production of goods . It's not related to the actual costing in Baan 5c which  rini and mike talks about.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for all your help.....<br />
<br />
But in our client, they want to accumulate all actual operations cost , surcharges cost for all production activity in one periods.<br />
<br />
At the end of the month, they want to divide all cost to each of Finish Goods item (result of the production in this period).<br />
<br />
So our questions, is it possible / not Baan handle this process using Cost Price Calculation in Manufacturing Module ??<br />
<br />
Or we must used activity based costing to solve this problem ??<br />
<br />
<br />
We wait your suggestions for it. :confused: <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Rini</div></div><hr />
