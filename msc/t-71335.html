The BOMs in 4c4 use the inventory storage unit.  I am not sure about LN.  I do not know of a reasonable way to do it in 4c4.  You could always make the BOM qty .001, but then the inventory person needs to make sure they only issue the correct amount.  Actually on some of these items they just make the BOM quantity 0 - since some of the items are overhead items.  Then the shopfloor employees just request what they need.  None are really good options in 4c4.  Let see what others or ln does.</div></div><hr />
