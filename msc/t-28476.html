<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cjunek</div><div class="date">22nd October 2006, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I haven't tried using manufactured items within the phantom. The structure is as follows.<br />
<br />
End Item - manufactured - not a phantom with a routing<br />
Child 1 - purchased item<br />
Child 2 - purchased item<br />
Child 3 - manufactured sub assembly - Phantom Item with a routing<br />
Child 1 of subassembly - purchased<br />
Child 2 of subassembly - purchased.<br />
<br />
I put a routing under both manufactured items.<br />
My expectation of putting a manufactured item as child 3 in the phantom subassembly is that the manufactured item would be treated like any other non-phantom subassembly. It would be treated the same as the two purchased item. The only difference would be that it would have been produced with it's own production order.<br />
<br />
If I have a routing for the phantom subassembly, would the manufactured item under it be treated differently than stated above? What would your expectation have been?</div></div><hr />

  I tried out your scenario of a manufactured phantom item holding two purchased sub assembly items. The tests did show that the routing of the phantom item wasnt applied to the items under it or the manufactured non-phantom item that it belonged to. <br />
As you must be aware that the phantom item gives away to the two purchased items when the main item (non-phantom manufactured) is being produced(the two purchased item gets added to the main manufactured item BOM replacing the phantom item). Since there is no production order for the phantom item, the routing just dissappears. If you look at it, how do you propose it to be applied? There seems to be no scope for the routing to be applied.<br />
<br />
I wasnt able to test the phantom manufactured item having another manufactured item, but i am not too optimistic about the results.<br />

The routing of the phantom item is used to calculate the requirement dates for the items (purchased or manufactured) below it. This is with the assumption that you have not built the manufacturing time for the phantom item (sub assemply in your case) in the manufacturing time (routing) of the main item. <br />

<br />
I cannot propose how the situation with a phantom item with routing is to be applied. My purpose is to understand the value of a routing attached to a phantom. Once I have an understanding then perhaps there are applications within my company that should make use of the routing.<br />
<br />
Have you read the response after yours. It seems to indicate that the routing is used to calculate the requirement dates for the items (purchased or manufactured) below it. Do you feel this is correct. I'll have to give it some thought before I respond to that post. <br />
<br />
At first glance it seems to make sense and I'll go back to see how Baan planned the purchased items in the phantom item. I must say this sounds interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cjunek</div><div class="date">24th October 2006, 03:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response. I will test out the situation to see what requirement dates were calculated. What I don't understand is the value of this functionality in the routing attached to a phantom. <br />
<br />
I can understand the value of calculating the requirement dates for the components but I can't understand how this helps us without a mechanism such as a production order to identify the tasks in the routing that must be performed, and if we have a production order then why have the item as a phantom.<br />
<br />
I am trying to understand a situation where this would be beneficial, else why would the functionality be in Baan. Can you see any circumstance where a company would want this? If yes, can you elaborate. At the moment I am still lost on how the use of a routing for a phantom helps the overall production of an end item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The routing for a phantom item is (as far as I know) used in 2 places:<br />
1. Cost price calculation. If there is a default routing on the phantom it will be used for costprice. Beware: if you include the same routing on the parent item (of the phantom) it will be counted twice!!<br />
2. Generation on bill of critical capacities in MPS (where it should not be used)<br />
<br />
MRP calculation does not use it.<br />
<br />
It is not a good idea to have a default routing on a phantom. However you can have another routing on it. This would then be used (manually) if for some reason you were to manufacture the phantom and put it into inventory. This could be for instance the case if the machine that consumes the phantom has broken down and you still want to continue the production of the phantom and put it (temporarily) into inventory.<br />
<br />
Hope this clarifies</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much. Your explanation is very understandable. Much Appreciated.<br />
