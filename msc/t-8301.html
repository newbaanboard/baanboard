<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srikarthy</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 08:24</div></div><div class="posttext">You cannot add the enterprise unit and model in the DEM parameters - session, since it'll ask for password. Therefore, you can fill up the enterprise unit and other relevant details in the appropriate table using Gereral Table Maintenance.<br />
<br />
I too had this problem and solved it as mentioned the above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aldendata</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Than you for answer.<br />
But because EM is obligatory I try to implement Enterprise Modeler by Baan  module procedure UP121A US, but on the start I have to define EM parameters in session tgbrg0100s000. When I try to do it, get session tgbrg1165m000 where I have to write password. But I do not now password.. I spoke with my dealer and he told me that I had to define password when I installed Baan. But I do not  remember that I had opportunity to do that in installation procedure. <br />
Can you tell me the way, which I can get password.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its mandatory to use Enterprise Units in Baan V. Enterprise units act as a link to determine the company where the financial transaction for every logistical transaction has to be posted. <br />
<br />
An Enterprise unit can be any of the following entities in Baan V - Warehouse, workcenter, Purchase Office, Sales Office, Service Office and Accounting Office. For example, in a multi-logistic and multi-finacial company setup, it is the enterprise unit which acts like a bridge to determine for every logistical transaction, in which financial company a corresponding financial transaction should take place. For example, a Purchase Office PO1 is linked to EU1. EU1 is the link between logistical company 501 and financial company 670. Therefore for a logistical transaction called ' Purchase Order created on Business Partner GE450001' in a logistical company 501 by Purchase Office PO1, a corresponding financial transaction takes place in company 670.<br />
<br />
This way you can model multi-currency, multi-country organizations. Contact Baan for full details on how to make good use of enterprise units.<br />
