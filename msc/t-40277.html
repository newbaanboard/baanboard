I have a following question for MRP requirement logic:<br />
<br />
1. While running MRP engine Does requirement for an component item includes Parent item's Production or not.<br />
<br />
Because as per a book (On general MRP Concept), it says that MRP Requiremnet does not include parent's schduled receipt as a requirement for the component as inventory has already been assigned to the production order.But I think MRP engine should consider parent's scheduled receipt untill component is actually released for that.<br />
<br />
Please verify and confirm.<br />

Your question is not clear. If you are asking if the sheduled receipt of parent drives the component requirement which in Baan terms means a planned production (MRP/MPS) or production order. Respective of the quantity remaining in scheduled receipt, system keep track of the quantity required. For e.g. it is quite possible that schedule receipt for a produuction order may be zero, but the component still may have requirement, if not consumed for wahtever reason. May be you can calrify your question little bit.<br />

I think even with the doubtful question you have cleared by doubt by your reply :)<br />
Yes I was asking in terms of the BaaN only. Whether the scheduled receipt of the parent drives the component requirement or not. <br />
I was also under the same impression that untill a component is taken out of on hand inventory,System should take parent sheduled receipt as the requirement for the component and you just made it confirm.<br />
Thanks a lot for your reply.Incase you want to add something Pleaseee...<br />

I guess now you are referring to production orders now and probaly your questions stems from MPS. When a production order is created, at the same time, firm requirment are created for the components - like planned transaction. And based on whether one is backflshing or going for manual issuing the component requirement gets affected. So, in my opinion it is nothing to do with the parent scheduled receipt. All, it depeneds upon what is the open requirement. And as you know one can always manually go and zero out the component requirement, resulting in production variance. I feel, though your question is relevant, but component requirement and scheduled receipt are failry independent of each other.<br />
