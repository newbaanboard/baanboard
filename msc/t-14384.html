<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dmcgrath</div><div class="date">4th February 2004, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Some months ago we created new SCH Sales contracts for a new customer/delivery address combination and put an expiry date against the old SCH sales contracts, when we do this we normally create a Sales Schedule for the old contract with zero requirements and then cancel the old contract.<br />
<br />
We have since found a number of these old contracts which although expired still have a Live status and have outstanding sales schedule requirements. These items are still being planned in MPS.<br />
<br />
We are somewhat suprised that MPS is still planning against expired contracts even though the sales schedules have outstanding requirements.<br />
<br />
Due to our normal procedure of creating zero requirements on the sales schedule and then cancelling the sales contracts, we have not noticed this unusual functionality before.<br />
<br />
Have other users noticed similar problems?<br />
<br />
I just thought I'd get some feedback before logging a case with BGS.<br />

I think it was fixed in sp8 on 4c4.</div></div><hr />
