I was searching and couldn't find an answer.   Our Quality Assurance department scrapped 6 pieces.  After further investigation, 3 of the parts are considered within tolerance and usable.  <br />
<br />
Is there a way to reverse the parts that were scrapped when the production order is closed in Baan IV B40c V91?<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
