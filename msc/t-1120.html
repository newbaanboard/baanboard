<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noonie</div><div class="date">20th February 2002, 23:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently upgraded from c3 to c4 and have the following problem:<br />
<br />
We are basically a JIT make-to-order assembly facility. <br />
We have our finished items set up with a 2 day lead time and a 1 day safety time.<br />
The way it worked in IVc3 is MRP kicked out orders to be delivered 1 day before the sales order was due(safety time) and the start date was 2 days before the due date of the produduction order(lead time). When these orders were confirmed and transferred the dates on the SFC orders matched the MRP order dates. The &quot;Timed phased inv. mov. date&quot; on form 2 of the SFC order matched the delivery date of the order.<br />
<br />
In IVc4, the MRP planned orders work the same way, however, once transferred to SFC, the start date and delivery date remain the same, but the &quot;time phased date&quot; is now 1 day before the delievry date. This time phased date is also the date shown in the &quot;Display Planned Inventory Movements&quot; session in MRP.<br />
<br />
We have played around a bit with SFC parameters but nothing changes. Has anyone else seen this happen? Does anybody know what this &quot;Time phased inv. mov. date&quot; is calculated from?</div></div><hr />
