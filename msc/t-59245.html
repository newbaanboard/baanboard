<br />
There is one query regarding PCS, transfer the Cost from “One” project to “Another Project” at below mentioned scenario.<br />
<br />
(1)	There are some logistics Transaction has happened at Item, with Project. <br />
(2)	There are some Cost (Sundry Cost that is not concerned with Item) has been incurred at project.<br />
(3)	But now Project has been call off.<br />
(4)	Due to call off the Project, user want to transfer the cost of that project to another project<br />
<br />
Item Cost can be transferred via “Inventory Transfer) from Old Project to “New” project.But the cost which has been incurred on project could not be transferred. Is there any way to transfer the sundry Cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have try to post some cost in finance for a project,but never try to correct it from finance.<br />

I think you can try to correct this cost through finance module, then post it again to this other new project.</div></div><hr />

Can you try to use session tipcs3140m000, and input cost component and negative amount.<br />
So the actual cost for this project will be reduced with this negative amount .<br />
You can also post this to finance.<br />
But it dont remember in which menu in finance module.<br />
will update when i have get the info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same has been tried already but the issue is there that this activity is not called “Transfer the Project Cost”<br />
It is something different which means that Project cost is getting increase/decrease/Zero of the particular Project by manual intervention.</div></div><hr />
