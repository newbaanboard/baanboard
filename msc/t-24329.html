<br />
I am on Baan Vc.<br />
<br />
I have a few Production Orders as follows:<br />
<br />
Ordered quantity - 100 pcs<br />
Delivered qty - 90 pcs<br />
<br />
In the Warehouse Order related to this Production Order, I have 2 Inbound Lines, one for 90 which is totally received. The other one is for 10. <br />
<br />
Since I have completed the Production Order, there is no question of receiving the balance 10 pcs. <br />
<br />
I would like to know as to how I can remove this line for 10 pcs in the warehouse order. <br />
Also because of this I am unable to remove Closed warehousing orders as it shows that this order is pending.<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
