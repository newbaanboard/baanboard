How we can track hourly production  in FP2.Is it possible to track quantity operation wise with time,e.g.-I have a production quantity of 100 Pcs,and there are 20 operations.I want to track at the end of certain time bucket(say one hour) how much quantity is completed in each operation.Is there any standard fuctionality in LN?<br />
<br />

I meet the same problem.<br />
I have post this problem in OPS, they said that it was the standard from LN.<br />
Since the quantity in Report Operation Completed id cumulated by the system, so we can not track the data history.<br />
maybe you can set job schedule  transaction to print the session Report Operation Complete by hourly schedule .<br />
But its not practical.</div></div><hr />

Baan LN doesn't have this type of functionality..if you want than only customization patch is only solution. and on the basis of customization you will able to see any type of report, which you want.<br />
<br />
This is common problem and i have already faced this type of problem.<br />
at that moment i had solve the problem through customisation.<br />

Thank you for your suggestion.We have already gone for customization.But i think it is a common senario in every industry,because every manufacturing industry wants to now its production rate,downtime under diffrent reason etc.So there should be something in standard.Anywhy thankyou for suggestion again.<br />

The functionality is very much there, u can track hourly production report, as far as I know , it is included as a standard functionality, the customization is required incase you have some critical requirement for the same, the designing of such report is a very complex task, unless it is really important for your business process.<br />
Your requiremnt is only regarding status at operational level , the functionality is there in one of the session, our company can design the same by tweaking it to your specific  requirement.<br />
Please contact www.empover.com and you can give my reference.<br />
