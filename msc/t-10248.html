<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">5th June 2003, 05:39</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on BaaN IV c2 sch0 version. When sales schedules are enetered, the planned inventory transactions for that item are getting created. But when shipping schedules are entered there are no planned inventory transactions getting generated or not even changes made to the existing sales schedules planned inventory transactions.<br />
The problem is that the shipping schedule requirements are different to sales schedule requirements and thus the demand is not getting calculated correctly in MRP. Ideally speaking, we want demand to be calculated when shipping schedules are created. As per BaaN, this was taken care in the higher versions like NASCAR and AGS0.<br />
<br />
Has any one faced with this tpe of problem? Is there any solution for this.<br />
<br />
Your help is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
