<br />
ERP LN FP5<br />
----------<br />
<br />
I have a very unique problem.<br />
<br />
I have a few companies running Live on the same application server. The issue is in 1 comapny when I process hours accounting, the amount is updated incorrectly in ticst300. The operation rates have different rates for labor machine and overheads on machine and overheads and man. However in ticst300 for all the 4 heads it updates with the labor rate only. <br />
<br />
Eg: In operation rates<br />
<br />
I have defined : labor 10 USD<br />
                      machine 20 USD<br />
                      OH on man 5<br />
                      OH on mach 6<br />
<br />
The problem is when i see in SFC Financial transactions it takes 10 USD for all the 4 cost components.<br />
<br />
This problem is unique because I have another company in the same application but here it is calculating correctly. So this eliminates the chance of a bug. It obviously seems to be a parameter setting or something else.<br />
In tfgld482 it is okay but the problem is varuiances are calulated based on ticst300 and here I have a huge variance coming in.<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP!!!<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />

<br />
Just a guess, but take a look at the Costing tab in Shop Floor Control Parameters (tisfc0500m000 --&gt; tisfc0100s000) and make sure you are using Actual Man and Machine Rates instead of Estimated Operation Rates.<br />
<br />
Another thing you might look at:<br />
<br />
Check your Cost Price Calculation Parameters (ticpr0100m000):<br />
 <br />
- make sure that the Standard Price Calculation Code is the one that you are using when you update your Operation Rates.<br />
<br />
- it sounds like you are maintaining Operating Rates by Work Center, so make sure that Type of Operation Rates is set to 'Work Center Rate' <br />
