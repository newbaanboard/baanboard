I would like to ask if there is a cheap solution (other then BwPrint) to make barcode labels on Zebra and Laser Printers - low budget. A middleware which would allow us to change the labels over time without much trouble.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

<br />
The BarOne free version will not allow them to create ZPL code labels, therefore I think that you will be on a better shape if they get the BarOne version that allows them to print them; we are currently using the Platinum version v4.2a<br />
<br />
That is an inexpensive solution that hopefully fits your budget.<br />

Hello,<br />
on ZEBRA ZPL Printers i use ZPL Commands directly in Report pointed to a raw network based printer.<br />
Send ZPL II commands as ascii-stream to Zebra printer.<br />
I'm creating DataMatrix 2D Barcodes this way.<br />
On HP-UX it works great.<br />
<br />
On HP Laserprinters you have to install &quot;JetCaps&quot; Modules.<br />
<br />
I see, you'r on MS, will be a solution available.<br />
<br />
Third party software we use for serialnumber labels is CodeSoft with Sentinel Printpack<br />
from: www.teklynx.com<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">13th January 2006, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">RMCis offers a module within Baan (RMClabel) that allows you to configure and print bar codes to various types of label printers such as Zebra, Intermec, and Datamax.  You can specify the data sources as Baan table fields or variables, and then define the format, including 1D and 2D bar codes, texts, lines, etc.  The system does not use BWPrint.<br />
<br />
There also is the capability to dynamically vary the label format that prints in a given situation based upon the customer, supplier, item, or other information.  For example, if you are printing a shipping label, you can have one generic label, plus a specific label for a given customer, and/or an even more specific label for shipping a particular item.  All of that is dynamic -- no user intervention is required at print time.<br />
<br />
We have customers using this to print auto industry 2D labels, labels for government suppliers, serial numbers for components and finished goods, receiving labels, stock tickets and cross-docking tickets, etc.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to contact me or Kathy Barthelt (kbarthelt@rmcis.com) if you would like more information.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

We are using a product called 'Label View'  http://www.labelview.com<br />
<br />
We generate flat files from Baan that contain :<br />
<br />
 Label format (file name)<br />
 Data to go on label<br />
 printer name<br />
 number of copies<br />
<br />
<br />
Label view watches the output directory, merges the output with the label formats, and outputs to specified printer.  We print thousands of labels a day with this approach.</div></div><hr />

<br />
could you maybe post an example for such a barcode. I want to do the same. I'm able to create the needed ZPL commands as output of the report. But I don't know how to send this file to printer. If I use a printer for that print session. The commands are printed on the zebra printer instead the barcode. We use a Windows system.<br />
Many thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
best regards<br />
Ralf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">6th April 2006, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can generate the ZPL, you should have all that you need.  Just make sure that there aren't any printer drivers interfering with the text that you are trying to send.  On Windows systems, sometimes it is easier to output the ZPL to a file and then copy the file to the print queue rather than trying to go through the normal Windows printing route in Baan.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
on HP's LaserJetprinter you may use JetCaps-Modules, which allow you to print barcodes directly on printer by choosing a barcode font in BaaN report.<br />
<br />
On Kyocera Laserprinters in PCL Mode you can Use &quot;PRESCRIBE&quot; commands to<br />
set the KYO-Mode temporary.<br />
!Only one dimensional barcodes (Code 39, Code 128, EAN) are working.<br />
extern domain tcmcs.str40 barcode<br />
Example: barcode = &quot;!R! BARC 42,Y, '&quot;&amp;&lt;field&gt;&amp;&quot;' , .2, .1;EXIT;&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a little bit.<br />
<br />

Hi, take a look at http://www.arcgateway.com for an off the shelf barcode solution for SSA Baan that covers the functions you refer to and more.<br />
