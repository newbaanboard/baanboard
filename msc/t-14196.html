<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rsomogyi</div><div class="date">16th January 2004, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We currently use Scheduler (stand-alone) in a business unit where we are in the process of implementing Baan IVc4.  We tested Baan's ITK2.1 interface between BaanIVc4 and Scheduler 6.3.4 in December of 2002 and plan to go ahead with it. We plan to create our test environment at the beginning of March 2004. <br />
<br />
The documentation for ITK 2.1 says that it requires Baan IVc3 or IVc4.<br />

Feel free to reply or contact me if you have additional questions,<br />

<br />
I am a consultant in South Africa and have worked with Scheduler for a few years now, including some implementations.  Firstly, unless you move to BaanIVc4, there is no standard integration available. There are several options for BaanIVc4. The latest integration offering uses OpenWorld and ITK (integration toolkit) which I am told is database independent. If you cannot move off BaanIVc2 you will have to pretty much write your own interface, as there has never been any standard integration for that version. <br />
Sorry for the bad news, hope this helps.<br />
For more details you should contact the guys at BaanSCS support in Canada.<br />

I have one more question about the production feedback session. In this session I report the quantity processed, but it always doubles the original quantity.  Example.<br />
I have a production order of 100 pieces, then I go to production feedback to report the 100 pieces done in the operation, and at the end when the PO is closed it has a quantity of 200.  Do you know if this is a bug or how can I report the production without doubling.<br />
Thanks<br />
JONAH</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you be more specific about 'production feedback'? Were you referring to 'Report Operations Complete' or 'Report Orders Complete' session?<br />
<br />
Firstly, you should check the report operations complete session. What does the qty is that session says? Is it 100 or 200?<br />
<br />
Were you using backflushing or manual production reporting?<br />

<br />
Well, The session is for production order report.   In the original order the quantity is 100, and when I report manually the 100 done, the system doubles the quantity.  <br />
<br />
By the way, my Scheduler version is 6.3.6.3.<br />
<br />

<br />
It sounds like you guys are talking at crossed purposes. You maybe need to clarify which production feedback sessions are at issue here. It sounds to me like Hendra is referring to production feedback in Baan, i.e. report operations complete, or report production orders complete, while Jonah seems to be referring to the production feedback module in Scheduler?<br />
<br />
If the problem is in Scheduler, and you are using version 6.3.6 (which is very new) it may be a bug. You should perhaps try logging a  case with BaanSCS support in Canada.<br />
