<br />
Due to an incorrect BOM we have a number of shortages in our system when running issue inventory. The issue was caused on the BOM by NOT setting a sub assembley part to a phantom.<br />
<br />
There are far too many Prod Orders effected to correct this through the session by setting the issued qty to zero in &quot;Enter Material Issue for Production Orders&quot;. I was planning to write some SQL to set the field ticst001.issu to zero for these problem orders.<br />
<br />
Can anybody see any possible issues with correcting this field in this way as opposed to doing it through the session ?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

   You would also have to update the tdinv150(Planned Inventory Transactions By Item) table as well as the allocated field in the tiitm001(Item Master) table.. There are certain warehouse inventory table too(tdinv) that you should look for any mention of allocated fields per item...<br />
<br />
If you manage to change all that then sql statement ought to do the job. Just dont forget to reorganize the tables that you changed, not that any of these fields are index keys but its a good practice after you do changes in this fashion..<br />

<br />
So you actually follow baan application logic and all other tables (e.g. tdinv150. tiitm001,tdinv001) will get updated.<br />
<br />
We had the same problem in Baan 4c4 and API was the one we resorted to. <br />

<br />
I will probably use the safer route of the API to ensure data integrity.<br />
