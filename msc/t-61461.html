<br />
My company is currently in the process of upgrading from Unison (antique) to LN ERP version 10.1.<br />
<br />
I am being asked to use item signals in LN to warn the sales team that items that come in multi-packs can only be order in those multiples (Our current unison system will stop you ordering 5 parts when the order multiple is 20 as defined by the box quantity). LN does not appear to be capable of dealing with this. <br />
<br />
My issue with the item signal is that we will need to have lots of them (50+) to cover all of the multi-pack options that we offer, and these will detract from the intention of item signals as a means to be a warning (part obsolete, item blocked for quality reasons, etc.). This will also conflict if we do need to use an item signal as a warning as only one can be used per item.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest a way of dealing with this issue? your help would be really appreciated.<br />
<br />
With thanks,<br />
