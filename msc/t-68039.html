Is there any table that lets me find a link between production order and sales order?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">12th August 2015, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - if you use pcs projects - tisfc001 will include the project number (tisfc001.cprj).<br />
However, pcs projects have their own quirks and issues.<br />
<br />
You could temporarily have some kind of link in tdinv150 (Planned Inventory Transactions by item as this table shows the sales demand (Material Requirement) and production order planned receipt. But obviously there needn't be a direct link - e.g. a production order is created without any sales demand either manually or through safety stock etc.<br />
The records get deleted from the table when the demand disappears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure about Baan4, but in LN we used Effectivity Unit as a link. But again, a single wrong entry will break the chain. Customization is one better option. You can maintain a customized table and fill the data or may be use an unused field to provide the link. Also, in latest versions of LN, it can be done using &quot;Demand Pegging&quot;<br />
<br />
Check this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=5673) for some ideas.<br />
<br />
I believe the standard doesn't offers a link as one sales order line can have multiple production orders depending on the stock required. So, if you have do do a customization, you need to take care of this scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Igor80801</div><div class="date">12th August 2015, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">EdHubbard, thank you for the proposed approach. I run a query on my system and realized that tdinv150 indicates planned transactions which is not exactly what I need since it is not linked to the MRP data directly. On other hand the act of dealing with the table gave me a clue to check timrp010 table. I found t_koor field there which indicates the origin of MRP record. Value &quot;3&quot; means that the record's origin is Sales Order. Hope this can be useful, itsn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In our case, instead of the Sales Order, it is the Manufacturing Dependent Demand. One MDD record can be considered as one Sales Order Line, and can create, in general, multiple production orders, depending on the order rules.<br />
<br />
We created a customization to link the MDD to the Production Order at the time of Shipping, based on the Distrubution Record of the Production Order and the Distribution Data (Program, Unit Series, Unit Sequence, Build Item, SubItem, etc.) of the MDD, using a sort of FIFO logic on the available inventory.<br />
<br />
Not 100% but statistically good enough for the reporting requirements of the business.<br />
<br />
We also made a provision to manually Maintain this link, if the logic did not establish it in the expected way. The link is stored, by the way, in the custom table that just has the Production Order Number, MDD Number and the MDD Position as the key.</div></div><hr />
