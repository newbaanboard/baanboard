So product A can come in 1000mm length with 100 mm increments. <br />
<br />
We want to reflect the item set up as only product A. On the sales order we put in product A and then specify the length we want to buy say 10x 1300mm lengths and 15x 1500mm lengths. Planning, manufacturing and warehousing would pick up the product as on the sales order.<br />
<br />
If no standard function, has anyone done a customization for this or can refer to the contractor that have done such a customization?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We used configurator, but downside is that a unique item number will still need to be created for the different lengths or colour. So 1000mm piece need to be called Item A and a 1100 mm piece item B, etc. Even though they are the same product A. We have 100 mm increment in these items, so as you can imagine managing the item master will be an enormous task.<br />
<br />
Configurator is great in delaying the creation of these items until needed and speeds up the item creation process. However a unique item per length or colour is still required. <br />
<br />
Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />

Not sure about baan4, but in LN you should be able to do it with the Product Configurator.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
Define Item A as a Generic Item.<br />
Define the following Features for Generic Item A:<br />
    LENGTH - Length of Item<br />
    COLOR - Color of Item<br />
Define the following Options for Feature LENGTH<br />
    All the possible lengths in millimeters <br />
Define the following Options for Feature COLOR<br />
    All the possible colors... Red, Geeen,...<br />
<br />
Then when a Sales Order is written for Generic Item A, the order taker will be prompted to pick the Length and Color of the Item.<br />
