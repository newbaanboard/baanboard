We don't use it for MPS, but we use it for MRP Savings of 3 hours on our normal MRP run.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">17th April 2003, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically when you start a session that has 'number of servers' functionality built in it will register an entry in session tcmcs0197m000 and set the 'number of servers' entry to not valid. You then have 4 choices - either 'manual' or 'not active' or 'job process' or 'manual &amp; job process'. If manual is enabled then whenever you run a mps generation it will start as many more bshells as you've choosen in the parameter. Most OS's allocate time slices of equal portion to all process - by using this functionality you can use more than one time slice for your higher level process. A word of caution: if you set the setting to manual you must either have your bw config file with a saved password set, if not the bw login screens will appear and you'll have a couple of seconds to login to each bshell. Also if you run into  problems where your master session cannot start the servers in manual mode check your 'path' setting on your workstation if it does not include &quot;\baan\bin&quot; somewhere it won't find the bw.exe executable. We played with the setting of 'number of servers' from 1-20 and on our system the best performance was noted at about 4/5. My recomendation is to use this functionality only in 'job' mode once you've identified which setting works best on your system.<br />

<br />
When we implemented the performance boosters for timps3201m000, our run time improved by about 60%.<br />
However, we noticed that some lower level phantom MPS items were showing the exploded demand from the higher levels. The demand is correctly exploded if run in single bshell mode.<br />
<br />
Please help me find a solution for this issue.<br />

Thanks,<br />
