<br />
I use BAAN IV.<br />
<br />
I have a generic BOM whose components are both generic items (with boms and routings in tipcf) and standard items (manufacture items, with their own bom's and routings in tirou and tibom). The main-item of this generic bom is a generic one, of course.<br />
<br />
When I run the session &quot;Generate Product Variant Structure for Budget&quot; (tipcf5270m000) for a variant of this generic item, then an budget is generated. <br />
<br />
In this budget, For each generic item in the &quot;main BOM&quot; (see first paragraph), one calculation part is generated. And for each of them, a routing is generated (tipcs1120m000 &quot;Maintain Operation Sheets&quot;). These routings are generated as a &quot;copy&quot; of the generic routings of the components of the <br />
<br />
My problem/question: Why doesn't BAAN generate also calculation parts for the standard manufacture items in the Generic BOM (see first paragraph)?<br />
<br />
And later, when the budget is copied into a project (pcs), and PRP-orders were generated, why does for these standard manufacture items exist a customized item (as a derivated copy from the standard item), but NO customized routing (as a copy of the standard routing)? <br />
