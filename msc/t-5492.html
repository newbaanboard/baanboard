<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">12th June 2002, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 items I build. There are 5 machines total which make these items. These machines are manned by 2 people. Item A has 3 molds that can run it, and item B has 4 molds that can run it.<br />
<br />
I am trying to figure out how to setup the routing for each item.<br />
<br />
In the Work Center there is hours per week, hours per day and # of resource units<br />
In the Task there is production rate, man occupation and machine occupation<br />
In Resources there is basic capacity hours per day and # of resources <br />
<br />
In Work Centers I assume the man/machine occupation should be machine for A and B. Should the # of resource units be 5 (total machines) for both item A and B, or should it be based on # molds (3 molds for item A and 4 molds for item B)?<br />
<br />
In Tasks, I assume the # of men should be 2. But what about the # of machines? Should this be based on the # of machines (5) or # of molds (3 and 4)?<br />
<br />
What about in Resources. What should the # of Resources be?</div></div><hr />

My suggestion is that You can setup 7 machine for 7 mold. and 5 workcenters for 5 machines. And setup the Man/manchine to 2.5.<br />
Seting up the task accordingly.Hope this can be helped.</div></div><hr />
