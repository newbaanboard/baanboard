<br />
we actually have a problem with rejected components.<br />
<br />
I would like to know how to deal with rejected components.<br />
<br />
Actually when we reject components, we need to reject it to a warehouse special for that.<br />
<br />
But, after the rejection finance has no information that we rejected components.<br />
<br />
So the finance will pay for the those bad components..<br />
<br />
Do you know how to deal with that in ERP LN 6.1.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

If so, why not have them re-entered in the PBOM (of the manufactured item its a part of) with a negative quantity(the quantity rejected) and attached to a specific warehouse created just to store rejected items? Plausible?<br />

<br />
The problem is that finance don't want to store the reject component in finance account.<br />
But they want the system to manage the rejected component.<br />
<br />
So do you know how to avoid that ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">7th December 2007, 12:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats where your integration setup would come into play. Along with the new rejected warehouse, you should also look into creating new rejected item codes that would be created for each item code that gets rejected. That way you can isolate these codes along with their warehouse(if warehouse is part of an integration setup) from generating any integration based transaction...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexlow</div><div class="date">7th December 2007, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">assume maintain receipt already done for the material.<br />
<br />
that case you should create a reject location in your warehouse to keep your rejected qty. do inspection if you need than accept goods.<br />
<br />
create a RETURN PO order, copy from original documents, approve and entry will be reverse back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ameya001</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
I m working on Infor LN version 6.1 with FP2 phase III Localization.<br />
I need to know how the accountability of SFC rejected material (Final item/in process item) is done.<br />
When we reject the material in the session Rerport Operations completed, warehouse order is created but it is in the blocked state.<br />
<br />
Kindly let me  know how to handle this scenario of rejected material ( I may scrap the final item/rework the item, and then post it again).<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Ameya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume you are refering to Purchase order rejection. I think the process that you are following is that you accept the whole PO and then move the rejected pcs to warehouse and may be subsequently send it supplier. When a payment is to be made, I think the process should be to offser the return PO. May be you can add a step &quot;Print Purchase Invoice&quot; and give it finance when a return PO is done. Finance can then create a manual debit note and offset the transaction. But I think the real chaleng would be the invocie from supplier would be for whole quantity and when you match and approve you would do partial. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ameya001</div><div class="date">16th March 2008, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx Arvind<br />
But I m referring to Shop floor rejection and not the PO rejects.<br />
When I reject the parent item on the shop floor,a warehouse receipt order is generated but it is in blocked state.<br />
<br />
Can you just tel me how the block is to be removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The block can not be removed manually. However when you complete the order the block gets removed automatically.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
