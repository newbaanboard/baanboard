                               i am trying to implement workload control in Enterprise Planning &amp; used all the essential step to run the cycle . can anybody tell me how i can see its working in the system. ( where i can see the effect of workload system on a resource when the resource is overloaded ).<br />
<br />
1.  is system shows any message when resources gets overload or there is any session to see the effect ? ( i am transferring the planned orders through workload control &amp; its just transfering the orders to sfc orders when free capacity of resource is nagative )<br />
  <br />
The steps i hav used are <br />
<br />
•	The component is included in the bill of critical materials (BCM) of the end item. <br />
•	The component is defined as a constraint in master planning (see the Constraint check box in the Items - Planning (cprpd1100m 000) session).<br />
•	The resource is included in the bill of critical capacities (BCC) of the item. <br />
•	The resource is defined as a constraint in master planning (see the Constraint check box in the Resource (cprpd2100m000) session).<br />
•	Workload control is implemented in EP parameters.<br />
•	Workload control parameters is maintained as per requirements.  ( forward planning used )</div></div><hr />
