<br />
Thanks for the info . <br />
Currently what we do is maintain UPC codes which are given by a third party as alternative Item codes.<br />
<br />
One additional question- Are these UPC codes converted to barcodes while printing on report? do we require some special device or any shell script or standard baan report can print barcode?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

I believe they are standard barcodes. We don't print directly them from Baan. I used a document management software that prints our all documents, so for e.g. when we print the picking list, we print the barcode on it. In our document management system I have to give option UPC 128. That prints the UPC code and also the actual code below the barcode, which I think is not possible from Baan directly. Otherwise, I think it is like any other barcode. You can always try it.<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
I believe that with some shellscript in the barcode directory in lib  we can print Barcodes on Baan reports. However what i would want to know is  UPC code different from a normal baan field. For example if i have an Item in Item master . Then do i have to maintain/generate a UPC code for it?<br />
Or while printng the barcode the system will take care of it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

In order to utilize UPC, you would have to have a field with the UPC code in the system that you were printing out.  For example, Baan won't take item ABC and print out a UPC code for it unless you have the UPC code for item ABC stored in the system.<br />

<br />
In Baan 5c we can print bar code and data beneath it.<br />
We print Baan shippign labels with UPC barcode, Item bar code and few other fields..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks all for your comments.<br />
<br />
So the process would be i maintain the UPC codes for an item.<br />
And then make change in the reports where i want to have barcodes alongwith the necessary shell script  with the correct escape sequence.<br />
