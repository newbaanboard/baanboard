<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">17th February 2005, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">dear all,<br />
can anybody give a list of reasons why a planned production order can not be generated (via session Simulate Order cprrp1210m000) although there's a demand from a sales order for the particular item ?<br />
Any other reasons beyond &quot;date&quot; problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
best regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">18th February 2005, 06:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Check if you have defined Item Production data and Plan Item Data for that item. Make sure Default Supply Source is Production in Plan Item Data. Make sure your demand from Sales Order falls in the scope of the Scenario maintained for EP to look at the demand.<br />
<br />
This should help. If not, analyse the signals which gets generated when you try. That should give a good idea of what is missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">18th February 2005, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Renegade,<br />
i've done all the checking just as you've suggested. But all seems OK.<br />
<br />
FYI, if i do the simulation from cprrp1210m000 then the message will be &quot;No Data Within Selection&quot;.<br />
If i do it from cprrp1220m000 (which started from cprrp0520m000) then the message will be &quot;Processing was successfull. No report printed&quot;. But ironically, no planned order generated too for that particular item.<br />
<br />
Please help....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">21st February 2005, 05:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, there could be many reasons for this:<br />
* wrong actual scenario date<br />
* wrong MRP horizons in item planning data<br />
* demand can be supplied from current stock<br />
* no routing<br />
* demand is already within time fence<br />
* order at fixed order qty but fixed order qty set to 0<br />
* order at EOQ but EOQ set to 0<br />
* order set to replenish to max inventory but max inventory is 0<br />
* item set to manual planning<br />
* etc<br />
There might be a lot more posibilities than these. What does the Time Phased Planning Overview show on this item? Any MRP signal generated for this item?<br />

<br />
Check the order horizon in 'plan item data'. If it is zero give some value, say 100 days and try to generate the orders. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">2nd March 2005, 06:55</div></div><div class="posttext">hi srikarthy,<br />
unfortunately that's also not the issue.  :( <br />
does anybody have any other explanation?  <br />

<br />
If you ahve checked the horizons and the item plan data, then try checking the item in question through session cprrp0520m000 (Time Phased Planning Overview) and check the supply-demand balance. It should show you some idea why the order did not get generated.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, you should also check the planning method. Make sure that it is Planned, not manual or SIC.<br />
<br />
Also check the Item Plan Data, on Master Plan tab. Make sure that all fields in the &quot;Automatic Update&quot; frame is set to &quot;Always Update&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope this will help.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">2nd March 2005, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Hendra,<br />
i already checked the Time Phased Planning Overview early in this case. It only shows the demand from the sales order. Actually we ran Simulate Order from this session (as i mentioned before in my 2nd post in this thread). <br />
<br />
As for the planning method, it was already set to Planned.<br />
While in the Item Plan Data, Master Plan tab, all the fields in the &quot;Automatic Update&quot; frame are set to &quot;No Update&quot;, just like every other items which never encounters this problem. <br />
<br />
Any other possibilities?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
best regards,<br />
Richard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">2nd March 2005, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the bill of material for the item you are trying to create orders for contain any Phantoms?  Have found that any phantoms need to be set as a plan item (cprpd1500m000) or the assembly they go into either won't get planned or won't get planned correctly.  when we started up we did not create all the sub-entities for phantoms - assuming that since we we not going to be actually making them we did not need these (like the ordering and planning data.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">3rd March 2005, 05:03</div></div><div class="posttext">jcorwine,<br />
yes it contains a Phantom item. But the phantom is already set in the Ordering Data and Planning Data. The ordering system for the phantom is also already set to Planned.<br />
<br />
Any other opinion?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">3rd March 2005, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry it wasn't as simple as the plan item sub-entity needing to be set up for the phantom.  you say you don't get any planned order at all?  not that you get an order and it was not correctly planned.<br />
     we just went through an instance where the planned production order was created, but could not be transferred.  got signals about resources not being all planned.  checked all the things suggested to you in this thread and all seemed correct.<br />
     in this case the part had two phantoms.  finally checked and found one of the phantoms had a router (used to make it and put into stock - later changed to phantom).  deleted the router for the phantom and orders immediately planned correctly.<br />
     might check and try this - hope it works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">4th March 2005, 04:03</div></div><div class="posttext">hi jcorwine,<br />
my case is the Simulate Order session don't generate any Planned Production Order for that particular item although there's been a Sales Order as the demand.<br />
Neither any inventory or any production order existed during that simulation. TheTime Phased Planning-Overview session only shows the demand (sales order) for that item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">4th March 2005, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Can think of only one other thing.<br />
Seems you have checked everything about the item itself and all appears OK.<br />
<br />
What about the Work Centers in the router for the item...are all of them set up with a corresponding Resource in cprpd200 [cprpd2500m000]?  Usually when a new work center is created the resource gets set up.  But, if something has happened with the cprpd200 table or a resource has been deleted planning may not happen.</div></div><hr />
