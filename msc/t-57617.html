<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisa_B</div><div class="date">14th January 2010, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using ERP LN 6.1 SP5.<br />
<br />
We have realised PCS financials is different in LN compared to Baan IV, especially the consequences of running Calculate Cost Price by Project with performing actual costs ticked.  This then calculates the surcharges for the project and also updates the actuals for report Cost Price by Project.  Unfortunately this session, in LN, also generates PCS+Cost of Goods Sold and reduces the Project WIP balance.<br />
<br />
Are you experiencing this issue?  Have you resolved it by either reviewing how PCS is configured or other means?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We implemented &quot;vanilla&quot; version of both Baan IV and ERP LN ie no customisations.  Could I stress the point please, it is to do with the CoGS transactions - we did not get these transactions when we ran Calculate Cost Price by Project to update the actuals, unless the project had delivered a standard item against a sales order.  In LN, as soon as the project has made its first delivery, it would appear any subsequent General Hours or General Costs are taken to cost of sale when Calculate Cost Price by Project is run.  We did not get that in Baan IV, it created that transaction when the project was closed.<br />
<br />
Maybe other businesses who are using PCS do not find all these CoGS transactions a problem, but I'm wondering if any other business does?</div></div><hr />
