    What would be the most viable way to hide BOM from production operators? It is OK for the warehousing personnel to know, but not production operators. The production operators should be initiating material issue for &quot;mixture of materials&quot; rather than the materials themselves. Thanks<br />

What are the roles of the production operator and the warehouse personnel? What problem are you trying to solve by this solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">25th July 2002, 04:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it may sound like funny request for developed countries where intellectual property laws are strictly enforced. Over there, operators may know formula of a product but are bound by law never to disclose it outside. But here where such law is practically absent, companies need to protect their intellectual property in unique way. One of the way is to obstruct information regarding product specification as much as possible. This is what we are trying to achieve.<br />
<br />
   I imagine that few of you have ever faced such situation, but I'd appreciate any input. We looked into many possibilities including list item-assembly order combo, adding another level in BOM, but none seems to provide the simplicity we want out of this. Thank you<br />
