Thanx in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Demand Forecasting in EP will look into the sales data that is available in the sales order and sales order line history (tables tdsls450 and tdsls451).<br />
Data is populated in these tables after running session tdsls4223m000 (Process Delivered Sales Orders).<br />
<br />
Hopefully this helps. If you have any questions/issues please let me know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishy65</div><div class="date">13th December 2001, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">You can look at possibility of using table whinr120 ,which keeps history of actual delivery as well as the demand by period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaukhan</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx everybody. I reached whinr120 table during the course of my invenstigation but realised a few other problems and am working on it. If I arrive at a concrete solution I will share it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">As an alternative  you can bring it in using EDI functionality.  That way Baan could handle it through regular functions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishy65</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Stephen,<br />
<br />
Which EDI functionality are you referring to ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 20:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking about EDI transactions 830, which Baan supports in Supply chain.  However this might be something of a stretch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishy65</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, 830 is used more for pulling out forecast from Sales Schedule ( planning releases) , I am not sure if it pulls any data from the history of sales. Do you have any different ideas on this .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize for my lack of understanding in EP but wonder how does this work for getting sales history in to get good working Demand Forecasts in EP?<br />
<br />
Please explain.<br />

<br />
What you would do is basically make the history into a straight line forecast by advancing the year field and putting it into 830 EDI format.  That would make last year's numbers look like next year's forecast.<br />
<br />
It is not scientific in terms of smoothing and projections (unless you use some of those techniques to adjust the numbers before the go in).<br />
<br />
However it would at least get the numbers into the system as a starting point.</div></div><hr />
