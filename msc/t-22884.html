<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marine</div><div class="date">18th January 2005, 01:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for anyone who has interfaced Baan (TI package) with Primavera's 'P3' product (or any of it's variations).  The 3rd party group we are looking at for assistance, says that they have never done it before.  I find that very hard to believe!<br />
<br />
Overall, how long did it take to go from &quot;Kicking-off the project&quot; thru &quot;Training the end users&quot;?<br />
How long did it take to configure P3?<br />
How long did it take to build and test the interfaces?<br />
What was the time commitment of your employees to the project?<br />
<br />
ANY insight you can give me would be GREATLY appreciated!!!<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />
