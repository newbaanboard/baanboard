<br />
As part of this process the manufacturing activities of the existing BaaN company needs to be shifted to a new company. The problem is that we cannot close all the issued production orders in the old company as these order are live and have a long production cycles. At the same time we cannot transfer the inventories to the new company without closing these production orders.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to treat these production orders as part closed and open new production orders in the enw company from the stage as per the old company.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

See what the value is of the order. Create the order in the new company. Create an item called WIP and issue the item to the order according to the value and include the outstanding tasks and unissued items in the open order in the new company.<br />
WIP stock value at the end of the day should be 0 and should be the value of the total WIP to be moved at the starty of the day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it is only one, then the cost issue is kind of moote.<br />
1- Delete estimated material not yet issued, and un-issue material already issued but not consummed.<br />
2- Complete the production orders with a quantity of zero and close it. This will create a temporary production result that will later be offset.<br />
3- Transfer the inventories<br />
4- Create production order in other company<br />
5- Delete operations already completed<br />
6- Delete material already issued and consummed<br />
7- Release production order<br />
8- Issue material, etc.<br />
<br />
You might have to prepare you costing people to the production results this will initially create.<br />
<br />
Hope this helped.</div></div><hr />
