<br />
Have a nice day<br />
For any manufactured item. I included the operation against each BOM position . Maybe the operation is a machine or a manual oper.<br />
When I create a production order , I put the actual material qty. against each estimated qty. ( for normal &amp; Bi product item ).<br />
Now I need 3 reports from system for that prod. order showing all material issued ( qty. &amp; cost ) :<br />
                      - during each operation. <br />
                      - during each work center<br />
                      - to each machine.    for machine oper. only<br />
Best Regards<br />
Adel</div></div><hr />
