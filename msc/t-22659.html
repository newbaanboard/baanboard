<br />
Suppose I have item A, with routings 0,1,2,3. Those routings defining defferent production lines, with different machines and different production time.<br />
<br />
How can I deal with MRP item planning, except manually. I know that Baan Scheduler deals with simular request, but I am interested in standard Baan procedure.</div></div><hr />

Only know about scheduler solution for this issue. Planner can also handle this but looks at meduim to long term planning and is an add on like scheduler.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use Quantity Dependant Routings and multiple routing codes per item. For each item we set up the routing, then we just copy the exiting routing to as many new routing codes as needed. Rather then change the run times we just use different Routing units for each routing code in tirou1102m000:Maintain Routings Codes by Item.<br />
<br />
The result is that MRP will automaticly pick the correct routing code based on the 'Up to Order Qty' in tirou1102m000. It's work on the front end, but our routings don't change much so maintenance is low, otherwise it would be a lot of work.</div></div><hr />
