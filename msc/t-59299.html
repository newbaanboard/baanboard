<br />
Simple Example:  ignoring lead time for the moment Safety stock is 10 and the re-order point is 10. - I'm assuming that the re-order trigger is when stock hits 9<br />
<br />
So does MRP suggest you should order the safety stock (ie 10) or just the shortfall (ie 1) or both (ie 11) <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, P</div></div><hr />

Hi Penfold,<br />
<br />
System will check the order method, if <br />
1. ur order method is Lot for Lot than system will create the order of allocated qty.<br />
2. Fixed order qty ,than system will create the order of fix qty (Or ur fixed order qty, which u mention in odering data) <br />
3. Replinish to max qty, than system will create order of the order of an qty to replinish the max qty. or to achieve the max qty.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help u !!!:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use Order Method = Replenish to Max Inventory to use this Reorder Point.<br />
You set Max inventory = 100 , and Reorder Point 10.<br />
When the stock fall below 10, it will generate production /purchase advice to fulfill the max inventory.</div></div><hr />
