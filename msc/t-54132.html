<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">28th October 2008, 12:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to understand the usage of 'Queue Time' in Production Planning; As per Field help, it is the time taken before an Operation can commence; <br />
<br />
Would like to know if Production Planning on an Operation Incudes Queue Time? I have seen that Transfer Time is included in Operation as can eb seen in Production Planning;<br />
<br />
Even if I see Utilisation of Work Centre by Day, I fail to see Queue time as part of Preceding operation of the Work Centre; <br />
<br />
We also use Inbound and Outbound lead times; Can someone pls give me a little more details on this particular field. Thanks</div></div><hr />
