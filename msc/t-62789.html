<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmurphy2650</div><div class="date">3rd September 2012, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">This used to happen to us every few months in FP3. It seems to have gone away since we upgraded to FP6. I always fixed the issue by using GTM to change the qty to be back flushed to zero in the Production Order Operations table - tisfc010 (step 4 below). Try the first three options before you attempt GTM.<br />
<br />
Take a look at KB Article 1043271 ...<br />
<br />
When closing the Production order , system is giving error ‘ There is still some quantity to back flush for a production order’, following could be the possible reasons, sometimes it could be due to data corruption.<br />
<br />
1. In session ticst0101m100 (Material to Issue for Production order), check for quantity in Subsequent Delivery or To Issue. Solution: Make it zero or issue it.<br />
<br />
2. In session ‘Report Order Completed’, check for ‘to back flush’. Solution: Run session back flush Materials and Hours or make it zero (All related material will be back flushed).<br />
<br />
3. In session ‘Report Operation Completed’, check for ‘To Do Back flushing’ (If order status is not completed).Solution: Make it zero or Back flush it.<br />
<br />
4. In table tisfc010, check for quantity in field tisfc010.qtbf ( When order status is completed).Solution : Back flush it or by back-end make the quantity zero.</div></div><hr />

Since the order status is completed, step three did not take me. I was afraid to step four, so as long as I have little experience :-[</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">15th September 2012, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
You can reset the production order status from Complete to Active.<br />
Then check in the session Report Operation Completed ,check the field Qty to do backflush,it shoud be zero (refer to step 3 suggested by mmurphy).<br />
If still didnt work, you can try to run step 4 from GTM, but it would be better to post the incident to the infor extreme support website, let them help you to solve it.</div></div><hr />
