Anyone using QMS in the Routing?<br />
eg Operation 10 has not been finished the QMS process, can it also block  material issue for operation 20 ?<br />
so warehouse can not supply the material before operation 10 is finish the QMS process.</div></div><hr />

it can be done by normal process. You have to define that perticual material to be issued in operation no. 20 in Bom of the final item. Now to use qms in operation no. 10 you have to put count point in it. So only after completing of qm process of operation no 10 you will able to process operation no 20 and only after completing operation no. 10 material can be issued for operation no. 20<br />
