You may have planned inventory transactions for materials that will never happen. You won't be able to archive Production Orders. Etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">25th May 2009, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say I can't really understand what you are trying to do here - what is the problem with Closing the orders?  But as you say, if the order is manual, and there are no materials, no projects, then not closing them is unlikely to matter much (until you want to archive them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klnm_Sn</div><div class="date">26th May 2009, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Production Order Completed : You have completed all the logistical activities to produce the item and put the end item in the FG warehouse. You may still have materials/hours left to be booked.<br />
<br />
Production Order Closed: You are Financially closing the order with Variance being calculated based on estimated and actual costs. <br />
<br />
What will happen if you dont close the production orders in time.<br />
   1. Financial closure will not be accurate<br />
   2. WIP calculation will be wrong if you leave some material to be issued with order completed whereas it is actually done.<br />
   the above are few but many issues can crop up<br />

The answer from Lakshmi is correct. I completely agree with. <br />
That is the actual difference between closing and completing.<br />
