<br />
We are currently in the middle of a Logistics improvement project and one question that has risen it's head is trying to improve our current methods of counting production. We currently do it at group level on the hour via scanning. However we now have a need to book the individual finished parts at the time of manufacture so we can maintain an accurate finished parts stock.<br />
<br />
Scanning isn't really an option on welding bays and one idea is that the operator presses a button when he's completed a part. <br />
<br />
What do people use to count production and is there anyone who uses a simple button mechanism to count ?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

It's clear that you want to increase the completed QTY by 1 each time, but which transaction(s) do you want 'pushing the button' to launch in your IVc4? Report operations completed? Report production orders completed?<br />
<br />
We've made various versions of this 'button', by scanning bar codes, pushing/clicking buttons or even CNC machinery automatically updating completed quantities or other desired transactions...feel free to contact us if any of this interests you.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
