<br />
I have a question about planned production order. When I create a new production order in Baan IV sometimes it automatically updates when I change the bom of the article of the production order.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know some details about this operation, like:<br />
<br />
- how often this update happen?<br />
- There is a particular job that make this?<br />
- there is a way to force this update?<br />
- there is a way to disable this update (besides confirm the production order)?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Hi Mark!<br />
First of all thanks for your reply. <br />
Yes if the order is released it can't be updated if I change the BOM, but I wrote about production order in planned status, in this case the order change when I change the BOM. <br />
So I had the questions that I wrote in the previous post.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

On our 4c4 system as long as it stayed a planned GRP order then bom changes would be reflected once the planned order was released to the shop floor as a production order.  From then on I think if you made a bom change and wanted it reflected on the production order - you then had to go update the production order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only talk about planned orders, I can suppose that MRP or PRP job update the BOM of planned orders, but I'm not sure about this.  Furthermore I can suppose that the date tisfc001.prdt has a rilevant role in this, like if the date is in the past the job doesn't update the order. Or something like this... <br />
But I'd like to have more certainty about this.<br />

Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmueskle</div><div class="date">10th October 2019, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I know two ways to update the estimated material of a planned production order in BaanIV. First if you change a field like ordered quantity, version, ... the system deletes estimated material and production plan and rebuilds is.<br />
Second is a session, it might be running in job mode. I do not longer have access to a BaanIV menu, so I don't know the exact name in your system. In InforLN it called Reprocess Production Orders tisfc1203m000. It does the same: delete current estimated material and production plan and rebuild it from BOM and routing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">19th November 2019, 20:16</div></div><div class="posttext">This must be a customization. Update of BOM doesn't change any order whether it be MRP or real production order . That is why we have net change MRP functionality to address such changes. Assuming you are changing a component in BOM, so in your cards it is going to change the production requirement for all the production order that system has?</div></div><hr />
