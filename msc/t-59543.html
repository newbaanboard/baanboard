<br />
As we all Know that unit cost of any manufactured item in Baan comprises following -<br />
Material Cost<br />
Operation Cost <br />
Overheads<br />
So sum of all above components gives us  cost of manufacturing for one item.i.e standard cost<br />
<br />
Now what I want that If I generate a Production Order for 500 pcs than there will be some cost for that 500pcs.<br />
Similarly if Ordered Qty changed to 250pcs than there will be another cost.<br />
So in this way in a year if i Manufactured that item with different QTY than every Production order will have different cost of Manufacturing.<br />
<br />
So my requirement is that  Is there any Standard Session Available in the Baan which gives Average cost details  of all these Production order generated in a Year for that particular item.<br />
<br />
If not than please suggest any way to calculate this.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Raman</div></div><hr />

2) If you are following standard cost, probably what you would need is to add up all the variances for the year and divided by total qty produced, to get the average variance, which if you add to the standard cost will give you what you are looking for (if i understand your requirements correctly)</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you use LN?<br />
this add on cost , is this operation cost?<br />
if yes,i think you can try to use tirou1101m000<br />
in this session, theres field &quot;up to order qty&quot;. you can define 250 and 500 in here.<br />
for 250 and 500, you create different task code, each task has different operation rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are talking about standard cost, then the standard cost not going to change as per the production Order.<br />
If you are talking about actual cost then you can get the data from ticst010 table, sort by Item based cost and select based on main item, then aggregate data of ticst010.aamt this will give you the end unit Actual cost of Production Order, you can aggregate for all orders and divide by number of orders will give you the actual average cost of a main item.<br />
The standard report gives you with respect to Production order. You can take it to Excel and further process or have customized query.</div></div><hr />
