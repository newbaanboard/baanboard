<br />
Can anyone explain where the Cumulative ATP figures come from in the time phased planning overview cprrp0520m000 in Baan VC, also what the functionality of cumulative ATP is?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The cumulative ATP figure is the item's quantity that you will have after finishing all demand and supply (confirmed demand and supply-planned orders don't count).<br />
<br />
It comes after simulating master plan/order. The figure appears not only in the time phased planning overview session but also in the item master plan session (cprmp2101m000) - Cumulative ATP tab.<br />
<br />
ATP-Available To Promise, as its name suggests, is showing the quantity that will be available after completing all demand and supply. By looking at this figure, you can tell immediately quantities that you will have that you can promise to a customer, if there should be a sudden demand. In other words, ATP is the projected inventory on hand.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps. If you have more questions, do ask. I'm still learning too here.<br />

Am looking at the ATP proposed schedule after inserting a new order from our customers. However the schedule suggests a date that is *before* the arrival of items from our supplier -this means that is suggesting me to commit a date to my customer in a moment when there is still no stock (in fact projected stock is negative!).<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
Many thanks!<br />
<br />
ps: am using Baan V.</div></div><hr />

There it  cumulates the quantities in the bucket and returns that at the end of the bucket. <br />
<br />
When the item is not master planned, ATP is determined in the Time Phased Planning Overview. But still it is check on Bucket dates.<br />
<br />
Next to that there is a field in Plan Item Data, CTP Time Fence. Outside this time fence the ATP is enough.<br />
