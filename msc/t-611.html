<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kethal</div><div class="date">11th December 2001, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to issue more parts to a production order (i.e., Kit) than the production order requires without generating a new demand to purchasing? For example, a production order calls for 50 parts that reside on a reel but the reel has 500 parts. I need to allocate the other 450 part to the production order without Baan issueing a demand. We are currenty only issueing 50 parts through Baan and tracking the other 450 manually to avoid additional demands. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishy65</div><div class="date">13th December 2001, 22:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't issue /allocate to a production order without generating demand. The only work around can be to transfer the material to a WIP warehouse attached to the work center and do a return transfer once production order is completed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">How consistent is this requirement?<br />
<br />
You can also play with the units of measure and only deal with &quot;reels&quot; in issuing to production and forced Baan to round up to one reel.<br />
<br />
What do you do with the excess?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kethal</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">The same 'reel' is used by multiple production orders and not always inexpensive parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">If the work centers are close together, then you might try sending the reel to a &quot;storeroom&quot; on the shop floor and issuing as required by the work centers.  That might be how it is used on the shop floor anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">8th January 2002, 11:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Please confirm if the following is true;<br />
<br />
The case stems from the issuance of materials in bulk.  In this particular case, it is a reel of material. Could be anything from a reel of wire, electronic component reel, thread maybe, etc..<br />
<br />
You wouldn't want the warehouse to issue the partial reel because he has to issue the whole reel to production.  Only thing is the reel is used in several production orders.<br />
<br />
Try using a WIP warehouse.  Link the items in the BOM to this warehouse so that you won't have problem recording the actual usage later in the production process.  This could be a physical or logical warehouse but the important thing is it will help you track the reel inventory in production and issue it to the specific orders.<br />
<br />
Disadvantage:  <br />
You have additional procedure to handle inventory<br />
<br />
Advantage: (assuming recording is religious)<br />
Inventory is always visible<br />
Inventory value will be more accurate<br />
Cost of your order is correct since you only issue what was used for each order, no need to reallocate order costs in finance<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
