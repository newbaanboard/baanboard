<br />
I am trying to use a generic item in my sales order. But when trying to configure the item, I got a message saying &quot;Generic Item-Configuration Class Relationship not present for the Generic Item&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyone know what this warning is about and how to fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">8th March 2005, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hendra,<br />
you have to maintain 'Generic Item-Configuration Class Relationship' in cftpl2100m000. Just insert your generic item with template 'product configurator'.<br />
That should work.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
Thanks. It worked.<br />
<br />
Just one question though.<br />
The session is not listed in the tree menu. Is it part of the service packs solution or what? and do I have to fill out that session everytime I make a new generic item?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">15th March 2005, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hendra,<br />
which version are you on?<br />
In my 5.0c Version the Session is in the Menu under package cf ('big' configurator).<br />
I know that in ERP Ln cf package is not supported anymore.<br />
Maybe the session exists in background so far.<br />
<br />
Normaly in 5.0c the record is populated by default if you insert a new generic item.<br />
The problem only occurs when an existing generic item is copied. In that case we have to maintain cftpl2100m000 manually.<br />

<br />
As far as I know the Configurator package is not used in Baan 5.0c, only the module tipcf, so 'class relationships' don't have to be defined. So I guess you have marked the Configurator package as 'implemented' and that causes the system to check for the class relationship. So, unmark the check box 'Configurator implemented' in the company data (tccom0500m000) and you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
I am on 5.0c and I can't find that session under the cf menu.<br />
My steps were:<br />
1. create the generic item and bom<br />
2. create sales and then configure the item. This is the step where the error occured.<br />
<br />
no copying were involved here.<br />
<br />
Frank, I did put the Configurator package as implemented. I thought it was a necessary thing to do since I want to use the PCF. Apparently it was not needed.<br />
<br />
One more thing, Any of you has a study material on CF package? I tried to look for it at the support website. Couldn't find any though :(<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for sharing,<br />

<br />
I guess that there's no documentation about CF because, again, as far as I know CF is not used in Baan 5.0c although it is present. Focus on getting it to work in tipcf, you don't need CF-sessions.<br />
