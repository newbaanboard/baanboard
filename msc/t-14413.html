<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mitchell</div><div class="date">6th February 2004, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We have had a few problems over the past few months in regards to the automatic backflushing of components on a production order.<br />
<br />
We have a production order with with approximately 35 components.  34 out of the 35 are set to backflush.  1 component is set to issue (it is a lot controlled item).<br />
<br />
The process that takes place within our &quot;Stores&quot; is as follows:<br />
<br />
Maintain Outbound Data - for the item which needs to be manually issued (it is a lot controlled item)<br />
Release Outbound Data<br />
Report Operations Complete - we have our parameters to automatically backflush goods.<br />
Report Production Orders Complete<br />
Generate Inbound<br />
Release Inbound<br />
Close Production Order<br />
<br />
What actually happens is that the only component to get issued to this production order is the one that was manually issued.  Nothing gets backflushed.<br />
<br />
If I look at ticst001 Actual Qty, Issue and Subsequent Delivery fields are all set to zero.<br />
<br />
This tells me that the stores personnel are actually &quot;zeroing out&quot; the quantities to be issues within the session Enter material Issue for production orders.  They say that this is not the case.  I have set-up a test company and I can't re-create the issue.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone every had a problem like this?  How can I show that these fields are actually being manually zeroed out?<br />
<br />
Any ideas would help.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have backflushing working correctly on other items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkotnani</div><div class="date">7th February 2004, 00:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Better log a case with Baan and see if there is a solution for this problem. I did not experiece this particular problem ever, but in general if there is something going really crazy, it may have come through some bad fix for another problem, which messes up the standard behavior.<br />

I have logged a case with Baan support ... hopefully they will be able to help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 07:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I also faced a problem which is slightly different from this. <br />
<br />
In my case subsequent delivery qty doesn't get transferred to the filed 'to issue' for the quantity completed in operations.<br />
<br />
In overcome this problem by making count point YES for the first operation in the routing used.<br />
<br />
This is working fine, for precautions I have generated a report session, which tells me what is the difference between qty completed &amp; qty backflushed.<br />
<br />
U can try by making count point YES for the first operaiton it may help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mitchell</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I will try that.</div></div><hr />
