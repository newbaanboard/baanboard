<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AntonMPS</div><div class="date">29th March 2022, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Forum,<br />
<br />
We use MRP (INFOR LN 10.5) to convert demand into Purchase Requisitions. Due to the current worldwide stress in the supply chain we can no longer fully rely on the leadtimes that are agreed with our suppliers. Entering new (longer) leadtimes in de master data is not desirable so we have resorted to converting Purchase Requisitions to Purchase orders as soon as possible (so not waiting until the date the Purchase Req. should be converted). <br />
We notice the following effect:<br />
1. Item A has a leadtime of 10 days.<br />
2. Demand A1 is in 30 days.<br />
3. MRP generates a PR for Demand A1 - 10 days. So 20 days from now.<br />
4. PR is converted to a PO today, so we give supplier 30 days leadtime (20 days extra).<br />
5. Due to stock correction there is suddenly a shortage for Item A (Demand A2).<br />
6. MRP generates a PR for Demand A2 but places the requirement date AFTER Demand A1 (not before even though the leadtime of 10 days could still mean the new order can be fulfilled prior to the order connected to Demand A1).<br />
<br />
I am told that this is normal MRP behavior due to the fact/rule that MRP will not schedule orders before existing purchase orders. In order to overcome this I am now more or less told that I have to implement a full S&amp;OP process which I am not ready for. Besides, I don't understand this MRP behavior. It goes against my logic. <br />
<br />
My reasoning: if I want to give suppliers maximum transparency I can have a situation where I give a firm purchase order for far in the future. Supplier happy (he has an order in the future he can rely on), me happy (I can trust there is enough time to fulfill the demand on the planned time), customer happy (he gets what he orders in the time it was promised).<br />
If another more urgent demand comes up (still within the standard leadtime of the item) I should be able to place an order earlier in the queue. I should not have to expedite the first order and replace the expedited one with a new order. <br />
<br />
Is my reasoning wrong? Can anyone help me to understand the MRP behavior better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th March 2022, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Heck this is a case of where I would need to see the planning data to make it is correct.  So can't really answer the MRP question.  When we used baan we could walk thru the data with the customer to explain what the system was doing - see what transfers were meeting what demands, which borrow paybacks were talking place, etc.  I never recall an issue like you describe.<br />
<br />
I do know our purchasing department used to have 2 types of agreements - if I recall correctly.  One was with customers - we would receive funds to go buy long lead items before we received the customer demand.  Then the other was the purchasing department would work with vendors and say we promise to buy this many parts over this time frame to get a price break.  I am not really sure how that all worked.  In some cases I think vendors would also just ship us so much over a given time frame using company money because they would be consumed by customer orders quickly.  But that is the nature of our business - not sure how something like that would apply to the private sector.  Now that I have done all this posting you probably need to wait for real expert to answer you because I am not sure I did.</div></div><hr />

What you describe sounds like the S&amp;OP model that I mentioned with forecast to suppliers and use the purchase requisitions to trigger a call-off of forecast materials when actual demand materialises. <br />
<br />
But it doesn't offer any feedback on whether my reasoning around MRP behavior is correct. Appreciate the effort to post a reply, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, in the Exception Messages there are signals given to pull in the existing PO.<br />
<br />
But it only adds work to have to pull in a PO that is further out for demand that exists further out rather than to insert a new order before the firm PO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">30th March 2022, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you play around with rescheduling tolerances so it does not generate the reschedule advice? may not help but all i have :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AntonMPS</div><div class="date">11th April 2022, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">The rescheduling is a result of the way the original scheduling is done. So I should not need to touch the rescheduling advice settings if the original scheduling was done in a more logical way. <br />
<br />
So far I do understand the rescheduling logic.</div></div><hr />
