<br />
Need your help on this.<br />
If i have create generic item :<br />
<br />
FG01= main wire<br />
consist of another generic item : WP01=subwire<br />
<br />
WP01 consist of:<br />
<br />
1. Main wire which can use length 1 mtr or 2 mtr ==&gt; mfg item<br />
2. Coloured wire: red and blue , and may have other colour.==&gt; pur item<br />
<br />
I plan to use multilevel PCF:<br />
<br />
Option of wire length : 1 mtr and 2 mtr.<br />
Option of colour : red and blue<br />
<br />
I have problem in defining constraint, because i dont want to create another generic item for SUBWIRE 1 MTR and SUBWIRE 2 MTR.<br />
<br />
If they select option :<br />
<br />
Condition 1:<br />
wire length 1 mtr <br />
colour red<br />
then  the coloured red wire must take 1,5  mtr<br />
<br />
Condition 2:<br />
wire length 2 mtr<br />
colour red<br />
then the coloured red wire must take 2,25 mtr.<br />
<br />
Any idea for this type of PCF constraint?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
why do you want to make the subwire a generic item? As an alternative you could define two generic BOM lines one for blue and one for red subwire as standard purchase items and define constraints for validation of the BOM-line based on &quot;color&quot; feature of main wire and the parameter substitution for BOM-quantity as function of &quot;length&quot; feature of main wire.</div></div><hr />

I have apply that, and it works.<br />
But theres another issue.<br />
I ll update later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The wires has more then 1 colour, if not all wires has same colour, then we call the main wire as &quot;MIXED WIRE&quot; in item code. but is it has the same colout, then we call the main wire with the same colour , eg &quot;BLUE WIRE&quot;<br />
We put the colour in each sub wire as an product feature and option.<br />
it may have 5 colours ,what kind of constraint required to do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must first say that I am not actually a PCF expert. I have learned enough to be able to do PCF-programming if needed. Anyhow:  My solution would be to define different features for the main wire for the number of each coloured wire. say:<br />
<br />
Feature		Configured Value (for example)<br />
<br />
GRN_WIRES		0<br />
RED_WIRES		2<br />
BLU_WIRES		3<br />
YEL_WIRES		0<br />
BRN_WIRES		0<br />
<br />
Then use the configured values of these features to validate and set the quantity of the relevant generic BOM lines as discussed in my last post.</div></div><hr />

Im sorry since im a new bie in LN, i dont understand about your last update.<br />
<br />
I have design it this way.<br />
<br />
Generic Item= MWIRE00<br />
<br />
WIRE00 has component subwire CWIRE01 , CWIRE02, CWIRE03,CWIRE04, CWIRE05.<br />
For Main Wire i create product Feature eg:<br />
MWR00C==&gt; colour for MWIRE00 which has option: GRN, BLU, YLW,RED,BRN, MIX.<br />
<br />
For Each sub wire, i create Product Feature eg: <br />
CWR01C==&gt; colour for CWIRE01 which has option: GRN, BLU, YLW,RED,BRN<br />
<br />
The requirement is: they select for all the product feature for sub wire with same colour such as GRN, then MWRC00 will automatic select GRN, if not all the same, then MWRC00 will automatic select MIX.<br />
<br />
Other issue which is frustated me : CWIRE05 is optional<br />
MWIRE00 has option whether they willl use CWIRE05 or not, if they select not, then the product feature for colour CWR05C will be filled with N (NOT USED)<br />
<br />
If CWR05C is N, then it means the MWR00C will always be MIX, even if the 4 sub wire has the same colour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I prefer that you set the sub-wire as a Generic Item also, and generate the standard/customized item for the sub-wire by the session 'Generic Item - Setting for Data Generation' (tipcf3101m000).<br />
