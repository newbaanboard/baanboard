Latest Purchase price field of one of our item has not been updated with the price appearing in PO.<br />
We have already received the material against this PO. Invoice also has been matched and approved in finance. PO lines status is appearing as &quot;Deleting line.....&quot;<br />
Still the latest purchase price field in the Item Master is not updated with this PO price.<br />
<br />
Any advise...what could be the reason for this ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Have you run the update cost price session for the same item? And also you need to check the priority of the purchase price at price calculation code session, if you want the Latest purchase price need to reflect at item costing data then you need to put the latest purchase price priority in the first position.<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

My understanding is that Update cost price session would update the standard cost of the item based on the priority defined in the price calculation code session.<br />
This has nothing to do with my problem related to update in the Latest Purchase Price field in the item master table. Even after match and approval, the item's master field for the Latest Purchase price is not getting updated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Understand your issue, this should not be happened, after match and approval at finance the latest price should automatically populated in the respective field at item master. Kindly let me know whether you are facing the same issue with a specific item or for a range of items? i tried to reproduce the same scenario in my environment, but that situation never showed up, so i am also willing to find out the root cause for it, If you already got it then kindly share it. Will dig a bit and let you know if something come across.<br />

Thanks for your reply, I am facing this issue for only one item. I can see that there were few POs in January and Feb. having different purchase prices and they were matched and approved in Finance, but still the latest Purchase price field in Item master contains the price belonging to a PO raised in Dec 2011.<br />
It's very surprising for me either, I even couldn't reproduce the same scenario in my test server. <br />

     Can you raise a ticket with Infor to check the same issue, not sure what blocking to update it's latest purchase price. If the Infor folks could able to find it out.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanravi</div><div class="date">4th June 2012, 10:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Few options to check:<br />
1. Try updating the Cost Price in Item Master. Does it ask to update Latest Purchase Price &amp; Average Purchase Price.<br />
2. When you are saying that the Latest Purchase Price is not getting updated after Match &amp; Approval...is it also not updating the Average Purchase Price?<br />
3. After Invoice Match &amp; Approval...is the batch being finalized or not?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ERPBAAN</div><div class="date">11th June 2012, 10:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi ,<br />
Thanks everyone for your contribution.<br />
@baanravi - <br />
As avpatil said latest purchase price gets updated at the time of approval of invoice. Finalization of a batch has no role in it.<br />
<br />
@roys11_in -<br />
I think I should better raise a ticket with infor to get an explaination on this issue.<br />
<br />
