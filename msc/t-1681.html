There is no qty in either &quot;Print Pending Pur orders&quot; or &quot;back Order by Supplier&quot;<br />
In &quot;Display inventory movement by item&quot; there i s(+)planned Purchase Orders and their No also<br />
when i look  for receipts against these PO's i find that receipt are already entered against all postions of these Po's and delivered qty= challan qty=approved qty and also that PDPO have been done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">savitr</div><div class="date">29th April 2002, 11:57</div></div><div class="posttext">where to check this yield(Session?)<br />
It seems from our data that database has not been updated properly<br />
we received some items in the year 2000 all except Purchase invoices were completed in the same year but the Purchase invoices were printed in the year 2002 for these receipts<br />
is this has some relation with BaaN printing less pendency but mrp considering the pendency.<br />
when i check in form 2 of maintain item data the &quot;onorder qty is more than the actual pendency being printed by using session &quot;Print Purchase pendency&quot;<br />
