In sub contracting, every time company sends all tools outside the premises also it adds tooling cost of subcontracting. When material like Jigs, fixtures etc to be sent out how to be mapped this in the system? <br />
   Shall i add new operation of for sending and raise subcontracting item for that and collect material against the same or is there any different method? <br />

<br />
u mean u send tools along with items or only tools...?<br />
<br />
service subcontracting can be another option as u cannot generate production order for item type spec - TOOL<br />

In this company it is not fixed when to subcontract operation. Hence tools are not always with the sub contractor. When it comes to know that there is short fall of man power then sub contracting isdone. In that case tools and other equipments like jigs, fixtures aresent outside. As you know there is no procedure to send out such material within the same production order. But still I want to capture the cost incurred during this should be accounted on the  same product.<br />
So if you get solution please elaborate with example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe a manual Production Order could be created and order/operation subcontracted as required and issue the produced tools into the production order that you want to consume; But this will create a considerable variance as such tool could be expensive; Alternatively, it could be estimated in Production order so it is costed and no huge variance;<br />
<br />
I am not too sure about LN but this could be an option;</div></div><hr />
