What I need is to enter some subcontracting tasks during holidays.<br />
<br />
Our company calendar is only for work center 'ZZZ' and I should not change that. Any ideas?<br />

Is it possibly to setup a specific work center for say just one day? What are the cave-ats?<br />

<br />
Anyway, it's not a big issue to switch between both settings. Make sure to have a proper calendar for work center 'ZZZ' available. 'ZZZ' stands for every work center (including the whole company) which has no specific calendar.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind, I can do a quick test in my test environment to verify my guess :) .<br />

Hmh. I was told that I have to setup the calendar for each work center if I switch. That would be a big thing on our live environment. At the moment we only use ZZZ / By Company.<br />
<br />
If I understand you right, baan uses a two level search when the ROU Parameter is set to &quot;By Work-Center&quot;. Maybe that might lead to longer runtime on PRP, MRP and other time-consuming processes?<br />
<br />
Thanks Martin<br />
<br />
Btw. folks, two germans are talking in english - aren't there any other opinions out there?</div></div><hr />

Correct! It should have a minor impact on the runtime of MRP/PRP (absolutely no impact in our case).<br />
