I should check tihra1101m000 for your order. All Hours accounting data of your order should be processed. <br />
<br />
That'all</div></div><hr />

   There wont be any order selection in the session Enter Hours Accounting {tihra1101m000}. Instead you would have to select the week the order date belongs to and the employee who would be involved in doing the tasks pertaining to the order. Once you did that, you would find lots of tasks/workcenters in the detail part of this session. Clicking on anyone of them would reveal the project/production order number in the bottom section of the session. But before all this hows your routing setup? Does any one enter data in the above mentioned session, manually?<br />
<br />
You get this error message when part or whole of your operation hours doesnt get processed. Usually this is done when you complete the routing tasks one by one.. But in case it doesnt then you could run the session Process Hours Accounting {tihra1210m000} for the particular week/day/employee that didnt get processed...<br />

You have only run for one employee and for the week 1. What about the remaining weeks and employees? Apart from week and employees, you would have to specify even the days (Sat, Sun etc). Therefore you will have to run for the whole 5 weeks of January for all the days Saturday to Friday... <br />
 <br />
An alternative to the above is to go to Enter Hours Accounting session and find out, for the first 5 weeks of this year, how many transactions didnt get processed. All processed transaction would have an asterisk &quot;*&quot; at the end of the line.. Find out the ones that doesnt have this sign for the 5 weeks of Jan and hit process...<br />
