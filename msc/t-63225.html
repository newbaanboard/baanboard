<br />
I have a question concerning production order.<br />
<br />
In BaanIV , when creating production order with 1 operation and 1 component.<br />
BOM  : Item A is the manufactured item  1 To <br />
          Item C is the component  Quantity 1 To<br />
1 operation <br />
<br />
If i have a production order of 100 To item A<br />
start date 01/12 and end date 04/12.<br />
<br />
I manufacture 5 To a day approximatively.<br />
<br />
When generating MRP the system gives me for the component item C needs is 100 to for item C request date 01/12. MRP is creating 1 POF for 100 To and i would like to have 4 POF <br />
<br />
In reality i need 5 to item C <br />
01/12   5 to<br />
02/12   5 to<br />
03/12   5 to<br />
04/12   5 to<br />
<br />
How can i manage this in Baan IV , is it possible ? Without to split my initial production order in 4.<br />
<br />
Thank you <br />
<br />
Best regards.</div></div><hr />

Basically, you want the material issued as you need and not at the start date. One way is to create 4 operations and in BOM maintain the 4 line with each line linked to 4 operations. You have to make sure that you have defined routing correctly so that material appear as needed. I think this may give you what you are looking for.<br />
