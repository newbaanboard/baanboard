<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">7th January 2003, 09:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course any update on Baan tables not using the functional restrictions may cause problems with data integrity. An ERP system is a relational application: for example changes in the Bill Of Material may need a revision on the Item, because of material changes in the components that are contained in the item:<br />
<br />
A computer with a newer CPU, graphical board, etc does have other specs and may need an update on the documentation.<br />
<br />
In your example: if the warehouses are changing, then inventory levels in these warehouses should be sufficient too. Also planning constraints may be there to allocate based upon the BOM warehouse data.<br />
<br />
So best way in your case: search for the functional session that can do the same as you want (I cannot imagine that there is none) instead of creating your own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OmeLuuk is right. There's a lot of logic involved in altering almost any data in BaanERP. You'd want to mimic the associated logic when creating your own session to alter a data in BaanERP. There are 2 ways to do it:<br />
 Mimic the program script of the session associated with changing the particular data you want to change<br />
 Use AFS (BaanERP's API) to make BaanERP update the data using the associated session in background. There's a forum here in BaanBoard specifically for AFS. Please feel free to ask more question about it<br />

<br />
In iBaanERP there is also a special protection in the Data Access Layer (DAL) that forces some data integrity. This concept is not available in Baan IV c4 or lower.</div></div><hr />
