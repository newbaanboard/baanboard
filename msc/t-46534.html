<br />
I am never worked with  MPS before and am trying to do a basic MPS setup to figure out the process. <br />
<br />
I am running MPS for a new part with the following details: <br />
<br />
stock-on-hand = 0 <br />
saftety stock = 14<br />
lead time = 60 days. <br />
mps period = 1week<br />
<br />
The weekly demand for this part is 4 <br />
<br />
When I run Gen MPS (with gen Planned orders=yes), the process creates a planned order for 18 for the first week(SS+week1 demand). On the following weeks however, instead of creating an order for qty 4 in each week, it creates 4 orders with qty 1 on 4 days of the week. Is there some setting that I am missing? I checked the max order qty on the Item master and this is set to 999999. <br />
<br />
Could some one help with this one. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />

If this is set to 1, and the order interval is f.e. 0 days, it will create orders for 1 pcs. If you set the min order quantity to 5, MPS will generate a planned order for 20 and another for 5 etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">10th January 2008, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Behind the scene MPS is bucketless. It divides the forecast into daily, hence you are seeing a MPS order of 1 pcs. You will need to set order interval. But this becomes tricky. It depends upon the day when you generate the MPS. so if you give MPS day of Tue and order intervalof 7 days then 7 days will start from Tue, and so on. But I think you can control this by always giving the week begining day as starting day of generating the MPS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metbaan</div><div class="date">28th January 2008, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
<br />
Thanks for all your responses. I used avpatil's suggestion and setup the order interval. That seemed to take care of the daily buckets issues. <br />
<br />
I have another issue though. <br />
<br />
I am runing MPS for a part that has the following info:<br />
<br />
Inv on Hand: 30 (27 in nettable, 3 in non-nettable warehouse)<br />
Safety Stock : 18<br />
Min/Max Order Qty : 32<br />
Demand Forecast of 2 per week<br />
<br />
No Sales or Purchase Orders pending. <br />
<br />
When I run MPS for the above part, I see a &quot;scheduled receipt&quot; of qty 28 in the first week. Also, there is a Planned Purchase Order of 28 generated along with this. I looked everywhere to see where the qty from 28 is coming from, but have no clue. Could someone shed some light. <br />
<br />
I am attaching the MPS session screenprint as well. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">28th January 2008, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Here is the reason for Order of 28.<br />
Your Demand forecast is for 2 per week. I am not sure if you have any backward forecats consumption, but it seems that you have one quantity left from the forecast and since your nettable warehouse inventoy is 27, so 27 + 1 = 28. Though you mnetioned min qty of 32, so system should have generated 32, but the logic for 28 is as mentioned. Try to generate the MPS with always giving the begining of week date, in that way system will always consider the full forecast for the week.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metbaan</div><div class="date">28th January 2008, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">no, there is no prior forecast (i.e forecast before current week). Each time we load the demand forecast, we delete forecast prior to current week. Also, i have other parts with the same problem for e.g.<br />
<br />
Part with<br />
<br />
Safety Stock = 24<br />
min/multiple order qty = 32<br />
inv on hand = 74 (68 in nettable, 6 in non-nettable)<br />
<br />
this generates a first bucket of 48 (and a plan order qty of 48). <br />
<br />
as you can see, in this case, the qty in the first bucket is less than the on hand qty. And it's only a problem with the first bucket. Everything else seems to be just fine. <br />
<br />
Do you have any suggestions? Could it be orders in past that are not delivered completely (for whatever reason)? <br />
<br />
Any help would be great. And unfortunately, we do not have source code, else I'd have put it in debug and gone the tedious route to figure it out. <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Try to generate with the MPS generation date of begining of the week. I can see how 28 can be arrived?<br />
<br />
What is the forecast for your second example?<br />
