Script: timrp1260<br />

Our buyer is very confused about the fact, that this session somtimes generate more than one purchase order for the same supplier. What could be the reason? I think, the normal way is to generate one purchase order for each supplier with one or more order lines. But instead the session generates many purchase orders with only one order line.<br />
<br />
The status is set to &quot;release&quot; in session timrp1121m000 for 3 or 5 items and the supplier is always the same.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

By default it should add lines together on one order if transfered together and has the same supplier.<br />
I don't think the buyer and planner field should affect this but check it anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klixy23</div><div class="date">21st June 2002, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">ok. I checked the solution #124619 and it was installed. I made a lot of systematic tests and I found the reason.<br />
<br />
I think the session timrp1260m000 works as follows:<br />
<br />
It creates the first order for supplier A and the buyer 1 and then the first order line. It looks for the next &quot;released&quot; dataset and if the supplier and the buyer is the same, it adds a new order line, if not, it creates a new order. The session doesn't compare the table field timrp021.buyr with the field tdpur040.buyr from the order createt before, it compares with the field tccom020.ccon from the supplier master. <br />
<br />
In our database there was an entry for each supplier. I cleared this entry and now the session do, what I expect. :)</div></div><hr />
