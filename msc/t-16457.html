<br />
Due to urgency, I need to have partial delivery out of a production order. Original planned quantity of the production order is let say 10 pc. Come to operation 40, which is a long lead time operation, we need to send whatever quantity (let say 4 in this case) that has been reported complete to the next operation. This next operation, 50, is a subcontracting operation whereby we need to generate Purchase order(PO) to our supplier. <br />
<br />
When I use session tisfc2250m000 to generate the PO to the supplier, the PO genarate will have a quantity of 10 instead of 6. This is still ok as we can overwrite the quantity in the PO.<br />
<br />
Imagine now the remaining 6 pc from operation 40 also reported complete. My question is how am I going to generate the PO for the 6 pc  for operation 50? BaaN don't allow us to create 2 subcontracting PO for the same operation for the same priduction order. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hope someone can advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A PO is simply a document stating the intention of a customer to purchase items with conditions as detailed in the PO from a supplier. From business process point of view, I don't see anything wrong with issuing subcontracting PO for the whole order qty. The material can then be sent partially to the subcontractor and product received again partially from subcontractor. The PO just states that you intend to subcontract whole order qty, even though you can only deliver the material partially to the subcontractor<br />
<br />
If you must have multiple POs, you can, but it's gonna be more tedious as you have to split the subcontracted operation<br />

<br />
how can this be done?  create the subcontracting PO and change the qty?  receive the qty that went out and then...  What?<br />

You mean within same production order you would like to have the option of doing some quantity in house and some via subcontracter. This is possible. You can reduce the PO quantity and then report more at the operation level. I am not sure how do you tacke the vairances, it will generate. But the receipt of purchase order and reporting at operation can be independent.<br />
