<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">19th June 2003, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I'm new to the functional side of Baan (I usually work in Tools), but I have a question that may sound odd.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to use the sessions in the tipcs module to make and ship project items without using ILC?<br />
Our users want to use projects and use the sessions in tipcs to transfer project items in and out of warehouses, but with ILC turned off.<br />
I'm not familiar with the workings of these sessions yet, but I'm trying to learn more about it.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to transfer project items from warehouse to warehouse?  Or how do you convert the project items to standard items?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.   :confused:</div></div><hr />

So i can't tell you about a non ILC system but here is what I do know:<br />
<br />
You can transfer pcs inventory from one project to another (and hence to different warehouses) using tipcs5131m000 Maintain Planned PRP transactions.<br />
<br />
You can also use tdilc1120m000 and transfer project inventory from one warehouse to another.<br />
<br />
You can copy a project customized structure to standard using tipcs2232m000.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

It still doesn't seem to be doing what we want though.<br />
When the user creates a production order and makes project items, then completes the production order, the item still does not exist in inventory.<br />
The item has been made into a standard item, the warehouse is non-ILC. <br />
From what I've heard, ILC treats items as WIP, which is not visible when location control goes away. <br />
This is our problem and we haven't found a way around it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 00:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you mean you are completing the production order for a customized item on a project and then you are converting it to a standard item by some other means?<br />
On our system, I can't seem to create a production order for a project without the item being a customized one.<br />
<br />
I think you can't manufacture a standard item in a project. Would that be what is causing you a problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">We're probably trying to do something that Baan isn't capable of doing, but I'll try to explain it a little better.<br />
We were an ILC environment, but decided to revert back. My predecessor found a document that provided steps to turning off ILC. Everything seemed to work up until this project dilemma. <br />
What we're trying to do is this...we want to transfer project items from one warehouse to another, but in using session tdinv1101m000 Enter Inventory Transactions, 'project' is not an input field.  <br />
After the project item is completed and shipped, there are some project items leftover. Today, with ILC we transfer these project items from the production warehouse to a stockroom warehouse, then later transfer these project items to a standard item using  session tipcs5130m000. <br />
But now with ILC turned off, this session doesn't seem to work. The item doesn't seem to exist in inventory, even after the production order is created and completed.<br />
We still want to use projects to make and ship items, but can't find a way to make the previous project item (once stored in an ilc-warehouse, but now converted to a standard item in a non-ilc warehouse) show up in inventory in order to use the inv module sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">With ILC, you do the following steps for transferring customized inventory to standard:<br />
<br />
1. Maintain Planned PRP Warehouse Orders - tipcs5130m000<br />
2. Confirm - tipcs5230m000<br />
3. Generate/Maintain Outbound<br />
4. Release Outbound<br />
<br />
Without ILC, I think you run session tipcs5270m000, Transfer Planned PRP Warehouse order, instead of steps 3 &amp; 4 above.<br />
<br />
Are you doing that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - <br />
<br />
I believe that customized items cannot be placed in a warehouse as finished goods inventory.  They must first be converted to standard items.  Although customized items carry a warehouse designation on them, they do not actually reside in the warehouse - their costs remain in WIP until either delivered to the project's sales order for invoicing, or converted to a standard item to be placed into warehoused inventory.  I am a finance person, but I believe this is how they work<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

Linda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you Linda in terms of customized item inventory.<br />
However, with tipcs5130m000 etc. you can &quot;convert&quot; a customized item into a standard item; although it won't be part of the project afterwards. This might be useful to Sandy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">You are absolutely correct Ed - I should have been a bit more specific in my reply.  When I stated that they must be converted to a standard item, I should have mentioned the session name.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I talked to the users who are trying to change from ILC to non-ILC and got a little more info.<br />
We have been through all the steps to convert to non-ILC.  We have created and completed production orders (using projects). The main concern is...we lose the warehouse visibility when ILC is turned off.  This is the main thing that is concerning our users, as they are used to moving inventory from warehouse to warehouse in ILC.  <br />
<br />
Also, once the production order is complete, what happens to the project...it doesn't seem to exist anymore.   <br />
How do you ship the sales order, which was created with a project if you can't see the project in any of the tdinv sessions?<br />
I'm confused. Any help is appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />
