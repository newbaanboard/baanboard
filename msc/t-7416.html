We are currently implementing BAAN IV version B40c.58, with ILC and Lot control activated.<br />
We are also maintaining Lots manually (session tdltc0101m000).<br />
The question is, when we enter a new lot for an item, the &quot;Lot type&quot; field defaults to &quot;Purchase&quot;. Unfortunately 90% of our lots will be &quot;Production&quot; types. Is there any way to change the &quot;Lot type&quot; default to &quot;Production&quot; rather than &quot;Purchase&quot;.??<br />
<br />
I did try to set session defaults, but it does not work.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

We also had the same problem. We tried to make certain values default by setting the default value of form fields, but it'd only work after we Tab to the field. We finally had to actually declare the default value in the program script so that the new default will automatically show up upon session start up. We didn't like changing the prog script, but it works.<br />

<br />
Changing the prog script sounds pretty radical, does BAAN itself have to make the changes or can they be made inhouse.?<br />

This is a user and session combination that retains values in the form.  I have used it for print sessions but I am pretty sure that it will work with a maintenance screen as well. Under the option menu, there is a value to save defaults.  What I have done is to fill in all of the values I definitely want to appear and then hit save defaults.  When I return to the session, I hit the get defaults button under options and my defaults are loaded.  It may help.</div></div><hr />
