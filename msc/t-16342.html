How does Baan support kinds of MFG Mode?<br />
For MTS, MTO and Repetitive MFG, I know there are SFC and RPT, But I found the RPT is too simple and the SFC can't support MTO yet, Is there any MTO or DOP(Dynamic Order Processing) supported session?</div></div><hr />

What specific industry are you trying to serve? With that information in mind, we can probably help you better<br />

    I'am thinking about machine equipment industry, which is typical MTO. They make to special customer and nearly all purchase, manufacturing are special to special sales order. So they need trace all such orders under a sale order, In some product, such as IFS, it provide DOP, used to process this conditions. I think the Baan Project is not fit for it and the SFC can not trace tens of kinds of orders under a sales order.<br />
    How does Baan achieve this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Generally, for companies which are heavy into MTO and would like to track all the way into profit and loss of a specific order, the Project Control (PCS) module is sufficient. May I know what specific requirements from the client which can't be handled by PCS? Or is it just too tedious to use?<br />

   Thank you very much.<br />
   I have no specific requirment, Although I have no much knowledge on Baan PCS and Baan Project, Baan I feel it is not very good to achieve MTO as DOP.<br />
   I paste several pictures on the attachment to describe my doubt.<br />

I've seen the document you attached. Seems like a convenient, one-screen control of everything like what's provided by IFS is what you're looking for. Well, then it has to be customised in BaanERP. I don't think BaanERP might be lacking the project/MTO control function, it's just not yet made into one simple screen like what IFS has<br />

   Thank you very much. I think I will study the Baan PCS deeply, I belive it provide a good MTO solution in another way, I try to understand its meaning and method.<br />
   Thank you again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">3rd September 2004, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking from experience with both IV and V, the PCS module does exactly what you are seeking.  You create your standard bills of material.  Then decide which of those items must be &quot;customized&quot; for specific orders and which can be used as standard - designating that by selecting either Anonomyous (to use as standard) or To Order (to customize) in the Item Ordering Data, Order Policy.<br />
     In PCS you create Projects, with a project equating to a specific order.  For the items you have designated as To Order in the standard bill, new items are created in the customized bill.  these new items are derived from the standard items and have the project number ahead of the standard item number.  these customized items are treated as distinctly separate items and purchase orders and/or manufacturing orders are created specifically for them.  Project costs are accumulated for the project as a whole and consist of the total of the items that are customized and those used as standard.<br />
     Have used this for manufacturing customized specialty vehicles, where 80% was standard and 20% customized and for government contracts (each separate contract was designated a separate project) where 90% is customized items.<br />
     This works well using the Project Control module under Manufacturing.  Don't even consider using the Projects (often referred to as 'Big' Projects).</div></div><hr />

    Your completed description on PCS make me clear.<br />
    For me, Much study on it is required!<br />
    Thank you very much<br />
