<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sjohnson</div><div class="date">29th October 2008, 21:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to block a purchased item from appearing on the planned orders session ( cprrp1100m000 ). Let's say engineering is doing a revision change on an item and you want to prevent purchasing from buying the item until the new revision is approved. I piloted the use of signals. This will prevent the item from being transferred into a PO, but by then, the purchaser has already gone through the quoting process with the vendor. She cannot tell from the planned orders session that item is currently blocked.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">30th October 2008, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Maybe remove Plan item data<br />
2) Maybe future date the &quot;first order date&quot; in Item ordering data<br />
3) Maybe change the horizons beyond scenario range in plan item data<br />
4) Maybe disable Item supplier information (either expire it or make sourcing % = 0 for all suppliers); In this case, planned order will appear but with no suppliers; Dont know if this can help<br />
<br />
Quick options I can think of;</div></div><hr />

MRP runs everynight so item(s) re-apprear each day on the planned orders session. I was hoping I could set a filter on the session somehow to remove the items or use the expiry date on the e-item revision.<br />
<br />
The current method of control is a &quot;Do not Buy&quot; whiteboard in purchasing with a list of parts that the buyers must avoid. There's got to be a better way to handle this in LN.<br />
<br />
All comments welcome.</div></div><hr />
