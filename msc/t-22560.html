<br />
A clarification required related to Backflushing.  (Baan IVC4)<br />
 <br />
In Maintain Estimated material (tisfc0110m000), Item called &quot;X&quot; Net quantity is 100 and scrap factor is 1 and this material is set to backflush.<br />
<br />
Net quantity - 100 nos<br />
Estimated quantity - 101 nos<br />
<br />
When we execute backflushing thru the session &quot;Backflushing Materials and hours&quot;( tisfc0220m000), it backflushes only 100 nos and remaining 1 nos.. not getting backflushed.<br />
<br />
Is Scrap factor will work in Backflushing or not?, Please clarify.<br />
<br />
Please let me know how to issue the remaining qty 1 no.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

The allocated qty will be backflushed. Is the scrap factor specified against the component or against the main item? The scrap factor should be specified against the component and you should see the allocated qty in estimated materials change as you change the scrap factor on the component line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthil</div><div class="date">8th December 2004, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Scrap factor is at component level, by changing the scrap factor in BOM or in Maintain Estimated material changes take place only in Estimated qty and allocated quantity and not in net quantity.  Back flush carried out in net quantity only....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a production order as follow:<br />
Production order for 8 units where it needs two components per assambly.<br />
<br />
component required qty is 16, scrap qty 1 so, estimated quantity is 17.<br />
<br />
We do not complete the order at once, we complete 2 units , then another 2 and so on... till we complete the 8 for the production order. However, the order still showing 1 unit on material to be issued for the component after completing the order quantity. Never backflushed.<br />
<br />
When this component supposed to be backflused? When we last unit is reported completed?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

To me it seems to be rounding issue,as every time you report a quantity of 2 pcs system tries to calcualte the qty and since it is not equal to to the whole number it is issues only 4 pcs. You should be able to issue at the end.<br />
