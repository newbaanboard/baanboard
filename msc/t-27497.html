<br />
In version Baan IV it is not possible to change the warehouse after we have delivered goods for a production order (sfc).<br />
We have the case that the production order can have 2 types of quality (1a, 2a).<br />
At the moment we solve this issue with a warehouse transfer booking from the receipt location of the warehouse of 1a goods to the special 2a goods warehouse. To avoid this step we have considered to change the standard that we can override the warehouse at any time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have any concerns or points we should look at?<br />

<br />
Correct: once, for a certain production order, you've received a quantity in warehouse 1, you can't receive another quantity in warehouse 2.<br />
<br />
I've seen a situation where a customer had also made it possible to change the warehouse (in tisfc0202m000) after the first receipt. This had caused problems in the planned inventory transactions. These are recorded by warehouse, so, if you change the WH in tisfc0202m000, the WH in tisfc001 will also be changed and therefore the planned inventory transaction will from then on be recorded for WH 2. This will cause unwanted results in case of using MRP (even more so when WH 2 is a non-nettable WH).<br />
<br />
Another problem: in case of reporting for WH 2, while in tdilc4113s000, the user decides to delete one of the previously recorded receipt lines (for WH 1),  the inventory levels and financial transactions will be corrupted.<br />
<br />
In other words, be very careful, it's not as straightforward as it looks.<br />
<br />
You might want to consider using some sort of AFS to create an inventory transaction in the background that brings the goods from WH 1 to WH 2, all according to the rules.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
Thank you for your answer. I will have a close look at it. Probably we will automate the booking step with AFS, as you suggested.<br />
