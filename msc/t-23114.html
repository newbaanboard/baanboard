<br />
BaaN Vc sp 15<br />
<br />
Recently we have migrated from BaaN Vb to Vc.<br />
<br />
In BaaN Vb , Baan only posts Project PCS COGS (General) on projects(tipcs) if there were sales order invoices raised on the project.  It did not consider instalment invoices in this process.<br />
 	<br />
But in BaaN Vc, Baan seems to consider both sales order and instalment invoices when determining the Percent Invoiced for a project.<br />
 <br />
How can we change the set up so that installment invoices are not included in the Percent Invoiced calculation?<br />
<br />
Is there any parameter setting to be done in finance integration set up?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
Sathasivan</div></div><hr />

When setting up the PCS project like this, the percentage invoiced is ignored and the way of reducing WIP can be influenced much better.<br />

<br />
How to stop the finance entries related to revenues against Installment invoices before closing the project? we want the entries to be posted at the time of closing the project only.<br />
<br />
Is there any parameter level set up required?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jvdhorst</div><div class="date">11th February 2005, 09:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Normal practice is that indirect installments are used. This means that actual COGS/Revenues are posted at the end of the project only. In case no installments are used or installments with direct settlement are used, the system have created during the project life cycle already actual COGS and Revenues based on deliveries on the project. The COGS transactions influence already the WIP value. Beside this the interim results are calculated as well by period, but will respect the already posted COGS and Revenues. It is necessary  to map the interim Costs and Revenues transactions to different accounts to be able to take it in account for reporting. The balance of interim Costs and Interim Revenues is posted to an Interim WIP Account</div></div><hr />
