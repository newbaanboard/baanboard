<br />
I am using ERP Ln 6.1<br />
I need to map the process of returnable gatepass , where the material will goout of factory for some job work and then will come back.<br />
<br />
it is little  different from routine subcontracting process, as if go for regular subcontracting then i have to go for opennig different items and subcontracting rate also will be varried.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Motors are reqd to send outside factory for rewinding.<br />
Inspection Intruments are send outside Factory for caliberation etc.<br />
<br />
If any body has encountered similar scenarios, pls reply<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
Make a service order for subcontracting.  In the estimated materials tab create two lines, put the item to be repaired &quot;From warehouse&quot; and &quot;To Warehouse&quot; in the lines. In the Activities tab, go to view details, put subcontracting details and release the order.  This will create a purchase order and one warehouse order for issue and receipt.  Through outbound order you can send the material outside and through inbound order you can recieve after repairing.<br />
<br />
I think this will clear your doubts. <br />
<br />
If you are not implementing service module.  Here is another way.<br />
<br />
Put a Warehousing Order of Service (Manual) - Issue, (you can maintain a series &quot;RET&quot; for returnable items and &quot;NRT&quot; for non-returnable items).  Process it.  If the material is returnable, while receiving the material, go to specific &quot;Create return Order&quot;.  Through this you can receive the material.  For making payments to the subcontractor create an item of type &quot;Service&quot; and make the purchase order.  Here, you can't get any link between purchase order and warehousing order.  <br />
