<br />
Is there any possibility thru which i can change the warehouse of the maintain estimated material, while creating the production order as material has to be allocated from subcontractor warehouse to have a better control of WIP .<br />
<br />
thanks in advance..<br />
<br />
<br />
Please suggest any solution or workaround.<br />

I am aware about changing the warehouse thru Maintain estimated material, but is there any possible way where i can change the warehouse thru a one shot so that allocation will be happen on that warehouse only...<br />
<br />
In my case maintain estimated materials are more than 2000..<br />
so not possible to change for every one..<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

This warehouse needs to be a WIP warehouse. It needs to be linked to work centre defined for your subcontractor. You need to set the sfc parameters to allow the use of WIP warehouses (form 2 parameter 3).<br />
<br />
When you create a new sfc order it will have the BOM warehouse in the estimated material warehouse. When you release the order the warehouse will be changed to the wip warehouse.</div></div><hr />
