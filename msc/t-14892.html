This can create all kind of problems, especially when changes are significant and configurations complex.<br />
We are exploring the possibility to set-up a seperate company for PCF developement and create functionality to export/import PCF data between companies. Does anyone have experience doing this? Any other suggestions on how to manage PCF development in a production environment are also welcome.<br />

<br />
Another option would be to copy your generic items to &quot;test&quot; items.  For instance, if you have a generic item called &quot;ITEM&quot;, copy it to &quot;ITEM.1&quot; or whatever naming convention you prefer.  This way, all the features/constraints will be separate.  Also, this method doesn't require your own scripts to export/import.  When you are done testing, just copy.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

I do know that configurator is different, but have no experience with 5.0</div></div><hr />

Major development of PCFs is done in a PCF development company, simple tweaks to constraints can be done in the live environment.<br />
<br />
We import and export the PCF data using the exchange module.  We have a policy to keep features specific to generic items.</div></div><hr />

Any chance you could post the details of your exchange scheme?<br />
