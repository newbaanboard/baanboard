The logistic transactions for those are, Purchase to Project, Production SFC Material Cost and Operation Cost with project, and project surcharges..<br />
As of today this warranty projects are posted to COGS ledger accounts which leads to mismatch.<br />
How is the sales process for such projects are foreseen as standard of Baan.<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

  Did you check the help file? Under the listing &quot;# Integration PCS with BAAN Finance&quot; you would get to see the integration setup for all possible PCS combination.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">2nd August 2007, 08:31</div></div><div class="posttext">You can post the costs for warranty projects directly into COGS (instead of posting them to WIP first). However, you have to &quot;throw away&quot; the PCS/COGS (estimated or actual, whatever you're using) transactions by posting debit and credit side to the same ledger account for those projects. Just keep in mind that  if you work with extra costs posted from finance to PCS (using a ledger account with the PCS integration flag set) Baan expects this account to be a balance account. As far as I know, you cannot use a profit/loss account here without using ttaad4100<br />
<br />
I just read over your positing again: You are missing the sales part? If you don't have sales for those projects, make sure the &quot;revenue expected&quot; flag for those projects is set to false. Then any costs that are posted to WIP will immediately generate PCS/COGS transactions as soon as you're calculating project costs (at latest when you close the project)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a bit<br />

Yes, we must have Sales Order. We issue invoices with zero amount. Therefore the internal project option is not useful. I think what we will do is the &quot;Normal Project&quot; option: Making use of normal projects with series to distinguish from projects with revenue and having COGS + WIP go into specially defined warranty project WIP and COGS accounts through integration.</div></div><hr />
