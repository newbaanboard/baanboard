we want to implement the QMS Module for our purchase (pur) and have set the parameters in QMS for pur. We want to use it for our default examinations in the goods receipt. Is there a documentation, white paper or anything else about QMS? Or is there somebody who have experience with QMS and can tell us some tipps and tricks ?<br />

Thanks and Regards,<br />

Our problem is solved, because we find out, where the inspection plan were generated. We have  forgotten to fill out one combination and so Baan could not generate the default inspection plans. But now it works fine. If we have any query about QMS I would like to ask you again by mail, if you allow.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanana</div><div class="date">13th September 2002, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Ray,<br />
<br />
We work with BaanERP, but I guess the principle of the module is similar.<br />
<br />
Some set up data (Master Data) is needed  In order to start using the module<br />
-Characteristics : what you want to check<br />
-Option set : Purchase<br />
-Options : Pass/Fail for example<br />
-Tests<br />
-Tests by characteristics<br />
- Quality group<br />
<br />
The trigger for an &quot;automatic&quot; generation of Standard and Inspections orders during the &quot;put away advice&quot; step is:<br />
<br />
1) The purchase line must be remarked like inspection=YES<br />
2) The Item must be linked to the quality group defined in the set up process<br />
3) A quality combination for origin Purchase and the defined Quality Group should be created<br />
<br />
Now, with this set uo, the system will create a Standard Inspection order when you put away the advice from the receiving location to the Inspection location.<br />
<br />
For each Inspection order a Sample (the quantity that will be inspected) must be created.<br />
<br />
While you have the results of the inspection, report it in the Test Data session.  Small tip : if you have two dispositions, for example, 3 units that PASS and 7 units that FAILED, create two samples, one for 3 and the other one for 7, in tht way you can complete amd process the inspection order.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps<br />

We are thinking of using QMS or a bolt on package like iBaan TQM, but want to see the documentation on QMS first.<br />

The white paper and KQ helped substantially. QMS will not work for what we want it to do. <br />

<br />
how did you solve your Problems? I'm trying to set QMS up but I'm still having problems with it. even with a combination the System does not create inspection orders.<br />
<br />
We are working with ERP_LN 6.1 FP5. Do you have experience in that?<br />
<br />
