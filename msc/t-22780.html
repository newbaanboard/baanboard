<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harishkm</div><div class="date">5th January 2005, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">We are a manufacturing company and our products are made to customer specific orders.  We provide complete cold room solutions on a turnkey basis and/or even supply all the components in CKD form.<br />
<br />
At the enquiry stage only external dimensions of the cold room will be available based on which the total square meters of panel to be manufactured could be ascertained. Quotations are prepared based on rate per square meter of panel. At this stage, details of the individual panels to be manufactured are not worked out as it is not practical to do so. <br />
<br />
Upon confirmation of the order the client will provide the drawings and the entire cold room will be broken down into individual panels (Standard width is approximately 1 meter and length of the panel could vary) as per the drawing. These panels are then manufactured and supplied to customer. <br />
<br />
Selling price is fixed per square meter of panel. Production and Despatch will keep track of the individual panels manufactured and supplied. Production capacity is determined by the total square meters of the panels.  Delivery note and packing slip will be in terms of number of panels supplied. <br />
<br />
How best this process could be mapped in BaaN IVc4?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
