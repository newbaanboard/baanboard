This is w.r.t. Production Orders.<br />
<br />
Have a situation wherein user has delivered more than what he actually produced, by mistake. He has issued the required Raw Material through. The Production Order is in Completed stage. I am not aware of any workaround in Baan for reducing delivered quantity.<br />
<br />
The best I can think of is to go ahead, close the Production Order, and then do an inventory adjustment.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions welcome!!</div></div><hr />

You are correct, once the order is completed there is no standard &quot;undo&quot; functionality available.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pergerp</div><div class="date">16th March 2005, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Inv. adjustment is the easiest way, <br />
 then you should create<br />
 - negative adjustment for produced item<br />
 - more positive adjustments for raw materials,<br />
<br />
but there is a more compex solution: <br />
 use only ticst0101m000 (Enter Material Issue):<br />
 - write negative quantities into fields of &quot;Issue&quot;, at existing raw materials<br />
    (negative issue for overissued qties) <br />
 - create an additional row for produced item, and issue (use up)<br />
    over-reported quantity of reported item.<br />
Adventage of this solution: you have to handle only one order, financial balance or prod. order would be perfect.<br />
 (Solution is working with ILC as well but with ILC you have to handle outbounds)</div></div><hr />
