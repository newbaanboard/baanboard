   We have a customer in flexible packaging. To produce a finished good requires several shifts. Their semi finished goods are considered phantom items to reduce load in planning and execution of prod orders. A roll of their semi finished good can split into multiple rolls of finished goods.<br />
<br />
   Because of the situation above, using lot numbers is less effective since every operations are spread to several shifts. Using serial numbers based on output of first operation is also not effective because of the same reason. Both of the methods will result in meaningless lot no/SN for quality tracking purposes. Using SN based on finished good is also ineffective because one roll of SFG would then have multiple SN. Any idea? Pls help<br />
<br />
   Thanks<br />
