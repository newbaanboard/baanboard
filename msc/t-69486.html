<br />
First off, thanks in advance for taking the time to review this. I was working on a constraint and received error, &quot;Length 10002 is not allowed&quot;. Is anyone familiar with this error? Some further explanation would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks in advance for reviewing my post. I wrote a validation constraint and received the following error, &quot;Length 10003 not allowed&quot;. I've received 1002-1004. The constraint is about 250-300 lines and 26k characters. If anyone is familiar with this error I'd appreciate some guidance. Thank you!</div></div><hr />

Never used constraints - for grins and giggles did you try shortening it?  Of course I do not even know if that is possible or how these work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">29th November 2016, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Could be that you are using the &quot;reserved/special&quot; name length in a non parameter substitution section of constraint logic.<br />
The PCf parameters in tipcf0100m000 contain the settings for certain special names in constraints. Length is one of them. So you can call it, for example &quot;len&quot; in there and that might avoid the problem.<br />
Without further detail of where and when you are getting the message it is difficult to say.<br />

The error was due to character limitation. I rewrote my constraints with less characters and it functioned correctly. Thanks for taking the time to review my post.</div></div><hr />
