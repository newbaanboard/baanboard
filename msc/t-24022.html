<br />
Does the system update FTP (Fixed Transfer Price) of a manufactured item when it is purchased from outside with a different price? Or is it always determined by the cost price of BOM items and operation rates based on routing? <br />
<br />
How do we change the weighted average cost of a manufactured item?<br />

There's no weighted average price of manufactured items in BaanIV. In BaanERP (i.e. version 5.x), it's possible to specify some manufactured items to be valued using Moving Average Unit Cost (MAUC) method. When valued this way, MAUC of manufactured item will be weighted average of its standard production cost and purchase cost (if the item is procured both ways)<br />
