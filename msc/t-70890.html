Haven't had any problems for years.  We have moved to Linux and now we have issues with it hanging.  Not every time.  Sometimes it works fine; others it hangs.  Anyone have any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

The problem with that scenario is that you can not replicate the issue.  They just helped us were the boosters were not working - turned out for our Generate Planned Orders we will need to point the BSE_TMP directory to /tmp to get it to work.  In our case they would not work period.</div></div><hr />

We changed our kernel settings and our success rate has gone up, but we are still seeing failures.  It is failing in our largest company and when two smaller companies run at the same time.</div></div><hr />
