<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">28th January 2002, 23:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We currently have 6 buckets, each being 30 days in length.<br />
<br />
We are planning on changing to 24 weekly buckets. <br />
<br />
We currently have a third party software which generates a forecast by item by month.<br />
<br />
How should we set up our plan periods? For example, if I were to set up 24 periods, each with a period length of 7 days, this would not work because some months are 28 days, some are 31 days etc.<br />
<br />
If I had a month with 28 days, then this would be ok. I could take the monthly forecast for each item and divide it by four. But if I have a month with 31 days, the weekly buckets will not match up correctly. <br />
<br />
What is the best way to handle this?</div></div><hr />
