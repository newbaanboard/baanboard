<br />
Almost all our products are customized items and we use PCS/PCF.<br />
We are looking to update our PCF-model because the way we have currently implemented PCF is limiting our future wishes. We heared about 'multi-level' PCF but never got a clear explenation about it.<br />
<br />
I have some general questions for anyone with experience in this area.<br />
<br />
What is multi-level PCF?<br />
Is there any documentation on multi-level PCF?<br />
Can anyone provide us with a working example of a multi-level PCF model?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Danny</div></div><hr />

<br />
A multi-level PCF means that you have product features attached to several generic items in your generic bill of material.<br />
As result, during variant creation process, the PCF will ask you to choose options for each generic item with product features.<br />
The interest is using the same customizable sub-assembly into several PCF models.<br />
<br />
For example, with a multi-level PCF, you can use item &quot;Z&quot; (generic sub-assembly) into PCF model &quot;A&quot; and PCF model &quot;B&quot;.<br />
<br />
   A (whith product features)<br />
   |<br />
-----<br />
|    |    |<br />
X    Y    Z (with product features)<br />
<br />
<br />
   B (whith product features)<br />
   |<br />
 ---<br />
 |      |<br />
 W      Z (with product features)<br />
<br />
Nethertheless, the PCF will always ask you to choose options for the &quot;Z&quot; item, even if the &quot;Z&quot; item isn't selected during structure variant generation process!<br />
<br />
I hope i've been clear enough...<br />
<br />

The one thing that you need to know is that characteristics and options are inherited only top-down (from A to Z in Sylvain's example) and not bottom-up and not sideways!! (not from Z to A or from Z to Y or Y to Z).<br />
I have done several multilevel PCF's (long time ago) and it works like a charm.</div></div><hr />
