<br />
We use PCF to create PCS items that are made on order.<br />
Now I need to keep safty stock of 1 item that is normally created by options through PCF.<br />
<br />
I could create a project &quot;STOCK&quot; and manuafacture on this project but then I need to check the stock myself.<br />
I was thinking of creating a standard item ( with safty stock ) with the same itemnumber as the PCS-item, and then use wharehouse orders.<br />
But then again I get no PRP productionorders but MRPorders and my system is build on the project-numbers.<br />
<br />
Please spread your opinion.<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

In Generate PRP orders, make sure the option to check standard inventory is not checked - it should then generate a new production order every time.  If you needed to use the safety stock for a sales order, you could create a warehouse order and cancel the corresponding production order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">croezen</div><div class="date">6th November 2009, 10:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Prince but if I want to use safety stock in your way I will manualy need to check whats the stock and create PO's. That's not what i was hoping to be doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">6th November 2009, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">If you set the item To Order, MRP, Replenish to Max Inventory and set Max inventory to 1 and run MRP on it I think that will do the trick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. You need to maintain a safety stock of a standard item<br />
2. You want project to plan for this item, but using PRP orders<br />
<br />
Question, then what is the use of the safety stock.<br />
<br />
I think what you can do is don't plan the standard item via MRP, but plan it via SIC. So SIC will generate the order for safety stock, and project will continue to plan under PRP. I havent tested this.<br />
