How do you do? I hope in a great condition .<br />
I confuse with my baan VI SSA ERP LN 6.1 FP 2.<br />
<br />
I have created engineering item ,and I have made some revisions.<br />
When i display it in BOM session, the revision code doesn't appear .<br />
Also ,  the revision still not appear in estimated material in the production order for this item.<br />
Anybody have used E BOM in LN6.1 ?<br />
Or may be i missed something?<br />
<br />
I have attached the screen for you information.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance ,<br />
Cheers,<br />
Jenny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">4th May 2006, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you copy the new BOM over for the new revision? I can't vouch for LN6.1, but in IVc if you create a new revision, you have to copy both the new item and the new BOM (even if there are no actual changes to the BOM) for the revisions to show properly. Just copying/creating a relationship for the item isn't enough. The PBOM knows that there's a new revision but since it hasn't seen any detail on what the new revision is, it leaves the field blank.</div></div><hr />

I think i have run the right steps to create engineering revision.<br />
May be I should write to the support.<br />
Sorry for late reply :)<br />

<br />
I just happened to see this post although it is few months old now and perhaps you already got your answer from SSA now. Let me know if you are still interested with an answer this post.</div></div><hr />
