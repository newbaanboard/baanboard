<br />
We plan to perform a stock take next weekend using cycle counting.<br />
<br />
However we have a problem where we wish to enter only the bought out items in the cycle counting orders. This is due to our warehouse setup where we only have warehouses for finished parts and bought in items.<br />
<br />
However we will be counting parts as subassembleys as well.<br />
<br />
Is there any functionality within Baan which will let us quickly enter subassembley parts and their quantities and then interrogate the BOM to give us the quantities of the bought in parts we have counted within each sub assembley.<br />
<br />
Alternatively or there any way we can use cycle counting more efficiently within this scenario.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Standard cycle counting functionality inventorizes subassembly stock directly and not for the BOM items.  However BOM item inventorization can be approached in the following ways.<br />
<br />
1. Take the stock of subassembly and inventorize it. Then you can define the subassemblies as phantom items so that in production order it automatically explodes the bom of subassembly and consumes the BOM items.<br />
<br />
2. The second option is to create a purchase order for subassembly for some notional supplier. You can receive the subassembly as purchase order receipts and then use the option &quot;post to components&quot; so that the PO receipts will be made for the BOM items and inventorizes it. In this method, purchase order is used as a proxy for cycle counting order.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
