We created a new Cost price calculation code for the year 2010 and used that new code in session Calculate Cost Prices (ticpr2210m000) to revalue some items. Everything went good except we are seeing some strange costs on some manufactured items. On some manufactured items, only operations costs are included in their final cost. All material costs (part of their BOM) are excluded from the final costs! Any ideas what might be causing this? <br />

Appreciate your help.<br />

Actually, the problem was with the calculation method that was using to run this session. When I ran it with &quot;Top-Down&quot; (instead of Bottom-Up), everything worked out fine.<br />
