<br />
Our team is in charge of encoding the new prices in the system. Other department will approve the encoded price and cost calculate.<br />
<br />
There were items that were not cost calculated (Missed) which in effect caused Price variances. <br />
<br />
I would like to know how I can filter in the BAAN system the items that were approved/cost calculated. Hope someone could help assist me to do the works.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />
