<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kingson</div><div class="date">19th October 2007, 04:37</div></div><div class="posttext">dear all,<br />
I want to set a privilege like this:<br />
1. Some roles or employees can use the operation of &quot;Approve by Engineering&quot; in Manufacturing\Engineering Data Mangement\Engineering Items and EBOMs\Engineering Item Revision(tiedm1100m000) and some can't.This operation is not a session, so I don't know how to control.<br />
2. In the same place, when I set a user can use this session(Engineering Item Revision(tiedm1100m000)), how to set they can't use Finalize operation? This is a session, it have a form, and not the same as point 1.<br />
thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

You hit the weekend after you posted your case and as is the case with all human beings, they religiously follow their weekends. So dont worry about your writing skills as i understood what you were trying to say..(i guess!!)<br />
 <br />
I am not too much into Ln but i checked out the session you mentioned in your thread. So here, according to me is one way of doing your query 1.. <br />
1) Customize this session or should i say copy this session to your own VRC(for safety purpose). When copying try to change the session number from tiedm1100m000 to something like tiedm11xxm000..<br />
2) Compile it..<br />
3) Right click on the session that you just created in step1 and select &quot;Form Commands&quot;. (It would be somewhere in the middle of the right click menu)<br />
4) In this new window you can see all the commands thats available on this form. <br />
5) Try to delete the commands you dont want to appear on this session(like Function:Approve by Engineering) and Save &amp; Exit followed by Compile.<br />
6) Next, you got to attach this session to the menus of the people who you dont want to give access to Approve. <br />
Trial and error would get you your results...I am not sure of whether there can be restrictions put on Functions in Ln using the User Authorization sessions. If it can be done like that then you could go in that direction..<br />
 <br />
As far as your second query is concerned you could put a restriction on tiedm3240m000 using Session Authorizations by Sesson {ttams3132m000} and that ought to do the trick. <br />
 <br />
If this isnt &quot;The&quot; solution for your problem, it surely is a Start..<br />

Thanks for your advice.<br />
I'm testing the second query, I copy a role in Role Data(ttams2100m000), then in the form that in Menu\Specific\Sessions Authorizations\Sessions Authorizations by Session(ttams3132m000), I set the edm1230m000 and emd3240m000 are No Authorization, but the user also can use the function.<br />
The user use DEM menu while login.<br />
<br />
btw, what's the useful of FULLDB and FULLSESS? I found thay are almost all the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">23rd October 2007, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Kingson,<br />
For all that i know of Ln(or even in Baan4), you cant restrict the Functions in the same way you restrict the Sessions..The only way, according to me, is to hide this Function from the user. <br />
I hope someone who has a bit of knowledge on Ln authorization could help you out with the usefullness of FULLDB and FULLSESS. If you have help files restored on your server then you could find the usefullness from the help file..<br />
 <br />

 <br />
Note: Did the suggestion for the first query, on hiding the function in the session, work for you?</div></div><hr />

It can be done directly in the enterprise process flow or using session tgbrg5223m000</div></div><hr />

<br />
do the business processes must be the root processes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">4th November 2007, 02:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Kingson - By root process I believe you are asking processes found in the repository - Then yes, this is correct.   Find a process in tgbrg5500m000 and open it using the EME (Enterprise Modeler Editor); you can then insert the subapplication on each activity (right click).    It is oftern easier to use the global session tgbrg5223m000 to block subsessions/browsing sessions that you don't want any end user to have - for example you might want to make Company Data Â– tccom0502m000 read only.</div></div><hr />
