<br />
We can report order /operation complete, even if we have not post any material issue.<br />
<br />
We can report order complete more than order quantity.(only pop up message appear).How to prevent this in LN?<br />
<br />
We can input negative quantity  in Material to issue , and also Hours Accounting.<br />
Is that possible to make a user cannot input negative?(we want to set another user who can input negative quantity).Is authorization by user can prevent this?<br />
<br />
Is there any other way to control this?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance<br />

     Ans:  Don't have the space to explain it all here but I suggest you the ffg:<br />
             1.  check/read about  the Reporting Method for Previous Operations field in the Shop Floor Control Parameters (tisfc0100s000) session.. set it to Manual<br />
              2. also read about &quot;count point&quot;... you can set selected preliminary operations as count point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: We can input negative quantity in Material to issue , and also Hours Accounting.<br />
Is that possible to make a user cannot input negative?(we want to set another user who can input negative quantity).Is authorization by user can prevent this?<br />
<br />
Is there any other way to control this?<br />
<br />
Ans: I do not see any problem if user can input negative qty as well as inputting positive qty. in the material to issue session. <br />
     <br />
      just ensure that once negative issuance is initiated, storage list should not be automatically &quot;put-away&quot; in order to control the posting (return) to inventory..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
I havent read about this count point, but thats a good idea, I will test this function.<br />
Yes, but our customer have problem with their user, it seem the user oftenly do a mistake.<br />
<br />
If too much flexibility, i think we need to make some bound to prevent user to inpur wrong quantity.<br />
