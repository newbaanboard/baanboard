   Instead of cancelling or deleting these production orders, cant you just &quot;Report Complete&quot; &amp; subsequently close the oriders with 0 issues and 0 quantities?<br />

<br />
Good Morning,<br />
<br />
Thanks for ur valuable advise for mine. But, there is a problem in the LN 6.1. We can't close production order at 0 (ZERO) quantity. For Completing the Process of Production Orders minimum 1 (one) qty must be completed.<br />
<br />
I think, these production orders are related to the FY 2006, 2007. and each production have the Subcontracting Operations. Few Production orders have their partial delvery of Subcontracting Operations. Their Purchase Order also stay in the distribution module.<br />
<br />
I think that can we change the status of these production order through SQL.<br />
<br />
We Don't want to create the inventory from these prod. Ord.<br />
<br />
Now, u r requested to please advise me and suggest any woraround for this.<br />
<br />
I will be apprreciated from ur response<br />
<br />
thanks &amp; regards<br />

    I am not too familiar with how Ln deals with production orders and so i am assuming that the principle behind it is more or less same as of earlier versions. <br />
<br />
So the situation is such that there are a few partially delivered subcontracting orders and few production orders with materials waiting to be issued. <br />
First, you could remove the balance or back orders for the subcontracting order effectively closing the subcon order. Watch out for integration entries, if any (especially when the partially delivered orders are not invoiced yet).<br />
Next, in the production order remove the quantities to issue of the materials so that it frees up the allocation. <br />
That would ideally leave only the production order to tackle and thats where i get off the train.. as i am not sure how to deal with it. If you try closing the order, it would post actual operation costs (courtesy partially delivered subcontracting order) to finance. If the first two suggestions work, then is there any problem with leaving the production order in the status they are?<br />

I think this how it used to work in Baan IV. One can report quantity rejected, so that everything will come as production variance.<br />
