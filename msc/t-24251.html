<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothy Clinton</div><div class="date">9th June 2005, 22:46</div></div><div class="posttext">It is for product Families such as mountain bikes but I have 5 seperate mountain bikes I make and sell. I may forecast at the model level and 35% of my sales is in model 1, 20% in model 2, 22% model 3 10% model 4, 13% for Modal 5. there is a lot of other fuctionality that goes into this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anubhav.bansal</div><div class="date">11th June 2005, 13:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Timothy for an overview but i have tryed on it and following is the case study i followed:<br />
<br />
1.I prepared a product family 1 .<br />
2.Then defined another product family 2 in the &quot;Planning Bill of material&quot; as 50 % .<br />
3.Then for product family 2 in the &quot;Planning Bill of material &quot; i defined the actual manufactured item let say XY.<br />
4.Now i went to the Maintain MPS and get the record for productfamily1 and give the forecast for a period let say 100 .<br />
5.Now i run the session Disaggregate Master Production Schedule <br />
(timps3260s000) for this productfamily1 by giving all the necessary input and checking the check box disaggregate the demand forecast as yes.<br />
6.By the above session it give me the 50 as forecast for the productfamily2 .<br />
7.now i again do the step 5 for product family2 .<br />
8.But in this case it is not giving me the forecast for the actual manufacttured item XY.....<br />
<br />
ALL THE ABOVE PRODUCT FAMILY AND MANUFACTURED ITEM HAS NO IVENTORY AT ALL THESE ALL THE NEWLY CREATED JUST FOR THIS CASE STUDY....<br />
<br />
So here is the question, i think it should give me the forecast for XY also for that particular period???<br />
<br />
and ya if possible please guide me some of the case study which i can try on MPS for getting a clear funda on Multi level .</div></div><hr />
