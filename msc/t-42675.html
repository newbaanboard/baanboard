<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">9th October 2007, 07:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to recreate yesterdays data all over again if you were to restore the day-before-yesterdays(7/10) backup? This considering you do take daily baan table dumps.<br />
 <br />
If not i think you would have to call in Infor Support on this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gatesplayback</div><div class="date">9th October 2007, 07:47</div></div><div class="posttext">We do have backups, but we do it as per database and not per table. is it possible to extract specific tables from the database dump. We can not restore the whole database coz theirs only one affected company, and restoring the whole database would affect a lot.<br />
<br />
What are the possible causes why we have this problem? as we can recall last friday 10/5 we have network problems for this company. but the problem is we dont have an audit trail for us to know if there where processes that was affected by the network problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
is only this one item concerned?<br />
If yes, I would do the following:<br />
a)create seq. dump of table with field seperator for all tables of this company<br />
b)substitute &quot;@00000000000145&quot; with &quot;FHFGL2&quot; in all files (!! make sure you don't have the token sequence &quot;@00000000000145&quot; at other places, where you don't want to substitute it !!)<br />
c)create tables from sequential dump<br />
<br />

Norbert<br />
<br />
P.S.: Contact Infor anyway, it should be interesting to find out how this could happen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gatesplayback</div><div class="date">9th October 2007, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">there are several items that have this problem. based on Baan Infor suggestion we will reconfigure tiitm and then run rebuild inventory.<br />
<br />
also, this problem was cause when there were financial processing and out network was unstable that causes intermetent connection.<br />
<br />
thanks for the suggestions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">9th October 2007, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt just bank on my database backup alone. For the long run it would be best if you start using Baan Backup as well where you have the provision to backup per company/company tables. Its interesting to note what unstable network connections or problems can create in Baan. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">9th October 2007, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Norbert,<br />
How are you out there? Just a small doubt on what you said...<br />
b)substitute &quot;@00000000000145&quot; with &quot;FHFGL2&quot; in all files <br />
Wont this corrupt the hash keys?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gatesplayback</div><div class="date">15th November 2007, 07:57</div></div><div class="posttext">This was resolve by changing the field tiitm001.reli which equates with tiitm001.item for table ITEMS. Afterwards tiitm100.item was replaced with the baan generated tiitm001.item for containerized item<br />
<br />
According to infor there was probably an update being made for containerized item when something got wrong in our network connection. Baan processing suddenly halted even if the table relationship being made hasn't finish yet.</div></div><hr />
