We are on BaaN IV.<br />
We've dealt with such a problem:<br />
We have 2 manufactured items, say A and B. They have routes and BOMs. On the level let's say 3 in their BOMs we have item C (also manufactured).<br />
We do MRP planning and create SFC-orders for all manufactured items. Now we want to track progress in items A and B (and their components).<br />
BUT:<br />
Finishing SFC-order for item C we want to understand for which &quot;main&quot; item was it manufactured - for A or for B?<br />
<br />
The second part of the problem is - if we want to reduce the quantity of item A how can we distinguish in whish SFC-orders for item C we must reduce quantity?<br />
<br />
How can we do it? Are there any workarounds?<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Yours,</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your suggestion.<br />
<br />
The problem is that when we release SFC-orders we often change the dates (for any reasons) so SFC-orders for item C will have dates different form A anb B order's start.<br />
<br />
Are there any more workarounds? <br />
<br />
Yours,</div></div><hr />
