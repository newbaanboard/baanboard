First I want to say is our company is a print shop.  We manufacture signage for businesses.  Each sign is an item.<br />
- One sheet of plastic will be printed on and could possibly have several different signs printed on it. How would you work this through a production order when only on item can be on a production order.<br />
- We do pick/pack kits.  The end kit is an item that has several items in it.  One customer has several stores that would recieve the kit BUT the kits could contain different amounts of each item depending on the site.  How would a production order be entered to complete these kits?<br />
- I also need to explain that we don't use Baan Sales Orders.  Don't ask.<br />
<br />
- any input would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks tnzabo</div></div><hr />

Baan IV (either ERP LN) was not made to work with this kind of task. It was only made to solve discrete and process manfacturing orders, with one finished good (or with its co-products).<br />
<br />
It´s the same problem experienced in metal stamping operations or when you need to do the cutting plan for any boxes, for instance.<br />
<br />
You probably need an specific software to solve it (cutting) and you open, register and close the production orders in Baan, just for move stocks and calculate costs.<br />

<br />
Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Make a Production order  for sign item. Make this as a Lot item. The RM should be sheet. When the FG are completed, complete it in Lots and give each Lot the item code or Sign code that you ar completing to make it unique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fsanches</div><div class="date">8th September 2008, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it could be done. But remenber that envolves a procedure solution that requires to create conversion codes to understand RM codes. It´s not a Baan´s standars process.<br />
