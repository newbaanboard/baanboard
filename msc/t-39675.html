<br />
We Face a serious problem with the production department, because they prepare the FG Production order directly. But, we use the FOUR stages of WIP in our production system. If, the process done through step by step by user, all RM and WIP also consume.<br />
<br />
We have much more raw material in the system but actual is very less.<br />
<br />
Now i requested to all of you, please suggest the solution for this problem.<br />
<br />
we wants, before prepare the IInd stage production order in the system, the first stage of production should be completed by the user. In case of FG production order, we make the FG production order when all related WIP for that ITEM should be complete.<br />
<br />
I hope you provide me a suitable solution for this type of problem or how we can put these type of restriction.<br />
<br />
thanks &amp; regards<br />

The four stages can be entered as four tasks or operations. Once you setup in this fashion, each stage has to be completed to receive the FG. You can even have material backflushing on for each tasks so that the raw materials are consumed with the completion of each stage..<br />

<br />
we are also using routing and backflashing, but due to non avilability of his BOM Material we can also complete the production process and item sent to the finished store.<br />
<br />
But, we want, if any shortage of BOM Material (only WIP) in the system, we can not complete the production order. It is beneficial to us for planning the MRP and MPS Effectively and there is no variation in the physical and the system.<br />

What you are saying holds true in a real production scenario where you may not get to manufacture any FG without consuming the materials. Unfortunately, i have yet to see a block in place in Standard Baan Production Order which prevents the user from receiving FG if the materials arent completely or process-wise issued. Therefore, i could suggest some sort of customization within or outside(AFS) Baan.<br />

Before reporting the quantity on production order do a check. If your BOM is in accurate, then I guess your costing is also in accurate. You can always issue items to a prodution order even if it is not in BOM. Adding a check is a very simple customization.<br />

Dear DK,<br />
Why should you be bothered of the sequence of data entry by the production<br />
 guys ? The global planning runs take care of all the mismatches in data entry time, as long as your cutoffs are correct. Best solution is to centralise Data Entry work ( which I did ).<br />
<br />
More Raw Material in the system means that backflusing is low meaning-&gt; Incorrect Data Entry / incorrect BOM / incorrect routing etc. ( you have to find the exact reason ).<br />
Another reason can be excess inventory transfers from Raw Materail Stores, but chances of this happening are slim ( there are stores guys who count the material before giving to Production guys).<br />
<br />
Refer to the thread which has &quot;Production Receipt&quot; in it's name in this forum, which addresses the same problem.<br />
<br />
If you put this kind of a restriction, you might have problems in getting your Finished product out of the door.</div></div><hr />
