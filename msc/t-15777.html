<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">26th June 2004, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">We are an engineer to order company and continue to have problems with Engineering issuing ECO (Engineering Change Orders) for project (PCS) BOMs after we have already release the production order to SFC.  This means that someone has to manually update SFC materials information.  Has anyone developed an automated process for updating the SFC materials based on an ECO from EDM (Engineering Data Management)?<br />
<br />
What were are looking for is a session or sessions that will take the changes that were made to the PCS BOM (including phantoms) and update the SFC materials or give us an error message if the materials have already been issued.<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very tricky requirement you are asking for. The shopfloor planner has accepted the order by releasing the order with his current BOM and Routing.<br />
Now you want to change these automaticly, which can impact the shopfloor planning significant.<br />
When I was a shopfloor planner, I would not allow automaticly.<br />
Stil I can imaging your requirement, but I think the only right way is to release the order as late as possible, thus when engineering is ready. When customers require a change afterwards, the order can be changed manually. For new orders for the same item, they will pick-up the changed BOM and routing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">3rd July 2004, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Your comments are quite true, but our management still wants this automated process because we canÂ’t always wait until engineering is complete before we start manufacturing.  <br />
<br />
What makes our situation even more difficult is that we use a lot of phantom mfg items so trying to update the shop floor control materials list is even harder.  So, if anyone had automated this process any information would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
