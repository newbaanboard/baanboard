<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">g√ºnther</div><div class="date">17th December 2007, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to know if the behaviour on your system gives identical results:<br />
* add a new operation to a production order; choose one  of your tasks with task type 'Machine'; the man/machine ratio should be set to 1.0. Lets say we take a Nr of Resource Units of 2.0. <br />
* After that, have a look at ticst002. You should see a new record containing your production order, operation and a sequence number of 0 (i.e. estimated hours and costs).<br />
* I think you will see both Man hours = 2 and Machine hours = 2 (both get Nr of Resource Units).<br />
<br />
And that's my problem. I think that we had some time ago a different behaviour with Man hours = 0 and Machine hours = 2.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, baan calculates the operation hours as sum of man hours and machine hours, which would result in 4 hours (instead of the 2 hours I entered).<br />
I see this e.g. in the session tipcs3462m000 print actual cost price by project (production order of above linked to a project).<br />
<br />
Can anybody explain me that, please?</div></div><hr />
