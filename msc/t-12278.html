Is there any parametar that solve my problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wizard</div><div class="date">22nd July 2003, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan you can close a production order  only if all  components on the material list are already consumed.<br />
If your SFC order is already closed, but some materials must be issued, then this is a bug to be notified to Baan Support.<br />
<br />
Viceversa you can issue the materials and post hours on a SFC order completed. The materials requested by the SFC order create a planned transaction and a requirement for MRP<br />

Thanks for yours answers. We are solved our problem. Problem is in table tdinv150 which are for planed transaction for items.  We are update that table with session tdinv0250m000 Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions. Beafore that we are update filds t_issu and t_subd in table ticst001 on 0 for orders witch have status closed. After that MRP give to us corect results.</div></div><hr />

tdinv0253m000 corrects the problem, but doesn't solve it. tdinv150 can get corrupted on changing the ordered quantity in production orders under some conditions. For this problem, solution 161858 has been made.<br />
