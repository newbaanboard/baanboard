<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigfoot</div><div class="date">25th February 2008, 19:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a reporting query for PCS Hours. <br />
<br />
For current PCS Hours reporting I can get hours from hours input and rates from operation rates, and generate a report using Crystal (or equivalent). <br />
<br />
However we do change our rates annually, when this happens the rates in table ticpr150 do not have a time stamp. <br />
<br />
My result is that all hours become valued at current rates (when using crystal). <br />
<br />
Is there a table I can use that holds the operation rates that are assigned to tasks that get posted to a PCS project... that records the rates in force at a particular time. Or an hours table that also includes the cost? <br />
<br />
:confused:<br />
<br />

We are using PCS project in ERP LN 6.1 which I feel may be similar to ERP 5.0C. In ERP LN 6.1 no of units (hours) and total amount for processed hours get registered in PCS financial transactions by project session tipcs3500m000. You can have data for reporting from the table related to such session. However please note that this table does not store operation rates but stores no of units and total amount from which one can have operation rate calculated for each transaction.</div></div><hr />
