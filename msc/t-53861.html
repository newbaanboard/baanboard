You can make the other WH also as excisable and give the same ecc no it it as mentioned in the RM Wh.<br />
<br />
I hope this will serve your purpose.<br />

Hi Navin <br />
<br />
Thanks for ur suggestion, as we make SFC wh to excisable with same ECC no than my problem is resolved.<br />
<br />

<br />
As you transfer the material from one W/H to another W/H (both are excisable),<br />
RG23 A/C will automatically get updated.<br />
<br />
One Issue Transaction - Ship-From W/H<br />
One Receipt Transaction - Ship-To W/H<br />
<br />
You can validate the same from the RG 23 A/C Register.<br />
