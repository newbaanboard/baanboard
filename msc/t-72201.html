<br />
hardly the same question as in the threat from 8 years ago:<br />

<br />
Though, the logic how Infor works is clear. But, does anyone else have the same problem or the same structure of BOMs. <br />
In short: phantom items where the items of their BOM should be distributed on the operations of the parent item? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th September 2019, 23:31</div></div><div class="posttext">In our case all of the items on the phantom should be issued to the operation on the phantom on the next higher.  So if the phantom part had op 50 then all its components went to op 50.  I think our phantoms are designed that way - not 100% sure.  But we have phantoms thru out a BOM listing calling for specific parts. Then again we only build some numbers of units.<br />
<br />
It almost sounds like you have what our other sites have - it is a phantom, but the part is actually contains the word &quot;-USAGE&quot; in it.  These are a list of parts and quantities they need to build like 100's of items.  They just issue all the parts to the line at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PeterPr_0</div><div class="date">2nd October 2019, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the reply. But our structure is different.<br />
<br />
Most of our phantoms are somewhat technical entities. E.g.: For an option we have several parts of our machines in different places and on different operations of production. For example: We build the basic articles at the first operation and the finalization at the 4th operation. But all these articles are in on item with BOM which is set to phantom in its parent item. And we would like to distribute the parts to the operations maintained in the BOM of the phantom, not all on the operation of the phantom itself...<br />
<br />
We know that Infor is not working like this with phantoms. But does anyone else have this problem? or this kind of structure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd October 2019, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Are your phantoms used on multiple next higher assemblies?  Was just wondering if you could make the phantom routing look like the next higher.  Our phantoms typically do not have routings.  Not sure this would work - but just a thought.<br />
<br />
The only other thing I can think of is once they release to wip going to maintain the estimated materials to update the operations.  But this sounds even more complicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmueskle</div><div class="date">10th October 2019, 14:00</div></div><div class="posttext">We have quite the same topic in our BOM structure. Since triton and today also in InforLN 10.x we are using a customization to handle that. Once the production order explodes the BOM, the original operation is written to a local table. When the system has finished that, a DAL method reads this table and changes the estimated material records. Works fine.</div></div><hr />
