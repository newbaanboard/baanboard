Is there a possibility to exclude blocked sales orders (e.g. outside margin) from the MRP run and to prevent that Planned MRP Purchase Orders are created for these SO's ?<br />

Not the perfect solution, but, like I said, I think this is how we handled it at a client site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In BaaN Iv c4, this functionality was not there, whenever you run the MRP planning engine system will consider all the Sales orders.<br />
there was no check whether the Sales order was blocked or not.<br />
Even you don't find any message in MRP exception messages.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to include in MRP then exclude these orders by changing the Nettable warehouse in Sales Order line to Non-nettable warehouse.<br />
