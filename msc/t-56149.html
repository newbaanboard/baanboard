<br />
Whenever any work started on the Production order (Issues of any material to production Order or Operation completed) the status will be changed from released to Active.<br />
<br />
Once you do the report orders complete the quantity will be posted to inventory and the status will be changed from active to Completed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">11th August 2009, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone posted above, when hours are either reported or backflushed, the status goes from released to active.  It does not necessarily get done when the order is reported complete depending on how you issue hours and the settings of your parameters to backflush (if you do), whether automatic, manual or interactively.  The hours are the driving factor no matter if your materials are issued.<br />
<br />
When the you report the order Complete in Report Production Orders Complete, the status changes to Complete.  I think there are flags in both hours accounting and Report Operations Complete to change the status as well.  In this case, it's the flag Complete Yes or No that makes the change in status regardless of whether or not you issue any quantity complete.  The order will stay active unless you change the flag to Complete = Yes.</div></div><hr />
