<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AAMTBAAN</div><div class="date">11th April 2013, 10:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if it is possible to do the following:<br />
<br />
Say I have (text-)features 1, 2 and 3.<br />
in the input constraints I put:<br />
<br />
feature 1:<br />
  [1] = 3<br />
<br />
feature 2:<br />
  [2] = 1<br />
<br />
feature 3:<br />
  [3] = [[2]] + 1<br />
<br />
expected value in [3] is 4.<br />
<br />
In general, can anyone point me to some documentation on the formal language that is supported in PCF constraints, so that I can sort out these kind of questions myself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">11th April 2013, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">In pcf constraints all of your features should be surrounded by square brackets, so shouldn't your last one be:<br />
<br />
[3] = [2] + [1]<br />
<br />
Also have you defined these features in tipcf0150m000 as Integers or Fractions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AAMTBAAN</div><div class="date">11th April 2013, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your response.<br />
<br />
The features are defined as integers.<br />
<br />
No, I do not mean [3] = [2] + [1].<br />
<br />
I'd like to achieve the following in words: take the name of the feature that is stored in the value of feature 2, and use the value of that addressed feature to do some calculations.<br />
<br />
Thus:<br />
[3] = [[2]] + 1  &lt;=&gt; ?<br />
[3] = [1] + 1     &lt;=&gt; ?<br />
[3] = 3 + 1        &lt;=&gt;<br />
[3] = 4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">11th April 2013, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to do. In your first example I would expect the value of [3] to be 1 + 1 = 2 That is, the value of feature [1] plus digit 1.<br />
Addressing your reply, if you want to store the name of a feature in another feature then the feature would need to be setup as type alphanumeric?<br />
<br />
example:<br />
If you want [3] to contain the name of [2] then [3] would be alphanumeric?<br />
That is if the value of [3] should be &quot;[2]&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AAMTBAAN</div><div class="date">11th April 2013, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me put it in another way.<br />
<br />
What does the compiler expect between the bracket operator [] ?<br />
That is, what is in X in [X] ?<br />
<br />
If the compiler expects X to be a fixed integer constant, <br />
then what I want cannot be done, I guess.<br />
<br />
But if the compiler expects X to be an expression,<br />
then I could, instead of addressing a feature directly (e.g. [12345678]), address a feature indirectly (e.g. [ [11111111] ]).<br />
<br />
The point is that I cannot anywhere find a reference manual on the formal language used in PCF constraints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">11th April 2013, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to have a short guide but I can't find it.<br />
<br />
My take on this is that inside the constraints, [X] means the feature X.<br />
So if you perform an action upon it you are addressing the value of feature X.<br />
<br />
[X] * 5 means multiply the value stored inside feature X by 5 etc.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AAMTBAAN</div><div class="date">12th April 2013, 01:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Given your answer you still seem to miss my point. Perhaps it is just a language barrier. I am Dutch and perhaps not capable (enough) to express myself clearly.<br />
<br />
I understand, of course, that [X] * 5 means multiply the value stored inside feature X by 5. I wanted to find out if I could actually nest [X]'s to use them like pointers in C.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it doesn't matter, because this afternoon I had the chance to test it at a customer of mine. The constraint compiler doesn't agree with my way of thinking :)<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for taking the time to help me.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

 <br />
I think that the syntax of the PCF is limited, but if you're using the compiler mode of the PCF, you could use <br />
 <br />
!your_own_function()<br />
 <br />
and do the address or index calculations by your own. Maybe get.var() or get.indexed.var() will help?<br />
 <br />
Regards günther</div></div><hr />

<br />
first, you need to run the PCF in compiler, not in interpreter mode. Then you have the full possibilities of Baan 4GL available.<br />
<br />
you can use function lval(...) to convert a string into a numerical (long) value<br />
you can use the expr.compile() functions to analyse strings as numeric expressions<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />
