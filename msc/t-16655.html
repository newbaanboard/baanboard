<br />
I didn't notice in documentation that Baan SCScheduler can be implemented with Baan 5.0c. In manual for Integration ToolKit 2.2 for Baan SCScheduler I didn't find a word about implementing Scheduler with Baan 5.0c.<br />
<br />
It is strange, because in some sessions of Baan 5.0c I have checkboxes with &quot;Planned with SCS&quot;.<br />

<br />
There is a customer in Belgium that uses the scheduler in combination with Baan5c. For more information, i suggest you contact SSA-Global in Barnelveld.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FoxxyPlanner</div><div class="date">14th June 2006, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Our company is planning on purchasing an advanced planning and scheduling system that will link up with Baan 5c.  We are currently talking with Baan but we would really like to talk to someone or even actually meet with the person for a live demo of Baan 5c using the Supply Chain Scheduler (SCS).  Really if anything I would appreciate a referral to a company within the United States that currently uses 5c and SCS together. Any help would be most appreciated.</div></div><hr />
