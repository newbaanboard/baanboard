<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Eden</div><div class="date">10th April 2008, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Unit effectvity is a huge area and not really able to explain its use in a board like this. I suggest you look at the documentation for this.<br />
<br />
In our case, we use UEF to track (peg) orders and items through the system.<br />
<br />
Sales order has a EU # and this is related to all other orders (production and purchase) in the system.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hemant.k</div><div class="date">11th April 2008, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Sir would please mail me document related to this or provide me any link.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">16th April 2008, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Think of Unit Effectivity as a light configurator.  As previously posted, UE can be used to peg orders, although if used strictly for this purpose, there are other options.  <br />
<br />
One of the real values of UE is to limit BOM / Routing maintenance when alternative components or operations are possible and do not adversely effect the standard cost.  Examples might be colors, finishes, labels, packaging etc...  On the routing side, examples might be modifying operations (or the routing itself) based on things like specific work instructions or slight variations in lead time components.  Again, be aware of standard cost ramifications.<br />
<br />
As stated above UE functionality is deep and offers many possibilities to handle situations that were a pain in the butt in prior versions.  For example, UE allows me to produce different items (within limits) on the same production order...effectively co-products.<br />
<br />
There are many other applications.  This is really nice functionality that has been thought out well.  I have tested extensively...pushing unit effective controlled planning through 20+ BOM levels and verifying the results via pegging (that is pegging outside of UE) with 100% accuracy.</div></div><hr />
