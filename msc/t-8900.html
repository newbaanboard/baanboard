Say we have a phantom subassembly measured in kg that we would like to subcontract. Now this subassembly is sent to and received from our subcontractor in rolls, and hence we would like to specify the price for the subcontracting purchase order in term of rolls. Do you know of any work around for this?<br />
<br />
So far we found out that BaanERP will always interpret the subcontracting rate as a rate per measurement unit of subcontracted sub assembly, in this case kg.<br />

Baan Support just confirmed that our requirements can't be covered by standard BaanERP features. I guess we'd have to make do with completely separate production order and purchase order. Probably we'll put the production order and its operation number in Ref B of the purchase order.<br />
<br />
Any other idea, guys? Thanks<br />
