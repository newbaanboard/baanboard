<br />
We are getting this message while sessioon timrp1210m00 is running.<br />
<br />
We have checked  all BOMs but couldn't find   reason of this problem.<br />
<br />
message   :  tibom1411a <br />
                (  Loop found in multi-level BoM  , caused by manufactured Item )<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have idea about this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance <br />

Run the session Update Low Level Codes and Detect Loops (tibom1213m000).  This should show you the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have the same problem but, I ran the session mentioned here and does not correct the problem. It does give me a report with three parts with loop but doesn't correct them.<br />
<br />
I checked the Multi-Level BOM for the three items and does not have loop under them.<br />
<br />
On the Item master stands &quot;Loop&quot; on Net Change LLCD. The Item in the BOM is Low Level 3(three other items above it) but in the Item masters reads Low Level Code 0.<br />
<br />
What can I do?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

Now to correct the issues, you may please run the session Print where used item in multi level BOM for all these 3 items and you would come to know where they are getting used. It need not be that these items are just one level below another, it could be possible that they would be say 3 or 4 or may be 10 level below. Print where used item would let you know the anomalies (again this would be the report).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I removed the loop by removing the item that was causing the loop. However; the user expired it with the effectivity dates. So the item it doesn't supposed to be called and the loop should not be there since the item was expired.<br />
<br />
What I see this session tibom1213m000 (we have tibom1213m10b A&amp;D) does not check for effectivity dates and tags the items with loop regadless of effecitivy. I entered a loop with an item effective and expired the same date in the past (March 10, 2015 both dates) and the session gives me a loop.<br />
<br />
I just want to make sure that people here instead of expire items in a situation like this, better they create a new item.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

It is better to physically remove those conflicting child items from the BOM. The reason being MRP logic would not look at the effective dates! The logic for this is, you may receive an order for a particular revision number which had this conflicting item as a child and then there would be again an issue while generating MRP orders for this revision number.</div></div><hr />
