<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pawelskij</div><div class="date">10th June 2009, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Is anyone aware of a report that can print to show Purchasing if demand changed?  I.E.  In our old system, we used to have an &quot;Action message report&quot; that told the buyer if they needed to cancel a purchase order, expedite, de-expedite, etc.<br />
<br />
This was all based on the demand in the system and the actions taken by Sales the prior day.  So, if Sales canceled a sales order then Purchasing would be advised to cancel the purchase order.  If production changed a date on a production order then the system would prompt purchasing to expedite or de-expedite.<br />
<br />
Anything like this available with BaaN?  Maybe Rescheduling messages?  How do we set the system up so that we get these messages on a report?<br />
