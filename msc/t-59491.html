<br />
I have quite a few planned purchase orders, which i need to group under a single Purchase order while transferring. But when i do this way, it creates multiple PO. It creats PO based on the transaction date , like every minute new PO's getting created. <br />
<br />
Can anyone let me know the setup which needs to be doen for grouping of Purchase orders per supplier / item etc. <br />
<br />
Thx for your reply<br />

The purchase orders are created based on the By from Business Partner. so just check whether your planned orders has same business partner. If it is then it will generate single purchase order for that Business Partner.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply. <br />
<br />
All my planned orders belong to Same Supplier, but stil it creates new PO for every new minute. SInce my network is very slow, if i have 4-5 planned orders it takes 2 -3 minutes to get done. So it creates 2 / 3 PO's based on the minute. Any parameter settings to be done to group under Supplier. <br />

Thx for your response</div></div><hr />

They told me that there's no way you can group planned purchase orders for the same supplier into one single purchase order.<br />
Not sure though if this feature is available in LN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmurphy2650</div><div class="date">11th November 2010, 02:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried transferring a range of Planned Purchase Orders (for the same Buy-from BP) to Purchase Orders in LN FP6 and they combined into one Purchase Order as long as the following fields on the Planned Order were the same:<br />
<br />
Purchase Order Type <br />
Buyer <br />
Planner<br />
<br />
If any of the fields were different, separate Purchase Orders were created.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

As Mike says.. it works in LN FP3 too.. Further there is functionality called &quot;cummingling&quot;. Where you can club multiple POs into one PO. You can use this as standby. <br />

thanks<br />
