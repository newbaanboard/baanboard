Please can you help me.<br />
After I done the Archive Project (tipcs2260m000), the Maintain Project Status (tipcs2102m000) show it as archive. System do not allowed deletion of the project number and retaining it eventhough the number is succesful archived.<br />
<br />
As years go by the Project numbers are full. We are force and need to recycle back the project number as we follow the number as per our overseas HQ project numbering assignment. <br />
So I would like to remove/delete the &quot;archived&quot; project data but system do not allow with &quot;Deleting not allowed due to project status&quot; which is not &quot;free&quot; status.<br />
<br />
Is there any method or worst scenario to delete using GTM but without corrupting the data?<br />

<br />
&quot;This means that all project data has been stored in archive files and removed from the original files. Only the project is retained for retrieving data from the archives.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last line to be noted. I think what you have to do is an archiving at a company level which i am sure is provided by Baan...<br />
