I'm trying to change the Start Remainder Date on the Last operation of Production Order Planning. This date when changed in the planning, also affects the (Re)-Plan Delivery Date on the Production Order. <br />
<br />
I'm trying to achieve this using FS. I'm able to update the date in most cases.. but in some cases... FS comes back with an error as mentionend below<br />
&quot;<br />
Cal 001 , 001 , 001, Av. Type PR01 - \n Insufficient Availability defined-A00000017Sales Order/Pos A00000034/10<br />
&quot;<br />
(The production Order is still in Released status.. and the last operation St. Rem Date is 07/14/2004. This am changing to 05/01/2004).<br />
<br />
But If I go to that planning and manually change the date, it changes it for the same above order and operation, without any error/mesg at all.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong here... and what does the above error mean ?<br />
<br />
I dont know if this question might be for the FS forum.. but I guess its more related to Manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">7th June 2004, 19:54</div></div><div class="posttext">That worked !! Thanks a lot for the help.<br />
I was not considering the utc date format and my number of days from that field was totally out of whack, susbequently not being on the calender.<br />
I've corrected it now and its working fine.<br />
Thanks again Tom<br />
