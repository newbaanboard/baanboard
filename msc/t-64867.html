<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rickashaw</div><div class="date">28th October 2013, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Goal:  <br />
To delete PO lines and then cancel order:<br />
<br />
Background:<br />
Purchasing requested that I open PO lines so they can be deleted.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
Several items have been received against purchase order<br />
<br />
Steps taken:<br />
1.  The items were reflected as delivered, but rejected and with a Backorder<br />
2.  Back orders zeroed out in session tdpur4121m000 (Maintain approvals) and tdpur4130m000 (Maintain Backorders).<br />
3.  Could not delete line items (status = A = Approved) <br />
     (error message = Inventory already taken for Inspection)<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Can these line items be deleted and how?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

You can delete this, but it is not something that Baan offers. You will have to do this at table level.<br />
1. First remove tdpur045 records<br />
2. Delete record from tdpur041<br />
Now you can remove purchase order header from Standard Baan session.<br />
After removing tdpur045 if you use purchase order line session it will remove the record,but then it will mess up tdinv150, tdinv001, tiitm001 and also supplier order balance.<br />

<br />
It seems this is something that may prove more problematic than beneficial and not worth the risk.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">18th November 2013, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">In BAAN IV c3, there is a session tdpur4223m000 - Process Delivered Purchase Orders. It has an option to &quot;Delete Order Data&quot;.<br />
<br />
You may want to read the session help for this session and then test it in a non-production environment to see if what the session does achieves what you have in mind. <br />
<br />
Read the session help first.</div></div><hr />
