        Does anyone know when the changes made to standard routing will get applied to the production planning on Planned production orders for those items?<br />
<br />
        I have couple of productions order for assemblies. When these production orders were created, this item had the wrong routing. After the routing was corrected on these items, I re-ran the MRP (both net change and regen) but its not updating the production planning data.<br />
<br />
	Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I dont think it would change the existing shop floor order plannings even though they are in a planned status. <br />
would it be possible to delete these sfc orders and let MRP re-plan them so that you can transfer them back ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">22nd April 2004, 09:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Once a production order is raised, the standard routing is copied to production planning data. Changes in standard routing do not affect production planning data. This is standard functionality (for a good reason). The MRP also makes no changes to routing data of production orders.<br />
<br />
What's wrong with your routing? Maybe a manual change of the production planning data is applicable. Or you take AFS into consideration..?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janneman</div><div class="date">22nd April 2004, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Routing is not changed on SFC orders when standard routing is changed into the rou module. As previously mentioned, for a good reason.<br />
3 options are available to modify the routing on SFC orders<br />
1.   Manuall change on the SFC order<br />
2.   Delete the planned orders and new planned MRP orders will be created next MRP run, transfer these to SFC.<br />
3.   Reprocess the SFC orders (tisfc1203m000), then the changed BOM en Routing will be picked up, and order is newly planned based on the new data. (This is a BaanV option, do not know if it is available in BaanIV too.)<br />
<br />
Option 3 is my choice.</div></div><hr />
