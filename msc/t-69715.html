the task field in routing tirou003.tano is a 4 character numeric field. We have reached the maximum number of 9999 tasks. Has anyone had this issue and how did you resolve it? Has anyone got any suggestions on how to increase this? Is it possible to change it to alpha numeric giving over 1.5 million?</div></div><hr />

We  only use about 127 tasks. Not sure about 5 or ln.  My first thought was to review the number of tasks you have - make sure no overlap or something you could consolidate.  If you change the length of task - everywhere it is used has to be changed and recompiled.  Not something I would want to undertake.</div></div><hr />
