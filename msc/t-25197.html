However in session tihra1101m000 we are only able to enter 'yes' or 'no' in field tihra100.opcp, a zoom is not available.<br />
Do we miss something, perhaps a parameter?<br />
<br />
Thanks for some advice<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">27th September 2005, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">The field opcp shows a drop down Yes/No option in tihra1101m000.  The fact that a zoom option was attached on the Form was probably a development mistake/try that was never removed, you can't zoom out from an enumerated yes/no type field. <br />
<br />
What it indicates is if you want to mark that order complete, along with any quantities reported.  This will not directly hit Report Operations Complete, you first have to 'Process Hours Accounting', then it will update the operations with the quantities completed/rejected from Hours Accounting, and complete the operation if the flag is checked as yes.  An error report should print if not.<br />
<br />
Does that answer your question?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nikos1</div><div class="date">28th September 2005, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, thank you very much.<br />
<br />
We hoped that there is a way to report previous operations complete by just handling the last one with setting complete to 'yes'.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

When you try to report complete from Hours Accounting, it will not update the previous operations.   It will only do that from the Report Op Complete session, where you are asked the question.<br />
<br />
We are a development/consulting firm.  We have simple, low cost stand alone Baan session that takes Quantities/Op Complete flag and Hours, then sends the Quantities and Op Complete flag to Rpt. Operations Complete, and the Hours to Hours Accounting.   You may be able to write something similar if you have knowledge of API programming, or contact me if you have any interest in purchasing such a thing.  Ours includes report Production Orders Complete flag, history view, and has a nice streamlined entry session.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using hours accoounting to report operations completion is not a very good idea, specially because the process of those records don't produce the same results of using the process operation completions session.<br />
<br />
Also, sometimes you will process Report order completion before procesing your hours accounting records, and certain validations will not happen like.<br />
<br />
If you have a planned qty of 20 and operation number 30 reports 18 completed 2 rejected and completed operation. Then when you report production order completed it will validate that your reported quantity is less or equal to 18; however if your record is still waiting to be processed in hours accounting NO validation will occur.<br />
<br />
Feel free to call me if you have any questions or comments. ;) <br />
