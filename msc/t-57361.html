I have found serious issue about pegging relation in FP5.<br />
<br />
&quot;1. Create SO 1  delivery date H (current date) +30 item A qty 1 pcs <br />
2. Generate order planning, and transfer planned order to production order MO1 ,cek the peggin relation ,it will pegged to SO1 <br />
3. Create SO 2 delivery date H (current date or any date which earlier than SO1) , item A qty 1 pcs <br />
4. Generate order planning,the planned prod order will have pegged order number SO1  (it supposed to be SO2)<br />
5. The production order MO1, cek the pegging relation, it will show relation with SO2 (it supposed to be SO1)<br />
<br />
if theres many sales order and production order for the same item it will be very frustated to check.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

If you promised S02 before S01, you would typically take the first item that hits inventory to satisfy the demand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrankManders</div><div class="date">5th December 2009, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to use &quot;hard pegging&quot;- meaning that the supply (production orders and / or purchase orders) must be hard linked to the demand (the sales order) than you must use the &quot;Allocation and Hard pegging&quot; that LN offers since FP5. For that you need to set this up using the new Terms and Conditions module (General data). Before you can use this, you need to switch this on in the company parameters. Please refer to online help to read how to set this up. Hope this helps. If not- let me know</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrankManders</div><div class="date">8th December 2009, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, you would need to set up a sales contract. Let me know if the help text is sufficient, it should...</div></div><hr />
