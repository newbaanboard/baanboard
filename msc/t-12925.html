We have a warehouse in another state that we do not own, but we store product there for a JIT customer which is near by. We ship the inventory from our central warehouse to this staging warehouse, and then the customer draws from this warehouse. We are going to monitor the inventory levels at this warehouse based on min/max settings. <br />
<br />
I have 2 questions regarding this setup:<br />
<br />
1-should this be setup with the consignment process (consignment replenishment orders when we ship to the staging warehouse, and consignment invoicing orders when the cutomer pulls form this warehouse? Or should this be setup as a DRP warehouse in a cluster?<br />
<br />
2- Based on the answer for quesiton # 1 - how should the min/max inventory levels be managed through Baan? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
