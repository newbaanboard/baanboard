Hello Everybody,<br />
<br />
When trying to transfer a confirmed Planned Production Order, the system gives me the error Message: &quot;Prod Order ...: the number of operations differ from the number present in Routing Operations. (Also check resource storage horizon)&quot;<br />
<br />
This message comes only for two items, I checked already the number of operations in tirou1102m000 (2 in my case) and the session cprrp1600m000 shows also 2, I confirmed that on the table cprrp200.<br />
<br />
I checked the work centers, they are all defined as resources, and I checked the storage horizon, is sufficient.<br />
<br />
I even deleted all operations and inserted 2 operations from an item which works fine.<br />
<br />
Compared the master data, changed item group, nothing seems to help.<br />
<br />
Logged call with Infor, here is their answer, not very helpful:<br />
<br />
planned orders planned by using the fixed lead-time cannot be transferred. This is standard functionality.<br />
To transfer the planned order a planning needs to be done including an operations planning.<br />
Then the planned capacity use is filled with the planned operations and SFC will use these operations to create the Production Order.<br />
<br />
The fixed lead-time horizon is used for performance reasons, because the operation planning takes some performance.<br />
If you do not have performance issues leave the fixed lead-time horizon to 999. And even then there are other ways to improve the performance.<br />
<br />
When Capacity used by planned order does not match to current Item Routing ooperation, we cannot transfer a planned production order to a SFC production order.<br />
<br />
SO CHECK FOLLOWING <br />
<br />
1. All the work centres are defined as resources &amp; are available in cprpd200.<br />
2.  Confirm  no.of operations in  the planned orders are same as in actual valid routing <br />
<br />
<br />
the error is because of the difference in no.of operations between the planned orders and the actual no.of operations present in the Routing.<br />
One that was corrected the error will not longer appear.<br />
<br />
Anybody an idea??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judgement</div><div class="date">7th December 2007, 06:04</div></div><div class="posttext">If somebody is interested in this specific solution:<br />
<br />
One of the items in the Bom of the production order was a phantom item and had a Routing with it. The order System of this item is manual.<br />
<br />
That means when generating order planning, the system does not consider the routing of this phantom item, because order system manual.<br />
<br />
When checking against a manual startet production order, the number of routings are not identical because the system also includes the routing of the Phantom item.<br />
<br />
Changing the Order System to planned solves the issue in this case.</div></div><hr />
