<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anna Rangelova</div><div class="date">3rd October 2006, 12:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I need to achieve actual cost of the manufactured items which includes the actual overhead costs. The problem is that the full overhead costs are known at the end of the month. Then I have to allocate these costs to every closed order. And to recalculate the cost price of the items of these orders. Also if some of these items have been sold allready - the integration transactions for the issue have to be recalculated (because they should be on other cost price).<br />
Is this possible with the standard functionality of ERP LN?<br />
Please help?</div></div><hr />
