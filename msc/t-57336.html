<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EntMgmt</div><div class="date">1st December 2009, 00:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I', new to LN and have recently been asked to help with a project regarding PCF and I could really appreciate some guidence and/or suggestions on where to search/test for some answers.  We have a generic item and have compiled all the constraints and are able to sucessful create new items.   We are running into a challenge with the planning for items created with the new generic 'model'.  For example, we have a generic item, I0, that contains components C1, C2, C3 and C4.   C1/C2  and C3/C4 are an either or options and we have a demand forecast percentage of C1-25%, C2-75%, C3-40%, C4-60%.  <br />
<br />
If i have a demand forecast of 1000 unites for I0, the component level forecast is C1-250, C2-750, C3-400, C4-600.   Now i make some items: I1 using C1&amp;C3 and I2 using C2&amp;C4.  I would appreciate any guidance on how to ensure ATP is calculated correctly so when a sales order gets entered we can leverage the ATP calculations.  <br />
<br />
Here is my current understanding:  I get an order for 400 units of I2, ATP looks at the generic I0 (not the acutual item I2) and sees C2 at 75% and C4 at 60% and sees that i have 750 and 600 unitss respectively and therefore I2 is available for the 400 unit order.  Using the same scenerio for 400 units of I1, it calculates 100 needed for C1 and 160 for C3 and ATP will be available for I1.  In reality, since I1 is using C1 and C3 and we have an order for 400 units, based on our demand forecast i will not have the components and ATP should know I need 400 units of C1 and C3 and not use the percentages setup on the generic item.<br />
<br />
I apologize if the terms are not accurate as this is my first exposure to LN.  Am I missing a simple 'check box' that helps with the planning and ATP?  We want the variants to remain in tact so we don't want to remove the dependency to the generic and then do the planning at the item level.  Is there any documentation I may read to get familiar with options?<br />
<br />
Any help and suggestions are greatly appreciated!!!<br />

Did you check the 'critical in  CTP' checkbox in the planning data for the components and the 'Component CTP' on the main item?<br />
Which version of LN are you using- keep in mind a lot was enhanced in FP5 (and will be in FP6, to be released 2nd week of January 2010)</div></div><hr />
