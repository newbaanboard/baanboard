<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">21st June 2006, 06:11</div></div><div class="posttext">When I choose to copy only single level, I understand that all the components in the Production BOM will be included in the BOM for the customized item as STANDARD ITEM. This is because BaaN will not create customized item for all the components. All this are mentioned in the help file.<br />
<br />
Why not BaaN check if the customized item for the component exist. If yes, the component should be appeared customized item in the customized BOM.<br />
<br />
We always have this problem. We copy the product structure in to the PCS project. A few days later, there is a revision change for certain manufacture item. We build the BOM (most component are the same as the old revision) for the new item in ITM and trying to copy this structure (BOM and routing) of this new item into the same project. <br />
<br />
In this case, we only want to copy the single level. Unfortunately, all the component are created as standard item in the BOM for the new customized item. This end up we have to change the field Item Category manually from St to Cu.<br />
<br />
Of course, we can create a the same BOM in the project. But, imagine how difficult is it when there are a few hundred component in the BOM.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any suggest to overcome this problem.</div></div><hr />
