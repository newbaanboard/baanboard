<br />
We are migrating from Baan IVc to ERP LN 6.1.<br />
<br />
Our production manager is in need for more information about KANBAN in LN.<br />
<br />
Does anybody already use this modul in LN?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">19th February 2007, 04:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure whether you mean Leanware. Leanware is a separated product. You may check out the document P3531C &quot;SSA Baan Leanware - Functions &amp; Features&quot; for the details on it. <br />
<br />
Or do you mean the purchase schedule and sales schedules which came from BaanIV Supply Chain version?<br />
<br />
But our advice is even without the leanware, you can still implement &quot;Lean production&quot; with your ERP system. <br />
<br />
Lean production is a visualize system, it relies on &quot;Pulling&quot; signal to schedule production. <br />
<br />
Our suggestion:<br />
1. Flat your BOM, all the semi-components are defined as phantom items. We will only have production orders for the end products <br />
2. Define details production steps, routing operations, for the end products. Link the bom materials to the routing operations.<br />
3. Still run your MRP engine. We don't against MRP engine in our Lean suggestion. The production orders created is for consumption of materials. The purchase orders created is for recording material receipt. You can break it into one order per month for the ease of booking cost to finance.<br />
4. Define your pull note/label(kanban) size for each material and the number of pull notes you required to circulate in your shop floor. Pull Note Size x  No. of Pull Notes = WIP value in the shop floor. Therefore, by decreasing your pull note size and the no. of pull notes, your WIP value will get decreasing. <br />
5. Print bar codes on your pull notes, use handheld devices, like an Pocket PC with a bar code scanner, to record the consumption of each container of materials by scanning the pull notes.  The data should be used to update the session &quot;Report Operations Completed&quot; and &quot;Maintain Material Issue by Production order&quot;.<br />
<br />
Share with us your problems and difficulties on practicing Lean, we will fine tune our suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's almost like replenishment order for WIP warehouses, with predefined quantities (depending on each item that it needs).<br />
