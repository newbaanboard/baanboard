<br />
I am working on a number of scenarios processing subcontracting tasks.<br />
<br />
On attempting to close the production order I received the following error message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Purchase invoice of Purchase order P80010055 for subcontracted operation has not yet been processed&quot;<br />
<br />
I have received the order line that the message refers to and it has been matched in Finance.<br />
<br />
I am a little confused as to why this message is displayed.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Norman</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my practice, (it is not a good practice), I just change those field in GTM and go on the &quot;close production order&quot; procedure.<br />
<br />
P.S. Think about why the problem come out and make a solution is a good practice.<br />
<br />
May be another one have a good idea on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">7th December 2005, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The closing of the production order is meant to indicate the system that all costs have been registered. So, if you do subcontracting for your order, all costs are known only after the purchase invoice from your subcontractor has been received and approved. In typical circumstances, that procedure in Baan prevents closing such production for about three weeks after the last subcontracted operation was received (that depends, of course, of the time your subcontractor needs to send you the invoice). If you still cannot close a production order after this time, you should check with the finance department if an invoice has been received and how it was posted (most likely it was not matched against the purchase order belonging to the subcontracting operation). They should know how to handle that (usually they will enter a zero amount invoice and match it against that PO)<br />

Hope that helps<br />
