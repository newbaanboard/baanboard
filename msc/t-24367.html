<br />
I ran a report for WIP by Production order for closed orders but see balance in Amount Work in Progress column.<br />
<br />
Why is the order showing a -ve balance for a lot of closed orders. IT seem to be with the variances being booked but but is it normal to see the WIP balances? Does anything need to be done to fix this ?<br />
<br />
THanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

1.	When you run the closed work order report, are you sure that you are selecting the current date? If your date is earlier then production order close date then it will show a value in WIP<br />
2.	If your answer is no to above then, are those production orders having sub-contract operations with added surcharge?<br />
3.	Does your integration report for the order shows zero wip?<br />

I am faced with the same situation of having closed orders with positive and negative WIPs.<br />
<br />
Based on your reply, I checked and found that there are indeed Sub contract operations with added surcharge.<br />
<br />
Can you kindly advise, how I should rectify this and move further?<br />
<br />
Thanks a heap in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />
