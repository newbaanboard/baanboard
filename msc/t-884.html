<br />
When changing Project Status From Active to Finished I get the message &quot;There are still actual sales orders&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have looked in tdsls045 (sales order line status) and everything seems Processed,<br />
<br />
Does anybody know where (which table and field) Baan looks at to know that &quot;There are still actual sales orders&quot;.<br />
The message appear at once when the save button is pressed, so I guess it can't be tdsls045,tdsls041,tdsls051 which are large tables.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actual sales orders can be found in table tdsls041. You can verify which order(s) are causing the problem by searching this table using index 4 with the project code. This is exactly the way in which the application is working.</div></div><hr />

Yes I have done this,<br />
And found that only One order uses the Project.<br />
This order has 24 lines, which I have checked that all have the Status &quot;Processed delivered Sales Order&quot; in tdsls045.<br />
<br />
And the necessary Order steps is performed regarding tdsls045 or session tdsls4533m000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked into the wrong project status. I looked at the wrong message code. I am very sorry. The check on tdsls041 is only executed when changing the project status to free.<br />
<br />
When you try to change the status to finished (or cancelled) a check is done on tdsls045! Checked is whether the Sales Invoice (tdsls4404m000) is printed. The procedure mask for this session must show e. If the check fails, another message is returned: There are still actual sales orders (tipcs2101a). <br />
<br />
Recently a solution was created for a problem, in which it was not possible to finish a project when backorder lines were present in sales. Solution number is: 120716.<br />
<br />
I only mention the checks on sales order lines, as this is where you have your question. Of course all other order types are checked as well.</div></div><hr />

I could not find this solution at Baan supports Knowledge Base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juergen</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess you are runninn IVc4.<br />
<br />
If so please check if you have installed solution 116497.<br />
Thats the latest solution (dated 2001-07-20) for the library tipcsdll2102 that will do the relevant checks to close the project.<br />

I verifed at Support and the status was not correct. They adapted it and now you should be able to find this solution in the Knowledge Base.<br />
<br />
In fact solution 120716 is the latest solution on the library tipcsdll2102. It is dated December 11, 2001.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Halvorn, <br />
did you process delivered sales orders (tdsls4223m000)?<br />
<br />
Sales order line status must be &quot;to delete&quot; or something like this (I just know the German term &quot;Position löschen&quot;.) If it's still on &quot;processed delivered sales orders&quot; then that step is not yet performed and the project may not be finished.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />
Uli</div></div><hr />

120716 solved the problem. I was able to download it with PMC, even if it was not available in the search engine.</div></div><hr />
