<br />
Need guidance in following scenario:<br />
<br />
Manufactured item:FG<br />
added child item PURITEM1 (purchased type) in BOM of FG at Pos 10<br />
<br />
Now ran planning engine and system properly generated production order of FG and purchase order of PURITEM1. Then transferred planned prod.order of FG to actual SFC order and released the same.<br />
<br />
Now added another item PURITEM2 (purchased type) in BOM of FG at Pos 20<br />
<br />
Now while taking planning engine run, system does not detect demand of PURITEM2 (naturally because production order of FG was released before this item was added in BOM of FG).<br />
<br />
To generate planned pur orders, we have to add this item in estimated materials of FG production order which is not practical.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to generate demand of PURITEM2 without adding this item in estimated materials line of FG production order ? Re-processing of FG's production order is not possible as order is already released.<br />
<br />
Pl guide.<br />

<br />
You can use Special Demand by Item (cpdsp2100m000) session. This will generate demand for the next item and EP will consider this.<br />
<br />
But for this item the demand date should fall after the Forcast time fence defined in Item Planning data, Horizons tab.<br />
<br />
