<br />
Env.: Baan V <br />
In session ticst1501m000 (Material issue for Prodn order ) , there are two fields 1)Subsequent delivery and another is &quot;To issue&quot;.I want to know the difference between these two fields means in which cases the data is updated in these two fields.<br />
<br />
The one logic which I know is , if the component is set is BACKFLUSHED then the required qty is updated in &quot;SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY&quot;.<br />
Else the qty is updated in &quot;TO issue&quot; field.<br />
<br />
But I have found that in some old production orders even the backflushed is set to YES even then the qty is being updated in &quot;To issue&quot; field.<br />
<br />
Could anyone pls let me know the reason behind it,<br />
<br />
regards<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Estimated qty : The qty of material estimated to be required to produce the goods<br />
To issue: The qty of material currently being requested by production department<br />
To issue by warehouse: Qty of material already requested by production department but hasn't been delivered by warehousing department<br />
Subsequent delivery: The remaining qty of material that might be requested later by production department, partially or in full<br />

If the Backflushing is set to 'Y', then the 'To Issue' gets grayed out and the Qty in that field moves to 'Subs Delv'. (This will happen even if you have partial issues from inventory (Actual Qty) or Partial Qty in 'To Issue by W/h'.<br />
 If it is not doing that, There might be a bug. <br />
Which service pack are you on. I remember there was a related change in SP 13 and SP 18.<br />
