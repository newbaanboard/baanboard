<br />
I have a basic question about SIC. Will SIC look at MPS / MRP planned production orders for demand?<br />
Lets say I have top level part -- A. And component B being used by A, where 'A' is a MPS / MRP part and there are MPS / MRP production ordes in the system. When I run 'Generate planned Inventory' transaction will the system consider the MPS / MRP production orders and recommend purchase orders?<br />
<br />
If not how do I handle this in BaaN, where the purchased parts are ordered based on reorder point principle and and the top level parts are MPS / MRP parts.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
SIC looks only on the inventory. PLanned Orders of MPS or MRP have no influence. They have to be &quot;real&quot; orders to get &quot;demand&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for comming back. <br />
<br />
What if in the situation I have all MFG parts as MRP parts and prchased parts are all on reorder point ordering. That would mean that all the MRP orders have to be transferred immediately. But given the volatility of the business (in our case) it would really mean that MRP has to be run literally 3 times a day (whenever we get sales orders). Apart from shuffling SFC orders for previously firmed orders. So is there any smart way you can think of that would help me plan my Raw materials (using reorder point) w/out confirming my planned production orders.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
you should change the purchase items from SIC to MRP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">28th November 2005, 21:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry - I mis-understood the question.<br />
SIC orders are generated in whina3200m000 - Generate Order Advice<br />
that session is in:<br />
Warehousing<br />
     Inventory Analysis<br />
          Order Advice<br />
Make sure when you run this session that you set the Order system range from SIC to SIC if you want to generate orders for only those items you have set to SIC Order System.</div></div><hr />
