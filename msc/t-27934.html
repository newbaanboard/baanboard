<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">21st August 2006, 23:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Our current company is set up as a multi financial and multi logistical.  We are thinking about adding a second company and in talks with our manufacturing folk the following question arose....<br />
<br />
Does production planning take into account both companies?  For example, if we have one physical workcenter for grinding (GRD) and that workcenter exists in both companies does production planning treat that workcenter as one for planning purposes and plans 100% to it or will it treat the GRD workcenter in each company as a separate workcenter and plan 100% for company 1 and 100% for company two (thus booking more work than possible for that workcenter)?  (if so I think that table sharing of the workcenters would be involved.)<br />
<br />
Is there any setup arrangement that will allow the production planning sessions to schedule work to that workcenter from both companies?<br />
<br />
If so is the 'entire' picture of production planning viewable in one place or do you need to look in both companies to see 100% of the planning schedule?<br />
<br />
Any information would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

But then it can be made to share the information by sharing of Baan tables. But since they are multiple companies and you want to share tables, I think you may not be able to share tables like item, BOM etc. Even if you share it, when you run MRP ( I think CRP records are deleted).<br />
<br />
You will have to know what tables can be shared- item, Bom, SFC, routing etc. My question would be if you can share all these tables then why did u create two seprate companies?<br />

Company lawyers are thinking of creating a separate business entity to protect the 'mother company' if legal action were to be taken.  Much of the information within our current company would remain the same, but certain work would run through this subsidiary.  Production planning would need to take into account both companies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">22nd August 2006, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Can sharing all the table at least MRP,, BOM, Purchase will resolve your issue? You will need to do this very carefully and analyze which is tables can be shared. The other approach could be to just load the CRP tables.  I think there are no references. If there are references in CRP tables then remove suhc references (for e.g. it may refer to a production order). I hope I am able to explain my self. But later seems to be a workable approach.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">6th February 2013, 05:48</div></div><div class="posttext">You will have to define correct company wherever it is used like waarehouse, purchase orders, production orders, workcenters, sales orders and also defien intergation parameter based on company if you need/ All the integration tables and gld tables have company as one of the input, but tales like AP. AR etc donot have. I guess one has to post the transactions from appropriate company.</div></div><hr />
