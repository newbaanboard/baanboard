And it wont be possible to restrict one welding machine to one product. In such situations, how to define routing for an item which involves one of these machines as in Routing line we can attach only one workcentre and one machine. <br />
<br />
Let me know if the question needs more clarity. Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
if all the machine in one department are similary with similar rates, you can maintain them as one machine with a higher capacity e.g. 6 machines can work 8 hours a day thus the capacity of this machine is 6 * 8 hs per day = 48 hs per day for this machine which stands for 3 machines. In order to avoid that the production order uses more than 8 hs per day you have to maintain 8 hs per day for each employ and set the critical capacity of the department to employee and not to machine.<br />
<br />
I know that this solution does not satisfy the needs of many Baan users since some wants to measure the efficiency of each machine but perhaps this is not required in your case.<br />

<br />
I have always thought that baan does so-called &quot;infinite capacity planning&quot; and hence considers only raw materials for a planned production order and doesnt consider capacity bottlenecks</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are absolutly right with your comment that Baan normally considers infinite capacity planning. Baan considers only the defined critical capacity of the department for each order without taking care for the others. If you follow my preposition you do not have to change your approach. You just have to keep in mind that the capacity of this machine stands for several machines. You can see IN SUM the orders planned by the system for each day and you know where you have to do some interventions. So nothing is really different. Even for reporting this does not cause issues. The total capacity is right as good as the planned, the actual used capacity and the KPIs derived from that. You just look at all machines in total and not individually. Of course they are very often no advantages without disadvantages.<br />
