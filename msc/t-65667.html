It appears that the table contains a summation of the costs per operation but I would like to know the breakdown of those costs everytime it gets added.<br />
Can anyone tell me where I might look to find the info I'm looking for???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">17th March 2014, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I don;t think it is summary. Every time one post something it creates record. I think the sequence 0 is like estimated cost while subsequent sequences are detail. I am not sure of sequence 0 thought) it might be summary also), but you can test out at your end. In my case, we backfush so estimated is always equal to actual hours.<br />
