Currently, when projected stock drops below safety stock, the item order planning system will plan a receipt for the period in which the safety stock is consumed.<br />
This often leads to planned orders with past due start dates or Reschedule In signals that cannot be achieved because of the supply time.<br />
Such past due start dates cause purchasing to scramble for a requirement that is not urgent and dilutes their attention from true urgent requirements.<br />
Is it possible to configure the system such that when this occurs, the planning system plans a receipt in the period that corresponds to the supply time of the item from the current date and so does not create a planned order with a past due start date?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you only thick use time fence selection box, then at least the planned start date and finish date wil use the current date.<br />
<br />
Time fence can be set as the same with normal supply time but this is not refer to which supplier.</div></div><hr />
