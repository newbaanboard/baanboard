<br />
I'm currently investigating a problem that we are facing where we have one item purchased by multiple customers and the customers want to order in different units of measure.  We have an inventory/storage unit of 'ea' (each) and a sales/price UOM as 'sft' (sales foot).  We make the inventoried unit, which is 144 inches long.  One customer wants to buy it by the foot (sft) the other wants to purchase it in 'ea'.  We are using conversion of units, but it seems to not like anything I try.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone currently do this or do you just set up a different item code for each sales UOM?  If so, then Baan is really lacking in this section of their functionality.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any information!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan is very flexible with uom's (inventory, sales and purchase) The help screens are very good.<br />
 <br />
In one of our operations we use sales quantity units and sales prices of pc (ea), kg, t, m. With conversion factors set up to handle the translation. We may price in one unit  and sell in another. eg. for same item:  2,000 meter @ $2,000 tonne, 3 pc @ $8.00 kg,  200 meter @ $1,500 tonne<br />
<br />
If ILC is being used, one point that may not be so readily evident is in order to automatically select for outbound the item may have to be &quot;stored&quot; in the unit that the sales quantity is expressed in. If sales unit sft then storage unit sft.<br />
 <br />
Hope this helps<br />
