When using session tipcs2250m000 'Close project' to close pcs-projects the field 'Reason for Adjusmtentorders' seems mandatory. Can anyone tell me what's the purpose of this field. Can I just use one code for all projects? Or is there a possibility to bypass the field (parameter setting)?<br />

<br />
When closing the project it's possible that still some unused some project inventory is present. You can decide to transfer that project inventory to standard inventory but you can also decide to delete (part of the) project inventory. With the field 'delete inventory up to value' you can define the maximum project inventory value that may be deleted from the system when closing the project. Then the system automatically creates an adjustment order in Warehousing and for adjustment orders it's mandatory to fill a reason so that later on it'll be possible to find out why a certain adjustment has been done. It's completely up to yourself whether you want to define one reason or a bunch of reasons that you might want to use to categorise adjustments done. In any case, the reason code you use should be of the type 'PCS project closed'.<br />

Hope this helps.<br />
