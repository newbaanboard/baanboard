<br />
I have a question. Production Time on tisfc010.prtm is calculated based on the Planned Quantity. However, if a quantity is rejected in an operation, the subsequent operations Planned Quantity is adjusted to the original quantity minus the quantity rejected but, the subsequent operations still having the original planned Production Time as was planned at first. Is it that right?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
