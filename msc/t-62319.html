<br />
We have a situation where in the BOM we need to have a component which has inventory unit as inches, and this component needs to be issued to the floor after cutting 10 inches out of 30 inches, and after issuing the 10 inches, we need to see the remaining inventory as 20 inches in the warehouse.<br />
can not say the net quantity as 10 inches as the routing and costing modules will take that quantity and multiply with the run time on the routing and show an overrated cost and run time.<br />
<br />
IS THERE A WAY TO HANDLE THIS IN baanIV ?<br />
<br />
I hope the question is clear, if not please let me know, i will try to make it clearer with some examples !!<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kindly put some examples and also let me know whether cutting of 10 inch of the component you want to consider as a part of routing with a different operation?<br />
<br />

Your inventory will show20 inches only. How is the cost and run time going to affect? Please explain this.<br />
