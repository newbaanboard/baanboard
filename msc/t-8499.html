<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">No I do not belive so.  An inspection of a s.o line for say a qty of 5<br />
uses the tolerence defined for the &quot;TEST&quot; thats being used.<br />
<br />
ie - TestABC is set up so that for &quot;good&quot; test the an 80% is neeed.<br />
<br />
The sales order line qty is 5<br />
The test is performed and 3 out of 5 items are &quot;bad&quot; which is &lt; 80 %<br />
<br />
so the sales order line is flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">extuma</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll just focus on purchase receipts but the same holds true for all other origins. First point is that a  purchase order can have multiple receipts if there is a backorder situation. An inspection order is created for each receipt thus permitting each to have its own &quot;pass/fail&quot;.<br />
<br />
For any one receipt, if the calculated actual percentage accepted is less than the AQL, then the entire receipt is rejected. There is no means to approve partial quantities of the receipt while accepting others. This I believe is not Baan being inflexible, but is Quality Management principles - statistically a drawn sample is representative of the entire population and therefore its rejection must mean the entire population is rejected. <br />
<br />
If for some reason, you want a workaround here, you may want QMS parameters set so that QMS only recommends so that you can change the quantities that QMS passes into Maintain Approvals.<br />
