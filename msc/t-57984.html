<br />
In relation to the last post i would like to know which  sessions have an effect/impact on the safety stock value inthe detail tab of <br />
session cprrp0520m000.<br />
The only one i know is Generate Demand and Inventory plan cpdsp1210m000.<br />
Is there any session other than this which can affect the safety stock value in the time phased planning overview session?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
