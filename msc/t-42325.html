We have phantoms in our BOMs, but we'd like to use them more productively.<br />
<br />
What we want to do is be able to rout a phantom component to a specific workcenter.  I'm not in Planning, but I have a materials background.<br />
<br />
Is there a way for phantoms in BOMs to be routed to a specific workcenter/sequence?  My planning department tells me the phantom inherits the sequence of the manufactured item above it.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to specify the operation a phantom BOM is supposed to go to without the parent assembly overriding it?  Other systems I've worked with permit a phantom ( a manufactured part) to have its own sequence in a routing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">4th October 2007, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan IV ignored the routing of phantom. It also doesn't include in the costing neither in planning engine. In Baan IV you can add the phatom routing to its parent as well as to phatom. So, in this way it will take into account properly.<br />
<br />
But please note that if there is an economic stock for phatom, then system will not blow throug the phantom.<br />

<br />
If you not cleared pl explain with Example .<br />
