<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">30th April 2004, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Kinley,<br />
<br />
I am writing you from within a Baan 5.0b environment, but probably this is pretty much the same as 5c.<br />
<br />
The message &quot;Cannot determine the costs of goods sold&quot; or in B50b &quot;Cost of goods sold cannot be determined&quot; (message number whinas0062) is triggered in script &quot;get COGS for Sales&quot; (whinadll1003). When the order is released to invoicing the message number tdslss0103 with the same description &quot;Cannot determine the costs of goods sold&quot; can also be displayed. This message is triggered in script &quot;Integration DLL with Central Invoicing&quot; (tdintdllcisli) and 'overwrites' the whinas0062 message. The messages are displayed when the system does not have the complete information to determine the Cost of goods sold.<br />
<br />
There can be two causes for this message:<br />
<br />
1. The delivered quantity passed on to &quot;get COGS for Sales&quot; (whinadll1003) cannot be fully consumed by the consumed quantity, which is available for that order line (field whinr114.qstk). Rounding problems can cause this. <br />
<br />
2. There is a difference between the sales sequence in the shipment lines and the original sequence number in the linked order line data.<br />
<br />
<br />
How to solve these causes:<br />
<br />
1. Rounding problems can be caused when the sales unit has a rounding factor of 1 whereas the inventory unit has a rounding factor of more than 1 digit behind the comma. If this is the case we suggest changing the rounding factor of the sales unit to the same rounding factor as the inventory unit in session &quot;units&quot; (tcmcs0101m000). If this is not an option then you will have to take care that you deliver in quantities, which are a multiple of the sales unit used. <br />
<br />
2. In session &quot;Sales Order Lines&quot; (tdsls4101s000) tab shipping it is possible to flag the checkbox 'unit is binding'. When this checkbox is flagged it is not possible to ship the goods in another packing unit than the sales quantity unit.<br />
<br />
3. Check if the field whinh431.rseq is equal to the field tdsls402.oseq for the relevant shipment and sales order line. If this is not the case then this should be checked and be corrected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
