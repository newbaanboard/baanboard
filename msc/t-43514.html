<br />
I need to change the Inventory UOM of an item. I have cleared all the pending transaction (orders and allocated) for all warehouses and have zeroed the inventory for it. But i still can't change it.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Historical data is nothing but the past transactions thats been recorded against this item which usualy you could find in the tdinv700 table. Depending on where this item has been used, you could find it in certain other tables as well. Its highly discouraged to change any of the historical data as these have foothold in finance and the outcome of such a change can only end in disaster. I recommend you block this item and create a new item with your preferred uom. <br />
Its the most sensible thing to do...<br />
