<br />
I just want to know if in the structure below here, the level 2, structure for item C shall or shall not be generated on generate EBOM copy data and copy it over to PBOMs?. All items have valid released revisions.(We are in BaaN IVc3)<br />
<br />
Level  Item<br />
0      A<br />
.1     B<br />
..2    C  (Non physical) <br />
...3   D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan does not allow the copying of non-physical items, and therefore won't allow creation of BOM copy data for such an item. If you need to maintain this set-up, you will have to recode your level 2 item as a physical item, do the copying, then change it back again. Tedious and open to human error. <br />
<br />
Note also that a non-physical item won't copy over as part of the BOM. When you try to copy the BOM for &quot;B&quot;, the copy method for &quot;C&quot; will come up as &quot;No Copy Action&quot; and you can't change it. We use this for hardware and other small expensed items. They exist on the EBOM for reference, but they don't show up in production, so we don't have to inventory them. <br />

I have tested it and it does not copy for non-physical and below. Which is fine for us. Just wondering if could happen.<br />
<br />
We use the non-physical items to keep drawings linked to the structure in the engineering side.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<br />
I found that when a non-physical Item is a parent of a physical e-item, even the EBOM structure is not copied to the PBOM, but the physical component is copied over to the item master!. At the generation of the EBOM copy data. Is this normal?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

When you generate E-Bom copy data via session tiedm1230m000: Generate E-BOM copy data multi-level, it first copies all the individual e-items in the E-BOM to the item master then creates the P-BOM structure.</div></div><hr />

people here say that this was not happening before we put a patch in place....<br />

If you know the date of the patch install you can check the fields in table tiedm101 to see if there were any copies prior to the patch.<br />
