<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">19th February 2010, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Why does this matter, since you can still update the materials and hours accounting after a production order has been reported “Complete” just not &quot;Closed&quot;. If the production order is &quot;Closed&quot; then you would need to reset the status back to &quot;Complete&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthil Kumar R</div><div class="date">21st February 2010, 06:54</div></div><div class="posttext">This also matters in Actual cost Receipt postings, But my thinking is that why this functionality is given like this, as we know the production can’t be completed without raw materials issued to it. This functionality can be called as flexible, but it supports violation of regular production system procedures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As per the standard functionalty , The system will allow you to &quot; Report orders complete &quot; even if all material is not issue or hours accounting is not done, howeever the system will not allow to close the production order.<br />
<br />
In order to have restriction on completion , i have also got concerns from few of my client and we have satisfy them by creating an AFS which check the shipment of material lines before executing &quot; Report operations Complete&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">23rd February 2010, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Why it is usually required.  Completion of production Order only allows you to further analyse the same in QMS if applicable and Warehousing functions. After you have reported a production order completed, you can still process material issues for the production order, or post hours to it. You can any way control the same while clsoing the production order. <br />
<br />
After a quantity of a product of a production order has been completed, you can post the quantity to inventory. You need not wait to add products until all items in a production order have been finished. Posting is usually carried out when produced items are stored in a warehouse.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no point in creating an AFS and restricting the usage of standard functionality. <br />
<br />
Please note Production Order procedure completes once you close the production order. Then only system post the following<br />
<br />
Calculates the actual item unit cost.<br />
Calculates the financial results of the production order and posts them to Financials.<br />
Updates the history of the actual material and operation costs, the operation times, and the hours accounting.<br />
Sends results to Warehouse Management if actual costing is used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthil Kumar R</div><div class="date">24th February 2010, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">My View is without physically issuing Raw materials to the production lines, we can't produce the required end material. In that case what is the point in system permitting issue after the end item receipt?.  If we are thinking of partial receipt of end item the system should check if necessary minimum material is supplied for the end item. Think of a case when end items received without issuing the material to the production and the setting is Receipt actual cost posting. The end item will go in with Zero value, and also the system allows issuing this end item to other production orders, and that time the issue cost will be zero in that production orders. So there should be minimum check to ensure that minimum material required for the end item should be issued before receipt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">1st March 2010, 04:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, thanks for ur updates. <br />

<br />
I strongly agree with Senthil. It will also create mismatch in ledger account valuation and logistic inventory valuation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">idrism</div><div class="date">29th July 2011, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a problem when performing a report order complete function and system displays Error 201 - record changed after delayed lock. We just performed a porting set and tools solutions upgrade to 8.7a. Thinking that the upgrade will eliminate the Error 201 as advised by principal. Appreciate if some one who has encountered this problem can highlight what to be done next.</div></div><hr />
