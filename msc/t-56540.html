The problem s that I cannot cancel this backorder in the system, generating a lot of garbage in the database.<br />
Do you know how can I cancel a backorder if I don't need to receive it anymore?</div></div><hr />

There is one suggestion which could be opt by you. If you do not want to confirm back order, you have to ensure at the time of receipt of partial material that onwards rest material will not receive against that PO thus you have to change the quantity in PO at the time of receipt of the material.<br />
But it is always preferred to confirm back order as it has a trace for your reference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Confirm the backorder with quantity zero and it is canceld make also sure that your receipt for this PO is final, so it want show up in the transactions anymore.<br />
