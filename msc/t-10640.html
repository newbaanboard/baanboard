<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 04:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm on BaaN 5.0c and using Enterprise Planning module.<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly how signal works. I want the system to raise a signal whenever it creates planned purchase order with the lead time less than specified in the item supplier data or item purchase data.<br />
<br />
The lead time is less than what it should because the time is not sufficient anymore. For example:<br />
<br />
Item A lead time = 30 days<br />
Demand Date = August 1st<br />
Current Date = July 15th<br />
<br />
If I simulate order at July 15th, the system will create a planned purchase order for item A with the lead time of only 15 days (start Jul 15, end Aug 1st). <br />
<br />
How can I get the system to raise a signal for this condition ?<br />
Anyone can help ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have supply time of item A in its item purchase data (or specifically item supplier data) as 30 days and you simulate it in MRP with scenario start date of 15 July, then MRP will create a planned purchase order for item A on 15 July, but also said that it will arrive on 14 August. It will miss your required date of 30 July. However, all is not lost. You can set signal for it so that BaanERP will warn you when things will arrive late like this<br />
<br />
What you have to do is go to Signal Types by Planner (cprao1110m000) and turn on the signal &quot;Finish Date&gt;Req Date&quot; for the planner of item A. You can do this by choosing the planner ID as your group ID for the session and create new entry with &quot;Finish Date&gt;Req Date&quot;, specifying that this signal's horizon is as long as your scenario length (in days) and leaving everything else default. After doing this, whenever cases like mentioned above comes up, a warning signal will be created by BaanERP for the planner of that item, saying that a planned purchase order will be delivered late<br />
