The raw materials are in the BOM so when manufcturing in-house the costing is ok.<br />
<br />
The problem is when going to sub-contracting, the supplier buys  some of the raw material by himself and charge us. Since those raw materials components are still in the BOM (we need that information for in-house manufacturing) the costing take them into considerations 2 times.<br />
<br />
Is there a way that I can point Baan to take some components out of the costing of  BOM on demand?</div></div><hr />

In case of subcontracting you may modify (delete or add) the estimated materials for the particular production orders (tisfc010m00). Also possible: to redirect the materials to a &quot;phantom&quot; warehouse, which in your case is the warehouse of your supplier. This allows you to track the raw material consumption for those orders and replenish them with purchase orders from your supplier. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">23rd March 2005, 04:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Dudutal97, you never have to worry about the cost being accounted twice. It won't. Here's why:<br />
 When you manufacture the goods in house and issue materials from your own stock, BaanERP will factor that in as material cost. The operational cost will then come from the production hours recorded for the operation<br />
 When you subcontract it and thus don't issue material from your own stock, BaanERP certainly won't book internal material issue (unless you set up backflushing). Instead BaanERP will book the subcontracting cost as operation cost for the operation (although it may contain material cost that supplier buy specifically for your order)<br />
Hence, if set up properly, you don't have to worry about cost being accounted twice for subcon. Please try to simulate it yourself on trial company data to see what I mean<br />
