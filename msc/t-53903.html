<br />
As per the standard functionality, It is not possible to inspect manual orders. That also implies that it is not possible to inspect transfer (manual) orders.<br />
<br />
Next to these: also transfer orders and assembly orders cannot be inspected.<br />
<br />
Therefore it is correct that the inspection is not taken into account in the order activites.<br />
<br />
As per your confirmation, I am closing the case.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let em know if you require any other help regarding this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />
Ashish Gupta</div></div><hr />

Talk to Infor and get this enhancement done if it is very critical<br />
cause if inspection is available in Outbound then It should be available in Inbound too<br />
It makes more sense to have inspection on inbound as compared to outbound</div></div><hr />

I use LN Fp3.<br />
First u define the order type use inspection in inbound procedure.<br />
Then, u can define in whinh0120m000, for order origin transfer manual, input from WH X and to WH Y, u can also input default series in it.<br />
Test it, u'll se when u create a wh order transfer from X to Y,  the series, and order type will read the default value.<br />
