<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">21st May 2007, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm testing ERP LN FP3.  I'm having trouble getting a product variant structure to be created on a budget or project.<br />
<br />
Problem 1<br />
In &quot;Maintain Project Parts&quot; (tipcs2111m000) the &quot;Generate Product Variant Structure&quot; is grayed out. Why is that? (see attachment), in Baan IV the product configurator can be accessed from this session.<br />
<br />
Problem 2<br />
When using &quot;Generate (Project) Structure for Product Variant&quot; (tipcs2220m000) the product variant can be configured and validated, however upon answering &quot;Yes&quot; to &quot;Generate project structure?&quot; and error report is received saying &quot;Run time function call problem.&quot;  Has anybody else experienced this?  How did you fix it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) the option should only be disabled in case the part is not a generic item AND no product variant is present in the item data (tcibd001)<br />
<br />
2) check whether the field tcibd001.dfit (derived-from-item) of all the components is filled. It's quite common that this field is not populated in case the item data have been migrated from Baan IV. In case it concerns a customised item, then the value in that field will point at the standard item it has been copied from. In case it concerns a standard item, then the value should be equal to the item itself. Bottom-line is that the field should be filled for all items in the item table.<br />

Good luck,<br />
