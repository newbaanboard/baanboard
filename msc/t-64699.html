<br />
Say we get through 5 operations and the 6th operation notices that there is an issue will all of the parts.  What do we do?  Would we do something differently depending on how far it was through the operations?  <br />
<br />
Any and all advice needed!  Thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you issued the material for the Production Order?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">8th October 2013, 22:37</div></div><div class="posttext">most likely yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">8th October 2013, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, and I guess you haven't delivered anything yet right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">8th October 2013, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">no, and, this is just a hypothetical question.  How would you handle this situation?  just complete the production out at zero and enter a new production order?  Can you back it up to print issue more material and redo?  I'm thinking no on that because the order can only be completed for the qty it was written for correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">8th October 2013, 22:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I am not sure about 4C4 (I guess its your version), but in LN, we have faced some situations where the ordered quantity was say 100 and user delivered 50 out of 100. What we follow is, we return the issued material, we reset the operations and complete them for 50 quantity, we change the ordered quantity to 50 and we close the order.<br />
<br />
Now, in your case, you have complete quantity being rejected, then I would suggest, you can return all the issued material, reset all the operations, and you can wait for the next production order of that item, because it's not possible to change the item and neither its possible to cancel the order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">8th October 2013, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok - how can you return all the issued material if they've used it and it's scrap now?  Can't really re-use.  I'm thinking our only choice is to complete it at zero because they were all rejected and enter a new production order for the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">8th October 2013, 23:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok - how can you return all the issued material if they've used it and it's scrap now?<br />
<br />
Yes, this would be an exception then but I thought its just a hypothetical question. Anyway, if you haven't used any of the issued materials then its possible to get it back. Else, you can leave it with 0 completed.<br />
<br />
Again, there can be various scenarios, say, if hours accounting has been done or some of the quantity was delivered, you will need to check the Financial effects too. As, your operations are completed, the costs might have been added up as well. So, take care of that before closing the order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">8th October 2013, 23:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Very good.  Thank you for your answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">28th October 2013, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also complete all qty then do innvetpry adjustment fro scrapping them. Or you may want to issue more material to compensate for loss. In this case you will get unfavorable variance. There may be some more options to handle it like I think you can report 0 pcs and everything as rejected. That will also work<br />
