<br />
Do any one have documentation for Production Order Components Issue?<br />
<br />
I have a some production orders, that I cannot issue its component:<br />
* The Production Order Backflush field is set to No<br />
* I have inventory on the component warehouse<br />
* When I Generate Outbound Advice (tdilc4201m000) the Production Orders it indicates &quot;No data found for report, no report is printed&quot;.<br />
* There is no other Outbound Advice for the Producion Order or the Component.<br />
<br />
Do you have any suggestion? :confused:<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also check if the item has some inventory allocated to other production orders i.e use Planned Transactions to check it. Basically, the inventory might be stuck in the To Issue state which should be made 0 to remove the allocations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">12th February 2014, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Try to maintain the outbound instead of generating it. Usually you get more informative messages that way rather than just &quot;no data&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Altrev</div><div class="date">14th February 2014, 01:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to all, I notice that the user entered a wrong date on the Producion Order, so when generating the Outbound Advice with the stablished time frame did not take it, I had to indicated a larger Time Frame in order to cover that day. Done This the Outbound was Generates and Released.<br />
<br />
Thanks Again!</div></div><hr />
