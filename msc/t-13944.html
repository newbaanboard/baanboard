<br />
We are using the small project module, I have the next situation..<br />
<br />
There is a project where an standard item was damaged, so I need to produce a new one, but I want that the cost of this new production Order be added to the project.<br />
<br />
how can I add this production order to a project if the item is a standard item??  is mandatory to make it customized?? how would be the best way to do it??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards..<br />

If so, are you trying to manufacture the standard item and then use it as a sub-assembly for the higher customized end-item OR is the standard item a purchased one?<br />
<br />
you can create a re-work production order for the items that you have scrapped and the costs are carried over.<br />
If you want the rework cost of the manufactured standard item to be absorbed as part of the project, then its better to transfer that as a customized item in your project and do a cost transfer.</div></div><hr />
