<br />
I was wondering whether there is a way of preventing a production receipt from happening if the materials in the BOM are not currently in stock. <br />
<br />
This creates quite a few headaches as we constantly have to clear the backflushing report.  Taking this approach would highlight the issue as the user tried to receipt rather than fixing the issue at a later date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">16th July 2007, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I see a bigger problem: your inventory record must not have been up to date for this to happen. Backflushing policy needs to be accompanied by regularly run cycle counting to decrease discrepancy between actual and recorded inventory level.<br />
<br />
However, as always, you can do a little customisation to provide this feature on your site<br />

As now you will have pyhsically a finished goods sitting but not in system, so you will create another discrepancy. I think better process would be not to start the production order, if inventory is not sufficient.<br />

<br />
Im using LN .<br />
Can you print Production ORder Shortage?<br />
Because in LN,we can print the production order shortage before we release the production Order (which means, user can not report anything),  if we still can print Production Order Shortage,that means the inventory is still not enough, so we dont release the production order yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjstephens</div><div class="date">1st August 2007, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">You raise a good point - the users should not be able to report production without the proper release of the corresponding materials from inventory.<br />
<br />
I have seen the issue several times where production is reported and the user has elected to ignore the backflush procedure.<br />
<br />
With a modification in place, you could reconcile the inventories before the POST production procedure, but my fear would be adhoc additions of inventory to the system leading to bigger issues when you do the EOM inventory reconciliation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jayverma25</div><div class="date">3rd August 2007, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">We have done customiztion. Before production order completion system checks for correctness of BOM &amp; also sufficient invenotry of child items  is available in respective warehouse. If is not correct or not available system does not allow to report prodction order completion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds exactly what I'm after, this would prevent a large amount of issues needing to be fixed after the production order was closed and making and fix the stock level at the time the production order was closed.</div></div><hr />
