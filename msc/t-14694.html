<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kinley</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 08:12</div></div><div class="posttext">we are on Baan IVc4. Can anybody enlighten me as to how any of you have mapped this business requirement?<br />
<br />
1) we have a item whose standard cost is 10$ when used in production<br />
2) the same item when sold as a spare, the sales price is 20$ (10$ std cost+5$ handling and packing + 5$ profit)<br />
3) i would like to know, after a time period, how much profit have we made on this item and how much was the handling and pakaging cost?<br />
<br />
<br />
i am aware of the Cost set functionality in sales, but i do not want my customer to see 2 lines (the item that i am selling with a cost line of 10$ and a cost line of 10$). <br />
<br />
are there any other ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use the cost set, and just suppress specific cost items on external documents (for packing slip there is a parameter) like ack and invoice.<br />

<br />
When used in Production does it appear as a separate line on sales order or you sell a finished goods item with this item happens to be one of it's components?<br />
