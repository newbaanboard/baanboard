<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">28th February 2005, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Production Order that is completed. When I try to &quot;Close&quot;  it, I get message &quot;No data within selection&quot;. I see all the materials are issued appropriately (though partially, which is ok) and receieved. End item also delivered.<br />
<br />
I see one strange thing. All the items in the BOM and the Finished Good has zero cost. Does this prevent me from Closing Production Order? Very strange though I have not faced this issue before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">28th February 2005, 10:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tested it in test and I am unable to close a production order that has zero cost for the items in BOM and hence Top-level item is also of zero-cost.<br />
<br />
Any inputs from anyone who has handled/faced it before, appreciateed. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glisha</div><div class="date">2nd March 2005, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you check item cost price in Item Cost Data (tcibd0107s000)?<br />
<br />
If cost prise is equal to zero, you have to calculate item cost for every item in BOM and also for Parent item (session: Calculate Cost and Valuation Prices: ticpr2210m000). <br />
<br />
If cost prise is still quals to zero after calculation, you need to define material cost (purchase items) and operation cost (in routing section) for every operation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">3rd March 2005, 05:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well. The Raw material and finished good are at zero by design. We have not set Simulated Purchase Prices for Purchased Item and didnt roll up cost either. This is because the material is consigned.<br />
<br />
Now, the Close Production Order is possible. But if I say Simulate Only, it gives this message. Very strange that it lets me Close but wont, when I do Simulate only. Honestly, I wont achieve anything by Simulate only as there is going to be no variance as cost is zero.<br />
<br />
But of late, I find in our environment that even if the BOM has a cost, I am unable to Simulate. We are at SP 15. Have taken it to Baan Support and they want to debug. That is the latest update.</div></div><hr />
