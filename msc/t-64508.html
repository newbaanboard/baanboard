<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazuramusa</div><div class="date">26th August 2013, 06:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is it the MRP processing &amp; calculation(timrp1210m000) did not consider our &quot;Off days&quot; or &quot;Public Holidays&quot; setting in Calendar (tirou4101m000)? It still planned order on our Public Holidays or Off days even though we already set certain days as non-working days.<br />
Please help if anybody knows any reason for it?<br />

<br />
I am not familiar with Baan-IV. <br />
<br />
In ERP LN there is a session &quot;Calender Non-Available Days&quot; (tcccp0119m000) in which we can maintain the non-working days. <br />
<br />
Just look for the similar session in BaaN-IV. This will resolve your issues.<br />

<br />
TQVM.. In BAAN IV, have already set Day Types as Public Holidays and Off days as non-working days whereby the &quot;Working Time&quot; &amp; &quot;Resource per day&quot; already set as 0. But, still BAAN IV only consider Saturday &amp; Sunday as non-working day.<br />
Anyway, thanks again for your reply.</div></div><hr />

I'm talking about both Planned Prod.Orders &amp; Planned Purchase Orders. Are you sure about the 5 days per week? But why in BAAN help screen, it says otherwise? Pls refer to below (taken from Help menu for session tirou4101m000 (Maintain COmpany Calendar):<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
sorry for my typo, it's tirou4201m000<br />
<br />
1st - Maintain company calender by tirou4101m000<br />
2nd - Actualize the modified/maintained company calender with tirou4201m000<br />
<br />
Changes only take effect by actualized calender.<br />
Hope this will solve your problem.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

we seem to be having the same issue. Did you solve your problem.<br />
Any help here would be appreciated.<br />
Thanks<br />

After copying it, please make changes the changes due to holidays by making them capacity of those work centres as &quot;0&quot; on those days and then actualize the calender</div></div><hr />

Sorry, till now no answer. I have done as per mentioned Mr. Erplncons mentioned long time ago. In fact, before posting this issue, I have consulted our local vendor in Malaysia and they say it could be BAAN IVC4 bugs.<br />
But, they also do not know why .<br />
Its ok. I have brief my users on this and they have accepted this failure. <br />
The best that we could do is, create a work around method.<br />
He he he..<br />
<br />
Thanks all!!<br />
I rest my case.;)</div></div><hr />
