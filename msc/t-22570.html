<br />
Hope someone can assist me. <br />
We are not using 'containerization' or 'Lot Control'  modules.<br />
According to Baan Support and from their study done, it seems we create numerous batches due to this very reason . This in turn also effects the 'variance'<br />
Is there any way we can overcome this issues? :confused: <br />
Pls advice<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />
Yours in service<br />

<br />
<br />
We need a little more information.  Can you be more specific as to what Baan said and what Baan were asked. <br />
<br />
How are you creating batches ? after MRP run ? <br />
<br />
You mention &quot;batches&quot; are you using the &quot;process&quot; module ??<br />
