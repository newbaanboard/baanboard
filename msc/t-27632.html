<br />
I use SSA ERP LN 6.1 FP2<br />
<br />
1. Does anybody use Cycle Time in Second ?<br />
Because it seems only be able to input in minute.<br />
I only can change production rate in minute,but cycle time still in second.<br />
Is it the standard from LN?<br />
<br />
2. Does anybody use different unit between Inventory Unit and Unit when i use this item as a component in BOM?<br />
For Example :<br />
Paint 01, i use inventory unit liter.but the engineering use it as a component in BOM with unit = Gram.<br />
It seems LN only read one kind if inventory unit.<br />
Is it the standard from LN?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance,<br />

I am not sure how the unit for cycle time is set, but the unit for production rate is set inthe Routing parameters. Also whether you will use production rate or cycle time in routing is set in routing parameters.<br />
<br />
2. The unit in EDM and Inventory Unit in Item data is same, you cannot have gram as unit in EDM and liter in Item Data.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
I have ask this question with OPS,and they confirmed that :<br />
1. cycle time can not be lower than minutes.<br />
2. Unit of Measure in BOM must be use Inventory Unit.<br />
<br />
I realize that its gonna be really complicated to implement, because :<br />
<br />
1. In plastic injection manufacturer,they have Item master data (routing) always in second.when we convert it to minutes,the result will not be a round number rigght.for ex: 5 s = 5/60 =0,0833333 which not represent the exact data.<br />
 <br />
2. the warehouse has different needs of measure to store the material .<br />
<br />
Anyone has any suggestion/experience about this?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance,<br />
Jenny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">28th July 2006, 00:16</div></div><div class="posttext">For the first point, you can define the routing for higher volumes, i.e. instead of defining the routing for 1pcs and then updating the rate as 0.083...minute, you can define the routing for 1000pcs and then define the rate as 83.33 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I have suggested to use Production Rate , and they agree with it.<br />
<br />
I will close this thread,many thanks for your consideration.<br />
