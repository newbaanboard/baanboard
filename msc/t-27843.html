You will have to modify some reports to make it visible though.<br />
For sales, if you specify the required revision on the sales order line you can set it to only generate outbound for the required revision. <br />
MRP does not consider revisions unfortunately :-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">10th August 2006, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as i know, this revision at the Inventory level does not work in Baan IVc4. Yes, it stores the revision # under each lot number but not under each item's inventory. But during the entering sales order line, you can choose which revision inventory to ship with different order date. But during delivery, it does not check if you are shipping from a different revision than SO line. MRP checks the total on hand to generate new requirements.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">11th August 2006, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Robert, thank you for the clarification. But if you look at the original question &quot;how to identify different revisions of an item that are availble in inventory&quot;. This is not possible in BaanIVc4. Yes, it does check the sales order line's revision during delivery ONLY if the inventory is LOT controlled. I think, it still does not check for normal Location controlled inventory. Also the Planning considers the total inventory for this item and generates wrong/incorrect requirements.<br />
Let me know if you know any other setup. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankadam</div><div class="date">11th August 2006, 19:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I don't think there's any inventory sessions where you can consult the item's inventory by revision. But in case you have the lot parameter 'engineering revisions in lot control' set in whinh0500m000, then you can record the revision by lot. If that's the case then you'll find the revision in the session whltc1100m000. You could create a report or a display session combining this information.<br />
<br />
As mentioned by the other posters you can implement the use of revisions in other modules, also in Ln. You can do that by setting the parameter 'engineering revisions active' in the parameter sessions of these modules:<br />
- SFC parameters <br />
- Warehousing Master Data parameters<br />
- Purchase order parameters<br />
- Sales parameters<br />
<br />
In the Warehousing Master Data parameters you can also decide whether you want the system to respect the revision (that has been recorded in for example the sales order line) at the moment of generating the outbound.<br />
<br />
As far as I know Planning doesn't take into account the revisions. In other words, when transferring orders, the system will look for the current revision of the item and create the production or purchase order with that current revision. I'm sure that it works like that in 5.0c and I think that it works like that in Ln as well.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
How can we identify different revisions of an item that are availble in inventory.<br />
<br />
For example: There are 100pcs of an item ABC with rev 01 in the inventory. Later the revision is change to 02 and another 100pcs are manufactured. Now the inventory details will show 200pcs in inventory. How can the user tell how much is of which revision.<br />
<br />
If you use FIFO/LIFO as material issue method, then the inventory is stored with the inventory date-time detail in the inventory table and there will not be any consolidation of inventory in the locations. This date/time is the production or purchase receipt date/time and does not change even if you transfer the item to various locations or warehouses. You can do a simple customization by adding a column for revision in the display session Inventory by item, warehouse,location and lot. Based on the inventory date, you must query the purchase or production order in table whinr100(inventory transactions by stock point) and in turn table tdpur401 or tisfc001 and fetch the revision. <br />

<br />
I was able to convince the client to transfer the old revision from the nettable wrh to a non nettable wrh and then to use this old revision manually by pulling it back to nettable wrh and then issuing it. The inventory report could have helped to some extent but the EP was the major issue as it was considering the total qty of the item.<br />
<br />
Again Thanks.</div></div><hr />
