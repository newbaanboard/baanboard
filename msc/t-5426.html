<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Br.</div><div class="date">6th June 2002, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">How will Baan react when you enter a production order for an item with one of the components a phantom manufactured item ?<br />
I suppose that it will explode the phantom manufactured item into all its components as estimated materials.<br />
But what if there is inventory of the phantom manufactured item ?  I hope Baan will take account of this inventory and add the phantom item as estimated material instead of all his components.<br />
I've done several tests but it didn't worked out the way I supposed and I couldn't find a logic in it.  Is this normal or is there a parameter for this ?<br />
We are on Baan IVc4.</div></div><hr />

(See material issue note) If you have stock of the phantom the phanton item will be issued untill no stock is present and then return to issuing the raw material for the phantom.<br />
This is standard functionality and no parameter setting is needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;I thought a phantom item typically doesn't have inventory?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are right: typically phantom items have no inventory. But think of producing a 'bundle' of items. In times of low order intake by your customers you can produce a certain number of bundles on stock - to sell them when order intake increases and your normal capacity isn't high enough.<br />
Makes you very flexible in production planning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gpitre</div><div class="date">19th June 2002, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan4c4 and previous version, you need to know that when you want to use a phantom item that will not be allowed to have inventory register against it, you do not setup the fields Phantom YES in the item master. You only set the itemas phantom in the BOM. That way the system always explode the estimated materials.<br />
<br />
And Yee if there is inventory for the phantom, the system will issues it first, just ensure that the item master Phantom fields is still set to YES.<br />

<br />
If the BOM includes a phantom, can I mainain the qty of the Phantom in Maintain Estimated Materials, or only qtys of the exploded components? <br />
Can I add another phantom via Maintain Estimated Materials? If so, I assume that any operations in the routing of the new phantom will be added to the order's operations?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">31st August 2002, 11:26</div></div><div class="posttext">A phantom item can be handled like a normal item if you have stock of it. By default the system will not generate stock for this item but if stock is available the system accepts this item like a stocked item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">1st September 2002, 00:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. I know that a Phantom is identical in most other ways. I'm don't have access to a test system right now, and the question is specifically about Maintain Estimated Materials. <br />
<br />
Say a mfd item X has a single-level BOM with 1 unit each of items A &amp; B. B is a Phantom. I don't have stock of B, but B does have Phantom=Yes in Item Master.<br />
<br />
If I understand your explanation, then if I enter a production order for 1000 units of X, I be able to use Maintain Estmated Materials to change the planned (estimated) qty of Phantom B from 1000 to 800. Correct? Or will I only be able see/change items on the exploded bill of B?<br />
<br />
Does B need to also be specified as Phantom on the BOM? <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I want to be able to maintain estimated materials at the level of the phantom. Do I have the right combinations?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">2nd September 2002, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you can insert the phantom but will allso be issuing the item. If you want to issue the components you will have to insert them in maintain estimated materials or  Enter material issue for production orders.</div></div><hr />
