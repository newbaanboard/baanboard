The way we handle this problem is by running Error recovery sessions - tdilc0250m000(ILC implemented) and tdinv0252m000. But precaution to be taken is that these sessions should be run in single user mode only.<br />
<br />
Hope this will be of help to you.</div></div><hr />

Find out why there is a negative first. Do you do cycle counting? Follow the same steps to find out why there is a negative in your project. I'd suspect that thetre was a production order that did not get completed or shipped more than was available. Do you have the flag set to negative inventory= yes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right regarding running of error session. But in our case ILC is implemented and we do not do cycle counting as it is very tedious. Further it has always been my experience that negative inventory for item is more a system generated error especially where ILC is implemented, and we get rid of the same through error recovery session.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />
