<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MWcpim</div><div class="date">28th June 2005, 01:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We run the MPS on top level parts and MRP subsequent purchase and production orders.  Business is centered around biologicals which yields can very highly from lot to lot.  Since the MRP system is top down generated, a small shortage in the the yield of a biological creates a new planned MRP order for a very small amount which is not practicle to make. Because the yield is under plan, the next level is under plan which generates another planned MRP order that will not be filled and so on and so on until the upper level part is closed out under plan.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have a way to get around these &quot;nuisance MRP orders&quot; in this situation?  Order interval is not acceptable and the scrap factor doesn't quite fit the bill.  If only we could get the system to do bottom up planning after the biological yields are know ( thats my pipe dream ).<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.  BaanC4 IV<br />

or the 'orderquantity multiple of'......or use a unit with a usefull precision (no need to use a unit with 4 decimals if you only use whole kg's)</div></div><hr />
