<br />
My understanding is that the production result is in effect the calculated difference between what has been posted to GL and the Standard values that should have been posted if the exact BOM and routing quantities and hours had been posted.  <br />
<br />
These are calculated when the production order is closed (costed). The porgram looks at tfgld410 for postings rather than tfgld106 just in case they integrations have not been posted/finalised as yet.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<br />
If you value your WIP against estimated costs (there's a parameter for that) the value of your WIP has to be what is precalculated by means of BOMs and routings. However, you are likely to issue more material / post more or (less hours). So, during production, the WIP will be not equal to the estimated value. When the order is closed, the WIP has to be adjusted to that estimated value. This is done by the production result: It reduces / increases the actual WIP to to the estimated value. (That posting has do be done against a profit and loss account).<br />
<br />
If you value WIP against actual costs, the SFC/Production result has no meaning. It will be generated anyway, but  with the status &quot;not for finance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />
