<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iain Fordyce</div><div class="date">2nd March 2015, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to do a mass entry of the Order Confirmation Date for Purchase Orders with multiple lines (for clarity, definition of Order Confirmation Date below):<br />
<br />
&quot;The date on which the buy-from business partner confirmed the purchase order, or the date on which the sales order is confirmed to the sold-to business partner.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was expecting to be able to do this at the PO Header level and it 'sync' across all lines but it only seems to appear at line level. This would mean that you have to fill this date in for each individual line which seems time consuming. <br />
<br />
Has anyone come across the same issue?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if there is any way functionally; but technically you can develop a program to update the field in the header and do a sync. You can either go with AFS or DAL to do that.<br />
<br />
Again, check if there is any way to do that in a standard way first.</div></div><hr />

I would think the only way would be a customization which I don't recommend.  It would be nice if you had a choice but it is not a feature of the system.</div></div><hr />
