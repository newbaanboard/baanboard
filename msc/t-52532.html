I am facing a very intresting problem as follow<br />
In session tiitm0101m000, i have an item called &quot;AA177&quot; the inventory unit and storage of hich is &quot;PKT&quot; and sales unit is &quot;no&quot; <br />
The conversion factor for base unit PKT is (0.6)<br />
when i generate outbound advise through session tdilc4201m000 the system gives me correct advise with the conversion factor.<br />
But for some item the generate UOtbound is not possible (for the reason not know to me) i do Maintain outbound advise tdilc4101m000 and when i insert quantity after converting with factor (from PKT to NO.) system doesnt not give me correct result in Maintain Deliveries tdsls4120m000 in Delivered Field.<br />
I have tried doing this manual outbound for quite a few advise. But there is no consistancy in the Qty. generated.<br />
Over and above while releasing the system gives always &quot;Qty&quot; released = &quot;0&quot; for all this manual advise.<br />
Is there any other table from where system is getting conversion data and doing calculation while &quot;Generate OUtbound Advice&quot; ?<br />
I am Confused   :confused:</div></div><hr />
