That is why lots of sales invoicing , production order closing , warehouse reciepts are pending for month of june.<br />
<br />
now his requirment is to make all such entries in back date , so as to close the june month .<br />
<br />
as if now , we have shut down the server and have not statrted punching transactions for july .<br />
<br />
I have suggested them one option of expanding their Fiscal period from 30th to 10th of next month,however i am not sure whether it is possible to do or not.<br />
<br />
kindly guide me about the same and suggest if something else can be done or not.<br />
<br />
waiting for your reply.<br />

It is possible to close a production order with a back date. But I am not sure about invoicing. Since Baan has been shut-down and no work is done in July as of now, why don't you reset the system date in Baan server to say30th June 6 pm and do only the pending works? But you must quickly complete everything before the time elapse. For example, the closing date cannot be before the completion date and so you can't reset again and again. You can select an appropriate date, may be 27 th so that you have enough time to complete. As a precaution you can keep the July periods closed.<br />

<br />
If I were you I would contact INFOR Support to get help here because you have some major issues to deal with.<br />
In case something goes wrong later on and INFOR is involved you know that you are in contact with the vendor.</div></div><hr />

There are no issues if you change the system date in BaaN Sever. But keep it in mind as early as you complete your pending work, u can start your current transactions in the system. so you must quickly complete your work.<br />

 <br />
In baan4, invoicing and deliveries could be back dated in their appropriate sessions..Dont know if Ln allows it in Central Invoicing module..<br />
