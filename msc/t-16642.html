<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michail</div><div class="date">27th September 2004, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, am working on a solution for Baan IVc4 (standard, no customizatiopns)user organization and would appreciate any comments/suggestions on the following list, any or all of them.<br />
<br />
1.Can one make a Sales forecast from sales history?<br />
3.Can we use inquiries for MPS before its change to sales order? <br />
4.Can system present MPS in chart ? e.g. Gantt chart or any Graph.<br />
5.Can we distribute MPS(Monthly plan) in Scheduling plan(Daily plan)?<br />
(Daily plan that would describe MPS of each day in each month into one day that show: <br />
-all production lines<br />
-production time in each line<br />
-specifications<br />
-production quantity of each item<br />
etc.<br />
9. Can system adhere to production processes bottlenecks in MPS?<br />
10. Can MPS reflect setup times for different equipment?<br />
11.After the production in one day or between that days ,we know about out of plan data . Can we adjust MPS<br />
<br />
13.Sometimes we have orders to be produced by man for special line/normal line (difficult production or a new product MPS system should not support this case . Can system flexible us to change and automatically adjust in MPS?<br />
<br />
16. Delivery of packaging/ingredient can not arrive to the factory on time. (cannot expect). Rescheduling of MPS easily or not?<br />
<br />
17.Can system record data about :<br />
- How many time we use to rescheduling?<br />
- How often out of  plan situation happens? <br />
-Percentage of on time delivery planning.<br />
-Percentage of shortage delivery.<br />
<br />
18. At present we have two W/H to keep raw mat and ingredients and manage them by using inventory transfer between these W/H. How can we track the data in each warehouse? <br />
<br />
19. Can MRP summarize data from only one warehouse (main warehouse)?<br />
20. Does item codes structure have to be re-arranged to support this process?<br />
<br />
21. Can system use material items from more than 1 warehouse for only one product code?<br />
<br />
22. One finished goods have many statuses in production process, e.g. Finished, Semi, WIP, Hold. How can we track finished goods item while its process still not yet completed? <br />
<br />
23. Can sales forecast be done by item code?<br />
<br />
24. Can we use QMS module for raw material processing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan user</div><div class="date">27th September 2004, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">You have many questions some of them easy to answer, others not. Do you use IRP (which should be normal if you're in the process industry) or the standard MPS?<br />
This will influence a number of answers to your questions.</div></div><hr />
