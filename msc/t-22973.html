<br />
Im working on a new pcf configurater with a generic bom linkt to it. <br />
Im using Generic items that are set to phantom for the grouping of items because of the high number of standard variants that can be generated from this pcf model.<br />
But today I stumble on a problem :<br />
Im trying to replace a gen item on a gen bom with the help of a parameter substitution constraint ,but it will not work . <br />
<br />
A brief description of the buildup from the gen bom:<br />
<br />
Gen Bom:<br />
<br />
DP (top item )<br />
   Phpaa2  (phantom)<br />
     Phpaa2-n  (phantom)<br />
        Phpaa2-n-h (Item that has to change to xxxxx)<br />
            Sup a	(addition machining that have to be done on the item xxxxx)<br />
	Sup b   (addition machining that have to be done on the item xxxxx)<br />
<br />
The constraint that I had written and added it to the generic item Phpaa2-n in the session constrains by generic item  and put it in the item Phpaa2-n-h in the gen bom of the item Phpaa2-n <br />
<br />
Constraint of the type Parameter substitution. <br />
<br />
If [M4GTK036]=J   ([M4GTK036]=J is a feature from the top item DP)<br />
Then <br />
Item_data=xxxxx<br />
Endif<br />
<br />
Does somebody know why it wont work ?<br />
I have asked the folks of the IT and a number of Baan consultants but still havent got the answer</div></div><hr />

Constraints for item_data must be written in Maintain Generic Item Data.  Here you also determine what the item data is, item number, description, material, size, standard or text.</div></div><hr />

Hi DriesV,<br />
don't know exactly what you want to implement but have a look at the last post of this (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=6487) thread.<br />
That should help you a lot.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">just_fro</div><div class="date">27th January 2005, 23:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure, but it seems that you no longer know the features of DP anymore when you're validating/substituting a lower level part....<br />
<br />
Try what happens when you start your constraint with a little select on the top level item (DP) to find out the actual feature......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DriesV</div><div class="date">1st February 2005, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, me again<br />
<br />
I found me a baan consultant who knows a solution , and it seems that the parameter substitution doens't work on item level .<br />
<br />
When i have the solution i will post it here for the folks who are intrested in it <br />
<br />

<br />
Did you define the feature [M4GTK036] on the Phaa2-n level, too ?<br />
<br />
Otherwise a second possibility is to use the 4GL capabilites of the PCF and define a global variable that contains the value of the feature [M4GTK036].<br />
<br />
Usethis variable to make the necessary tests.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DriesV</div><div class="date">2nd February 2005, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem is that you can't change the item itself.<br />
not even by a parameter substitution constraint , you can change the qauntity of a specific item and more things on the form of the generic bom rule ,but not the item.</div></div><hr />

Nice to see your question here  :) <br />
Do you have a solution for the problem you mentioned?<br />
<br />
Greetings to Roel and Carl ;)</div></div><hr />
