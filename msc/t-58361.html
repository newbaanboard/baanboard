<br />
We are trying to make use of the Purchase Contract delivery time field (tdpsc001.delt) to deal with the scenario where we pick up the goods from our suppliers overseas. (ie. It takes 20 days to arrive at our site).<br />
<br />
Despite setting this up it appears to have no impact on the Planned MRP Purchase Schedule.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any experience of using this field ?<br />
<br />
I have raised an incident with Infor for this but have been told to update to a later Service Pack. This will take me a few weeks to acheive but in the meantime this issue has become a little more high profile within our organisation.<br />
<br />
Cheers Neal</div></div><hr />
