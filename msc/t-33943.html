Why u r trying to delete the routing for the item, u just change the item type to purchased and try to run cost price. <br />
<br />
If there is any production order present against this item with this routing then it will not allow you to delete the routing code. i.e this refers the table &quot;tisfc001&quot;. <br />
Try it out.<br />
