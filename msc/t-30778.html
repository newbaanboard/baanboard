We can manufacture X item 1000 qty. in a week. Sales order comes for 5000 qty at the staring of the week &amp; we have to deliver 5000 qty. in the same week. how this will be maped in the system using MPS.(Only by inhouse production)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">just_fro</div><div class="date">3rd February 2007, 00:13</div></div><div class="posttext">MPS is a typical LONG term planning and is to be used for items with critical materials and/or critical capacities. <br />
A demand coming in at the beginning of the (this?) week sounds more like short term planning....so MRP. (in both cases you're a bit late with production :D )<br />
When demand is hard to forecast, you would need safetystock (in both MPS and MRP)<br />
<br />
But in general MPS shifts the demand to the end of a timebucket and plans receipts at the beginning of the bucket. The long term planning would plan the receipt of 5000 relative to the bucketlength. Weekly periods would result in 5 weeks with 1000 per week, Monthly buckets in 1000 and 4000. (there is a lot more going on, like timefences and so, but then again, in this case MPS doesn't sound like the proper method)</div></div><hr />
