<br />
I am manually attaching the unit effective no in order distribution session of production orders which are generated in sales order lines.<br />
<br />
Now while processing the production orders, we are rejecting quatities.<br />
For ex I have quantity ordered = 10<br />
quantity orders in order distribution line of the unit effective no =10<br />
<br />
now i reject sm quantities in operations=3<br />
so i post the inventory =7<br />
rejected=3<br />
but now when i try to complete the production order it showing to be completed status.<br />
Reason is that it is creating warehousing order line in production warehouse order session with <br />
transaction type status=receipt, blocked= checked, status=open with order quantity =3<br />
It means that the production order still needs 3 quantities to be completed.<br />
the 3 quan rejected does not fulfill the order distribution line.<br />
<br />
Everything works fine if there are no rejected quantities, and in case i want to short close a order still it creates a same problem.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me that if the system should behave in the above way, am i missing on something where this problem can be resolved?<br />
<br />

You use 1 Unit eff for this production order?<br />
Do you use warehouse inspection?<br />
Usually, the status is become to be completed, when theres an outstanding warehouse inspection for that prod ord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">24th March 2009, 10:48</div></div><div class="posttext">i test it in here  with the same condition, after i click save, the status is become completed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">priyanko</div><div class="date">24th March 2009, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using only 1 unit effect for prod order.<br />
No warehouse inspection is there, by warehouse inspection do u mean quality inspection or warehouse level inspection?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">priyanko</div><div class="date">24th March 2009, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">no outstanding inspection for that production order.<br />
<br />
I have tested in diff system with the same scenario, <br />
I think I am missing some setup? Can u guide me the process u are doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy_baijun</div><div class="date">24th March 2009, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">it is okay in my test with the same condition. order =10, and reject =3 in one operaion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">priyanko</div><div class="date">24th March 2009, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the unit you are attaching is generated from sales order? and whether that unit generated you are attaching it manually in the order distribution session of that production order?</div></div><hr />

The problem is solved, if i try to save the order complete session , the status gets completed.<br />
unless you save it, the status shown is &quot;to be completed&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Can u test one more scenario, where say you have 20 planned quantities.<br />
You partially complete 10 quantities and post it to inventory and then complete 7 and reject 3 . In this case can you check whether after saving &quot;report order complete&quot; session whether the status changes to &quot;Complete&quot;. <br />
What i found out is it is saving in &quot;to be completed &quot; status.<br />
In normal condition one cannot save the session in &quot;to be completed&quot; status. <br />
<br />
