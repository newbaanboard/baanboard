   For a Production Order, what is the difference between Status = Completed and Status = Closed?<br />
   Thx<br />
Popeye!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FransG</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 09:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Production order status completed means:<br />
The order has been reported as completed, and all completed products have been delivered into inventory (inbound procedure for end items has finished) (i.e. the order has been logistically closed).<br />
<br />
Production order status closed means:<br />
The financial results of the production order have been posted (i.e. the order has been financially closed).<br />
<br />
Hope this answers your question.</div></div><hr />

Closed = Closed for all transactions. Financially closed but can be changed back to completed to issue more items or hours.</div></div><hr />
