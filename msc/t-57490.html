                 I would like to know of a  situation where in, on completion of a production order, when I refer to INVENTORY RECEIPT TRANSACTIONS session(whina1512m000) the TOTAL AMOUNT field should  have Negative amount.<br />
please let me know when such scenario  arises.<br />
<br />
With Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">23rd December 2009, 05:02</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, i found the same thing.<br />
still havent found the exact reason.<br />
But i can replicate the condition with input hours accounting negative , and use negative material issue line then you run report order complete.<br />
then the receipt value will be negative.<br />
Now i found the problem again, and i find that theres no negative posting for hours and material also .its really confusing , any one can help?</div></div><hr />

             I have tried  your procedure but i couldnt  get a negative amount  in INVENTORY RECEIPT TRANSACTIONS  session by consuming -ve inventory and posting negative hours. However, let us see for responses from other friends.<br />
thanks for your effort and sharing your information and let me know if you are able to get negative amount.<br />
<br />
With Regards,<br />

I have replicate it and can get the negative amount .<br />
eg: you add a BOM line with negative qty . then you issue this material line which add qty in the inventory, then run report order complete .<br />
My problem is, theres strange amount (some times its negative some times its not) but i can not figure it out, wheres the value came from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">6th January 2010, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi vijayendra, i also found negative value again, but without adding BOM line.<br />
and i find that it happen if i use partial confirm receipt for production receipt.<br />
is it also happen in ur system?</div></div><hr />
