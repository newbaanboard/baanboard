<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">25th May 2004, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Is anyone aware if the supply chain functionality of baanIVc4 SCH1 namely selfbilling, purchase and sales schedules is included in Gemini I know they failed to get this stuff working properly in the version 5 releases and eventually gave up and removed it. But I assumed it would be returned in Gemini I have heard that this is not the case and features are still missing. If this is true what happens to the companies (mainly automotive) on this version there is no upgrade path. Is this a similar problem for the other extensions like A&amp;D,MCR are they also locked in at IV or is it only the SCH0,SCH1,AGS0,NAS0 extensions</div></div><hr />

Would be worth rechecking...</div></div><hr />

&quot;ags2&quot; with new functionalities and for an easier way to migrate to SSA ERP LN (Baan 6) later.<br />
SSA told us in Febr. 2004, this will be come in the mid of 2004 for 4c4.<br />
The reason for this is clear if you read the posted before.</div></div><hr />

I did full test on migrating from NAS0 to AGS0.  Attached are the steps I took in doing the testing.<br />
<br />
Note:  The conversion routine will work with Sch0, Sch1 or Nas0.<br />
Also, I did these test about a year ago.  I don't think anything has changed since then.  BTW, I'm still running Nas0.<br />
