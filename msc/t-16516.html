I´m new on fabrication module. Please help me on this.<br />
I want to produce a new item. The item is composed by materials and hours of work. For the material I use the BOM to create the structure I need but I can´t include cost items like hours of work.<br />
<br />
How can I include the hours in my created Item? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glisha</div><div class="date">11th September 2004, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">For all produced items you need to specify BOM (material costs) and Routing (operation costs). You have already specified material costs and now you need to specify operation costs.<br />
<br />
Routing is defined by work centers, machines, tasks and operations. There are two ways for defining operation costs. You may defined price for every work center with all operations on that WC. The second way is that you may define operation rates for every operation that can include the costs of machines and costs of labor.<br />
<br />
I have always defined the costs for every operation, because it's the most common way of calculation of costs. In this way you may devide machine costs to partial costs of machine, if you have one.<br />
