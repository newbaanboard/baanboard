<br />
Is it possible to setup LOT control so that the LOT number is generated when a production order is released? ( Similar to the way serial numbers work in LN ). We need the LOT number so that it can be applied to the units during manufacturing. We're on FP3.<br />
<br />
I've heard that it's possible but cannot figure out how to setup.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

Your requirement is possible for Serial Items, as far as my knowledge Lot number will not be generated during creation or release of production order.<br />
<br />
Lot number will be generated or can be generated when we report operations completed <br />
<br />

<br />
I wonder if anyone has found a workaround for this or has developed a way to use the serial number mask to act like a LOT number. Do to the nature of our product we cannot apply the LOT number at the end of production, it needs to be applied at the beginning to our units.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />
