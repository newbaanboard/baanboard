i'm trying to get how much we consumed of a purchase order in a shop floor.<br />
from the sales order, i'm able to get the lot that they used.<br />
but with the lot, where the lot number is composed of the shop floor number, i want to get the purchase order used and see how much we consumed on that.<br />
most of my info is from tdinv700 or tdilc301 but the link between them is in tdilc401 (outbound)<br />
problem is if the release the outbound, the data is gone.<br />
must be another place in Baan that has this info.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />
