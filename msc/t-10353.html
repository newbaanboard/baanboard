<br />
changing the item type from Manufactured to Purchased does not delete the BOM. Very useful in our case :) , because the item is a kind of kit-item and we still want to keep the information of the item's components in our system. Is there any negative impact when BOM's of former manufactured items are not deleted? I checked the costprice calculation, inventory transactions and MRP, but could not find any problems.<br />

I am using the same trick for many years now but havn't got any problems at all.</div></div><hr />

An example is &quot;hidden&quot; spareparts (ie a cylinder we buy; the customer can order a subitem of this cylinder when it is broken)</div></div><hr />

Not a problem but just something for purchasing dept to be aware of.<br />
Also if you use EDM to maintain revision control of boms unless you also switch the e-item to purchased there will be no visibility of the change until someone tries to copy the newly revised e-bom to production and standard Baan will not allow it. You get a message &quot;item is not manufactured&quot;. We overcame this with a customization but still something else to watch out for.<br />
