    somebody please tell me if it is still  possible to delete serial end item as-built headers for already released Production order?<br />
    <br />
    1. we are processing rework production orders, and since it is rework it should not generate new serial numbers.<br />
    2. I understand, the system will assign the same serial numbers once the FG is already picked and issued for production.<br />
    3. The warehouse issued the FG to production for rework even without the picking list yet thus the FG is still in the To issue by Warehouse<br />
 <br />
   4.The problem now is, last operation was already completed even item #3 is not yet done.  The system now assigned  new set of serial numbers for the order.<br />
   5. Impact, inventory is doubled in the system<br />
  <br />
Appreciate your response in advance<br />
