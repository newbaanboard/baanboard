When I use project code in production order with customised item and report production order completion, system does not generate any entry. <br />
<br />
Can any one explain me is this is a bug or standard functionality?<br />
<br />
If it is standard functionality then what is the sequence of entries system should generate for production order completion?</div></div><hr />

   That to me is the standard functionality (up until SP19). No entries are generated (correct me if i am wrong) at the time of completing a Customized Production Order. The only entries you would find in integration table at or around Completion time is the ProductionSFC-Inventory Transfer ones. This is equivalent to the ProductionSFC-Issue of standard orders and are logged in the integration table when you issue materials. To get further entries you need to Close the customized production order &amp; subsequently the Project. <br />

What sukesh says is absolutely write. When you complete production order of customized item, no financial entries are generated. Following are some of the financial entries generated for PCS projects :<br />
<br />
1.  Purchase / Material Cost - When customized items are brought from supplier<br />
<br />
2.  Production SFC / Material Cost - When material is issued to production order of customized item.<br />
<br />
3.  Production SFC / Subcontracting - When operations are subcontracted and  subcontract PO is generated for then at the time of receipt against subcon PO, this entry is generated.<br />
<br />
4.  PCS / Actual Cost of Goods Sold - When PCS project is closed, this entry is generated which ultimately reverses project WIP and takes Project WIP    value to RM consumption account.<br />
<br />
For detailed integration details, just give me your personal id, i will mail you financial integration document.<br />
