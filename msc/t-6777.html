<br />
We have routing defined for an item A which consist of<br />
four operations.  <br />
Backflushing will  be done automatically.  No hours accounting.<br />
<br />
The four operations are<br />
<br />
1. Cutting<br />
2. Welding<br />
3. Carpentary<br />
4. Fabricating<br />
<br />
Most of the cases,  the operations will be performed sequencially. So we dont face problem to complete each operations. <br />
But some cases,  more than one operation will start simultaniously like  (1)cutting of  metals and  (3)carpetary for wood works will start in the same time.   our problem is  we could not enter the quantity completed for (3)carpentary operation until the previous operations (1 and 2) quantity entered in the system.  <br />
<br />
How can we solve this problem ?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards.<br />

<br />
Thanks for ur suggestion.   Yes, I tried this before I put my question.  Still  system does not allow me to enter quantity<br />
completed  until I enter quantity for the previous operation.<br />
Is there any parameter to be setup.  ?<br />
I entered overlaping in the session <br />
tirou2110m000 (maintain routing...)<br />
<br />
Please help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why don't you seperate the whole thing into three different items / production orders, one for cutting, the other one for woodworks, and the third to put the things together? Since the operations are independent, that is what Baan would expect also from a production planning perspective. Or is that too much overhead?<br />

hi,<br />
<br />
It is too complicated to split in to many production order. Even if we do so, what will happen to the cost of the item.  <br />
<br />
Please help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The system is not allowing to enter the quantity<br />
completed for the operation No. (2) and <br />
It gives message &quot;Maximum quantity completed is 0&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note : Operation No. 1 qty completed is '0'<br />
<br />
How can we enter the qty for operation number 2.<br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">23rd September 2002, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading the operation names, I am guessing that following is what happens:<br />
You have metal materials. These metal materials undergo op 1 (cutting) and op 2 (welding)<br />
You also have wood materials. The wood materials undergo op 3 (carpentary)<br />
You then combine the operated metal and wood in op 4 (fabrication)<br />
<br />
If that's indeed the case, then you probably should explore the possibility of network routing instead of linear routing. By network routing, I mean<br />
<br />
Metal mat'l - (cutting) - (welding) - semi fin A<br />
                                                                      - (fab) - fin goods<br />
Wood mat'l  - (carpentary)           - semi fin B<br />
<br />
You would have to specify semi finished goods A &amp; B as phantom. That way, the whole thing will still be included inside 1 production order. If you didn't it'd split into 3 orders.<br />

Hi paul,<br />
<br />
Thanks for ur suggestion.  <br />
<br />
If I am not wrong,  the network routing is possible only for<br />
process item.   To define network routing,  we need to define<br />
relationship for operation (psrou2120m000) which exist under <br />
routing for process item.   <br />
<br />
Could u please explain more detail about phantom items.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddy G</div><div class="date">24th September 2002, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking for Paul...:<br />
<br />
Only thing you need to do is:<br />
Specify a correct BOM with &quot;EndItem&quot; having materials &quot;Metal&quot; and &quot;Wood&quot;, which should be phantoms (!! - flag on BOM-line)<br />
<br />
Then in Item - Routings specify the Cutting and Welding operations for &quot;Metal&quot;, the Carpenting operation for &quot;Wood&quot; and the Fabricating for &quot;EndItem&quot;. So in fact three different routings.<br />
<br />
When you create the Production Order for the EndItem, you will get operations like:<br />
<br />
                   10 (Fabricating &quot;EndItem&quot;)<br />
                   /<br />
100 --- 110 (Cutting &amp; Welding &quot;Metal&quot;)<br />
                   /<br />
            120 (Carpenting &quot;Wood&quot;)<br />
<br />
And you are allowed to do the parallel things you would like to do, because the mechanism of reporting quantities on previous operations won't find previous operations anymore for 10, 100 and 120.<br />
<br />
Of course still when reporting qties on operation 110, qties on operation 110 will be reported. <br />
And guess you like that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">24th September 2002, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Eddy G,<br />
<br />
Thanks for ur response. I followed as per ur suggestion.  When I create a Production order for 'EndItem' (which has two phantom item in BOM and both has individual operations defined ),   the operations for phantom item does not appear in the same production order. It shows only EndItem operation only. <br />
<br />
But  it  brings  the  sub-components of phantom item under estimated  materials which I think is correct.<br />
<br />
Is there any parameter settings to get operations of phantom item in the same production order (of EndItem).<br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddy G</div><div class="date">25th September 2002, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Noorulhaq,<br />
<br />
No, there is no parameter setting that I know may cause this.<br />
<br />
What BaaN version are you on?<br />
 - In BaanERP it might be the effective dates...<br />
 - Be sure the phantom operations are linked to the right Item.<br />
 &quot;Metal&quot; and &quot;Wood&quot;, so the phantom items.<br />
 - Are these standard to order Items? In that case I think it will try to find the routing of the Derived-from-Item.<br />
 - Did you check &quot;Standard Routing&quot; on the Item Routing. If you do so it will retrieve operations from the standard routing specified in stead of the operations you linked to this routing...!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...  Eddy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">25th September 2002, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Eddy G,<br />
<br />
We are using BaaN 4c4, WIN NT4, Sql ver 7.<br />
<br />
- Yes I checked all the operations defined for phantom items as well as  'EndItem'  are  correct.<br />
<br />
- The order policy of the items (Both 'EndItem' and Phantom items) was  'To Order'.  I tried with 'Anonymous' also.  But No Luck.<br />
<br />
- There was no standard routing defined for any of these items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me explain how I defined routing and phantom items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Master<br />
----------------<br />
                                                                <br />
<br />
Item A  - End item                                    <br />
Item B  - Metals    (Phantom item)            <br />
Item C  - Carpentary  (phantom Item)    <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bill Of Materials For Item A  are <br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
Item B,<br />
Item C      (phantom &quot;yes&quot; for both)<br />
<br />
<br />
Routing               <br />
-----------<br />
                            Operations<br />
<br />
Item A         -       Fabricating Operations  (No. 10)<br />
Item B         -       Cutting  (No.20)  and  Welding (No.30)<br />
Item C         -       Carpentary  (No.40)<br />
<br />
Production Order<br />
---------------------<br />
Item  A  <br />
<br />
<br />
Finally,  system shows only  Fabricating operation(10)  and does not show other operations  like 20,30 and 40.<br />
<br />
Hope it is more clear.  Please help.<br />

<br />
Ooh... Baan IV. I think this whole concept won' t work in that version.<br />
<br />
This (network routings) is new in Baan V (BaanERP).<br />
There besides the &quot;Operation&quot; we also have the &quot;Next Operation&quot;. Thus more than 1 operation can have the same &quot;Next Operation&quot;. This is what is called a network routing.<br />
<br />
So in the example:<br />
10 would have N.O. = 0 meaning it is the last operation.<br />
100 would have N.O. = 110 and<br />
110 would have N.O. = 10 (where phantom routing of &quot;Metal&quot; is linked to the main routing) and<br />
120 is also linked to 10.<br />
<br />
So... this might be one of the good reasons to think about BaanERP...?!<br />
