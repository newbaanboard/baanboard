<br />
we want to evaluate the expected inventory value for a certain date (i.e. end of financial period).<br />
<br />
It seems that session ticrp2201m000 is build for that issue, but the output is very poor. The session runs for hours and creates a few records in table ticrp020 only. Does anybody know the logic and calculation scheme behind it?<br />
<br />
Are there other (better) solutions available?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

You need to develop a customization to suit your requirement.<br />
To begin with you can get the current stock for a item. Then look at planned inventory movement table, upto the date you want to find the inv value for that item.  Then multiply the inv qty (actual + / - planned inv) with std cost (as applicable for that item and date combination).<br />
You can then print it as per your requirements for item / item group / warehouse / any other criteria.<br />
<br />
Hope this can give you some idea to start with.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes thing are not so easy as they appear: the session should not only consider the planned inventory movements but also the results from MRP, MPS and other inventory related modules. Anyway, we have already started to develop a session that merges all related tables. It seems not so complicated as I was afraid of :) .<br />
