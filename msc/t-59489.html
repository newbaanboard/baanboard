First I like to thank you for this question, many of my friends and few customer asked this, that time i was not able to answer. but after this form question today, i worked on it and found the functionality. it is as follow.<br />
<br />
If your Item is not Lot controlled or serial controlled, but if you selected the priority 1 as lot price and second as serial then what should be the item valuation method, that time it takes from Priority 3. I think this would stimulate the thought process in you, if it is not clear you can contact me in my mobile +919704750630</div></div><hr />
