<br />
I've encounter some weird problems, that is the delivered qty &gt; orderer qty for production order(pdo) subcontracting. But when i checked the purchase order(po), the approved qty is same with ordered qty.<br />
<br />
What is the procedure for receiving pdo subcontracting? so that i can check whether baan validate the delivered qty so it cannot bigger than ordered qty.</div></div><hr />

   It would be helpfull if you describe your subcontracting process.. What is being subcontracted? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">26th May 2008, 04:31</div></div><div class="posttext">before generating subcontracting order, routing process and subcontracting rate must be made for a certain item(manufactured item type in subcontracting item group) and supplier. After that i generate subcontracting order so that baan create pdo and po. after that i release the pdo, print po, and waiting for receipt.</div></div><hr />

Even I did this simulation and it allows for quantity to complete which is more than the planned output and sub-contract receipt (of PO). It looks a bug to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">26th May 2008, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
so what session did you run to increase the pdo subcontracting delivered qty? or what step did you run to receipt pdo subcontracting. i want to test it, and if its really can greater than ordered qty, i will add validation into that session.<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">26th May 2008, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible in Baan4 to receive more than the ordered quantity when you do a Purchase Receipt. Subcontracting order is nothing but a purchase order with a subcontracting item. So you would have to place some sort of a trigger on the pur045 table to deny the excess or to allow a pre-defined percentage above the ordered quantity....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">27th May 2008, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">i already add validation when receving po and also when report production order complete. but what if the case is like this......<br />
- Due to deadline in closing pdo, user run session report production order complete with delivered quantity = ordered quantity when receipt po is still 0. So the delivered quantity in pdo is same with its ordered quantity<br />
- The ordered item is come and user make receipt then inbound, so that delivered qty in po is same with ordered qty(assume that the item is not inspection)<br />
- After inbound, how about delivered qty in pdo? is it became 2 x ordered qty or not?</div></div><hr />

When you are validating the receiving quantity for the subcontracted production order operation, instead of validating it against purchase order quantity (corresponding PO), validate it against purchase order receipt quantity.<br />
This should solve your problems.</div></div><hr />

How do you do validation ??<br />
<br />
I'm dealing with the same problem, ist here a way to receipt negative quantity on subcontracting purchase order in Baan IV, since system does not allow adding lines with subcontracting items.</div></div><hr />

run report pdo complete doesn't mean that those pdo status changed into complete, i only change field quantity to deliver, so delivered quantity increase.<br />
<br />
@csjoshi<br />
yes i added validation when user change qty to deliver with received pdo qty and with all approved receipt qty for subcont po. So with this i assume there will be no more qty delivered &gt; qty ordered<br />
<br />
@justone<br />
i add validation on the event when value in field qty to deliver change, check it if inputted qty to deliver is &gt; than order qty and if qty to deliver is &gt; than summary of all approved po qty for that pdo, since 1 pdo can have 1 or more po</div></div><hr />
