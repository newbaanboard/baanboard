<br />
I have an item in our system where when a Production Order is raised for a top level part but the quantity for the bottom level part does not match the BOM qty of the item.<br />
<br />
ie. Top level part A qty ordered (tisfc001.qrdr) =100 <br />
Bottom level part B net qty (ticst001.qune) = 66 <br />
<br />
The BOM qty for the bottom level part is 1 and the Production Order has been raised manually.<br />
<br />
Which tables do I need to check to trace this issue ?<br />
<br />
Cheers Neal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 07:32</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Do you use projects(pcs) and therefore estimated customized bom?<br />
2) In the standard BOM of the main item(A), does item B have a &quot;Length&quot; and &quot;Width&quot; defined or whats the value in the field &quot;Number of units&quot;?<br />
3) Check the BOM unit of the main item (A) in the item master.<br />
4) Last but not least, check the tdinv150 table, which is the planned inventory transaction table, to see whats the quantity planned for the item B..<br />
<br />
These are the checks i could think of..<br />

<br />
1) No we do not use projects<br />
2) Length = 0, Width = 0 and number of units = 0<br />
3) BOM unit in item master = 0<br />
4) Quantity in the Planned Inventory Transaction is 45.2571. What is taken into consideration when calculating this figure.<br />

<br />
How were you able to enter that value? In Item Master, this particular field wouldnt accept 0s, atleast in my case. I am not sure if there is any customization at your end but under normal circumstances, the BOM unit should be a value greater than 0. So care to throw some light on this?<br />
<br />
==&gt; 4) Quantity in the Planned Inventory Transaction is 45.2571. What is taken into consideration when calculating this figure.<br />
<br />
I take it that the combination of Order Type and Transaction Type for the above quantity was [Production Order] and [Material Requirement]. If so, then the planned quantity is nothing but the quantity that is &quot;to be&quot; issued to a production order. Therefore if you had issued it partially, only the balance to be issued will be shown here. Before any issues happen, this is exactly the same quantity that was estimated at the time of production order creation. <br />

<br />
Looking at our item master all of our components are set up like this and the system will accept zero if we change it. No customisation at this end but we are running ags0.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes you are correct this figure is the subsequent delivery.<br />

PS. I will talk to support to try and get some assistance with the net quantity of the component part in ticst001 and post their findings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The BOM Unit in the item master is the number of units your BOM is based on. By definition this only involves manufactured items, so you can't modify this field for purchased items. It's normally (0), but if it's something else it just has no effect. If you change a purchased item with BOM Unit (0) to manufactured, you get an error &quot;Quantity not allowed&quot;, though in typical Baan fashion it doesn't give you any indication of what field it's referring to. Enter a value of 1 or greater and it accepts it. Change it back to purchased and it just retains the value in the field but doesn't use it.<br />
<br />
For manufactured items BOM Unit should normally be (1). If you use unusually small quantities of something in the BOM, you can base the BOM on some multiple quantity so that the quantity of the BOM line isn't too miniscule to use.</div></div><hr />
