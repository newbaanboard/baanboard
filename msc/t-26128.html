Hi Folks !<br />
            <br />
           When u r making a new item , by copying from an old &amp; existing item , with copy &quot;BOM&quot; &amp;&quot; ROUTING&quot; options , ( The easier &amp; Time saving option ) , the following problems r encountered , which r not desirable :<br />
<br />
1 ) In PBOM , the effective dates for the old items/Lines come,  as a default effective dates , for th new items/ lines .<br />
    U have to over-write the new dates of all these lines on the old effective dates.<br />
2 ) In PBOM , all the expired lines r also carried forward to the PBOM of the new item .<br />
3 ) In the session &quot;Display PBOM &quot; ( Session No : tibom1510m000 ) , all these expired lines r also displayed , which will confuse the user , while checking for the items /lines in the new PBOM .<br />
<br />
          R these soft-ware problem ? If so , r they being addressed in BaaN-IV , C-4 version , or in other higher versions of BaaN  , under preparation ?<br />
Has any of the BaaN users ,  complained about these problems before ?<br />
<br />
Kindly throw some light on these !<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

As far as I understand your problem you want to have a kind of itelligent copy procedure? Hard to define what would be more intelligent rather than to duplicate each field. A manual post processing will be necessary anyway I think...<br />

Dear Mr.Martin Jung ,<br />
                            Than x for the reply , but in our case , making a fresh PBOM mannually , for a new Manufacturing Item , is a very tedious &amp; time consuming process . That's why we resort to copying from asimilar type of item , option .<br />
                            But , when u r printing the PBOM ( Multi-Level ) , these problems of expired lines , surprisingly , disappear . U encounter these problems , only in &quot;Maintain PBOM&quot; , or &quot;Display PBOM&quot; sessions . Why ??     Of corse ! The old dates problem for other lines , still persist.<br />
<br />
Than X , in anticipation ,<br />
<br />

Dear Maria ,<br />
               I had not logged in this case to SSA . Anyway , I hope they r also viewing this problem , in this forum . In that case , they should take-up this case , in the interest of all users of BaaN &amp; try to solve it .<br />
               I had good response from this forum before , for the problems faced by us . I'm not sure of the same from SSA.<br />

<br />
Hi bvrao54,<br />
There may be a simple reason why the problem of expired lines dissapear in the report. What's the value you enter in the print session for the Check Date? This field refers to the expiry in the BOM. If you leave it blank all lines of the BOM should appear on the report regardless to the expiry date. If a certain date is specified, all lines (expiry date &gt; check date) will be printed. This is standard functionality. This option is not available in the Maintain BOM or Display BOM session.<br />
<br />
By the way we use the copy functionality as well rather than to create a new BOM manually. But as I already said, manual postprocessing will be reqiured anyway.<br />
<br />

<br />
One advise for you...<br />
<br />
Please do not put all your eggs in one basket by only posting your problem on BaanBoard.<br />
BAAN Support will never pick up your problem from our board. Officially there is no relationship between BaanBoard and SSA Global.<br />
As long as your company pays their annual maintenance fees you can log cases with BAAN Support and at the same time you can keep logging the same issues at our board. This dual approach is always your best bet for getting the solutions the fastest way.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

Dear Mr. Edwin ,<br />
 Than X for the advice ! May be u r right ! I must post this problem to SSA Global Support ! <br />
                    It's a pity they don't go through the problems discussed in this Forum , in the larger interests of the BaaN users ! Especially , if it's a Universal Problem  &amp; correct their soft-ware ! Of course ! We'll post the problems to them , if they r specific to our company !<br />
                    There's one more problem  nagging me , which , I wanted to share in this Forum . It's regarding finding a Record , say a receipt No , in the session &quot;Display Receipts &quot; ( Session No : tdpur4531m000 ) , using the &quot;FIND&quot; ( Telescope ) option . <br />
                    One is taken to the next receipt No , in stead , in BaaN . One has to punch , the previous Receipt No , in order to counter this problem . Also , it takes a few minutes , if u r scrolling upwards , in this session , where as , scrolling downwards , does not take any time lag .<br />
                    Do any other users of BaaN-IV , C-4 , face similar kind of problems ? Kindly, throw some light on this .<br />
<br />
Than X , in anticipation ,<br />

<br />
I would make a new post for your second issue.<br />
In that way you have separated the two.<br />
<br />
Last year SSA Global almost shut down our board because they did not like us to use the name &quot;Baan&quot; in BaanBoard. In a way they allow us to exist but if they want they can shut down the board whenever they want.<br />
That is the exact relationship between SSA Global and BaanBoard.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

Dear Mr.Edwin ,<br />
                    Than X for the reply &amp; for the information about ur relationship with SSA GLOBAL . Also Than X , for seperating my two Threads .<br />
                     Now , I only request , the other users of this Forum , to let me know whether they r facing similar type of problems or not ?<br />
