<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">2nd March 2004, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We have items that need to be reworked every month or so. We do not use lot control, and when these items go through rework we issue a rework production order. The item then gets a new inventory date when the rework order is complete (which is a good thing and a bad thing). A report runs daily showing all items older than 30 days (based on the new inventory date of the reworked item) - and that is how we know when it is time to rework. <br />
<br />
While we do like the fact that Baan stamps the item with the new inventory date - we actually need to keep track of the original date as well - because we run into problems where we lose visibility of the original manufacture date and FIFO becomes impossible to manage - and we end up scrapping the material.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else run into this issue - and if so, is there a workaround? I guess we actually need to track 2 dates Â– original manufacture date and new reworked date (which is only used for the 30 day old report)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">just_fro</div><div class="date">2nd March 2004, 23:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say : use Lot control.....<br />
and consequently change your report to use the 'lot-dates'<br />
<br />
<br />
Another option might be to change your report in such a way that it 'collects' all warehousetransactions and use the qss.sort and qss.search options to 'track' your original receipt date. (inventory date links inventory to the rework order so your 'real'inventory date is the date of the last order before the 'rework' order ? )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">8th March 2004, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We do not want to use lot control - because we are not using it on other product lines, and because we have a &quot;KISS&quot; approach to this system (keep it simple). When we were on Baan 4 we used LTC and the # of steps to get through each transaction was huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">8th March 2004, 22:55</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan IVc 4<br />
If you have location history enabled (check location parameters) and you were manually issuing the item to the new re-work order, that information would be stamped in the location history table.<br />
<br />
You could build a report based on tdilc301 (Baan IVc 4) that would show :<br />
<br />
Item A: Inventory Date: Nov 01, 2003<br />
manufactured on Production Order 123 <br />
<br />
Item A: Inventory Date : Nov 01, 2003<br />
Issued to Production Order 126<br />
Item A: Inventory Date : Dec 04, 2003<br />
manufactured on Production Order 126<br />
<br />
Item A: Inventory Date : Dec 04, 2003<br />
Issued to Production Order 212<br />
Item A: Inventory Date : Jan 10, 2004<br />
manufactred on Production Order 212<br />
<br />
and so on,<br />
if Baan 5b tracks the history at the same level of detail as Baan IVc 4, you should be able to make this work.<br />
<br />
Note, multiple items (quantity &gt; 1) on any inventory date, might make this not work.<br />
