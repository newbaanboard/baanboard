<br />
&quot;Article still present in other tables&quot; I have tried everything but IÂ’m running out of options.<br />
<br />
I have used session ttaad4229m000. Article only present in tiitm100 can not delete this record.<br />
<br />
I have looked in the program script of session tiitm0203m000. But I can not find this problem. <br />
<br />
Does somebody know what is going wrong here.</div></div><hr />

  Why delete? Why not just block the itemcode by creating a signal code which blocks it from being used. This is the best way to deal with itemcodes that wont be used again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">18th December 2006, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you ever re-use an existing number for a different item? That will cause nothing but confusion history problems.Was the number ever used as the original item? Unless the number was created and nothing more than giving it an engineering revision and BOM was ever done to it, there are going to be references in other tables that cannot be deleted and it's a lot of work to track them down.<br />
<br />
Numbers are free. I'd assign a new one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you really need to re-use the item number, then why do you want to delete it ?<br />
The item is in several history tables, so you can't just delete it.  If you would archive first, you might have a better chance.</div></div><hr />
