Need to have Enterprise Planning create a production order directly from a sales order ignoring economic stock.  <br />
<br />
In other words, company wants some customer orders fulfilled from one and only one production order regardless of current economic stock levels.  Usually, this is on the basis of order quantity.  For example, Item A has 20 in inventory.  Customer orders 1000.  Enterprise Planning creates Planned Production Order for 980.  This is not acceptable.  The result we are looking for is one production order of 1000.  The decision as to whether this sales order line item is fulfilled as a MTO vs a combination of MTO/pull from inventory in determined manually, by the sales order entry clerk at order entry.  This decision is based on order quantity.<br />
<br />
Lot control is not an option.  I have tested Channels thoroughly with no success.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

You might have to just create the order manually in SFC if safety stock needs to be ignored.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the information.<br />
<br />
Pardon my ignorance, but what really are the effects of specifying an item as Anonymous vs. Make To Order?<br />
<br />
I have seen the ability, in other systems (MAPICS), to create a production order directly from a sales order.  Planning still sees it for capacity, materials etc...  but it doesn't necessarily have to be created in planning. <br />
<br />
My thinking now is to create a customization that will populate the Production Order session with the Sales Order Line data, Routing etc...  I don't want to invest the time or money if I can get Baan to do it for me.  This company does too much volume to consider workarounds such as using revisions or PCS. <br />
<br />
What does Anonymous vs. Make To Order really do?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askajale</div><div class="date">21st March 2003, 22:27</div></div><div class="posttext">How about using PCS? you can create the new project for each sales order and in that case EP will not consider existing stock.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">22nd March 2003, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">PCS isn't an option because of the volume of orders, at least right now.  If it comes down to a customization or PCS who knows.  Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">24th March 2003, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">If you use a &quot;To Order&quot; item the system will generate a PCS project from the sales order and run planning when exiting the sales order. This creates a planned order and you have the option to ignore current stock.<br />
The system can also automatically confirm these orders so all you would have to do is transfer the order. <br />
<br />
In the zoom session there is the option to select Maintain production order. This means you can manually enter the production order from the sales order. This looks like the easiest way. You could cust. this session to copy your info into a new production order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
did you have a look at Sales quotations?. You could raise a Sales Quotation for a &quot;dummy&quot; customer to cover your stock holdings, then every Sales order raised will create a production order for the quantity needed. The Sales Quoation can remain in the system as long as you need it.<br />
