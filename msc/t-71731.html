<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ondwick</div><div class="date">22nd February 2019, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an issue with hours not accruing for certain operation steps within a work order.  i.e. we have estimated hours for the step, but no hours accrue as we move through the step.  Upon complete and close, we see no hour accounted for those steps.  It does seem to be happening with newer items and tasks we've created or updated.  We think the tasks and work centers are all setup properly -- as it is estimating hours per each step in the work order.  If they are set up correctly, what else may be broken in the hours accounting that stops the hours from accruing?   I have an order in front of me with 36 operation steps, and we have hours accrued for only 4 steps.   Any thoughts would be helpful.   <br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

If backflushing, then please check its setup is correct, if not backflushing, then hours need to be booked against the order step in HRA session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ondwick</div><div class="date">20th March 2019, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes that was the case.  Sorry I should have responded to my question once we found the answer.   <br />
A change in business meant we needed to create several new tasks.  Many had the backflushing set to No at the task level.   However fixing that did not automatically update our routings.  We had to go into each routing for each affected operation step and change the flag there as well.  And then if we wanted to affect open work orders, we had to update each work order step through Maintain Planning by Planning Board.<br />
A fair bit of keypunching to fix our codes.  But we're now seeing the hours pull through.<br />
Good learning for us, as we have had this issue for many years in a more minor way.  It wasn't until we saw this as a huge issue, that we investigated.  <br />
Thanks for the response abattoir!</div></div><hr />
