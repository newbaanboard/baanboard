<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">16th February 2004, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there an easy way to import data from an Excel Spreadsheet to create an EBOM in IVc4? I'd like to automate what can be a very tedious and error-prone operation - manually entering a new BOM. The engineers can output a list of materials into Excel from their design package. If I could then dump this directly into an EBOM (the E-Items would have already been created) it would save a lot of time and eliminate some possible human error entering all that data manually.<br />

To me this method is easy considering how many of them I have written, but it could still be a matter of opinion.  You might want to check out the API/OLE function server forum.  You could even go so far as to write this code in VB if you wanted to - same forum.<br />

If this is an ongoing process then an option might be the WISEPLM product from Fullscope (http://www.fullscope.com/enginee_sol.htm) which provides connectivity with CAD systems.</div></div><hr />

 We have the same problem. Can you post your solution if you found out?  Thanks<br />

I used to work for) created an interface between CAD-systems and EDM (for standard, anonimous items) and PCS (for complete Project driven BOM's, including new PCS-items and standard items as well)<br />
<br />
In order to process project changes (e.g. by customers request) we've had some customizations programms which automatically updates estimated materials in SFC-orders (which status &lt;= planned) so in case new BOM's need to be uploaded: no big deal.<br />
Let me know if you wanna know more.<br />

Our IT department bans any VBA program on Baan, special writing. Until today, we use VBA to read data without their permission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Our IT guys were able to get me going on this using Exchange, and set it up so that I can do it myself. <br />
<br />
Most applications that can create a BOM seem to be able to output it in Excel format. I add a sheet to the file and re-arrange the columns to a defined format. In the end I save it as a single-sheet .csv file. I run a batch file that ftp's the file to the Unix server where Baan can get to it (I think that's what it does). Now running tuxch0223m000 Import Data (Non-Regular)brings the BOM in. They gave me permission for this and put it in the  EDM menu tree for easy access. Works great. It even fills the BOM text if there is any. We use BOM text for reference designator info on circuit boards, which can be a long , tedious, error-prone process to enter. Now it's almost instant, and the data is a as good as what the engineer supplies me. I found this process is worth using for any new BOM with 13-15 lines or more.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't tell you the details of the batch file or exactly how exchange works, but from what I've seen, if you have a tools person, they should be able to set this up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justone</div><div class="date">8th July 2004, 12:20</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have a file with known structure (i.e. comma or tab limited) you can try importing it with seq.() commands. I'm currently working on session which will import single-level BOM exported from Zuken (PCB design software) into EDM module. I attached script which I use. I enter the main item and file path on form (it must be located on AIX server) and then import it. Please note that the script is not finished yet, it just reads the line from ascii and truncates it into corresponding table fields.</div></div><hr />
