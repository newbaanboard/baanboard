<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AndrewdCSE</div><div class="date">6th October 2008, 01:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently sending multiple parts to a Supplier/Subcontractor to be coated.  We are transferring the parts into a specific warehouse, creating a Purchase Order for the total coating value (calculated in a Crystal Report) and sending the Transfer and Purchase Order to the Supplier/Subcontractor.  On receipt of the parts we then transfer the parts to the stocking warehouse and process the Purchase Order as normal.  We are keeping the same part number for both Coated and Uncoated parts.<br />
<br />
Is there a way in Baan that we can create 2 part numbers (uncoated &amp; coated).  Create a routing for the part to add the coating to the part and, therefore, change the part number to the coated part number.  Create 1 Purchase order for multiple parts requiring the same coating from the same subcontractor.  Then, on receipt of the parts, receive them as the coated part number in the stocking warehouse. :confused:</div></div><hr />

The routing operation for the manufactured item has a work center defined for the coating business partner.  <br />
The production order is then used to generate a subcontract purchase order with a subcontracting-type item on the order.<br />
The receipt of the coated item happens when the production order is closed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you generate multiple production orders onto a single subcontract purchase order?</div></div><hr />
