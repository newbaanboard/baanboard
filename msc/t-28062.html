<br />
I took a process chart that I have prepared for LN and changed it to BAAN IV for you.<br />
Just follow the steps in the chart. It should give you a good overview of the processes.<br />
I have also prepared other charts in English and German for BaanERP and LN. There are more steps but the idea of the process is always the same. Please let me know if you are interessed in this stuff.<br />
<br />

Thanks a lot for the powerpoint presentation. We are planning to move on to ERP LN. Can you provide me some info about the manufacturing process in LN.. How different is it from BAAN IV.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
I also prepared a process chart of the processes in shop floor control with LN. I could write much about new functionalities in LN but it would take too much place. I just can tell you that I do not like it but I love LN (with some expections).<br />
<br />
The main difference for shop floor control is that there is a new module for warehousing. All material is handled in this module regardless if the origin of the order is production, purchase, transfer etc. Thus there is no more negative receipt and no negative shipment/issue.<br />
<br />
The steps for issues and receipts may confuse you but it is possible to define simple warehouse procedures in order to skip them. In addition it is possible to automate mandatory steps. Backflushing and direct issue to warehouse when you report orders completed is also still possible.<br />
<br />
Yours<br />
