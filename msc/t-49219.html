Both MPS items.<br />
I would like to generete (based on the sales demand of the manufactured item) a MPS-order for the manufactured item as well as for the (MPS) subassembly. <br />
<br />
Is this possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">12th March 2008, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is possible, you can define both the item as MPS and can also give forecast for each one of them. The forecast for sub assembly should be of independent demad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">inalfa01</div><div class="date">17th March 2008, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">The demand of the subassembly has to be generated automatically as a result of the demand of the main item.<br />
So I don't want to enter a demand on the subassembly. It has to be generated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">17th March 2008, 12:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, thats all standard functionality in Baan. <br />
I mentioned about forecast, say if you have a demand coming from spare sparts sales etc, such demand can be forecasted and put as forecast. The requirement coming from top level is dependent demand as it comes from the explosion of BOM. <br />
So one can handle both dependent and independent demand in MPS<br />

<br />
I have a sales order of item 'ASSY'. In the BOM of that item there is item 'SUBASSY'. Both items are MPS items.<br />
If I now generate MPS I only get a MPS production order of 'ASSY'.<br />
I would like somehow to also get a MPS production order for 'SUBASSY'.<br />
So withhout manual intervention.<br />
I think this cannot be done?</div></div><hr />

I am not sure what solution of MPS program you have. The latest version of MPS program will explode the BOM of material. I know in older version of MPS program , one has to generate MPS of parent and then run MRP and then again generate the MPS to see the requirement coming down to next level.<br />
