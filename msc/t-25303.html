<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glisha</div><div class="date">8th October 2005, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a very interesting situation. I have 2 logistical and financial companies that share same work center as resouces. Those companies have separate planning, but every planner have to see total resource master plan. <br />
<br />
I defined one fictive company with supplying relations and I achieved to aggregate demands, but I didn't obtain to aggregate planned production orders. Also, I didn't obtain to have cumulative resource master plan.<br />
<br />
I thought about second solution. I tried to define all the resources in first company and to share this resources in second company (using Logical tables in Baan Tools). When I looked resource master plan there was only utilization from first company. <br />
<br />
Any ideas how to solve this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan user</div><div class="date">10th October 2005, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">You second scenario will never work, since you need to define way too many logical table links.<br />
Your first scenario however should work. This is what multi site planning is all about. I cannot determine what you have done wrong in your set up, did you define the appropiate supplying rules?<br />
basically you should have 2 logistic companies, in which the demand is created (drp or sales), and the third logistic company, which should take care of the production. The production planning therefore will only take place in this third logistic company, there will be no aggregated production planning from the other 2 companies.<br />
I understand this will not help you sufficiently, ut in my opinion your first scenario will be supported 100% by Baan, if the setup is done correctly!<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
First scenario have to work or I am a dead man.  :o <br />
<br />
In addition to my first message, I want to explain the situation further.<br />
<br />
If I am understood you correctly, you were explaning centralized logistic (production) company, so demands would come from other 2 logistic companies, by aggregation.<br />
<br />
My situation is deferent, I have 2 independant logistic and financial companies with 90% of common resources. The plannning is completely independant per each company, but planners must have a possibility to see what is the utilization of shared resources (work centers). Therefore, I defined one fictive (non-physical) company for that reason.<br />
<br />
Baan offers standard functionality that each planner has a utilization of every work centers caused only by his demands, but not others. <br />
<br />
Any ideas???<br />
