<br />
I'm not sure whether I'm running Baan 3.1 or IV (that's a different thread).<br />
<br />
However, <br />
<br />
My users are coming up with an error and I haven't been able to track down the reason.<br />
<br />
The error is:<br />
<br />
&quot;Runtime Calendar not found when planning (Forward) for work center 901 on 12-18-2003 with 7 hours planning time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The error occurs in tisfc1101s000.<br />
<br />
A similar error also occurs while trying to set up a new production order. <br />
<br />
The errors just started happening, so as of yet, I haven't been able to establish a clear pattern but what little data I have seems to point to mid to late december dates.<br />
<br />
Our baan system uses one calendar, the company calendar, &quot;ZZZ&quot;.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any information about the calendar features in Baan, as I've yet to find some documentation on it. <br />
<br />
Our system has been running since 1996, and the calendar goes back that far. <br />
<br />
In session tirou0100m000, <br />
<br />
Stored Days into Future : 500<br />
<br />
I would guess that the calendar is automatically updated to reflect this, but the current situation seems to say otherwise.<br />
<br />
I have located the sessions for maintaining calendars (tirou4101m000) and updating calendars (tirou4201m000).<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated, please post if you need more information to help me.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Insert the dates into the future and remember to update your calendar after any changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm new to Baan, so this may sound like a simple question, but, <br />
<br />
Do I have to manually input everyday for the next year into my company calender?<br />
<br />
Can I just set a range in the maintain session, then update it and be done?<br />
<br />
How do I add years to the calender?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be an option to copy a day to a range of days. This range can be over several years.<br />
The location of this session is dependend on the version of Baan you have. Should be close to maintain calendar lines. Maybe on the specific menu in the session.<br />
Remember to update.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I created a default calendar, and just expanded the date range.<br />
<br />
After I updated, it fixed the users's error, but when I go to 'maintain calendar' it only shows to the end of 2003. <br />
<br />
Is that normal or should I copy the days as you specified above?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">You should move the end date of the calendar to the future and copy the days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">2nd October 2003, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I think I'm starting to understand. <br />
<br />
Even though I increased the length of the calendar, I need to copy days there also?<br />
<br />
Thanks SO much, I really appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />
