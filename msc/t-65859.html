There is any transaction in BaaN that help me to freeze a specific quantity of my inventory (for example my safety stock or a percentage of my on hand), so people cannot outbound all the stock without permission!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">20th March 2014, 19:15</div></div><div class="posttext">You can create a dummy location, move the inventory there and block it for all transaction. Or you can create dummy order (may be production, sales replenishment) and hard allocate the same, so it cnnot be used by any other.<br />

In fact, my problem is chronic. In the warehouse, after the inbound, they drain all the Bin parts in canteens to be ready for the issue. Unfortunately, my On hand drop to zero and I’ve to order again even if my floor stock will cover six months or more. I know this is a process issue and not BaaN one, but I don’t have power to change it now. So I’m asking, if there is any configuration that I could do to stop issuing my safety stock for all my bin parts.<br />

<br />
Could you please give more details about this customization? Is it: &quot; create a dummy location, move the inventory there and block it for all transaction&quot;? If yes, hwo to do it?<br />
<br />
By the way could you please reply to my old post . &quot;Phantom or Generic item/ BOM&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm a new user and your support is very appreciated:) <br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

Here is what my customization would be.<br />
<br />
1. I will create a new session where you can enter the item, location and quantity to be blocked, and I will create the hstory of any such chnages<br />
2. This will increase the allocation in inventory and any other user will not be able to do this w/o using this new session.<br />
It is a very straightforward customization.<br />
<br />
For your Generic Item I need to know more about what you intend to do. If you want we can take it offline. My email id is avpatil@hotmail.com<br />
