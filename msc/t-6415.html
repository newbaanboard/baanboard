With this have come an increased amount of changeovers (as I expected). Can Baan help minimize changeovers by planning like items together? If so...how?</div></div><hr />

Are all items MTO?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets say I make item A,B,C,D,E,F,G<br />
<br />
Items A,B and C are all similar products, except for minor differences in packaging. They do not require changeovers when swithing among item<br />
<br />
Items D,E and F are all similar products, except for minor differences in packaging. They do not require changeovers when swithing among items<br />
<br />
Item G is totally unique. <br />
<br />
Lets say I have demand for all of the items during a given week. I am looking for something which will plan items A,B and C together, and then D, E and F together, and then item G alone, so I dont have to run, for example, item A, then switch to item G, then switch back to item C, then switch to item F etc</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">You might want to look at cyclic planning. Normally used for repetitive items so I don't know what the effect will be on MTO items. <br />
You allso might want to look at why you have all your items as MTO. If you have your safety stock at 0 in MTS you get the same effect but loose the tracking per order on the lower items in the BOM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your question reflects a typical situation when a company switches from MTS to MTO, in the sense that manufacturing lead times need to be reduced in order to support the transition.<br />
<br />
You want to reduce change-over time because you need to reduce your manufacturing lead time.<br />
Manufacturing lead time needs to be reduced in order to meed the promised delivery dates, in order to:<br />
a. Maintain customer satisfaction.<br />
b. Improve your throughput (money flow)<br />
<br />
MRP will not do this (not Baan's MRP or any other MRP) per definition!<br />
<br />
To reach these goals you need a &quot;smart&quot; planning engine that can:<br />
a. Identify bottlenecks in the manufacturing process because work stations which are not bottlenecks don't need to be scheduled efficiently.<br />
b. Prioritize jobs on the bottleneck stations according to due date.<br />
c. considder change-over dependencies between similar items on bottleneck stations.<br />
 <br />
If this issue becomes critical in your ability to switch to MTO then  I suggest to considder interfacing Baan to an external planning engine, an investment which can be well justified in terms of buttom line benefits to your company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 22:54</div></div><div class="posttext">What other external APS system does Baan interface with..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanana</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 07:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan has BaanSCS which is supposed to be an APS. It's much better than MRP but has 2 downsides:<br />
1. It is not a true optimization engine because it will not give the best result after one run.<br />
The system handles material capacity separately from shop floor capacity which means that iterative runs need to be executed in order to reach a feasible solution in terms of both material and work. (why compromise again?)<br />
2. BaanSCS works only with B5C.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, I don't know of any &quot;plug-and-play&quot; APS systems fom Baan, But I do know of 2 good systems:<br />
1. SWS by Telly systems : http://telly-advanced.com. (don't be discouraged y the quality of the site)<br />
2. STG which belongs to Manugistics: http://www.manugistics.com/solutions/manufacturing_planning_and_scheduling.asp.<br />
