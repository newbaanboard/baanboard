<br />
Is Scrap qty depends on Ordered qty in a production order? Are there any parameter settings for updating the estimating qty ?<br />
<br />
For Example: I have got a BOM for an item as follows<br />
<br />
As per BOM- Net qty--10, Scrap factor --10%, Scrap qty-2, Yield not applicable.<br />
<br />
What will be the Estimated Qty if we raise a Production Order for 10 qty. ?</div></div><hr />

The estimated quantity will be 13.<br />
<br />
The calculation of the Estimate quantity is as follows:<br />
<br />
Estimated Qty = Net Quantity + 10% of Net Quantity (Scrap %) + 2 units (Scrap Quantity) = 10 units  + 10% of 10 Units + 2 units = 13 units<br />
<br />
Please note that scrap percentage dependents on the net quantity but Scrap Quantity is independent of the order quantity of production order, it is constant irrespective of the order quantity ( or we can say independent of net quantity).<br />
<br />
Hope this will helpâ€¦. Please let me know in case you have any further query. <br />
Best Regards,<br />
Rajeev</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajeev Seth</div><div class="date">10th April 2010, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">The Scrap quantity is the quantity of material that will be lost during production. It is a fixed quantity that is independent to the quantity produced. Recording a scrap quantity prevents shortages in production.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajeev Seth</div><div class="date">12th April 2010, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Balu,<br />
The scrap can be defined as percentage or as a fixed quantity. This is the functionality given by the Baan to define the scrap as percentage which depends upon production quantity and if in the particular process scrap only depends upon the production qty then we can define scrap qty as zero.<br />
<br />
If scrap is defined as a percentage it is called the scrap factor. It is defined with the following formula: <br />
<br />
Gross requirement = ( scrap factor/100% + 1 )  x net quantity<br />
<br />
Scrap quantity <br />
<br />
A fixed quantity scrap can be used, for example, if a material must be cut of a reel, and a fixed quantity is lost during cutting. A fixed quantity scrap is characterized by means of the following formula: <br />
<br />
Gross requirement = net quantity + scrap quantity <br />
<br />
A fixed quantity scrap can not only be defined for a material, but also for an operation. This can used for start-up effects. For example: when a machine is started, the first products must be discarded, because their quality is poor.<br />

<br />
Thank you very much. The last two lines made me clear at scrap qty.</div></div><hr />
