I need urgent help if some one can provide. Here are the details: -<br />
<br />
Assuming a BOM structure is Main item A, Below that few purchased parts + a manufacured item B (phantom-yes) and below B lots of purchased parts.<br />
Master planning is no for A (That means it is time phased inventory plan)<br />
When I enter the special demand qty of 60 pcs for A, it should explode B into its components and should give the demand of components below B (BOM qty * 60) but it is giving exactly 50% of that.<br />
I have checked the BOM in detail, parameters, there is no planning BOM being used. B has got about 22 components and all are coming 50% of what it should be.<br />
There is no stock of the components of B, in nettable warehouses, neither any qty is on order, nor there are any other planned transactions that may affect the inventory.<br />
Can someone help me in finding out what the problem could be? I am reachable at rka_72@rediffmail.com<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
RKA</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you checked the BOM unit inthe Bill of Materials?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rka_72</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 20:59</div></div><div class="posttext">- There is no inventory of Phantom item B.<br />
- BOM unit in Bill of materials is 1 for all items</div></div><hr />
