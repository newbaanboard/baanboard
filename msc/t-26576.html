<br />
I'm trying to write a report to reconcile Project WIP back to the accounts. My problem is Integration transaction PCS/Act.Cost of Goods Sold. <br />
<br />
These transactions are generated by session tipcs3250m000 (Calculate Cost Price by Project) but I have no idea what criteria causes creation of the transactions.<br />
<br />
We run ths session daily, yet sometimes transactions are generated on a project that has had zero activity in that day, i.e. no sales deliveries, no production orders backflushed/completed/closed etc.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me any clues??<br />
<br />
Better still, can anyone just tell me how to report Project WIP!?!?!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">7th March 2006, 23:47</div></div><div class="posttext">From my old Financial Integration Documentation I have the following:<br />
<br />
Financial trransactions are generated for this combination when actual cost of sales are booked for projects and the Calculate Cost Prices by Project (tipcs3250m000) session is executed.<br />
<br />
Transactions are also generated for this combination when projects are closed with the Close Project (tipcs2250m000) session, which automatically starts the Calculate Cost Prices by Project (tipcs3250m000) session.<br />
<br />
We have customized our reports scripts (which sit on top of Baan's vanilla session scripts) to get the information we need.  We have also created a WIP accrual report to aid in projects that should be closed (all items have shipped and been invoiced) but due to a hang-up in the process, the project has not been closed (or production orders under the project have not been closed).<br />
<br />
In spare time (ha ha) I have been working on a fully customized version of the WIP reports that will incorporate our methodology for the WIP Accrual and also prints WIP balances per project for the last three periods (this identifies stagnant jobs).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In our pcs projects, the Act. Cost of Goods Sold transactions will not be created until the production orders for that project have all been closed.<br />
<br />
I know that invoicing matching in Accounts Payables needs to be completed before the project can be completed.<br />
<br />
So, if the production orders get closed, or the A\P matching is completed, this may cause the Actual Cost of Goods Sold integration transactions to be created.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps a bit.<br />
<br />
We recently switched the PCS parameter from 'Actual' to 'Estimate' for WIP, because we were not getting the COGS entries created in the same financial period that the goods actually shipped and were invoiced.  This parameter should not be changed, because 'in process' projects can be completed without 'Est Cost of Goods Sold' or 'Act Cost of Goods Sold' Integration transactions.  This happened to a dozen projects in our environment.  We corrected the G\L by a journal entry, and left the project costing for these projects a bit wonky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think our problem is that we use projects for prototype manufacturing, and these projects stay active for long periods of time and have many production orders, sales &amp; purchase orders etc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normal&quot; projects I can handle in my report as they get created, production orders get completed/closed, sales deliveries are made and the project is closed. No problem.<br />
<br />
The prototype projects stay open. Production (SFC)/Material Costs transactions get generated when the production orders are backflushed, this debits the WIP a/c. <br />
<br />
However, there appears to be no logic to the creation of the PCS/Act.Cost of Goods sold which credits the WIP a/c.<br />
<br />
We don't have source code so I can't check out tipcs3250m000 to see what it looks at.<br />
<br />
Why there isn't a standard Baan report I don't know. Why doesn't the session Print Work-in-process (tisfc0450m000) report Project WIP?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">8th March 2006, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Try the Print Financial Project Transactions (tipcs8410m000) report.  It is located in the following path:<br />
<br />
Baan IV Manufacturing - Project Control - Link with Finance - Print Financial Project Transactions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rammie</div><div class="date">9th March 2006, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks, that report has saved me a lot of development time and headaches. I'd never spotted it there before!<br />
<br />
However, it's sort of cheating as it seems to look at tfgld410, which means it's not exactly a reconcilliation report, but it will keep the Finance dept happy (and more importantly, the external auditors).<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
