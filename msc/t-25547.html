<br />
<br />
We have a monthly program and the printed items are always different, but the stock and cartons are mostly the same.  Can I have PRP pick up my inventory for my last project by linking it as a mainproject or subproject?<br />
<br />
Please don't write back and tell me to make the stock and cartons standard items for MRP.  We are a job shop with thousands of jobs and the monthly programs could terminate anytime so we prefer not to make standard items.<br />
<br />
Also, I know that I can warehouse transfer the material into the new project, but isn't their a better way with fewer transactions?</div></div><hr />

(maybe PCF can help....with a little PRP logic in a BOM constraint)</div></div><hr />
