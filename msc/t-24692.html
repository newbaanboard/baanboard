Has anyone figured out how to keep Expense Item(nuts and bolts) on the BOM without requiring Inventory Control to take audits to keep Finance happy?.  We would like the item and usage quantity for viability to production. Our Material Control Department does not want the overhead of cycle counting. Finance would let us get away with just letting them know the value of the expense items when they are issued from the warehouse to WIP.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">31st July 2005, 13:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You can defile the items as Floor Stock. Floor stock items can be defined on the BOM and the system will automatically backflush.<br />
<br />
Floor Stock = Yes<br />
The item originating from the floor stock may appear as a component in the production bill of material or as material in the formula. In the case of a production order containing floor stock items, the estimated and actual data are the same. This means that the estimated quantities are automatically issued from inventory. With 'backflushing', these are the right quantities, depending on the output of the production order or production batch. If the items needed for a production order belong to the floor stock, they are printed on the material note through the session &quot;Print Order Documents (tisfc0408m000)&quot; or &quot;Print Batch Documents (pspmg0408m000)&quot; (BAAN Process).</div></div><hr />

We use EDM, so it's all in the Engineering BOM if required. The items are coded as non-physical items in engineering, which prevents them from copying over as lines in the BOM. We also give them their own Item Group. So we have all the info in engineering for reference, but there's no concern about tracking the inventory. Our hardware vendor just comes in and keeps our bins stocked.</div></div><hr />
