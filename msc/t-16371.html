<br />
We transfer MRP production orders over to the shop floor, and then if we cannot start a production order on the planned start date, we push this date out on the shop floor production order to a realistic date so that Baan knows when this is actually coming to stock.<br />
<br />
I would like to measure how we are doing in terms of starting production orders compared to the planned start date Baan MRP recommends, but because we change the start date on the shop floor produciton order, I lose visibility to this original MRP date.<br />
<br />
Is there anywhere that this original date is stored that I can reference?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The most important measure of production timeliness in any industry is versus the sales order. If only BaanERP maintains a peg between production order coming from MRP and its SO origin, then your problem would be solved too &lt;sigh&gt;<br />

<br />
Just FYI:<br />
<br />
In 5.0c and later, on production orders we have split the delivery date into:<br />
 - Requested Delivery Date, and<br />
 - (Re-)Planned Delivery Date<br />
<br />
The first one remains unchanged.<br />
I don't think it always matches with the Sales Order date. There may be other lead times in between. (Extra Lead Time and Safety Time, in Item Ordering Data, and Item Plan Data, all 5.0 c)<br />
<br />
