How do you doin :) ?<br />
I hope in great conditions.<br />
I use SSA ERP LN 6.1 fp 1<br />
<br />
1. Alternative Item<br />
I have set an alternative item with interchangable checked (replacement unchecked). I thought that if i use interchangable, when i create the production order which  the standard item stock level is zero, it will automatically trigger the alternative item to the estimated  materials in the production order.May be I have missed something?<br />
<br />
2. Work Center<br />
We make one work center consist of 5 different machine (different process for the same product) ,and different operators for each machine (machine 1= 4 operators, machine 2 = 5 operators ,..etc) , the total operators = 25.<br />
If I input in the work center : number of machine = 5, and the number of operators = 1 (because we only define one employee for the work center in the system) ==&gt; is it correct?<br />
Is it effect when I generate order planning? (I set in the critical capacity planning = man capacity )<br />
How SSA calculate the costing for the production order which use the machine in this work center?<br />
<br />
sorry , i really confuse, im new in ssa.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your consideration .<br />
Cheers,<br />

<br />
i just checked the help and it looks like you need to do some setup in the BOM as well:<br />
&quot;Alternative materials in BOMs<br />
This topic introduces the concept of alternative materials.<br />
Often, multiple items are interchangeable. Sometimes, you purchase these items from various vendors. You can use any of these items as material in a bill of material (BOM). You can define up to nine alternative material for any material in a BOM. If a shortage of a standard material is expected to delay a production order, ERP LN can automatically select one of the alternative materials.<br />
The use of alternative materials has the following advantages:<br />
ERP LN can handle material shortages for some items without user intervention. <br />
The use of alternative items can reduce the average inventory level.<br />
Important!<br />
This functionality is available only if the Use Up and Alternative Materials check box is selected in the Implemented Software Components (tccom0100s000) session.&quot;<br />
Hope this will help on your first question.<br />
:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im afraid the Use Up and Alternative Materials check box  only appear in SP 2 right?<br />
I dont have it in SP 1 :(.<br />
So anyone knows what is the advantage of using interchangable in alternative item?<br />
Because in Baan V student book, it says:<br />
When alternative item is defined as interchangable, PCS can have the system make an automatic substitution without user intervention ==&gt; what is it means?</div></div><hr />
