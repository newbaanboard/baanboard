If we add our technical drawings as a appendix (PDF file) to our items, is it then possible to find a way to print or show the BOM automaticly togehter with the demanded drawings?<br />
<br />
We have big problems that our production has never the actual drawing in their hand during manufatoring of our products and the job preperartion department finds not the time to keep the drawings updatet.<br />
<br />
We are using Infor LN feature pack 4.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

<br />
I have realized such kind of functionality several times. ItÂ´s always customizing and is depending on the CAD/PDM system and the business processes. To add a drawing as PDF to an item is possible with ODM, but I have realized this always without ODM.  Usually the drawing is taken from a vault or the drawing is printed/viewed direct in production area.<br />
<br />
