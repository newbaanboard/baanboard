<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">25th July 2003, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We have recently run into a problem when closing completed production orders.<br />
<br />
The error message reads Purchase order ***** for subcontracting is still open.<br />
<br />
However, the production order status is complete which I understand means all logistic events have finished and the purchase order has been fully received, inspected , approved and paid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where else should we be looking?<br />
<br />
regards, P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">singhalv</div><div class="date">25th July 2003, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if Production order status is completed, the subcontracting Purchase Orders may not be paid. Prodcution orders can not be closed until purchase result is present.<br />
In session tisfc2510m000, check all suncontracting PO for your Production order.<br />
Check whether the these PO' are paid for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">28th July 2003, 11:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestion, but the orders are paid as previously mentioned.<br />
<br />
However I was able to discover that the items require inspection and although it has been approved in some tables it has not been in others. I'm guessing that we have to adjust the table for these, unless you you know away to use the standard interface to acheive this.<br />

<br />
In addition to the match/approval of the invoice related to the subcontacting purchase order, the &quot;Process Delivered Purchase Orders&quot; session must be run in order for the production order to proceed with closing.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this will affect the inspection problem you experience, but I know that this is a required step.<br />
