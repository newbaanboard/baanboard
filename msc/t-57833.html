I have noticed that Sales orders that already exist are not pulling through and registering as customer orders on the MPS screen. When I then delete the order it pulls through as a negative.<br />
<br />
The only solution I have found is to delete the MPS item, delete the order then re-create the MPS item and then load the order. Does anyone know if this is due to a setting that we haven't correctly set or is it part of the functionality.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, one needs to just run the MPS again.<br />
