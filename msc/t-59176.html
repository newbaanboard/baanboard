<br />
I am facing a problem related to Customer Rejection. When our customer sent back us the Assembly as a reject. We make a return order and process that. After quality Inspection, we get only the one part of the Assembly is rejected. We dismantle the assembly and take all OK's items from that and physically move in to the RM Store. <br />
Now my problem is how to handle the Assembly Inventory?<br />
How to treat with the RG1 Stock?<br />
How can I create the Child part inventory?<br />
<br />
Is there any solution available, to dismentle of the assembly? (I give the assembly code and the system consume the Assembly and create the inventory of their child parts)<br />
<br />

yes u can use reverse bom to handle this case.<br />
<br />
Return from customer , you can process item transfer to change the item code to assembly item code .<br />
this assembly will have some stock.<br />
Then you will create a production order for the child part, and input this assembly item in estimated material by prod ord.<br />
<br />
Process the prod ord, then you will get child part inventory.<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean there are many child parts.<br />
Do you need to capture some cost in dismantel process?<br />
If not, then i think you can use Adjustment Order.<br />
First, you record the stock value for this Assembly, let say it cost 100 USD for each item.<br />
Second,you have to get the price for all child part.<br />
Third, <br />
in one adjustment Order, you can create one line for Assembly = negative qty (the value consumed is depend on your inv val method.<br />
Then add some line for child part = Positive Qty (the received value will take the price which you have define).</div></div><hr />
