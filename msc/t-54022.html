<br />
Can any one suggest me, hoe to track the Inventory of Rejected Material during the Final warehouse Inspection.<br />
<br />
The Problem which I'm facing is that while rejecting the Material at W/H Inspection, the Rejected Inventory is automatically processed by an Adjustment Order. But we want to Generate a Re-Work Order or we can accept this Reject Material under deviation.<br />
<br />
Please suggest how to map this scenario...??<br />

<br />
Rejection handling is available only for purchased items.  If u want to rework the rejected manufactured item put an adjustment order of same quantity and take it back for reprocessing.<br />
<br />
This is standard functionality.<br />

<br />
When you create the re-work order system will not estimate any material to be issued again as it is assumed that user will enter the required material manually in estimated materials as everything may not be broken.<br />
<br />
hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In case of rework order, the quantity to be produced will become the Estimated BOM from the same W/H.<br />
<br />
But, our major problem is to track the material which is rejected at the time of SFC Warehouse Inspection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bond007</div><div class="date">22nd January 2009, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Please check out the possibility by implementing QMS</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no any solution through baan standered. If you want to track the record than generate customize report only. for rejected material.<br />
<br />
and your next requirment of Rework---- than on the basis of rejection report you will generate inventory through inventory adjustment in the system in a different warehouse like under daviation warehouse or rework warehouse. as a parent item. after that you will generate rework order and whatever operation required mentiontion in the production order.........this is the only solution and workaround for this problem. <br />

<br />
The QMS can't help in this case, as in QMS is also linked with the W/H Inspection Order &amp; we know that Rejected Quantity can't be handled whose Order Origin is SFC.<br />
<br />
Making Adjustment Order then raising Re-Work Order is not a feasible solution in case of real time transaction, no-one wants to give the authorization of Adjustment Order to his end users &amp; a senior authority can't do this activity frequently.</div></div><hr />
