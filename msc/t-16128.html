<br />
I've tried cluster method but EP doesn't create Planned Distribution Order instead it creates a transfer order directly in Warehouse Order session.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">28th July 2004, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">It works OK for us regularly - no special set up is required.  We have requirements for a  base item and for the same base item customized to multiple projects.  System regularly puts up planned distribution orders for moving standard items to the customized items.  NOTE:  this only works for moving standard to customized - system will not plan for moving from one customized to another or for moving customized to standard.<br />
<br />
You can force this by setting Supply Source to Distribution (Plan Item Data) for the customized items, leaving at Purchase or Production for the base item.  then you will plan to make or buy the standard item and always distribute to the customized requirements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the info, but I don't deal with customized item. I just want to move standard item from one warehouse to another automatically thru EP.<br />
<br />
Just_fro,<br />
<br />
I have setup the supplying relationship and make the supplysource as distribution (Item plan data) thru the use of cluster. But the system generates warehouse order of type transfer, directly in warehouse order session, not Planned Distribution Order in Planned Orders session. This is what I have achieved by using Cluster.<br />
<br />
What I need is the system to create Planned Distribution Order in Planned Orders that will be transferred manually to warehouse order.<br />
<br />
Any idea?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have defined your supplying relations correct, then you can use the Item Order Plan (cprrp0520m000) in Enterprise Planning.<br />
Via this session a planning run must be done, use Simulate Orders (cprrp1210m000), and then the planned distribution orders are generated.<br />
The Simulate Orders can be found in the Specific menu.<br />
<br />
Use the transfer sessions (cppat1210m000) to transfer the planned distribution order to warehousing.<br />
Note: the scenario that you use must be actual scenario, else no transfer can be done.<br />
<br />

<br />
The thing is system automatically create warehouse order of type Transfer in the warehouse orders session. It did not create any planned distribution orders for me to transfer.<br />
<br />
In short, Transfer orders are created automatically as warehouse orders not as planned distribution orders, as I wanted.<br />
<br />
Any idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sdvries</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, strange problem. <br />
Maybe first a short answer, planned orders only exists in EP and are not visible in warehousing... So it is not possible to generate a planned order in warehousing.<br />
And planned orders can only be made via an MRP run or have to be entered manually.<br />
<br />
A more longer answer: :)<br />
<br />
I don't know for sure, but in Baan 4c it is possible to generate automatically warehouse transfers via the PRP run.<br />
<br />
And in a very early release of Baan 5b this was also the case, but later this kind of functionality was removed due the possiblity of oversupply.<br />
That is why the construction, as it is working now, was introduced. That is first a planned distribution order is generated and then the planned order should be transferred.<br />
<br />
So I am curious what kind of steps you take before the system automatically generates warehouse transfers.<br />
Are you, for example, running an MRP (simulate orders)?<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, I run simulate orders first then system creates warehouse order transfer and planned production and purchase orders but not planned distribution orders.<br />
<br />
From your explanation, this behaviour is just like the early release of Baan 5b.<br />
<br />
Planned distribution orders that I've ever made was Item Transfer from standard item to customized item, like jcorwine suggested.<br />
<br />
Any other idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benny007</div><div class="date">19th September 2004, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The steps is:<br />
1, first. you must create one cluster and assign it to a distribution warehouse. And this warehouse must is No-nettable .<br />
2, Create a planned item with cluster.<br />
<br />
3, Create supplier relationship between planned item.</div></div><hr />
