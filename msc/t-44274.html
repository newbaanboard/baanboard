<br />
could you tell me why Unit Effectivity is an interesting function to use with LN 6.1 ?<br />
<br />
For example: i need to manage packaging material.<br />
<br />
We have one product with 1 to 8 different packaging material.<br />
What do you think of Unit Effectivity to manage packaging material ?<br />
<br />
Thanks !<br />

<br />
Say you have Item 'X'  and for this item 'X' there may be 8 type of packaging. The Sales Guy at the time of order booking order decides what type of packaging  should be given.<br />
<br />
With Unit Effectivity you can define validity of options for BOM and Routing.<br />
This will serve your purpose.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">20th November 2007, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">The concept of Unit Effectivity applies very well to your circumstance.  The concept will allow you to maintian a single BOM and/or routing but vary the specific BOM component and/or routing operation based on the unit effectivity code selected.  The code can be predefined or 'configured'.  It helps to think of unit effectivity as a light configurator.<br />
<br />
Unit effectivity functionality allows mixed unit effective codes to be manufactured on a single production order.  In effect, limited co-product functionality is possible with certain ramifications in the costing areas.<br />
<br />
This might be an ideal solution to packaging, labeling, color selection etc...it really depends on costing variances between the different, alternate components in the BOM and/or routing operations if you apply the concept to rouitng code and / or routing operation selection.<br />
<br />
I have used packaging selection many times as an example when I discuss this concept.</div></div><hr />
