<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">26th November 2001, 00:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We are multisite (Multi Logistic, single Finance), we make the same items in both plants. The reson we have 2 logistic companies is because we have different standard costs for the same item in each plant.<br />
<br />
We would like to have a centralized order entry system for both sites, then have the system recommend (through centralized multisite planning) which site to build them in based on capacity, least cost, shortest distance to customer etc. <br />
<br />
Is such functionality available (via standard baan, a supply chain add on, or other third party product)? How so? We currently run seperate order entry and planning in each company but will change setup if this is possible<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any experience with this...I would like to exchange information. Any advice is appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

What we did was establish a third, purchasing company.  This companyh did all the purchasing and was the supplier to each of the other companies.  Supply Chain passed its requirements into the purchasing company, which drop shipped all of its purchases into either of the two real companies.  This also allowed for easier contract negotiation and tracking as all the suppliers sold to just one company.<br />
<br />
Finance will have to track purchase variances as the standard costs will be different from the purchasing company to each of the logistical companies, but that cen be solved by a single, monthly G/L entry.<br />
