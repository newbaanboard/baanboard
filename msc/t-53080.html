I would like to start ticst0502s000 with a production order and position. So I'm setting ticst001.pdno and ticst001.opno before zooming that session (via a menu). The production order displayed is correct, but the position is zero.<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<br />
If I am not wrong the position field name is ticst001.pono not ticst001.opno.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<br />
The Session uses ticst001._index2, which is {pdno, opno, pono}. So I think setting opno was correct.<br />
<br />
Anyway, at the moment I'm setting both to the identical value, just to see. But I cannot understand what's happening:<br />
5 gives 0, 10 gives 100, 20 gives 10, 30 gives 100 and so on.<br />
Valid positions are 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 70 ,80, 90, 100, 110 and so on.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Anybody that has the sources and that can have a look at it?<br />

<br />
1. Ur customized main table has  some reference on the ticst001 . And  standard program automatically matches the reference fields to references of ticst001 and brings accordingly ticst001 records . I had seen similar matter for  zoom to item master for main and child item both .<br />
<br />
2. ticst0502 imports only pono and then accordingly changes the opno value and brings the record . <br />
<br />
3. cst0502 restricts the import / export only for standard session . I c this is a veryremote possibility .</div></div><hr />

I'm zooming from tibom010, so point 1 can be excluded. The points 2 and 3 could be, but to verify that I should have a look at the sources I guess.<br />

When zoom name is blank , zoom from on entry and on exit functions are not executed in the called session which may affect the import / export of the values.<br />
<br />
However the values change in cst0502 for u. So it certainly imports pono and displays pono values. So in that case the option would be set to set right cst001.pono.<br />
<br />
Let us know ur findings once u finish working on this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been playing for hours but I could not get the expected result. Finally, I decided to create a new session from scratch -- I copied the forms, created the session script manually. That took about 15 minutes; in the zoom.from.all section I import ticst001.pdno and ticst001.pono and everything is fine.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: I don't know what the standard does, but it would be most intersting.<br />
