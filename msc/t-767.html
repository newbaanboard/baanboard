When all production, purchase and sales activeties in the project is closed, there is almost allways inventory in the project. This inventory is moved to Warerhouses by manually maintaining WH-orders (Project to Warehouse) in the PCS-module, confirm this orders and transfer them.<br />
I have tried to run PRP to get this orders automaticly from the system, but it doesn't seem to work. I have tried to do it when the project have the status Active and Finished, but I don't get proposals for WH-orders from PRP.<br />
Is it anyone out there, that can tell me if I do anything wrong. Is it possible to generate the orders, or do I have to maintain them myself?<br />
For information, they use the INV-module for warehousing.<br />

Warehouse transfer to either a standard item that can be stocked OR a $0 dummy standard item (if we don't want to part number and stock the very customized part), that removes the item from the project but leaves the cost in the project.  It does seem like a bad way to do it but we could find no alternative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it depends on what you want to do with that stock. If you still need it (as standard items) there is now other way than manually enter PRP Warehouse orders.<br />
<br />
It you want to &quot;nullify&quot; that stock (because its just due to bad data maintainance, but physically not present any more), you can do that automatically when closing the project: Here you can enter an amount until which project stock will be automatically deleted.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your replies. You confirmed my assumption that Project Inventory that still remains as stock in a Finished project, have to be handeled manually. I can't get any help from PRP to generate proposals for Project to WH orders.<br />
We handle the inventory in two ways. If it's physical inventory, we move it to a WH and store it as a standard item. If it's system inventory (inventory used by the project, but not issued by production), we re-open the SFC orders and issue the material.<br />
We also delete some inventory from projects when closing them, but thats only low cost items.<br />
