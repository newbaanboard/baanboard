<br />
I'd like to know if BaaN 5.0c has a different production planning approach other than infinite capacity. The fact that it currently considers infinite capacity is keeping our planning process from sheduling according to real available capacity. <br />
<br />
Also, does this version have material allocation capabilitites within other sites/intermediates? <br />
<br />
Any help on this two aspects will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

In baan 5,you can try to use work load control.<br />
<br />
started in FP3, theres a new feature called Orde sequencing, but still use Infinite planning.<br />
and also theres a planning board (started from FP2) can show you the gantt chart that enable you to move the bar .<br />
Only APS can give you finite planning, but its price is very expensive :(.</div></div><hr />
