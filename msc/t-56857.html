We send our suppliers purchase schedules each week for material releases.<br />
We have authorizations on the Purchase Contract set for weeks...Released set to Daily (4), Planned set to Weekly (8) and Forecast set to Monthly (6).<br />
<br />
If we have requirement from MRP out in the future...say 3 months out...but no requirements between...I would expect the purchase schedule to have no released quantities, no planned quantities but have a forecast quantity in the 1st month.<br />
<br />
Instead, we have purchase schedules with released quantities starting 3 months from the date of the MRP run...which authorizes our supplier to manufacture for the demand.  If however, the orders are canceled and the demand therefore is canceled...we don't want the parts, and we don't want to pay for obsolesence...<br />
<br />
How do we get the purchase schedules to begin with the date of the MRP run or at least the following Monday?</div></div><hr />
