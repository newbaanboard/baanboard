<br />
We are on Baan IV b4.  In our cost price calculation code we have simulated price as the method for recalculation of the standard cost.  We have maintained the simulated prices of all our items.  We are using multiple currencies and as such our simulated purchase prices are maintained in different currencies for different items.<br />
<br />
My question is, in case we run the calculated cost prices session without changing any of the simulated prices, will a revaluation entry get passed for those items maintained in foreign currencies and where there is a difference in the rate of exchange between the date on which we last ran the cost price calcuation and the current run date.<br />
<br />
Also, if we run the cost price calculation and a revaluation entry is created, is there any way we can find out how much of it was on account of change in currency rates and how much was actually on account of change in simulated purchase prices.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

<br />
1. Baan will generate a revaluation if the currency rates have been changed. This will happen even if the prices simulated or otherwise have not changed.<br />
<br />
2. There is standard report which will give you the impact of rate changes and price changes separately. What you can do is create a simulation code where you can maintain the simulated prices without any change. Calculate costs under this code. You will then be able to generate a report to give impact of both the changes<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.  You have mentioned that there is a standard report which gives the impact of the currency rate changes and the price changes separately.   Can you give me the session number of the report please.<br />
<br />
Also the other method suggested by you would also seem to be fine except for one further clarification.<br />
<br />
Suppose we create a simulation cost price calculation code and run without changing the simulated prices, then we will get a revaluation based on the changes in the prices specifically due to the changes in currency rates.  But, when we run the standard cost calculation with the new prices entered we will get a new revalued price.  This new price would have the impact of both the currency changes and the changes due to change in prices would it not.  <br />
<br />
In such a case how do we separate the currency rate difference from the price difference, by a simple subtraction of the two differences?  Please do clarify.<br />
<br />
Thanks once again <br />
<br />

<br />
One other query.  Is it possible to get a split up of the impact due to currency changes and the price changes for the revaluation entries that have already been created in the past?  Some development of customised reports is also acceptable to the client.<br />
<br />
bye and regards<br />

<br />
I am sorry I missed out on 'No' in my point no 2 I wanted to sat there is no standadrd report.<br />
<br />
However you can generate a report for the impact for changes due to currentcy rates and changes due to current rate. Maintain a simulated code with same purchase prices a s your standatd cost code and calcultae cost under this code. Costs calculated will be entirely due to change in rates. Now when you maintain current prices in standard cost code and calculate prices under that code these will have both the impacts. You can generate a report using the sim code and standard code which will give the impact due to each change.<br />
<br />
As to the past calculations it will be difficult to do thaat now as you eill have to read dates exchange rate changes related to the cost price calculation dates. The exchange rate change dates would be different for different currencies. Theremay be multiple rate changes between two successive cost claculation dates. I do not really have a programming backgroud so I can not say whether it will possible to develope such a report<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.  I too don't think that it is possible since the simulated purchase price has since been changed and there is no record in the system of the previous simulated price.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />
