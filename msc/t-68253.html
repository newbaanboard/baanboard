<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pillai.ganesh</div><div class="date">12th October 2015, 10:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Manufactured Item &quot;ITEM0001&quot;, I sell this item with or without testing as per customer requirements.<br />
<br />
Say, Out of 10 qty  on Sales Order ;customer is asking me to do &quot;Radiography Testing&quot; of 2 qty.<br />
So in that case how do I record COGS?<br />
Should we include the cost of “Radiography Testing” to COGS?<br />
<br />
We are thinking of using this approach-<br />
Create two item codes &quot;ITEM0001&quot; and &quot;ITEM0001-R&quot; and add two lines on my Sales Order.  Line with &quot;ITEM0001&quot; of 8 qty and another line &quot;ITEM0001-R&quot; of 2 qty.<br />
Item &quot;ITEM0001-R&quot; will be a manufactured item with &quot;ITEM0001&quot; in its BOM and Operation “Radiography Testing” attached to the routing of &quot;ITEM0001-R&quot;. <br />
Thus 2 Production Orders will be created to my Sales order. Out of which one will handle cost of “Radiography Testing” as the production cost.<br />
<br />
Problem:- We feel creating a separate item code to differentiate if the item involves cost of testing or not looks incorrect… As a case where there are 10 different types of testing done based on customer requirements; we will end up creating as many Item codes which is equal to the different combinations of the Testing types.<br />
<br />
So we are looking for an alternate solution where we need not create separate Item codes for the same item… As the end item whether tested or not is still the same.<br />
How will we do costing in such a scenario?  Should we add a cost line on the Sales Order specifying the RT Cost? How will this be treated by finance?<br />
Looking forward for your advice….</div></div><hr />
