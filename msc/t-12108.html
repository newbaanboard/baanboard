<br />
I want to report a completed production order through session Report Orders Completed (tisfc0120s000). When I open the details to enter the data, the &quot;To Reject&quot; field is disabled.<br />
So now I will have to go to session Report Operation Completed (tisfc0530m000) to record the rejected qty.<br />
<br />
Why is the field disabled? Anyone has a similar problem? Help please..<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FransG</div><div class="date">9th July 2003, 09:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The To Reject field is only enabled in case the production order status is below to be completed and the production order has no operations; otherwise it is disabled.<br />
In case of operations one has to specify the quantity rejected at operation level. If you do not do it at operation level but at order level you assume the rejects to count for all operations, whereas the reject could have been accounted at the first operation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the info. I got the point.<br />
<br />
Now I have another problem. When I report the production order with some qty rejected, the rejected qty is showing in the Inventory by Warehouse and Item (whwmd2515m000) session under the Inventory On Order column. And it is also showing in the planned inventory transaction session.<br />
<br />
I have closed the production order and there is no other outstanding order. So how come it still showing in the On Order column?<br />
<br />
Do you know anything about this ?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

You were saying that it appears in planned inventory transactions? What exactly is the entry displayed in Planned Inventory Transactions by Order (whinp1501m000)? Does the entry there really correspond to the production order in question or something else?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">10th July 2003, 06:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Either in the whinp1500m000 (planned trans by item) or in the whinp1501m000 (planned trans by order), they both show planned receipts for the corresponding production order, even though the prod order has already been closed.<br />
<br />
How strange....<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the quantity reported as completed in Mfg (SFC) is still more than the quantity actually received in WH (INH). Hence WH is still insisting on getting the remaining qty. You can check it out by comparing the qty reported in SFC (using tisfc0501m000) and quantity received in INH (using whinr1511m000).<br />
<br />
That being said, in an ideal system, BaanERP shouldn't allow an order to be closed unless all quantity reported in SFC matches qty reported in INH. Hence, if BaanERP is allowing you to close a production order when there's still qty mismatch between SFC and INH, then you should contact BS for the latest fix for your system<br />

<br />
After asking support, we were told to run the session whinp1200m000 (Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions). After running this session, all incorrect entries were removed and no more incorret reject transactions recorded.<br />
<br />
However, I still don't know whether this session needs to be run periodically or just once.<br />
