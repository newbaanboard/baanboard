<br />
it is not possible to add a result after the inspection order is closed. This is required not only the day after inspection but very often at the moment when parts are outbounded to the work shop and while assembling an issue comes up.<br />
<br />
For Baan there is no more connection to the receipt though in 95% of all cases everybody knows the supplier just because there is only one supplier or the name of the supplier is written on the product or the packaging.<br />
<br />
I once solved this problem with minimal programming in that way. First of all the item needs to be in a warehouse. If the item was already outbound for a production order you have to perform a negative in order to get it back from the production order to the warehouse. Then you have to start manually an inventory inspection order for this item with the same test that is normally used for the receipt inspection order. You need at least one more field in the inspection order namely supplier and receipt date or the receipt line of the former receipt. Supplier and date should be a little easier. So you have a reference to the supplier, a date, and the test results.<br />
<br />
The main problem for reporting is that you have two sources where to get data from. Here you need to subtract the number of bad tested items from the good items of the receipt.<br />
<br />
Receipt 100 pcs<br />
Receipt inspection<br />
90 good<br />
10 bad<br />
<br />
7 found as bad while assembling<br />
Inventory inspection<br />
<br />
90 from receipt inspection order Â– 7 from inventory inspection order = 83 good items per supplier, item and period<br />
10 from receipt inspection order + 7 from inventory inspection order = 17 bad items per supplier, item and period<br />
<br />
I know that this solution is not very nice but it is very close to the standard.<br />
<br />
If you need some more information about the QM module do not hesitate to contact me.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
