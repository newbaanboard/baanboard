<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">15th October 2002, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 production orders - one subassembly and one finished good (which will consume the subassembly)<br />
<br />
The 2 production orders have the following finish dates:  <br />
	subassembly = 10/22 at 10:22am <br />
	finished good = 10/22 at 8:48am <br />
<br />
I then generate signals, and the system is telling me I have negative inventory, because my subassembly will be built an hour and a half after the finished good. In reality, we dont look at time when building order, only date, so we are going to be fine in production. <br />
<br />
I have many subassembly/finished good orders in this situation, and Im getting a negative inventory signal on each. Technically, it is correct in giving me a signal, but we do not build our orders to a specific time- only to a date. Is there any way to have signals ignore the time on an order and only look at date?</div></div><hr />
