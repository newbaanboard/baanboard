<br />
in our new baan environment the order lead time in mrp purchase order proposals is not taken into account. The delivery date and the planned order date is the same in the purchase order proposal while the order lead time is defined in the item table. <br />
<br />
Do anybody out there have an idea how to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your assistance.</div></div><hr />

This is, because when the MRP-reorder point is hit, or is going to be hit, in a period shorter then the lead time of the purchased item, it will not consider the lead time but mrp will generate an advice to get the stuff in today. Only advices in the (near) future will take the normal lead time into account.<br />
<br />
Please reconsider your complete Supply Chain and perhaps for some item categories MRP is not the most ideal ordersystem. INV-advices based on SIC-system might be better and easier to control in cases where value is low, lead times are short and reliable and demand patterns are more stable.</div></div><hr />
