Hi,<br />
<br />
Select your poduction order and go to specific. In material, go to material to issue for production order.<br />
<br />
For every line, check if there is any value in subsequent delivery field. If yes, make it 0 and try again.</div></div><hr />

Hi Bhushan,,<br />
<br />
As you can see in the attachment file, that the material already been issued exceeded than the estimated, i think we do not need any material to be issued. But, the closing' message goes to material that should be issued.<br />
<br />
Should you have any other idea, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Diana</div></div><hr />

In your second screen shot, I can see a line which has Est. Quantity = 15 and Actual Quantity = 26.<br />
<br />
Now, double click on that line and you will see a field Subsequent Delivery under Quantities group.<br />
<br />
I guess there might be some some quantity left.<br />
<br />
Please check. Attach that screen shot. That can be the only reason unless and until there is no data corruption.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check timfc0101m100 (Prod Warehouse Order). Check if there is a tick on Subs. Delivery for your order.<br />
<br />
And in case if you want to issue less material, you can create a Return Order for the material. Also, you can get back your delivered material by returning the inventory.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't show whether there is any quantity in subsequent delivery field.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, please go to timfc0101m100 (Prod Warehouse Order) or in ticst0101m100(Material to Issue for Production Order) if you have an subsequent delivery quantity.<br />
<br />
Check the screen shot.</div></div><hr />

Found no qty for the Subsequent delivery field in Material Issue for Production order. Need your advice next.<br />

<br />
See, the To Issue quantity is present, hence there exists some planned orders against it. Try to make To Issue quantity as 0.<br />
<br />
Also, check in session whinp1500m000 (Planned Inventory Transactions) if any line exists for that production order.<br />
<br />
A basic thing is that a SFC production order cannot be closed with any quantity (other than zero) in either the 'to issue' or 'subsequent delivery' fields.  These fields can be maintained by the user, so if nothing more is to be issued on a given material line (ticst0101m100), simply update these fields to zero and then close the order.<br />
<br />
Just make To Issue quantity and Subsequent Del. Quantity as 0 and it should work.</div></div><hr />
