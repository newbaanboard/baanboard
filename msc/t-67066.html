<br />
I would like to correct the quantity issued for a given item on a Production Order.  We're using handling units, so I thought it would be the same process as the goods receipts on a production order; put a negative quantity and specify on which handling unit but it seems that it is not the case.  <br />
<br />
When looking at the Warehouse Order from the Warehouse Manager Dashboard, Under &quot;Outbound Lines&quot; I can see that two issues were made for my specific line # and I would like to reduce the quantity of the last one.  How should I perform this?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
I guess most of the views were due to the subject &quot;Correct Material Issue on Production Order&quot; which is a simpler way. But, the content describes that you are having the concept of Handling Units which gets off the attention.<br />
<br />
Anyway, have you tried to check whinp2100m000 (Inventory Commitments)? Also, I guess you will need to generate handling units if the process is not set up as Automatic using whwmd5230m000.<br />

Use Doc - U8938G US for more info or wait for a Manufacturing expert for a proper advice. :)</div></div><hr />
