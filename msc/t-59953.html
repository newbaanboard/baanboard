<br />
I have a requirement to have hard allocation of Quantities against a production order. I tried using the Inventory Commitments whinp2100m000, but it allocated only when i have stock on hand. But here i would require to allocate the quantity(components) when i release a production order. So that even though i have 2 production orders with same components in released state, the inventory should be initiated based on the first release date. <br />
<br />
I am not sure whether this is possible in LN FP3. Can anyone let me know ?<br />
<br />
Thanks much for your response <br />

Item Production data for material item code, must select direct initiate inv issue.<br />
<br />
When you release production order, these material will directly processed in warehouse orders  until generate outbound advice ( of course wh order type for SFC issue must be set to automatic for generate outbound advice )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quelle was right, you can try 'Direct Initiate Inventory issue' for the child item and keep the warehousing issuing activities as automatic, so that the material will be booked as per the production order's releasing date.<br />

<br />
Thanks much for your response. I tried those options too, but here the requirement is little strange. The Procurement is initiated only based on the Production order shortage report. There are cases where in Std Components are commonly used in many BOM's. Due to this they need a hard allocation of components to a production order. Because right now, even though we have automated steps in SFC issue WH order type, it only works where in there is stock on hand right up front. <br />
<br />
So I am trying to find a way which would be somthing similar to Inventory Commitments, but without stock on Hand. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for your reply .<br />

<br />
Whether the issue item is lot controlled or serialized item? I guess for lot controlled or for serialized item we can go for such Hard allocations.<br />
