We are an engineering company with most of our items are custom part with revision controlled. Changing from one revision to the next (up-rev) is very common for raw material that we purchased from our vendor. In most cases, the change is running change. Meaning, if there is any inventory for the old revision left, we are allowed to consume those inventory first before using the inventory for the new revision.<br />
<br />
I understand Baan V allow us to enter a future date in the BOM line and routing so that we can tell MRP when to plan using the new revision. I just wondering if there is a better way to handle this. Estimating the date on when the new revision kick in is difficult as the user need to forecast the inventory availability manually.<br />
<br />
We are on Baan V. Any advice on this is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />
