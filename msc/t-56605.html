<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lvergnano</div><div class="date">25th August 2009, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello gurus,<br />
I'm a manufacturing newbie, so please forgive me for my ignorance.<br />
<br />
I have a customer who uses E-Items and E-Bom to have different version of produced goods in manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Different versions are handled in different projects.<br />
<br />
This means that, when he needs, for example, to change something for a new customer, he:<br />
1. Creates a new project and activates it<br />
2. Creates a new version of e-items and e-boms<br />
3. Creates the E-BOM Duplication Data<br />
4. Copies Duplicate Data to PCS, in Customized Item and customized Boms<br />
<br />
This is ok; my problem is that sometimes standard routings are copied in customized routings and sometimes not (or at least this is what they say): I have not understood the rules behind this process.<br />
<br />
My question is: Is it possibile to create automatically a customized routing during the copy-from-engineering-eitem-and-ebom-data in PCS module? If yes, under what conditions?<br />
<br />
If not, must routings created or copied by hand? Is it possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks very much,<br />
Luca</div></div><hr />

if the standard item has more than 1 item routing,and we copy it to customized item, the customize item will only take the standard item routing code data.<br />
also the item routing description is not copied (but for this issue theres already a solution from the support)</div></div><hr />
