I believe its when you invoice a PO with the new Pur Price but just want to confirm.<br />
<br />

Thanks,<br />

what you say is correct but don´t forget to change or update the priority of purchase price field in the session &quot;price calculation code&quot; (if you have baan V, the session is ticpr1500m000).<br />
<br />
For Baan IV you can see the session ticpr1101m00 to check the priority.  if you want last price it must be first priority Lp<br />

thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">21st January 2004, 06:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The setting of the Purchase Price Priority field in the session &quot;Maintain Cost Price Calculation Codes&quot; (ticpr1101m000) only determines what purchase price Baan (IV) uses to calculate cost price in Calculate Cost Prices (ticpr2210m000), it does not control when the latest and average purchase prices in the Item Master are updated.<br />
<br />
The setting of &quot;Integration with Baan Finance&quot; in Maintain Financial Integration Parameters (tdpur6100m000) determines when the Average Purchase Price and Latest Purchase Price in the Item Master are updated.<br />
<br />
If &quot;Integration with Baan Finance&quot; is Yes, the Average Purchase Price and Latest Purchase Price are updated on approval of the purchase invoice (in tfacp1140s000). <br />
<br />
If &quot;Integration with Baan Finance&quot; is No, the Average Purchase Price and Latest Purchase Price are updated by Process Delivered Purchase Orders (tdpur4223m000).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">21st January 2004, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, Hitesh. I forgot about updating price after receipt. But since that session updates the PO Line item price, wouldn't the actual update of latest price field in the Itrem Master still be processed at the same points (i.e. approval of the purchase invoice or Process Delivered Purchase Orders)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th January 2004, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">To the best of my memory , the latest and average prices are calculated at the time of purchase receipt , change price/discounts after delivery , invoice approval etc . <br />
<br />
Currently I am not in front of Baan  and in a position to check this . U may check the whereused programs for tdpurdll0019 , to get the correct list  or else create a simple test.<br />
<br />
Also  keep this post updated.</div></div><hr />
