Based on BOMs and Routings a required date is calculated. This is also the calculated delivery date for a purchase advice. The order date is simply the delivery date -/- the lead time of the item (if relevant added with a safety time). Hope this answers your question.</div></div><hr />

      Thank you for your answer. My question is: I have a planned MRP purchase order. The system calculate Planned Order Date = 04/26/2006, Planned Delivery Date = 06/21/2006. This item in the order set Lead Time = 40 days, Safety Time = 8 days. It seems planned Order date &lt;&gt; Planned delivery date - lead time - safety time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">10th May 2006, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a lot of time currently to calculate it for you, but be aware of the lead time: this is in working days (in your case perhaps 5 days/week) as wel as the safety time is.<br />
Plse recalculate and check the results.</div></div><hr />
