Please help on this issue. suggest if any work around is possible if some direct method is not applicable.<br />

<br />
The only way you can tell the origin of a Production Order is to have different Order Series for Production Orders generated from EP and Manual Production Orders.<br />
<br />
For example, this can be done in Shop Floor Control Parameters (tisfc0100s000) by setting the following Number Group parameters:<br />
<br />
- Production Order Series for Production Orders (Manual) = M<br />
- Production Order Series for Enterprise Planning = P<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, no record is maintained of the Logon ID of the user who created a manual Production Order.<br />

But In LN, you can use Pegging Relation to track, who is required this Production ORder.<br />
If theres no Information, then this could be (but not for sure) created manually.<br />
Or you can block the create icon in production Order.<br />
SO no one can create it manually.</div></div><hr />
