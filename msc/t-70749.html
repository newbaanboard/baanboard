<br />
I wonder if there is a way to create purchase orders for the cheapest supplier for a specific ordered quantity. The prices are in the pricebook and there can optionally be a purchase contract.<br />
<br />
Had anyone get this done in Baan?<br />
<br />
We use PO advice in CP planning. But I think it uses the WH order advices before creating a PO.<br />
<br />
I would be grateful for every hint...</div></div><hr />

Basically just tracked the quantities available to purchase on contracts with suppliers.  I am not even sure how it worked anymore - but I think it basically monitored GRP purchase orders and would release them automatically, create all the necessary paper work and interface records.  Now that I typed it not sure if this is even relevant to your issue.  So best to just wait for some other ln users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">15th January 2018, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. Me thinks that we have to do it on our own. But perhaps someone already did that or someone with a newer version than 10.2.1 has a hint if it is solved somehow in 10.3 - 10.5!?</div></div><hr />
