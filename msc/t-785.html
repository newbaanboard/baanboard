Bit curious to know if someone has done this in the past and what are the consequences..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ramchand50</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">What if, if we do this through 'Alternative Items'...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael Phifer</div><div class="date">30th January 2002, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Ensure that there are no active records in Baan for the items you are planning to change: such as Sales Orders, Purchase orders, Plan orders, etc.<br />
<br />
2) You should expire the BOM for these items.<br />
<br />
3) Then there should be no major issues with changing them from Manufactured to Purchased.   Remember that you will have to complete the normal fields for a Purchased item, probably change the Item group and Product type and run a cost calculation update.<br />
<br />
4) Change plan code from MPS to MRP or SIC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdumais61</div><div class="date">28th February 2002, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">The previous message mentioned to expire the BOM.  This is correct or you also can delete the BOM.  <br />
Also you should remove the task from routing along with the routing code for the item.  This will ensure proper clean up for future rollups.<br />
<br />
Have you determined if this will be a permanent change.  If not then you might consider creating a subcontract work center and task.  Maintain the task in the subcontract module and maintain the routing with this change.  You can also retain the original routing as an alternate route.  This gives you the ability to flip back and forth if needed.<br />
<br />
M.A.D.</div></div><hr />

We are also considering the option of copying the existing Mfg. part (eg. xyz) to a new Pur. part (eg. xyzP).  Basically the new part # will be prefixed or suffixed with letter 'P' &amp; the item type is set to 'Purchased', while copying from the old part #.</div></div><hr />

If EDM items are copied to standard, there is check on item type.<br />
