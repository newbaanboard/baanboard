I assume that there is such a unit because when I maintain units / conversion factors I can see a MFG Unit.  I have not found out where to change it!<br />
<br />
<br />
I want to inventory my board in sq ft and store it in sheets.  Okay no problem so far. inven unit sqft and storage unit shts.<br />
<br />
When I release the production order it is in Sqft.  Can I change this to sheets somehow?  Is this what the MFG unit does?   Where can I find it?<br />
<br />
<br />
I simply want to draw the BOM relationship in sqft to save time.  I still want to store and manufacture in boards!</div></div><hr />

<br />
When determining main measurement unit of an item in BaanERP, somehow accounting got the upper hand. This is because in most cases, it all comes down to what measurement unit the accounting department would rather use to account for the material cost. If your accounting dept has chosen to value those boards in sq ft (which can be a little tricky during cycle counting, an activity which should be monitored closely by accounting), then unfortunately BaanERP will still make production material request in sq ft. However, you still can issue the material from storage in number of sheets, even though the request is in sq ft<br />
