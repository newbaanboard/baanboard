<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">12th August 2002, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I am faced with a scenario where a certain machine produces more scrap on high speed then it does on lower speeds.<br />
<br />
The speed of the machine is depending on the quantity to be produced. The larger the quantity, the higher the speed.<br />
<br />
I want to include this variable scrap-factor, to keep costs accurate, but I can't seem to do it in Baan.<br />
<br />
Has anybody beat this challenge before?</div></div><hr />

This is item specific so it might be allot more work and not an easy solution.</div></div><hr />

Also take care you don't order so much that there won't be left over anything anymore.<br />
<br />
(Flip's suggestion sounds like a good approach btw.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">13th August 2002, 17:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I was going with quantity dependent routing, but I was expecting the machine to &quot;cause&quot; scrap when it is in fact the operation where scrap and yield is maintained.<br />
<br />
This would actually allow me to set up some generic operations like a 10% scrap, 20% scrap and 30% scrap operation that then can be used by many items, depending on the quantity to be produced.....I hope.</div></div><hr />
