If I want to manually calculate the allocated stock and ordered stock as a check on tiitm001.allo and tiitm001.ordr, wich fields needs to be considered?<br />
<br />
tdinv150 + tipcs500 + timrp010  ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sujoy.sen</div><div class="date">16th May 2003, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been a while since I've worked with the Planning modules in Baan IV. However, if I am not mistaken, tiitm001.allo and tiitm001.ordr are not affected by mps and mrp until and unless the relevant mps and mrp orders are converted into actual sfc and pur orders. Therefore, to calculate tiitm001.allo and tiitm001.ordr, you would need to add up all future outflow and inflow, respectively, of the item, from all nettable warehouses in the system. Again, not having looked at the tdinv module in a long time (tdinv does not exist in Baan V !) I can't be absolutely certain, but if tdinv150 is your planned inventory movements table by item, I would use just that to manually calculate tiitm001.allo and tiitm001.ordr. Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />
