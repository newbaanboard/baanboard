Is there a standard method which avoid you to create manually the technical Data ?<br />
<br />
ps : We can't use the configurator neither the project module.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">20th June 2007, 09:02</div></div><div class="posttext">The Item Master table contains a lot of fields that needs to be filled up as an item code is being created. The tables involved are itm001, itm004(if conversions apply) and itm100. A BOM file simply doesnt provide all that information. To speed up the creation of items and its bom, you could use the copy method in Item Master and copy the specification of an existing item closely resembling it and then do the little adjustments that uniquely identifies this new item. Furthermore you coud create Item Defaults for the combination of Item Type and Item Group which would then make the creation of item codes easier.<br />
The bom table is a simple table and you could create a structure of the table(all fields with the exact sizes) in a spreadsheet and import it through the exchange schemes(after converting it into a txt file). You could automize this task with some vb codes too....<br />

My idea to create routings and import the missing informations for items is to generate text files and use BAAN Exchange. :)</div></div><hr />
