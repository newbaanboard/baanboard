<br />
I am having problem with Family diaggregation on Baan5c. How can I make demands for family in one unit (package) and make diaggregation of family items in other unit (pieces)?<br />
<br />
I have tried to make conversion factors for family items (package -&gt; pieces), but that won't work. Everything works when I put the same units for family and items in the family.<br />

<br />
If you need to make conversion between units of family and items of family you may set the conversion factor for family. That solution gives you the conversion of all family items in one family. <br />
<br />
Also, you may need different conversion factors for each member of family. In that case you must insert new family items. The number of new family items depends on number of items with different conversion factors.<br />
<br />
It will be the new situation because you will have top family item on plan level 1, with family items on plan level 2. For this family you may define one conversion factor for all members (e.g. package to pieces). For family items on plan level 2, you may define conversion factors for each family item, which will contain at least one final product on plan level 3 (e.g. fitst family item will contain 10 pieces of final product 1, second family item will contain 5 pieces of final product 2...)<br />
<br />
As I said this is helpful solution, but it's no straightforward.<br />
