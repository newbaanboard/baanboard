<br />
In production order- Back-flushing of materials is set to yes. On completion of the order for the production order qty, the qty back flushed (materials) is double. Following sequence of operations carried:<br />
<br />
1. Release production order<br />
2. Book hrs for the individual operations &amp; hrs processed<br />
3. No subcon operations<br />
4. Report-operations completed<br />
5. System prompted to back-flush the material (quantities are available). Material back flushed<br />
6. Production order completed <br />
<br />
Now we find material issued is double to estimated qty. <br />
<br />
Checkd &quot;inventory transactions by order&quot;  in warehouse reporting and &quot;Integration transactions by project &amp; order&quot; in gld. Time instance for material issue is same for all the issue transactions.<br />
<br />
Checkd the Finished item receipt qty in inventory transaction &amp; finance. It is same as production order qty. <br />
<br />
Any inputs, why system triggered double qty while back flushing?  <br />
<br />
In other production orders back-flushing is in line with estimated quantities. Should we consider it as a one off case?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

Just a after thought. please check the BOM unit for this item. BOM units control the qunatity required in the BOM.<br />

Check whether there is a need to run Inventory correction programs ?<br />
<br />
Still if you dont get the solution, pls contact SSA for support. Baan is said to be strong for the manufacturing &amp; distribution modules.<br />
<br />
Cheers !!!</div></div><hr />

Just two ideas by someone using Baan IV: what about scrap factors in the BOM? I guess you checked this already.<br />
More likely (it happens to us already): in Baan IV you can enter a backflush quantity for each operation (tisfc010.qtbf). This entry will adjust the estimated material and therefore leads to &quot;unexpected&quot; backflushing quantities. I have to admit that there is no place to track the entry of this field except an audit.<br />

<br />
Thanx for the inputs. I have checked up the following:<br />
<br />
1. Customer site is ILC/ LTC implemented one. We have already tried out inventory correction run. However, there was no effect on financial entries. We have a long pending case with SSA Global.<br />
<br />
2. Regarding Scrap factor - not defined. We have simulated another production order for the same manufactured item and the back flushing functionality is behaving correctly.<br />
<br />
We shall await for SSA support inputs. <br />
<br />
Thanx again<br />

I faced a similar situation when i was at one of my client site.<br />
I realized that it happened because the user changed the Production order status from &quot;Released &quot; to &quot;Planned&quot; and then released it again.(it is possible to change it only by modifying the table). <br />
Just check,if your Problem is similar to this one<br />
