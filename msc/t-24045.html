I have an interesting problem and I am looking for any suggestions as to how to resolve it (Baan IVc4).<br />
<br />
We use PCS Projects and we have had several instances where a purchase order is created and the project is attached on form1.  Then the purchasing staff has manually forced the costs associated with the PO line to be driven to a non-work-in-process account (by using form 3).  When the project closes the system relieves these costs out of Work-in-process and takes more out of the work-in-process account than was put in for that project.<br />
<br />
I have attached an illustrated example in an Excel file.<br />
<br />
I need to be able to fix this.  We use some customized reports which use the integration transactions to report WIP.  If I enter a journal entry into the system (to correct the ledger), these reports will still calculate negative work-in-process for the project.  If I use project general costs to add costs (into work-in-process) and remove them from the expense account the purchase order originally booked it to, the project reports will show duplicate costs on their reports.<br />
<br />
I have since created Oracle triggers to 'blank' out the account and dimension fields on form 3 of the PO lines if a project exists to prevent future problems.  Without the override, the integrations will post all project related costs to Work In Process.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions?  Any input would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
