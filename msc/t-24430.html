Our set up says 'no routing, no production order'<br />
Anybody have a solution to this problem or experience in using rework orders</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janneman</div><div class="date">30th June 2005, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">When using rework orders, the standard routing en BOM are deleted. The BOM is filled with the manufactured material to rework. So the productionorder material is also the BOM material. It's intention is to fill the BOM further with the rework needed materials as positive amount into the BOM en the materials demontage as a negative amount. After that prepare the routing for the rework order and print-relaese the order.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rocky6</div><div class="date">1st July 2005, 02:17</div></div><div class="posttext">As Janneman said, the routing is deleted when you flag the order as &quot;rework&quot;.<br />
You'll have to go to Maintain Production Planning and insert the necessary routing steps (tasks) required to do the rework.</div></div><hr />
