<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">24th April 2006, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a situation where a customer order for a manufactured item was cancelled after the product was made and the production order reported completed.  Now we want to take the product apart and put the materials back in inventory.  Since there is not a way in Baan IV to reverse such a production order, how would you handle this?  I tried to use negative quantities in the Estimated Materials but the Generate Outbound will not backflush negative quantities.  Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">24th April 2006, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to use the maintain outbound session (tdilc4101m000) to create the outbound data for negatives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">25th April 2006, 03:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply.  I know that a 'Maintain Outbound' will backflush negative quantities but this will require manual intervention rather than having Baan backflush automatically.  I guess I could a batch job which will look for any production orders which were reported completed and have negative quantities in the BOM.  The routine would then issue the material using a Maintain Outbound. I guess I will go that route while I'm waiting for more suggestions.<br />

Thanks again,<br />

We have a tear down bill that gets released, the floor takes things apart and then sends it to inventory.  What we did was create a session to read the ticst001 records and put them in a temporary table.  Inventory people then complete the record - they input the qty and location and process the records.  I see no reason why you could not automate the whole step - in our case we may not always yield what is expected and our locations are not fixed.  If I had those two pieces I could ask for the order and process all the records.  Attached is what our session looks like - in the background in creates the outbound record and releases it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pk_parida</div><div class="date">26th April 2006, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no such direct step to reverse a production order.  This type of situation occurs in most of the cases. But we do it differently. <br />
<br />
we go to the session Report production order complete &gt; PRESS completed - Yes &gt; a subsession opens (maintain production receipt (ilc)) . Now delete the records.This will cancel your finish goods posting. Now delivery qty will be zero. Now u can make the completed qty zero.<br />
<br />
What is only left with the production order is the raw material issued to it.<br />
This you can nullify by doing following step<br />
   Maintain estimated material i.e -ve qty with raw material w/h.<br />
   maintain outbound and release the material to raw material w/h.<br />
<br />
This way the order can be reversed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pk_parida</div><div class="date">28th April 2006, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">For reverting delivered quiantity following Steps can be used -<br />
   1.  Go to session tisfc0202m000 [ Report production orders completed]<br />
   2.  select the production order and press button [ Re. Complete].<br />
   3.  This will lead to two messages post hours and post to inventory.<br />
   4.   Press Yes button in both the message, this will open the session. tdilc4113s000 [ Maintain Receipt (ilc)]<br />
   5. This session will display the lot and quantity delivered to finish goods w/h.<br />
   6. Now delete the records. This will nullify the delivered quantity.<br />
<br />
   Now to revert the issued raw material the following steps can be followed.<br />
   1. Go to session entermaterial issue. [ enter  item code of raw material,-ve quantity and raw material w/h).<br />
   2. maintain outbound and release.<br />
<br />
This will revert the production order. You can do it in test environment. and see its effect. We have done it many times in our case.<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply and detail information. I think you are using the version IV and mentioned all sessions &amp; processes realted to that version. Unfortunatly we have BaanERP (Version V) and we don't have the sessions you mentioned. Please if you can give references of sessions in Version V, or some document that explain this procedure so I can check corresponding procedure in version V.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
