We have set the “Moment Freezing Estimates” to the latest possible point (Before first WIP Transaction ) but changes do sometimes occur to a production order. ( Material added or changed on the BOM ). We currently handle these changes through the “Material to issue for production orders” session. But this is a manual process and causes problems. For instance if a new item is added to the active BOM and the subsequent delivery quantity is set at 10, and then a partial quantity of that item is issued, the subsequent delivery amount changes to zero. The user must manually reset this to the remaining quantity. <br />
So, is there a better way to manage BOM changes on active production orders?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sjohnson</div><div class="date">11th December 2009, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, we're running FP3. I had a look at FP5 and the functionality has not changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">15th December 2009, 07:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
i use FP5<br />
I dont use direct process warehousing.<br />
so i add a new material line in material to issue by prod ord, then initiate it.<br />
the qty will move to field &quot;to issue by wh&quot;<br />
then the warehouse will be proceed in their own session (warehousing orders) find the prod ord number-outbound line ,the added line will be appear in there.<br />
warehouse will process release outbound advice partially.<br />
Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply. Your process is similar to what we do now. I was hoping for some sort of functionality to role a new revision of a P-BOM down to the production order, without having to manually add/delete lines on the material to issue session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If after estimation is frozen and again if you want to change the estimation, then how will you compare the estimation and actual. The estimations are frozen in order to check the variance between estimated material and actual material.<br />
If we are able to change estimation through out life cycle of an order, then there is no need to have two defferent terms as estimate and actual.</div></div><hr />
