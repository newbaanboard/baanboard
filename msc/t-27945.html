<br />
I have to set up a manufactured with a subcontracting operation. The subcontractor is in US and the company is in Europe. Hence there is a mix of currencies and inventory units. <br />
<br />
The inv UOM for the manufactured and subcontracting item has to be Kg. The purchase unit of the subcontracting unit is also Kg, but the purchase price unit has to be lb (Pound). Hence the PO on the subcontractor should show the price in lb.<br />
<br />
Also the subcontractor is supplying to US sites also so the currency for the supplier is USD, but for Europe sites the currency required is Euro.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for spending your valuable time on this issue.</div></div><hr />
