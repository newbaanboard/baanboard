<br />
Warehouses orders are only created when the planned distribution order supplies items within the same company.<br />
This means that the Supplying Site on the planned order details must be equal to your current logistic company.<br />
If they are not the same then the item is supplied via a Purchase/Sales relation.<br />
<br />

That's right, two distribution order must have same logistic  company. We only use a logistic company, and all planned distribution order have been created in same logistic company. they all can been transfer to warehouseing module, but system create one distibution order number for per a planned distribution order. even though for two distribution order ,they have same item number, demand date logistc company.<br />
<br />
It's ok, for two planned purchase order we can transfer they to one purchase order number.   A purchase order can with many purchase order line. but for transfered distribution order, only a order line exist. <br />
How can I transfer two two distribution orders  to a distribution order number liking purchase order.  <br />
<br />
Thanks and regards.<br />

Yes, Sicco is my name :)<br />
<br />
Regarding to your question, what you want is currently not supported functionality.<br />
It is not possible to combine planned distribution orders to one warehouse order. <br />
<br />
You are correct that it is possible to do this grouping of orders for purchase orders, but this is very limited.<br />
<br />
