<br />
This is in Baan Vc.<br />
<br />
Consider the following Item Structure :<br />
Top Level Item : A<br />
Lower level Items for Item-A : <br />
A1, B1, C1<br />
(A1, C1 are Manufactured, B1 is Purchased)<br />
Item A1 has a lower level Item-A11  (Manufactured Item)<br />
<br />
I have a Production Order # 1 for Item A <br />
Item-A1 has production order #10<br />
Item-C1 has production order #20<br />
<br />
Item-A11 has production order #30<br />
<br />
What would be the best way to calculate the Labor Hours on each of these production orders.... am total them up as the Total Hrs spent to make Part A. Which tables would I be looking at.<br />
If someone has done this &quot;drill-down&quot; procedure to capture the labor hours  for the lower level orders/items... can you please help me out with the code/algorithm or which tables to look at.<br />
<br />
All help is appreciated. Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Little John</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what particular manufacturing industry you're in. But just to remind you that generally if the semi finished goods don't check in and out of warehouse, you can simply designate them as phantom. That way, less production orders will be created per finished product and less headache in determining total operational cost in producing the product<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply<br />
<br />
 This is a aerospace company and we need to have lot traceability for every lower level item (prod &amp; pur) and reporting &amp; estimating has to be done on this basis.<br />
