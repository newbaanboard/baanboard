<br />
If I simplify the situation in our electronics manufacturing, there is an equipment(box-filler) which is connected to a connector which has facility for 3 connections. The connector always has slots for 3 connections. If the customer orders 3 box fillers we manufacture the same and need 1 connector. If the customer needs 1 box-filler, then too we need 1 connector.<br />
The BOM requirement is, for 1 to 3 box-fillers 1 connector, 4 to 6 box-fillers 2 connectors and so on. How is this situation handled in BOM in Baan V? <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

What I face is not something peculiar. To illustrate further I have attached a powerstrip. There are 3 slots. Suppose I produce some appliance which needs individual power supply. If the customer orders 3 appliances I manufacture three and then buy one powerstrip and deliver to the customer. If I get order for 2 appliances I manufacture two and buy 1 powerstrip and deliver to the customer. The production orders are created manually and the powerstrip comes in the Estimated materials of the production order of the appliance. How is the BOM defined?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">16th May 2007, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using Baan IVc, but I don't think V should be any different. Quite simply, a BOM is a definite list of materials; it can't have options in it. I think you have three options -<br />
<br />
- List the equipment and the &quot;power strips&quot; separately on sales orders.<br />
- Create a BOM (and therefore separate part number) for each possible combination of equipment and power strips.<br />
- Use the configurator to define the options and configure the end product.<br />
<br />
We've looking into the configurator but haven't tackled it yet. Lots of overhead to setting up and maintaining as things change, at least in our environment. Putting up the orders with separate line items means order administrators work from some kind of matrix to tell them what has to be ordered with what equipment. This also means the items have to be loaded separately into the MPS. Using the BOMs is the cleanest way, since putting up an order for one number takes care of it. One item in MPS drives everything you need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your valuable inputs. At the moment we are considering rounding up to achieve the requirement. BOM unit will be 3 for the equipment and its component strip will be 1 pcs net quantity. Rounding factor of unit pcs is 1.0000. When a production order for 1 equipment is keyed in, the requirement is 0.33 for strip but system rounds off to 0 at the moment in the estimated material. By changing the domain of the quantity field to round up, I can test whether it becomes 1. If the production order is for 4 then 1.33 will become 2 and so on. But I am yet to test this. Once again thanks for the update.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">17th May 2007, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">That's an interesting approach. I never thought of using BOM units that way, but it sounds like it might work as long as the rounding up doesn't adversely affect quantities somewhere else. Please post the results of your testing.</div></div><hr />
