Production order was for Quantity of 5.  Was Completed for 1 instead of 5.  Status Changed from Completed to Active in Table.<br />
Operations Reset to Active and Order then completed for 5.  Hours and Material all posted correctly.  <br />
<br />
Now Production Order in Status of To Be Completed, with Quantity to Deliver at 4.  <br />
<br />
No Warehouse Order exist except for the one that delivered the 1.  How do you receive the other 4 and complete the Order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you do that via GTM (General Table Management - ttaad4100)?  :eek: <br />
If so: you ask for troubles !!<br />
You should never do that, unless you are sure, that the change does not cause data corruption.<br />
Once a production order is Completed the remaining WH order (inbound)lines will be removed. If you reset status in GTM, you won't get back these removed inbound lines....<br />

  Baan Support fixed the item thur GTM.  This is not the recommended fixed but in some cases it's the only fix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Next time probably it would be better just to enter another SFC order for that 4 pcs?<br />
