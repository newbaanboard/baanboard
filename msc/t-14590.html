<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chufos</div><div class="date">25th February 2004, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using BaaN IV c4.<br />
<br />
I want to sell several customised-purchased items. I purchase them to a supplier called XXX<br />
<br />
I introduce in the sale order<br />
- The customised-purchased items (already configured)<br />
- The Planned Delivery Date, i.e. the date that all the goods of the sale order should be ready in my warehouse to be shipped<br />
<br />
As far as I know the PRP generates purchase advice orders to be delivered by the suppliers in my warehouse in the same day Planned Delivery Date introduced in the sale order.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the supplier XXX supplies always with delay, so I have to change all the Planned Delivery Date in the purchase advises one week before the Planned Delivery Date (as a safety time).<br />
<br />
Is any parameter, field,where I could request in the Generating purchase advice for PRP with the Planned Delivery Date of the with a safety time?<br />
<br />
I really do not understand why BaaN does not admit that a supplier of a customised item could be with delay! and I also do not understand why BaaN request that the goods should be supplied (Planned Delivery Date in the purchase order) the same day when these goods shuold be shipped (Planned Delivery Date introduced in the sale order) when is very frecuent that a supplier has a delay<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
Does anybody know the thinking behind Baan not allowing safety time for customised (purchased) items?<br />
<br />
Or are there any suitable alternatives to account for suppliers of customised items sometimes delivering late?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
