<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">neeraj_vasudeva</div><div class="date">16th July 2004, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We are working on Baan IV c4 is3 , sp10.<br />
Here MPS is generating some excess planned orders.<br />
<br />
here we have configured our system for simplest use of MPS , the formula for calculating Planned order Qty is <br />
&quot;Demand (sales Order) - Stock - Prodn Order - Planned Order &quot;<br />
Safety stocks = 0 , Multiple = 0 , Min Order Qty = 0 , Order method = lot for lot etc <br />
<br />
But for some item, system is not using is formula , after analysis we have found that MPS is not considering future date pending prdn orders<br />
<br />
For Example <br />
till 16.07.04 : Pending Sales Order Qty  =1000<br />
Till 16.07.04 Pending Prodn order Qty = 400<br />
On 19.07.04 there is another Prodn order ( manually entered by user) =200<br />
And Stock as on 16.07.04 = 400<br />
Planned Orders = 0<br />
<br />
Then as per formula system should not generate any planned MPS order<br />
1000 - 400 - 200 - 400 = 0<br />
<br />
But system is generating order for 200 pcs + also giving rescheduling messages for Prodn orders of 19.07.04.<br />
<br />
Now my Question is &quot;IS THERE ANY WAY IN MPS BY WHICH IT CONSIDERS FUTURE DATE PENDING PRODN ORDERS ALSO&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks in ADVANCE<br />

Its also giving you a reschedule message because if you reschedule the 7-19 order you could also meet your requirements.  If you changed your sales order date to 7-19 do both the planned order and reschedule message go away.</div></div><hr />
