<br />
We are using BaaN Vc-sp15.<br />
<br />
We are using queue time with each operations in routing. The materials are linked to the operation(through BOM). <br />
<br />
In BaaN, the materials are available at the &quot;production start date&quot; which is after the queue time is exhausted. We want to get the materials at the beginning of  queue time and not after the queue time.<br />
<br />
Can any body suggest the mathod or any work around?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I can't think of anything else then to relate componts in BOM to queue task/operation instead of physical operation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">9th February 2005, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">You might try putting your time in as Transit Time instead of Queue time.  Transit time is added after the operation, allowing time to transfer to the next operation.  This should move your production start date for the operation back as you desire.<br />
<br />
Always be careful with queue and transit times if you are using Main Work Centers and Sub-Workcenters.  BaaN applys these times to planning in ways that may not be obvious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still I could not get the materials as per the time. If I use Transit time, instead of queue time, the material will available still on production start time only.<br />
<br />
As per the other suggestion of adding queue time as a dummy operation, I can get the metarials as I want. But it adds more operation and data entries. <br />
<br />
Any other suggestion/solutions pls?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">11th February 2005, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">But - did it not move the production start date back as well?<br />
Following assumes 1 day for the operations.<br />
Case 1:<br />
	Q1=2 days	OP1	Q2=1 days	OP2	Completion<br />
			6APR			8APR	9APR<br />
Case 2:<br />
	OP1	T1=2 days	OP2 T2= 1 day	Completion<br />
	4APR			7APR			9APR<br />
Material available on production start date, but that date is earlier using T time than if using Q time.  That seemed to be what you wanted.  Using the transit time gives you the buffer time after the operation - that is, allows you more time to complete.  Using the queue time, going before the operation, does not allow the extra time for the operation.<br />
<br />
Sorry my suggestion does not work for you.<br />
<br />
If what you want is a materials available date that drives the due dates of the purchased and or manufactured items needed for the production order you might consider the use of Inbound Lead Time (Item Data by Warehouse in BaaN V).  We use Inbound Lead Time on materials coming in to allow time for Receiving and inspection before going to stores.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. Your answer clarifies my requirement very well. I could apply the same method in my production planning.<br />
