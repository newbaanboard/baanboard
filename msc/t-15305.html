<br />
I want to distinguish the difference between repetitive manufacturing and the standard manufacturing procedures? what are the significant advantages in repetitive manufacturing ?<br />
Please list the disadvantages as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tim Fleming</div><div class="date">12th May 2004, 06:50</div></div><div class="posttext">A repetitive type of manufacturing environment is characterized by high speed, large volume of production. Usually, the items are make to stock and have a short lead time. Production is usually accomplished with dedicated production facilities (such as an assembly line). There is less diversity among the end products (standard products). The production in a repetitive type of manufacturing environment is rate-based (as governed by the production setup). Because the production speed is high and the lead time is very short, the production is controlled with schedules instead of production orders.<br />
<br />
I think you are more familiar with the Discrete environment but please contact me should you need additional assistance,<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />

<br />
I have a scenerio where polyster yarn is produced in continuous production environment. so for such process can i used repetitive manufacturing module of infor ln.<br />
<br />
Can you elaborate &amp; send some documentation on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

<br />
You can use Repetitive manufacturing for that scenarion. But it has some constraints also. As it is continuous production environment, the costing at production order level is not accurate. <br />
<br />
You can use backflushing functionality with repetitive manufacturing. <br />

From Baan system perspecitive, repittive mfg, simpilfies the reporting of work orders. Baan does create work order, but they get completed by system. Since, repittive mfg involved same product on regular basis at high volume it make sense, as in reality one do not issue a work order on the floor. So, system perspective is simplification of production ordering process.<br />
<br />
In reference to ployester case, I don't know if Baan supports continous mfg in reptitive mode <br />
