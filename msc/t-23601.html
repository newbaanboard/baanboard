<br />
Regarding multi level BOM concept and which manufacturing conditions it would suit (the hard part), I suggest you read some books released by APICS. Regarding how to record multi level BOM into BaanERP (the easy part), the manual that came with the software should show it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">5th April 2005, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I gather you're new to the use of BOMs and structuring a product. The simple answer is that you don't create and use multi-level BOMs a such - you create a series of single level BOMs. Suppose you create a BOM for item ABC containing items DEF,HIJ &amp; KLM. If one of these, say HIJ, also has a BOM under it (containing NOP &amp; QRS), then you have a multi-level BOM. A BOM within a BOM, so to speak, sometimes referred to as an indented BOM because of the way it's printed -<br />
<br />
ABC<br />
...DEF<br />
...HIJ<br />
......NOP<br />
......QRS<br />
...KLM<br />
<br />
This simple example has three levels. You can have many different levels and many BOMs and items on each of these levels, depending on the product being structured and how manufacturing wants to handle it. Remember that each BOM level requires a work order to build (unless you're able to use phantoms).</div></div><hr />
