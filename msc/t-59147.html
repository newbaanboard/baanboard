<br />
First, thanks all owners and contributors to this site cos I'm pretty new in Baan and all material here helps much. I already solved some problems using advices here.<br />
<br />
At my company we want to use MPS and I'm running some scenario tests to implement. Problem is when I create MPS board using session &quot;timps3201m000&quot;, system cumulates some planned receipt values which I can't understand. <br />
<br />
For example, at my latest scenario I have manually entered 100pcs for each day 2 months straight. After MPS run, system calculates 1000 pcs for 1st day and 0 for next 9 days. 100 pcs for each next 7 days and cumulates another 400 pcs for 4 days and again 100 pcs for each 4 days and so on...<br />
<br />
There is not a pattern at this calculations. We're using company calendar and I entered all days %100 capacity to simplify scenario. Also there is no capacity issues here as we are after material needs of plan.<br />
<br />
Any ideas or advices abou calculation logic here?? Thx in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a week, we tried to solve this problem and after recreating company calendar and making necessary changes on calendar, MPS started working just fine. I guess it was a data related problem but we couldn't figure it out.<br />
