<br />
I have found a few areas with this but not what i am after, i hope you can help.<br />
<br />
A user has reported all operations completed, when processing the order they have said NO to 'Process inbound procedure automatically when activating warehousing order receipt line' when they should have said YES.<br />
<br />
It has now 1 completed and 0 delivered. The prod order is at status 'To Be Completed'.<br />
<br />
How do i get this to 'completed' and deliver the qty 1?<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />
<br />
JK</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess, you need to go to Warehousing Orders session (whinh2100m100) and for that specific SFC Production Order, you need to check if inbound advice is generated or not, if yes, you need to check if receipt is generated or not, if yes then confirm the receipt.<br />
<br />
Also, if there are any open outbound order lines, you need to complete them as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it seems the final receipt and inbound is done but the production order is still sat at 'To Be Completed'<br />
<br />
I dont have whinh2100m100 so if you could give me the name of the session would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
Ive managed to sort now Bhushanchanda.<br />
<br />
It was more a create receipt for it as it was sat in prod warehouse awaiting receipt then process (confirm) receipt.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your help though.<br />
