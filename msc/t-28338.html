I understand the meaning of this error. I have removed the material consumption in both the production orders, yet the problem remain. I think this is due to the history.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion to solve this problem are appreciate.</div></div><hr />

Look for the loop, delete it from the BOM-structure and try again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The loop is not found in PCS BOM.<br />
<br />
From the error message, it is clear that the loop is found in actual material structure, that is, in the production order.<br />
<br />
I worry this is a &quot;dead lock&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">In the error message its indicating the loop found in actual material structure so i  dont think its the PCS BOM thats causing this. Its further ruled out when after removing the loop from the PCS BOM the error persists..<br />
<br />
There is one thing in what you said which is interesting...<br />
Quoting you..<br />
&quot;I have removed the material consumption in both the production orders...&quot;<br />
<br />
How did you do this? Once you issue an item in a production order, Baan doesnt allow you to delete those issued items from the PRoduction order. So care to throw some light on to this?<br />
<br />
sK<br />
<br />
P.S: Whats the status of these Production Orders b.t.w?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 12:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi sukesh75,<br />
<br />
The production orders status are &quot;Completed&quot;<br />
<br />
I am using session ticst0101m000 to remove the material comsumption by issuing a negative quantity. I am not allow to delete those items from the production orders (ticst001).<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is the root cause of the problem. BaaN will still calculate the actual cost for this items in the production orders, even though the nett material consumption is zero.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion is very much appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">10th October 2006, 07:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi <br />
You have to delete this item from the Maintain Estimated Materials {tisfc0110m000}. Since your production order status is Completed, this will not be possible. Just check the table tdinv150 (Planned Inventory Transaction by Item) for any entry for this item against the completed production order for the combination of Production Order - Mat. Requirement.<br />
If its present, delete it from this table and re-run the calculation process. <br />
<br />
If that fails to solve the problem, Create a new project, transfer the finished quantity from the project with cost price error to the new project. <br />

I get the message Loops found in actual material structure at the end of the report.  Then it lists pdno1 - item 1, pdno2 - item2 then pdno1 - item1 again.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what to do about this.  Both production orders are in a &quot;Closed&quot; status.<br />
<br />
Will transferring the qty to a different project work?  How do I know what the qty is supposed to be?<br />
<br />
thanks - Nikkiz</div></div><hr />

The quantity that the Production Order completed would be what you need to transfer. <br />
<br />
Once the quantity is transfered, you should &quot;Cancel&quot; and &quot;Close&quot; the project with problems. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Bryant</div><div class="date">17th February 2012, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
<br />
Would like to add to this as we have just had the same experience!!<br />
Our &quot;loop&quot; was with a customised item in the Production Material.<br />
<br />
The item had been issued.<br />
The Production Order had been completed.<br />
<br />
So there was no User Interface way to remove the loop because Estimated Quantities were present.<br />
<br />
To remove the customised item from the estimated material we had to un-issue the material with a negative transaction and zero subsequent delivery.<br />
<br />
In GTM make the estimated quantity (ques) in ticst001 0.<br />
<br />
Delete the material line from the Production Order (now possible as Estimated Quantity = 0)<br />
<br />
Close the Production Order.<br />
<br />
Close the Project.</div></div><hr />
