Now I can not figure out how the WIP works, since it's showing minus balance. Would anyone help me why it's showing minus balance? I try to learn the program ticst3500m000 (Efficiency Variance) where this calculation comes from? and why this transaction happened</div></div><hr />

<br />
The groupwhere you placed your question is Performance and Tuning. The performance in this group is the performance of the application, so I think your question can better be asked in another group. Most likely the group<br />
Manufacturing &amp; Supply Chain (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=7) is the best group to post your question.<br />
<br />
You can also Search (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/search.php) on keywords like WIP.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't answer your your question, but hopefully you can do something with this.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Dick</div></div><hr />

Typically WIP will show negative balance when more value is drawn out of WIP than was placed in, e.g. finished goods posted to inventory but raw materials not issued.</div></div><hr />
