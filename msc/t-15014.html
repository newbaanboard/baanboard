<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">13th April 2004, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for some insights on methods used in Baan Vc0 in EP's generation of planning signals as see in the RAO module.<br />
<br />
We have many items which should be generating signals to reschedule planned purchase orders and purchase orders but signals are not being generated by EP.<br />
<br />
I'm investigating the item setups but so far I don't see anything unusual about these items. We have thousands of items which are generating signals correctly.<br />
<br />
If you know which fields in which tables must be set for EP to generate signals, I'd appreciate some feedback. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you limiting the quantity of signals you are viewing?<br />
<br />
Are your signals not appearing becasue of restrictions based on quantifiers?<br />
<br />
Are you ignoring signals of this type or for this item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">14th April 2004, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Item Ordering Data should have Order System as Planned and if use Order Interval it should be populated.  If Purchase should have Supply Time in Item Purchase Data.  If Manufacter should have Order Lead Time in Item Production Data. Item Planning Data you need to determine if you are using Order Based/Master Based Planning, Time Fences and Order Horizion and if Master Based Planning Horizon and other information on the Master Plan Tab. You may also need to check the Item Supplier Information to see if it's populated correctly and that the Lead Times are Calculated there.  Buyer/planner code should be populated in Item Purchase, Item supplier and Item Planning Data.<br />
<br />
  In session cpra01110m000 Signal types by Planner we use the blankd planner code as the default.  Here you can change some of the setting on you signals.<br />
<br />
 This should be the only fields required to generated signals when you update the scenario and asked for update signals by Item/Planner.<br />
<br />
  If you have a specific question send me a private message and I will get back with you.</div></div><hr />
