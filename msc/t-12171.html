But for subcontracting operations there is no possibility to add the overhead cost . For subcontracting rates are picked up from the subcontracting rates.<br />
<br />
Actually what I want is when  Subcontracting PO is raised , the cost should be picked up front  the subcontracting rates. But when reporting the operation, additional overhead cost has to be posted automatically under a different cost price component.<br />
We tried using cost items in the PO but that doesnÂ’t help.<br />
Any suggestions please?<br />

Have you looked at the Sub-Contracting Rate Factor? It's available in the Task and Operations sessions. It's also available in the Production Planning session in Shop floor. We haven't used it but the help indicates it's a rate factor that is incremental to the Sub Contracting Rate. I have no idea how it would work financially, but you may want to check it out.<br />

Thanks for replying.<br />
<br />
The subcontracting rate factor is not helpful. The subcontracting rate factor, together with the subcontracting rate, determines the cost of subcontracting.<br />
<br />
Actually I want the cost tobe split in to two cost price compoents one for over heaads and other for subcontracting . Only subcontracting cost has to be used in the subcontracting PO.<br />

I think it is not possible in Baan, the way you want it.<br />
<br />
As a work around, u can define one more operation which wud be a dummy operation to cover your overhead for subcontracting. May be you can have similiar task codes for these dummy tasks &amp; subcon tasks so that you can indentify these tasks.<br />
<br />
This way, subcon PO will be only for cubcon cost. The overhead will get added to your production cost.<br />
You have make some customized report for data analysis.<br />
