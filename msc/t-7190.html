   Depending on version of Baan, maintaining outbound manually usually looks at the available inventory. The formula to obtain available inventory for outbound differ from version to version but usually involved subtracting the on hand inventory by allocated inventory or probably even adding on hand with on order. So, available inventory is not always the same with inventory on hand (qty on hand is the actual qty sitting in your warehouse).<br />
<br />
   The allocated inventory of 76 means that there are orders needing 76 of 26PNG. The kind of order that perform such allocation may include sales order, return purchase order, transfer order, production issue, etc. Have you checked which order is causing the allocation?<br />
<br />
   Manually changing the allocated inventory in the table is not advisable at all! In fact, changing any record manually right at the table, eg using GTM, should only be used if no other way is available, it's the last resort thing.<br />

  Baan is usually able to handle this allocated inventory thing quite well at all time without you needing to modify a table record. However, if an untidy customisation was done to your maintain outbound logic, as in the case of several barcoding integration, then things like this might happen where Baan got confused with the allocated inv handling.<br />
<br />
   Did somebody happen to customise your maintain outbound logic for barcoding integration?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">19th October 2002, 00:28</div></div><div class="posttext">The customization was my first thought as well.  Generate outbound will allocate based on order (any) priority.  Release will then use the inventory.  Manually changing the table means some other outbound advise will try to use the inventory again.<br />
<br />
If not one has customized the programs, and you are not using one of the several barcoding packages that work around Baan's (sometimes cumbersome) outbound system, then check on your software patch levels to make sure you are surrent for the warehousing modules (ilc, inv, ...)</div></div><hr />
