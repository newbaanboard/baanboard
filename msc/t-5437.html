before anybody can &quot;advise&quot; u, i think it is better if you can introduce some background of your company i.e. what industry (chemical, electrical, electronic ... ) coz u know different type of industry has its own unique requirement :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

what are you missing within the Baan planning system? At least you have to build an interface to get the data back in the Baan tables in order to have proper basis for your MRP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">therese</div><div class="date">10th June 2002, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">The only reason we are considering third party software is baan can't handle finite planning system.  According to our consultant ERP system is infinite planning.  Is there a way baan can handle this matter?</div></div><hr />

IV has constraint planning wich is the finite planner in ERP in an early state. Baan has advanced planners and schedulers as ad-ons that can be very helpful and can do finite scheduling in more detail.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cameron</div><div class="date">10th June 2002, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Therese,<br />
as far as i understand of Baan planning system (with MPS, MRP, SIC and so on) it covers almost all industries (electronic, electrical, etc.). however, if ur company requires maximizing planning materials (as i understand of PCB industry) like example below:<br />
raw board = 2m x 3m per sheet<br />
required size = 20cm x 8cm<br />
and you would like the system to calculate the maximum output of the required size (in term of cutting them horizontally or vertically) while returning the balance of materials back to inventory, and later draw the balance sheet for another production (say, 10cm x 3cm); also you would like the system to first consider issuing the balance sheet before a new sheet, then i think the available ERP system in the market will not be able to handle this requirement. you definitely require so-called &quot;third party planning system&quot; to handule this.<br />
apart of the PCB industry, i believe the other industries e.g. metal stamping, garment and so on also face the same situation.<br />
<br />
hope my description helps.<br />
