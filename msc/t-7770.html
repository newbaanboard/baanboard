We reported the problem to baan, but they cannot find the problem because it happens only sporadically.<br />
<br />
I would like to know if anybody else gets an appropriate message on the third step within tipcf5280m000 (generate sales order structure) after the device has been selected and the user presses &quot;continue&quot;:<br />
<br />
Fatal error : Use of NULL pointer on ''<br />
Fatal error : Can not continue in tipcf5280m000 (choice.report)<br />
<br />
Btw.: no customizations here, system up-to-date, Baan IVc4<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">30th November 2002, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We used to get this error sporadically on our 4c3 system which we upgraded to 4c4 from in June this year.<br />
<br />
It seemed to happen most often with :<br />
<br />
1. A feature which we changed sequence number for<br />
2. Feature options that had been added more recently.<br />
<br />
I could find no technical reason why - data type was  correct domain etc. and we installed numerous patches but it didn't ever get fixed - and without pmc related sessions were never properly updated in tandem.<br />
<br />
With 4c4 (SP9) we have never had this error!<br />
<br />
What did help once or twice on our 4c3 system was to reorg. table tipcf520 as the error message implies a table index issue - just make sure you back it up first!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">2nd December 2002, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">WE ran accross this problem a long time ago using 4c2 and<br />
also had it occur in some of our personalizations.  According to <br />
BaaN (at the time) a 'Null pointer error', meant that you have some reference in a table to another table, and one of the tables<br />
have not been converted to runtime properly.  doing a create/convert to run time wide open (all packages) seem to solve our problem.<br />
<br />
What you could do is check all the references in the tables involved and see if they exist in the data dictionaries of the 'referred' tables.<br />
<br />
for example, if the table tdcms030 has a reference to the table tiitm001 on the field item, then the data dictionary for the table tiitm001 should have an entry as below;<br />
<br />
:REFC:tdcms030.item    1 t1<br />
<br />
(this is the Unix data dictionary ffile where this should appear)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />
