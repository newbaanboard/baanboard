We need 12 signs for that, but therefor we need to change the segmented domains tc.item and cp.item and to convert our database.<br />
I think, if it is a new system there is no problem but what about a running system?<br />
Has anyone done that?<br />

<br />
In the first place it went well, but after a while they faced several problems with it. One of the problems was when you change the length, you can't generate a project from a sales order (because length of the salesorderno. &lt;&gt; projectsegment). For other problems I don't know the details.<br />
<br />
But I do know that they changed the length back to 9 pos., because they faced to many problems.<br />
