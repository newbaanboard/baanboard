<br />
When we implemented the performance boosters for timps3201m000 (BAAN IV c3), our run time improved by about 60%.<br />
However, we noticed that some lower level MPS items were showing the exploded demand from the higher levels MPS Items. In other words, the exploded demand field on the lower level MPS items is not being calculated correctly The demand is correctly exploded if run in single bshell mode.<br />
<br />
Please help me find a solution for this issue.<br />

<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
There are several fixes for multibshell MPS/MRP bugs.<br />
<br />
I especially remember a fix on consumption in a rolling scenario and some fixes after that that handle most of these issues....<br />
<br />
These fixes are over a year old and I'm not sure what's been done to B4-MPS the past 6 months, but there should definitively be a fix .<br />
<br />
You'll have to check the knowledgebase (currenly I have no acces, so I cannot give you a solutionnumber......I thought it was something like 100908)</div></div><hr />
