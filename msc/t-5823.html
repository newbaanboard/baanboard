<br />
Thanks for ur response,<br />
<br />
Regarding ur questionaire,<br />
<br />
1.  LOT/LOcation control not implemented<br />
2.  Purchase order  type - Subcontract<br />
                  Steps as follows :<br />
<br />
                   1.  Maintain Receipts<br />
                   2.  Print purchase invoice<br />
                   3.  Process delivered purchase orders.<br />
<br />
I followed the above steps. My problem is the purchase invoice is not appearing in the  finance for the orders which is generated thru sub-contract.  If I creat purchase order with same type manually,  the purchase transactions appear in integration tables and after posting it to finance, it appears in finance...<br />
<br />
what will be the problem with sub-contracting orders ?<br />
<br />
Please help me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for response.<br />
<br />
I am not clear about ur answer about my doubts. If integration for purchase module is on for the finance,  the purchase invoice will come automatically after posting to finance.. isnt it ?  <br />
If I am wrong please explain.<br />
<br />
Becuase, I can see other purchase invoice except sub-contracting orders invoices.<br />
<br />
Please advice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">22nd July 2002, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The Print Purchase Invoice session is just a report, there are no Finance transactions linked to this.  The purchase invoice is not a mandatory session.<br />
<br />
The only Finance transactions created are for the Purchase Receipts<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if subcontracting is different, but for normal purchase order, the purchase invoice is created manually in finance and liked to a purchase order.  This is done by the Finance department in Maintain Transactions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael Phifer</div><div class="date">22nd July 2002, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">You are seeing the other Purchase Invoices, because Finance is setting them up.   They need to perform the same process in Finance for the subcontracting Purchase Orders, as they perform for the regular Purchase Orders.   From this standpoint (Finance) all Purchase Orders are &quot;Purchase Orders.&quot;   They are set up the same way.<br />

<br />
If you are looking to see a Purchase/Receipt integration transaction, you will not for subcontracting orders.  The type of integration transaction that is generated is Production SFC/Subcontracting.<br />
<br />
As the previous members have stated, the invoice must be matched and approved just like any other type of purchase order.<br />
<br />
You stated earlier that you cannot see it even after the production order is closed; BaaN will only allow you to close the production order after the subcontracting orders have been matched, approved, and processed to history. <br />
<br />
I believe your problem is that you are looking for a purchase integration rather than a Production SFC integration.<br />
<br />
