<br />
After completing 3rd operation (where you rejected 2 qty &amp; completed 3) you can block that operation by maintaining blocking reason. Then Carry on with operation 4 report completed 3 quantities but status will not changed to completed. Now when operation 3 is performed again &amp; 2 quanties are Ok then reset the operation &amp; put -2 in Rejected additional first &amp; go back again at field Cumulative (Main) &amp; report 5 quantities &amp; complete that operation . This way you can go to other operations &amp; report completed with updated quatities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanxs for ur reply.<br />
<br />
But in this case blocking reason is not opening because it is not linked with qms.<br />
<br />
Can you please elaborate your view.<br />

In session report operations complete blocking  should work. Kindly check &amp; inform.</div></div><hr />
