They do have item management as a part of iBaan PDM. I don't know if this what your after, but we like it and for what it does it works good. <br />

<br />
We've done a similar requirement...<br />
We print the Item Sketches along with the production order... (we print the Bar codes, Routing, BOM, Blueprint and other details).<br />
These sketches are in bmp, gif or jpeg format.<br />
<br />
The user maintains the bmp image name in a field of the item master.. and all the images are stored in a common network folder.<br />
To display the image, I've created a button on the Item master form to launch the 'paint' (say) application with this image.<br />
Its not a great solution, but works fine.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. If you need any further info, pls do let me know.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />
