<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">15th January 2010, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The Transfer Delay of current operation coupled with Queue time of next operation result in Slack time for the current operation. It is not adding up. I checked thoroughly with both work centres' calendar etc...<br />
<br />
Precisely, I am unable to arrive at Earliest Finish Date and Latest Finish Date of Current Operation by adding up Production Start Date + queue time + setup time + cycle time and transfer delay; And ideally, to this, if I add the Queue time of next operation, should be the Latest finish time and the difference between Earliest Finish date of current operation and Production start date of second operation should give the Slack of first operation. But it does not add up. <br />
<br />
Any help greatly appreciated. Thanks</div></div><hr />
