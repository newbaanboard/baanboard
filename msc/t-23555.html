We issue a purchase order which gives a rate/sq.m. of coating.Coil stock, whether in plain metal or coated form, is maintained in kilograms.  How to do this in BaaN?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds like you could use the standard Baan subcontracting procedure. So you would create the coated part, as manufactured, and create the BOM with the steel coil on it. Than a routing with the operation of the subcontractor. And you setup the subcontracting rate etc, which equals whatever you pay. <br />
<br />
Than you create the production order for the coated part, and generate the subcontracting purchase orders after you have released the production order. The subcontracting PO will be linked to the production order incorporating the cost. Then when you receive the coated parts back from the subcontracter, you do a receipt on the PO to pay for their services, and you do a completion of the production order to put the coated part in inventory which you can than issue to the higherlevel production order.<br />

Thanks,<br />
