<br />
My client says he wants a item not to be inventorised but still would like to reflect that cost in the end item. Is it possible through Cost item or service item? But I cannot attach a cost item to BOM or maintain it in the estimated materials. Any suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael Phifer</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Filp is correct.   A &quot;Phantom&quot; is an item that appears in the product structure, but which is not seen as a separate manufactured item for production.   The item will be included in the product structure, but will not be stocked in a warehouse. However, its components will be included as material requirements.    HOWEVER, it is not necessary for a phantom to have components!!!   You can define an item in the Item Master on form 5 as a phantom and it can simply be a component of the product you are building.<br />
<br />
This allows you to have the item and its cost on the product's BOM, without carrying that item in inventory.<br />
