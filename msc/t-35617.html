<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m2_wnt</div><div class="date">11th May 2007, 01:43</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 2 different companies - multiple logistics and multiple financials.  We plan to share the same Item Master; BOM; and Routing.  The Item Master Data in the secondary company is pointed to the main company.<br />
<br />
During the testing in the 2nd company, I notice inconsistency in outcomes from various processes - purchase receipt; sales delivery; inventory transfer; and inventory adjustment of a standard item.<br />
<br />
1.  Part number originally exists in the 2nd company but not in the main company seems to be disappeared when table sharing is activated.<br />
2.  Inventory balances in the Item Master Data represent total inventory balances of both companies.  However, balances exist in the 2nd company prior to table sharing are not accumulated in the total balances.<br />
3.  Inventory-on-hand obtained from inventory transfer is not accumulated into total inventory-on-hand in the Item Master Data of the 2nd company.  However, the balance is added to total inventory-on-hand from inventory adjustment transaction.<br />
4.  The financial impact of maintaining purchase receipt is only purchase/result.<br />
5.  Sales delivery and inventory adjustment transactions do not have financial integration impacts.<br />
<br />
If anybody has done this table sharing, please share the pros and cons and any other information that may help me to confirm these outcomes and possibly to seek out other solutions.  Thank you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">11th May 2007, 04:06</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently had a similar experience when somebody tried to set up a company in the same way. Try running MRP or MPS and watch what happens. You end up running the same batch job twice and the schedulers in either company end up with their results mixed up with each others. Schedulers don't like that.<br />
<br />
In my own opinion, the item master table should always be in the same company as the inventory tables. Table sharing should only be used for finance (tf) tables and master data tables (tccom and tcmcs). <br />
<br />
Write a script or use an exchange scheme to copy item data from one company to the other.<br />
<br />
Read the help on the Maintain Logical Tables session. It actually has some good advice about this. <br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />
