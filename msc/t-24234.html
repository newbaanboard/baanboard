When we attach the drawing .gif file in Engineering item revision session, system is showing the drawing picture. But it is not taking other format like .pdf, .jpg.  How to view  drawing file format otherthan .gif? <br />
Whether is it possible to view other format files with standard baan without much customisation?<br />

Thanks in advance.<br />

Internet explorer then works out what decoder/plugin to use to show the drawing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">9th June 2005, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, in Baan V, Baan eliminated the EDM parameter that allowed you to pick the application to use for viewing drawings, documents, etc.  You are now at the mercy of the image.display function in library tiedmdll0020.<br />
<br />
There are different ways to get around this.  If you have source code, you can modify that library.  If you don't, you can use one of the tools for modifying program scripts without source code (e.g., RMCgen, Qkey, rush).  And there are others.<br />
<br />
We've modified the library for our clients as part of overall production order document printing integrations.  With these changes, the drawings and/or documents (AutoCAD, PDF, Word, etc.) associated with the finished good's revision print collated with the regular Baan production order documents.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.  Good luck! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">26th May 2006, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">You can either get someone who had the source code to do the customization for you, or you can use one of the 3rd-party tools like RMCgen or Qkey to do it.<br />
<br />
Feel free to email us (info@rmcis.com) if you need more information on either method.</div></div><hr />
