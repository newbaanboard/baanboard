<br />
I have ceated production orders and sub-contract purchase orders in BaaN V.<br />
<br />
How do I ship the items, specifically to get either the production order and/or purchase order into shipments to know that the item has shipped and can have the tracking information readily available without having a side system for tracking?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is one of the drawbacks in the subcontracting module in Baan5. You have to track the material movement manually as there is no tracking feature.<br />
<br />
One workaround is to create an item right before the subcontract operation and then manage the movement through warehouse transfers by creating a virtual subcontract warehouse. However this would increase the complexity of your manufacturing as this will add one more level into your BOM.<br />
So you need to make the trade offs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">7th December 2006, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We have set up an Operation (Sendout) and a work Center (SEND) that is put in every router before each outide operation.  When parts are completed and moved to the Sendout Operation is when the sub-contracting PO is generated and is used as the packing sheet for sending to the OV supplier.  The quantity completed at the Sendout operation is the quantity sent to the suppplier.  So our WIP report will show quantity at the OV supplier.  Sample router shown below:<br />
OP#      TASK #    TASK                   WORK CENTER<br />
1	1	Issue Material	09S006		<br />
2	7000	Sendout	             SEND<br />
3	7055	OV Process	711500<br />
The OV Process step is often followed by an Inspection operation.<br />
<br />
We do some other unique things like setting the SEND work center to only be open 1 minute a day, so we can put set up minutes in this OP to represent to total days for the following OV OP.  The OV work centers are set up to pay as for labor at $1/minute, so we can put in the set up time the minutes representing the $ set up cahrge (if any) and in the run time the minutes representing the per piece $ charge for the OV operation.<br />
<br />
Means we don't have to set up any virtual warehouses and do any transfers.  We can track everything using our WIP report (which is a Cyberquery report that the shop runs on demand).</div></div><hr />
