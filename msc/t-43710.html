<br />
My client has a sales lead time, <br />
eg: their customer order finish good A 100 pcs, they want to be delivered 1 Nov 07 (1 day after current date).<br />
since its not possible, they want the system can inform them :<br />
When they can fullfil the requirement .<br />
It has 2 kind scenario, <br />
1. The raw material is always ready to use ==&gt; it only need to calculate the order lead time.<br />
2. The raw material is always set to zero stock ==&gt; they want the system automatically combine the order lead time of finish good and the supply time for raw material<br />
<br />
How to applicate in LN ?is that possible?<br />
<br />
i have try in planned order session, but it seems too many things we have to input manually and analyze it.<br />
Can we use ATP on this? I have try it too, but it didnt inform us, the date when we can fullfil that order.<br />
<br />
