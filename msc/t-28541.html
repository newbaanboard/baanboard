<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">1st November 2006, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Tommy,<br />
  One of our site is running on SP 19 and faces a similar situation as what Smitha is facing. However, i checked out the Functional enhancements in the Installation Guide of SP19 and never came across a patch for first free numbers or for Production Orders. The only thing that was close to this was an increment of Packing Slip number to 9 digits, but it was for Ags0/sch1 extension(solution 201974). So can you please tell me which solution you are referring to and what exactly is the enhancement thats a result of this patch?<br />

you should be able to download this from the Baan Web Site.  If you have problems send me an email.</div></div><hr />

 I will be looking through these solutions and the installation guide. In the meantime, did Baan only release it for production orders or are there solutions to increase Project(pcs) series too?<br />

For those who are interested, these two solutions are available with Service pack 15. The one that really does the job is solution 140490 which cannot be downloaded but could only be obtained from your SSA(or Infor) Account Manager. There are a set of 74 solutions that needs to be installed with the 74th being solution 140490. While majority of these solutions come with Service Pack 15, the others(except 140490) could be downloaded. <br />
