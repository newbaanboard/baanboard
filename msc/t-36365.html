<br />
I am inserting some items into tiitm001 through SQL developer. The itm001 data has been modified at the SQL level to set my new warehouse values, suppliers and zero out any inventory counts in tiitm001.<br />
<br />
It appears through testing of a manual entry that when I write one record from scratch, an entry is made in tdinv001..<br />
<br />
Regarding tdinv001, is this needed ? Can the values for this table be written with an inventory adjustment or something as needed ?<br />
<br />
I am just concerned if I need to populate inv001 or can that be done later on ? Copying inv001 table values from the source comapny gets a little messy because some items are duplicates and would be a pain to try and sort them all out  :) ..</div></div><hr />

The tdinv001 table holds warehouse wise details of an item. While inserting new items into itm001 table, i dont think you need to populate the tdinv001 table, from what i know and done...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">25th May 2007, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply. I am inserting new items from an existing company to a new company that has just started selling this product. I don't like using the exchange scheme much so I have created a number of queries to change and import ti itm001 as needed as opposed to exchange schemes ....<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on the inventory table ...</div></div><hr />

 You mentioned that you were inserting items from an existing company to the current company in question. Does this mean that the item you are inserting has a history? Does it have on hand, on order and so on order related data? If it does, then you surely have to insert the same into the tdinv001 table, i.e if you want to use the same data in the current company..<br />
<br />
It would be helpful if you tell us what is the goal of doing all this? Are you trying to create another company with the base data of your old company..<br />

<br />
However you need to fill tiitm100 for each record that you insert in tiitm001!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">16th June 2007, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">If one is transferring the item codes with the stock then you would have to fill inv001 along with the itm001, itm004(if multi units for this item exist) and itm100. If on the other hand, just the item codes are being copied to the other company, then itm001, itm004(above condition) and itm100 are the only tables that needs to be filled. <br />
