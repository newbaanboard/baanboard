<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhowells</div><div class="date">19th July 2005, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We are in the process of upgrading an existing Baan IVc4 environment to ags0.  There are documentation and correction routines that specifically deal with the new table definitionis / data.  I.e., correction routines to set the new fields to their appropriate default values.  Our problem is that the correction routines assume you are already on one of the supply chain extensions or NAS.  Baan &quot;will not support *ANY* migrations&quot;.  <br />
<br />
We have the code for the correction routines, so we can see what is taking place from whatever (sch, scc, nas) extension to ags.  What is unknown is what data migrations must be completed going from standard C4 to SCH/SCC/NAS.  We cannot find any documentation or correction routines dealing with the SC upgrade.<br />
<br />
- Has anyone upgraded an existing environment to on of the SC extensions?<br />
- Where there any supported routines that were used?<br />
- Any other lessons learned would be great<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

The supply chain functions rest above the c4 functionality. for example if you are using purchase schedules it has additional tables to record this information but when you receipt it the  sch0/sch1 version of the receipt session creates purchase order in the standard c4 tables. the same is true for supply chain shipments you do the shipment in the supply chain sessions but it creates a sales order the same as C4 standard. most of the work would be in setting up all the additional parameter sessions. I have a document on how to install sch1 once I find it I will post it.</div></div><hr />

Let me rephase my question a bit to make sure we are on the same page.  I need to know what standard c4 tables were changed by sch/scc, and did they have to do any type of data manipulation for the existing data in those tables to enable them for the SC environment.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

If you want a list of tables which are changed and have ags0 loaded, simply print all tables between vrc's sch0 and ags0. feel free to contact me directly.</div></div><hr />
