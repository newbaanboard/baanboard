Hi All,<br />
<br />
In short. Backflush don't work. Everything was fine up to the last month. All parameres are the same like beafore. There is only one change in personal. Now I don't know what hepens. When I run sessinon tisfc0220m000 but there is no any backflushing in material.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">26th October 2006, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there any routings for this production order? If so make sure some of the operation has been completed if not all. <br />
<br />
sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eibrahimovic</div><div class="date">26th October 2006, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes this item have routing, but all operations are closed.<br />
There is one scenario for closing orders:<br />
1. On order 100 pcs. and released<br />
2. production report 110 pcs in report productions order compleated and backflush materials and hours<br />
3. issuing all materials except beckflushing materials by productinon<br />
4. changing oreder qty on mantain productions order<br />
<br />
now we have problem. Baan in fileld subseq. delivery calculate wrong amount, backflush doesen't work, and we must manualy to adjust amaunt in field issue to make esimated and actual to be equal in session Enter material issue for production order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">26th October 2006, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the SFC Parameter setting for Backflushing?<br />
When you closed the operations, did Baan notify the user about backflushing the materials?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eibrahimovic</div><div class="date">26th October 2006, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Parameter for backflushing is automatic</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you saying that backflushing was working fine earlier for production orders with excess production?<br />
<br />
In case of excess production, the subsequent del qty field gets updated with the requirement for the qty that is actually reported (110 in your case) and the same qty (which is more than the estimated qty) gets backflushed. <br />
<br />
So is that problem with wrong qty getting backflushed or is the backflushing not working in case of excess reporting of production?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">28th October 2006, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi again,<br />
 Can you go to the session Report Operation Completed {tisfc0102m000} and check while completing an operation if the field under the heading &quot;Backflushing&quot; [To Do] has the same quantity as what was finished(in your case Backflushing To Do = 110). If this field is zero at the time of completing the operation, then no backflushing happens even if the materials are to be backflushed. The subsequent delivery quantity in the session Enter Material Issue For Production Orders {tisfc0101m000} will not be issued even after the operations are completed. So check it out...<br />
<br />
I wouldnt know why your subsequent delivery quantity is miscalculated when you reported 10 more than ordered quantity. But i hope you are aware that the subsequent delivery quantity will be calculated on what will be the final reported finished quantity. Therefore in your case the quantity will be calculated for 110 numbers instead of 100..<br />
