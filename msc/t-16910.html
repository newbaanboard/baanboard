<br />
Version BaanIVc4<br />
<br />
We have a requiremnet in which we want to maintain all the tools issued in the BOM itself with quantity zero to avoid creating estimated material again and again when creating a production order.<br />
<br />
we are able to create a production order , process it and close it with such a line(quantity zero) in estimated materials.<br />
<br />
Are there any unknown impacts bcos of this??<br />

we use the same trick for a long time now and never faced any problems (no ILC, no PCF).<br />

But I think it's important. The approach is fine if the cost of the tools shall not be considered in the inventory valuation of the finished good. This is because doing it this way means that the costs will be booked as variance upon order closing instead. Of course, I'm looking at this issue from an accounting personnel point of view<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">11th January 2005, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the cost of a tool is amortized over perhaps many items it is rarely included in the cost of an item.  I think tooling cost is generally an expense item.  Having a zero quantity in the bill is the answer to your problems as it will create no demand and no variance.  Keep in mind however that this tool must be declared purchased in order for it to be in the bill.  It may be declared manufactured but it then must have a bill or a routing in order for it to have a cost even though it is zero quantity.  Of course tooling can also be collected as a surcharge if required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">28th January 2005, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">when using EDM perhaps you could also set flag &quot;Physical item&quot; to no, when it's only information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">28th January 2005, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Be aware that when an item is a non-physical product, it doesn't copy over the the production BOM and therefore won't be on the work order. That line will disappear from the bill when it's copied over (No Copy Action). We handle expensed items like common hardware this way. We can find the item and qty in the EBOM, but manufacturing doesn't have to inventory every screw and washer they use.</div></div><hr />
