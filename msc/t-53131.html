<br />
We have a company that uses an item called MC2. They received MC2 from one company and MC2 L from another company.<br />
<br />
Both items have been approved for global usage as equals and we do not need to receive them seperately anymore ...<br />
<br />
When the company receives MC2 L through EDI, they want this to be added to their &quot;MC2&quot; inventory and not as seperate inventory of MC2 L ...<br />
<br />
Is this the functionality of Alternate Items ?  Apparently at one time, the company had this substitution set up for another item but I have no record of what was done ...<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

I think this will see EDI orders from our satellite comapny who send MC2 L and will receive it as MC2 ....</div></div><hr />
