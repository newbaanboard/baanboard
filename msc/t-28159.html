<br />
Your post is a typical example of how not to post on Baanboard:<br />
<br />
a. You posted in the wrong forum. I moved the thread to the 'Manufacturing' forum<br />
b. You did not specify any details to your Baan version, nor in your user profile nor as a meta-tag of the thread itself.<br />
c. You double-posted in your own thread for no apparent reason?<br />
d. You are asking for help to be &quot;e-mailed&quot;. If other members have suggestions or solutions, then the best thing to do is to post these as a reply to your post. That way other people with the same problem may also benefit from this information in the future.</div></div><hr />

Is the problem unable to issue material but the system has it allocated already or the system won't allocate the appropriate qty of material to issue?<br />
<br />
I've worked a bit on LN FP1 and FP2 and never encountered such problem though.<br />

Yes, we aren't able to issue material but the system has it allocated already.<br />
Now we don't want to use allocated in this time. Please advise if you have solution, Consult guy in thailand try to help us but they have been fixing two week, and they have blame user because my site have config about &quot;lot selection&quot; in BOM.<br />
Maybe, Is it possible problem on LN 6.1. Do you have idea to fixed it, please advice.<br />

<br />
Have you checked your warehousing orders?<br />
Allocated material means that warehousing orders have been created for them. If somehow it could not be cleared, then something must have gone wrong in that whs order, like not enough qty, the line got blocked or anything.<br />
<br />
If u use lot selection in BOM, u might want to check the session &quot;Material To Issue&quot; and see which lot the material to be issued is referring to and then check the correesponding whs order and inventory.<br />
If u have enough inv for the material in the specific lot, then u should be able to clear the allocated mat'l.<br />
Usually those are the things that I looked for when facing this kind of issue.<br />
<br />
If the consultant has tried those things and still facing problem, then it might be best to log a case to support and have them solve your problem.<br />
<br />
Please update us on ur outcome. I'm interested to know as well.<br />

Can you attach a screen shot of the Material to issue for production order session for that specific production order (before clicking initiate inventory) and then another screen shot with the error message. This will help in understanding the issue. Thanks</div></div><hr />

Hi Hendra,<br />

Let 's me follow up you advise.<br />

<br />
I've seen the screen shot.<br />
Ur inventory should be cleared when the user press the initiate inv issue for the 1st time.<br />
<br />
What u need to look is the time of the inventory. I can see that ur inventory is dated Sept 20, so when is ur material to issue date? Is it before or after sept 20? If it's after Sept 20, there shouldn't be a problem but if it's before sept 20, then I think the problem is the system sees that there is no inventory for that time.<br />
<br />
Secondly, to resolve the &quot;to issue&quot; field, ur gonna have to do it manually in the warehousing order. Do not press the initiate inventory button again. It will cause another problem.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, this will help.<br />

Dear Hendra,<br />

I have tested It's good if before sept 20, Is it possible we modify the inventory date. Pleas advise.<br />

<br />
I suppose u have figured out the problem now...<br />
If u wish to modify inventory date without GTM, then the only way is to do forced cycle counting and make the current inventory zero. After that u insert the inventory again with the desired date.<br />
<br />
Be careful with cycle count as it will make entries on the accounting side. Check with those ppl before doing CC..<br />
<br />
Good luck..<br />
<br />

<br />
Based on the attachment, it appears that u should have enough PASSVN with lot 06-09-13. U should be able to clear the 19,929 qty (To Issue by Whs field on screen shot 1)<br />
<br />
Your lot 06-09-15 has no inventory so you can't issue them. (screen shot 2)<br />
So you need to look at your inventory and material to issue and match the lot in the material to issue to the lot that u do have inventory.<br />
<br />
For those records that are already hanging (in the To issue by Whs field), u should adjust the inventory and clear them manually thru warehouse order.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help.<br />
<br />

I have just come in, Could you help me advise more how much the value and which lot have to adjust thru session warehouse order for clear the qty (in the To issue by Whs field),  I need help step by step, I'm a new user in BAAN system and need relevent information.<br />
For you help is appreciate with me.<br />

<br />
I'd like to help but I can't give you step by step instruction mainly bcoz I am only looking at snapshots of your system. Besides, doing it through forum would take a lot of time because it will need constant interaction.<br />
<br />
The best way for you would be to contact support directly through http://support.baan.com and have a support agent help you. They will login to your system and fix the problem.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a support account yet then you can ask your consultant or the company which you purchased the software from to create a login code.<br />
A support agent would be assigned to your case and s/he will solve out your problem. This is the fastest way.<br />
<br />
Hopefully it's ok for you.<br />
