<br />
I read from the help text of this field and know that the item with this field set to yes will be printed in the material note. Also, the estimated quantity will be issued automatically in a production order. <br />
<br />
Question 1 : is the automatic issuing of this item independent of the fields tiitm001.bfep and tiitm001.bfcp ?<br />
<br />
Question 2: what other implication of setting this field to yes if any ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We want to manage &quot;Floor Stock&quot; (material with a low cost price) not as a material but as a cost.<br />
<br />
The best way will be to be able to have this parts in the bill of material but not in the outbound.<br />
<br />
It's possible ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But we are obligated to manage a stock and we don't want that. Are they an other solution where you can add a cost in the bill of material and this ligne will can appear on workshop report. We can add a cost price but we want also that floor stock item appear for the workers.<br />
<br />
I think we are obligated to create a programme who can manage automatically this stock.</div></div><hr />
