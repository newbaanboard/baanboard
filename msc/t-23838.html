Currently all manufactured parts get their own production order number and there does not appear to be a way to know what goes with what unless you know in your head or cross reference multiple reports.  Used to a ERP system where it was easy to identify status of all sub-level production orders attatched to a particular finished goods MPS order.  <br />

Help, what am I missing.  Running Baan IV C4<br />

Do you have parts that are unqiue in to particular Bill. Otherwise it is not even conceptually possible. MRP by defintion summarize the requirement and pass to lower level. So if you want to imploe upwards it is not possibel to determine what eaxctly is causing the demand as several factors come into play- Safety stock at various level, Order Multiple, Order interval. MOQ etc. However u can build a report ot display screen that may tell you ultimately where it is going and this may not always end up at top level<br />

<br />
You might want to try using PCS for the sales order. That way, all of your production order will be under the same Project code.<br />
To track the status of each production order, simply run the production by project code report.<br />
<br />
To make it work, all of your manufactured parts must be of &quot;To-Order&quot; type in the planning method instead of anonymous and everytime you key in your sales order, you generate project structure for your sales. The generating process will copy your standard BOM to Project BOM. Don't forget to run cost price calculation or the item will not be usable for production or purchase.<br />
<br />
In doing this, there is of course a catch. Your item data will grow very-very fast as everytime you key in your sales order and generate project structure, system will duplicate your entire BOM, Routing, and all other common data.</div></div><hr />
