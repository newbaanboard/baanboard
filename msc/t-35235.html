We are in the process of implementing the EDI 830 transaction in Baan IV with some of our suppliers. If you have experience with this transaction, then I would appreciate if you could let us know what data do you use to pull for this. Is it just the planned orders or do you also consider the open orders ? What about the orders in transit that the supplier has also alredy shipped but we have not yet received?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

First of all, I'm sure you know that you need to be running one of the Automotive Extensions for the sc830 transaction to process.<br />
<br />
Since you mention Suppliers instead of Customers, I would guess that you are sending the 830 out.  If this is the case, you need to include the quantity you received to date from the Purchase Contract.  The supplier will use the cumulative accounting to reconcile the outstanding shipments.  This same principle applies if you are receiving the 830.  Baan will compare what you have shipped with the quantity your customer said he has received.<br />
<br />
The difference will be deducted from the top of the schedule.  If your customer would specify that he received more parts than you show you shipped, an error is generated.<br />
<br />
As far as what to include, We give both Firm and Forecast requirements on the schedule.  Lead-time would play a role with regards to how far your firm goes out and how far your forecast goes out.  These are controlled on the purchase contract.<br />
