using aggregation for multilevel links.<br />
in the last 3 months the scheduled demand on the plan levels above (or below depending on your terminology) lost the scheduled reciepts numbers that have been there for a long time.<br />
the actual planned customer orders and scheduled reciepts remain correct on the actual planned items level.<br />
Does anyone know what I can do to reload those prior period actuals?<br />
I have tried every combination I can think of to reload goods flow numbers although I figure that only happens at the bottom actual production level, and I have tried aggregating back up, but I am not even sure aggregation will impact the scheduled reciepts lines. I am unclear what choices kick off updating goods flow updates in MPS anyway.  Seems a bit clearer on ERPLN than on Baan IV.</div></div><hr />

Try running regenerative plan</div></div><hr />
