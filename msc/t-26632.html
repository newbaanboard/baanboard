<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bogackig</div><div class="date">13th March 2006, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using the configurator in Baan IVC4 SP15 and would like to know if there is any way to have the planned PRP orders use a fixed order quantity of 1 when generating.<br />
<br />
As an example, customer orders 12 of configured item X, project is created and PRP is run. Planned PRP production order created is for 12, where we would like to have it create 12 planned production orders, each for 1 qty.<br />
<br />
While I personally think this is crazy, our manufacturing operations feel this would allow them better scheduling control since the manufacturing time for each could run about 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if this is possible in PRP? All of my tests seem to indicate that PRP won't do this. Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I've also tried setting the order quantity to 1 on the project item. System seems to ignore everything and create PRP orders based exclusively on the demand quantity.</div></div><hr />
