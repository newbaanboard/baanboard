<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">8th June 2006, 08:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I have this question about INV Production Order.<br />
<br />
Imagine I have this simple BOM structure where item B (purchase item) is a child of item A. These items are having the following parameter settings ;<br />
<br />
For Item A<br />
Order Policy	 	: Anonymous<br />
Order System	  	: SIC<br />
Order method		: Lot-for-Lot<br />
Reorder Point		: 10<br />
<br />
For Item B <br />
Order Policy	 	: Anonymous<br />
Order System	  	: SIC<br />
Order method		: Lot-for-Lot<br />
Reorder Point		: 0<br />
<br />
After running session Genarate Planned INV orders (tdinv3201m000), I got an Planned INV Production Order of 10 pcs for item A. The planned start date for this order is today date.<br />
<br />
There is no planned order for item B unitl I transfer the planned INV order to become a SFC order. <br />
<br />
In this case, how will I know that I need to purchase item B ? By the time I know (after creating a SFC order), then it will be too late.<br />
<br />
Any comment are much appreciate.</div></div><hr />

Also item B will need a re-orderpoint to stay ahead of shortages. Otherwise MRP is the way to go..........</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agreed with you.<br />
<br />
It is possible for item A to be controlled by SIC and item B by MRP ?<br />
<br />
What our bussiness needs is have item A control by inventory level. Once there is planned INV order for item A, all the child for item A (that is item B) will be automatical allocated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm afraid you're turning it around for what's supposed to be &quot;normal&quot;.<br />
<br />
In normal situations the upper level is MRP-controlled, which effects allocations for the lower levels. The lower level (semi-finished products or raw mat's/Purchase items) can be SIC or MRP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a last question.<br />
<br />
Why the allocation from the INV Production Order is not cascaded down to lower level as allocation. <br />
<br />
Example : we have a Planned INV Production Order for item A and item A need item B. Why dont BaaN generate a Planned INV Purchase Order for item B ?<br />
<br />
I know this is the case but just cant figure what is the reason for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">12th June 2006, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Basic idea behind this method is, that reordering for lower level is supposed to be done based on reorderpoints/safetystock instead of allocations from upper levels i guess.</div></div><hr />
