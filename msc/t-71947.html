<br />
Company is transitioning into baan with little background. Is it possible to add text, specifically assembly instructions, to a work order? We would like to add our assembly instruction as automatic text that is attached to an assembly build that will populate each time a work order is printed for a specific part number.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

When we converted into baan way back when we pulled all of the text we needed into the routing text. Form 2 on print order documents tisfc0408m000 shows a lot of what can be printed. We even added an addition flag to print like engineering config notes.  In our case we would have included anything needed in the routing text for the production order paper work to travel with the job as it moved thru the shop.<br />

Also - I am going to delete the thread in the general discussion forum.  I think here you will get the most replies and we prefer one post on a topic.  If needed moderators can move a thread to another forum.</div></div><hr />
