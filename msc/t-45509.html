It would have brought the status one notch down to &quot;Completed&quot;. Is this a customized production order, with a project? If so whats the status of the project?<br />

When was this production order closed? Did you run any Calculate Cost Prices for standard items after this? In short, was there any cost price change that took place for the item within this production order? Baan wouldnt let you re-activate a production order..<br />
-If the item inside this production order has a cost price change that took place post production closure..<br />
-If the project attached to the production order is either has status Finished or Closed.<br />
 <br />
There could be other reason why baan wouldnt let you re-activate a production order but these are the two reasons i came up against...Since the project scenario was ruled out by you, check on the first point..<br />
Check the Last CP Trans. Date of the manufactured item, this production order was created for, and compare it with the production order closing date..If CP Trans.Date is greater than Closing Date, then you have crossed PONR (point of no return)..<br />

<br />
The production order was reported complete yesterday, the last CP trans date for this item was 08-01-07 so I think I can rule that out as well.  There are many levels in the BOM but I don't think any of the sub items have had CP calculations run since yesterday either.  It was almost immediate that I realized I had to reset the status..<br />

We have logged a case with Infor.  We'll see what they have to say ;)</div></div><hr />
