The Initiate Inventory Issue (tisfc0207m000) session is used to manually issue material to a Production Order.<br />
<br />
Let's say that you manually add an Item to a Production Order's BOM, you could then use this session to issue the Item.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have selected Manual Issuing in the Shop Floor Parameters session, you would then use this session to issue the material.<br />

<br />
What I have noticed is, when I Initiate Inventory Issue a warehouse order is created against all warehouses as in the BOM. The warehouse order is not created only for those added manually in Prod. BOM as you said. Actually what is the point of 'Initiate Inventory Issue'?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would use Initiate Inventory Issue if you want a more manually controlled process to issue material.<br />
<br />
In the 'Material to Issue for Production Orders' session, if the 'Direct Initiate Inventory Issue' check box is selected, the warehouse order line for the material is automatically unblocked during production order release. Consequently, you do not need to run the Initiate Inventory Issue session to unblock the material.<br />
<br />
If this check box is cleared, and if the material is not backflushed, you must use the Initiate Inventory Issue session to unblock the material's warehouse order line.<br />
<br />
An unblocked warehouse order line serves as a signal for the warehouse employees to begin the warehouse outbound procedure, starting with an outbound advice for the material. The warehouse outbound procedure results in material sent to the shop floor. If the Direct Proc Wh Order Line check box is selected for the material, the warehouse outbound procedure is carried out automatically when the warehouse order line is unblocked.<br />
