<br />
We have a number of parts lists setup (i.e. phantom BOM's).  In many cases the phantom BOM is 90 percent of what we want to add to the new BOM.  However, there will be 1 or 2 parts that we want to substitute. (i.e. a different bolt).<br />
<br />
We would like to add all of the items from the phantom BOM, then change the items that are different, as opposed to adding the phantom BOM as a line item, and letting it blow-through on the work order.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are appreciated.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ilbaan</div><div class="date">15th June 2006, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">What I'm trying to do is to import the phantom BOM as a part of another BOM.<br />
<br />
As an example:<br />
I have a BOM with 200 items in it.  Item 200 is a ladder assembly that consists of 20 additional items.  We would have the ladder assembly setup as a phantom item.<br />
<br />
The dilemna that I have is that the customer might request a special bolt for example as part of his ladder assembly.  The parts list would not be accurate.<br />
<br />
What we would like to do is to be able to import the phantom BOM into the overall BOM, then add and delete the items that we don't want.<br />
<br />
I suppose that we could copy phantom A to phantom B, make our changes, then add phantom B to the overall BOM.  I would like to avoid this if possible, as it would create a lot of parts lists.<br />
<br />
Does the copy function allow you to copy one BOM into another existing BOM?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another 'light' solution could be: Unit Effectivity.<br />
In Common you have to define an Effectivity Unit for your end item (or phantom). In the BOM you have to specify then exceptions for that Effectivity Unit. You can exclude materials, or add material that are only effective for the specified Effectivity Unit.<br />
When you enter a production order for that Effectivity Unit, the system will consider the defined exceptions and 'use' the right materials.<br />
<br />
Please refer to the Help of Effectivity Units for more on this.<br />
