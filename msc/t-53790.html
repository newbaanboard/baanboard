<br />
There are different clasiifications of warehouse<br />
<br />
1. Nettable / Non-Nettable<br />
<br />
Nettable: Those warehouse which are accountable  in Enterprise Plannig ( MPS/ MRP)are known as Nettable and those which are not included in Enterprise Planning are non-nettable.<br />
<br />
2. Normal &amp; Shopfloor Warehouse.: Shopfloor warehouse are those ware house which are associated with workcentre are used with Production shopfloor.</div></div><hr />

    Baan help clearly explains this and the following is an excerpt from there...<br />
<br />
Three types of warehouses exists in Baan:<br />
1) Normal: These are warehouses with or without a location system used for storing goods.  <br />
<br />
2) Work-in-Process: Warehouses used to store intermediate inventory used to supply production lines/work centers.  <br />
<br />
3) Transit: Warehouses for registering inventory in transit. These warehouses are used in the module &quot;Replenishment Order Control (RPL)&quot; to trace inventory during transportation. <br />
<br />
Nettable Warehouse:<br />
Nettable warehouses are ignored by the DRP algorithm. The replenishment of the inventory of these warehouses is planned using MRP, MPS and SIC in the modules &quot;Material Requirements Planning (MRP)&quot;, &quot;Master Production Scheduling (MPS)&quot; and &quot;Inventory Control (INV)&quot; or takes place through manual purchases. An exception is a &quot;nettable&quot; Work-in-Process warehouse, because it can also be resupplied by DRP. <br />
Non-Nettable Warehouse: <br />
These warehouses are ignored by the MRP and MPS algorithm. The resupply of such warehouses is planned with DRP in the module &quot;Distribution Requirements Planning (DRP)&quot;. In addition, direct purchases can be written to non-nettable warehouses or they can be replenished via the SIC (Statistical Inventory Control) principle.<br />
