     Consumption of items in Baan is based on its Inventory Unit, afaik. From your description i take it that your Inventory Unit, for the item in question, is &quot;pcs&quot;. <br />
Therefore inorder to store this item in &quot;pcs&quot; but consume in &quot;kgs&quot;, you would have to turn on Location Control. With this, you get to choose your Storage Unit as &quot;pcs&quot; and your Inventory Unit as &quot;kgs&quot; (provided conversion factors are defined) while your purchase &amp; sales unit could be &quot;pcs&quot;. The downside of this process is that it kind of lengthens your data entry process and can get a bit frustrating to start with (atleast with the users who would have to tackle new windows opening here and there and couple of new sessions to get their job done). <br />
<br />
If on the other hand you can live with the fact that the item is stored in &quot;kgs&quot; then all you need to do is to change its inventory unit to &quot;kgs&quot; and purchasing and sales unit to &quot;pcs&quot;, without turning on Location Control.. You may have to create a new item code if you wish to do this as if there are transaction reported against an item, you cannot change its inventory unit..<br />
<br />
.. i just realized you are using B5 and not B4c4..and the above was written keeping B4c4 in mind...i guess it should be the same in B5?<br />
