<br />
             I have raised a production order with a subcontracting operation and I have generated a Subcontracting purchase order until that no problem. Later we have raised one more production order with the same production planning  and materials with the same subcontracting operation as before. But here we wanted change the subcontractor  , for that we changed the subcontractor in the work center which was already used in the previous order. Here the problem was we couldn't generate the subcontracting purchase order.<br />
<br />
                           Can anyone help regarding this?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Could you confirm,what error you are getting at the time of creating Subcontracting Purchase Order ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">balufor2020</div><div class="date">8th September 2009, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">The error message it was showing is &quot; tax code field required in the purchase order line&quot;. But we maintained the tax code in the item level itself. I think the error is different.But it was showing the tax code error.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This problem might be resolved on putting aggregate tax code for particular Business Partner in session 'tctax1101m000'.<br />
<br />
If you have still any issue,Please inform.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it could be another option.</div></div><hr />

I had only define Subcontracting rate for new combination BP-task-subc.item (because of changing Subcontarctor in Work center).</div></div><hr />
