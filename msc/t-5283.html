<br />
&quot;Inventory amount for item above specified value. Project cannot be closed because too high a inventory value&quot;<br />
<br />
Why are we receiving this error message and how do we fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">22nd May 2002, 19:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan checks the following conditions:<br />
<br />
1.  All subprojects have the status Closed, if there is a main project.<br />
2.  All production orders for the project are closed.<br />
3.  All purchase orders have the status Closed.<br />
4.  All purchase receipts have been invoiced, and the invoice matching procedure carried out in the financial accounting.<br />
5.  All sales orders have been closed with the Process Delivered Sales Orders (tdsls4223m000) session.<br />
6.  All service orders for the project have been processed in history.<br />
7.  All transaction hours for the project have been processed.<br />
8.  No project inventory is still present. The project inventory value cannot exceed the value entered by the users. Remaining inventory less than this value is automatically deleted by BaanERP.<br />
<br />
Did you either scrap or return to the stockroom any excess inventory?  Check your project inventory reports and clear up any leftovers there and try it again.</div></div><hr />

You can either deal with this inventory by returning it to stock or by invoicing it from the project.<br />
Alternatively (depending on what internal controls you operate!) you can enter a value in the Close Projects session in the field described as &quot;Delete Project Inventory up to Value&quot;.  This will write any left over inventory off to cost of sales.</div></div><hr />
