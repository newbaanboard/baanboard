<br />
we have some production orders which can't be closed. We get the message &quot;Hours accounting not yet completely posted&quot;. <br />
<br />
We we run the Backflush materials and hours (tisfc0220m000) for these orders, we get no message and later when we try to close them we keep on having the same message.<br />
<br />
Does somebody know how can we see what is still missing? Or what (tables/fields) is the system checking at the moment to close production orders?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for your help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">31st January 2007, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You would have to go to the session Enter Hours Accounting {tihra1101m000} and Process the hours transaction from there. Unfortunately the transaction is based on Year/Week/Employee combination and so chances are that you would be processing the hours transaction of other production orders that seem to fall under the same category...<br />
<br />
Another way is to manipulate the hours table through GTM..<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...<br />

<br />
Please check for that particular order in tihra1101m000 session some unprocess transactions are still pending.or you can check in tisfc010 table quantity completed field(tisfc010.qcmp) is equal to quantity delivered in session tisfc0202m000.<br />
I will not advise to do through GTM.<br />
<br />
thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">1st February 2007, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Yashwant, you are right about messing around with GTM, but then this was suggested as a last option. Even when you have the completed field (tisfc010.qcmp) reporting the same quantity as that was delivered or planned you get this hours accounting issue. So if you cant process it through the session tihra1101m000, the other option would be GTM..<br />
<br />
Jordi, updating the tables through GTM is a tricky situation as the processing of hours accounting does insert records into tfgld tables and so you would have quite a lot of tables to update....Sorry for not mentioning that earlier..<br />

   Could you tell me whats stopping you from using Enter Hours Accounting {tihra1101m000} or Process Hours Accounting {tihra1210m000} to process or post the hours transaction? <br />
<br />

<br />
I was not trying with these two sessions because Production order number was not in the selection; but finally I tried with tihra1210m000 upto de closing week of those orders and it solved the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />
