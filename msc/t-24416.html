But how can we include a scrap factor for finished items reflecting a higher standard cost price as well as increasing demand for material and capacity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">30th June 2005, 05:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have access to BaanIV now, so I'm not sure whether routing yield is also available in that version along with BOM scrap factor. How BaanERP separates BOM scrap and routing yield is really useful for those who are particularly fussy with the definition of scrap and yield. But even if there isn't any routing yield in BaanIV, you can still use the scrap factor to somehow model how much material is being lost during the production. Not really the exact definition of scrap, but if you're not too fussy about the definition it might works out quite OK<br />

I agree that for the material and for cost this might work but what we would like to get is a production order with a planned quantity of x percent more than the demand (x being the scrap factor).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way BaanERP works regarding scrap and yield is not by telling people to produce more quantity than needed, but rather to prepare more material and time than ideally necessary (all the while keep telling the people to just produce the qty needed). Just a change in vantage point<br />

<br />
If you define a scrap factor for manufactured items on the item master level, MRP will take that into account in its calculation. <br />
<br />
This is the way it works in Baan IV (or should normally work). <br />
