<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michelle.Bailey</div><div class="date">22nd August 2015, 02:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to set up MRP in a logistics company. When I run MRP, I get the following error:<br />
<br />
Planning Horizon of 1865 days exceeded for item 10100807:<br />
please increase parameter. <br />
<br />
I can see that this comes from the MRP parameter verification out of timrp5000, but can't figure out where to make the setup change. Can anyone help?<br />

Sorry of this is not in correct form for this forum. I am new to the site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">22nd August 2015, 03:48</div></div><div class="posttext">This was long back so a little hazy. Happened a couple of times only in 10 years.<br />
<br />
The first point is: the MRP Planning Horizon was set possibly after a lot of discussion by a lot of different departments deciding that number, so that is NOT what we want to change, if at all.<br />
<br />
As to the error: The main reason it happened for us was somebody typed in a date incorrectly somewhere. (like 2030 instead of 2020, for instance). [The other reason, which for us was ruled out, is that the calendar was not extended - in our case, we have a automatic reminder to extend the calendar by a year every year.]<br />
<br />
This is where it becomes problematic - the date could be on a purchase order line, it could be on a planned purchase order, it could be on a production order component line, it could be on the Demand Record of the parent item (Sales Order or in our case the Manufacturing Dependent Demand).<br />
<br />
So, we would query the planned inventory transaction for a planned date that goes beyond a reasonable number of days exceeding the MRP planning horizon. So any Planned Inventory transaction with planned transaction date after that is a suspect. It will tell the Order Type and Transaction Type to narrow down the search of the source document a bit.<br />
<br />
We would then locate the source document and correct the date - for purchase orders it is easy - most of the times. For the others it would need to be corrected on the main requirement document, example a Sales Order. In our case it was the Manufacturing Dependent Demand. We would search for all Manufacturing Dependent Demands of all the parents in which the component is on the BOM and correct the planned date on the MDD. Then to wait for the next planning run (it takes 6 to 8 hours to run the planning so it was a decision made to wait for the next run to take care of the error).<br />
<br />
Another point to look for is if the Order Lead Time on the Item Master has been set to a very high number.</div></div><hr />

I appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which was the cause of your error?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michelle.Bailey</div><div class="date">1st September 2015, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">It was all data. I ended up finding a lot of very old purchase orders that hadn't been closed short on receipt. The cumulative effect of the orders drove late supplied back to 2010. <br />
<br />
To determine if the system was actually working, I set up a bogus BOM structure and ensured no items were set as MRP which were not on that BOM. The system ran through without error. So, it had to be the data from those old POs. <br />
<br />
Clean-up is in progress. We'll see if we can get it clean enough to actually use. <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
