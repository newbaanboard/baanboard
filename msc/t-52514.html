Refer below business situation. In production planning we have 5 operations numbered as 10,20....50. We want to complete operation 30 without completing operations 10 and 20 i.e. we want to complete operations independently. Please note that all these operations belong to same routing and not to phantom routing (network routing) and we dont want to use &quot;operation relationship by production order&quot;. because this does not satisfy our requirement in case different quantities are to be completed for different operations. Also this requires manual rescheduling of operations.<br />
<br />
Please advise on this.<br />

    I dont use Ln and i so wished to have that feature (parallel operation) in Baan4. We were told (by SSA quite some time back) that parallel operations will be supported in the newer versions but incase this feature is not available, then i guess you could look into dividing your BOM's into different levels. Each level with its own operations and materials. <br />
E.g:<br />
-Car<br />
---Engine<br />
---Body<br />
<br />

Now we can put our point strongly with Infor. We have got rid this problem to a maximum extent by the concept of phantom routing which is applicable for the solution of dividing BOM you provided. But still some operations are there which are on same end item and run parallely.<br />
