<br />
  Are you talking about printing am image... say JPG or BMP of an Item and printing it on the Production Order routing document that goes on the shop floor ?<br />
<br />
In Baan IV, we were able to do it... not a full fledged ODM functionality.. but were able to get by. (there is no ODM like in Baan V... even that is not so user friendly)<br />
We used the &quot;Extra Information&quot; field on the master routing to store the name of the image file (the path can be prefixed within the code). Every order printed will create a flat file with the list of Project, Item &amp; Image name. I created a small VB program program which will read that file and print it to the same spooler in the background.<br />
So, effectively, you get the images printed whenever you print a production order. Its not so much of a &quot;nice&quot; solution... but it did get by.<br />
We now have Baan V.. and we ended up creating our own ODM package. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
