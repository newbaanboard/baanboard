<br />
I have 2 companies 100 Comercial, 200 Industrial. Part A is build in company 200 and distributes the material to the Comercial company.<br />
Comercial company has 3 warehouses x,y,z. Warehouse x distributes to warehosues y and z. And the source for x is the industrial company 200<br />
Right now I can create all the distribution orders x, y, z. Also the planned distribution orders for x to company 100. But in company 200 a planned production order is not created or a distribution order from company 200 to 100<br />
The problem is in company 200, I do not see the requirement to company 100.<br />
<br />
Any help It will be appreciate.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Do I have to?????<br />
It is planning between 2 companies.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rocky6</div><div class="date">21st March 2007, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you don't need to have Business Partners defined.<br />
There are a couple of things that you must define, though.<br />
<br />
1) in EMM, you need to define the Entity-Entity Relationship (tcemm2110m000) for the relationship-type &quot;goods transfer&quot; between the warehouse X in co100 from a warehouse in co200 (the warehouse the you put item A in when you complete the production order for it). Make sure you set the 'Type of order to be Generated by Enterprise Planning' to &quot;Warehouse Transfer&quot;--not &quot;purchase order&quot;.<br />
<br />
2) in co100, in EP, you need to define the Supplying Relationship (cprpd7130m000) for item A that it comes from item A in co200. <br />
<br />
Now, as soon as you have a 'planned distribution order' for item A in co100, you should see it as 'distribution' demand in co200.<br />
<br />
Let us know if that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">achavezf</div><div class="date">21st March 2007, 01:32</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not working.....<br />
The planning has to be run in co100 and 200 or just in co100?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rocky6</div><div class="date">21st March 2007, 03:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Order Planning will need to be run in co100 to create the demand in co200.<br />
you'll have to run Order planning in co200 to get the planned production order there, but you should see the demand without having to run Order Planning.<br />
<br />
you do have demand for item X in co100, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rocky6</div><div class="date">21st March 2007, 06:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
Also the planned distribution orders for x to company 100.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, let's start here....<br />
<br />
Go to the Planned Distribution Orders....<br />
Go to the Transfer Planned Orders (cppat1210m000). In the Order Selection box, check Distribution; enter your item X in the item selection range; leave everything else wide-open in the from-to ranges; on the Options tab, check Interactive, check Transfer Status Planned, &amp; check Transfer Status Firm Planned; on the Purchase/Distribution tab fill in the appropriate values for the Distribution fields.<br />
Then click &quot;Transfer&quot;.<br />
You should get a new window Select Orders for Transfer (cppat0210m000).<br />
On the far right of the screen is the column &quot;Transfer Multicompany Distribution Order&quot;. <br />
What is the value in the field for your Planned Order?</div></div><hr />
