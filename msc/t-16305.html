<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">17th August 2004, 23:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering if someone could shed some light on a couple of errors I get when I process ECO's. They started showing up when we went to IVc4. Since they seem to be informational only, and not sign of a real problem I've ignored them, but I'd be interested in knowing the logic behind them, because I'm not sure I understand.<br />
<br />
I process ECO's using the semi-automatic method, if that matters. I create my own new revisions and BOMS the let Baan process the changes via tiedm3250m000. During processing, I can typically count on getting  at least one of the following, usually both, and in numerous instances, depending on how many BOMs and other items are affected by the ECO. These are errors from the Generate EBOM Copy Data By ECO session -<br />
<br />
1)  Item XZY  Rev B         LMN   - Non Physical product cannot be copied<br />
<br />
2)  Item XYZ  Rev C         Item type of Standard Item EFG must be manufactured<br />
<br />
1) I understand that non-physical items won't copy over as a line in the BOM, in fact that's why we make them non-physical in the first place. But there could be a dozen or more non-physical items in the BOM and it only gives one error message for each BOM. What's more, the item it lists seems to be the LAST non-physical item in the BOM, as if it starts at the bottom and works it's way back up and only lists the first one it finds. If it's going to give this error, why wouldn't it give it for every instance of a non-physical item in the BOM (not that I want it to!)? It doesn't make sense to me.<br />
<br />
2) I think Baan wants anything with a rev change to be Manufactured. But it's very common to make revision changes to machined parts that we purchase outside. They're rev controlled, but there isn't going to be a BOM for these. Baan allows the rev change and ECO to go through, so what's the logic behind showing this error?<br />
<br />
Neither of these errors is a really problem. The ECO's go through fine. I'm just curious as to why they show up. And if I could get rid of them, it would make it easier to spot when a real error shows up. <br />
<br />
Thanks to anyone that can explain Baan logic!<br />
