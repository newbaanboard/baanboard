<br />
I am having trouble generating a netwrok plan.  Can anyone lend advice?  do I need to run PRP in order to generate the network plan?   I was hoping to use the rough capacity calculations to help me in RCCP.  This planning takes place before BOMs are finished.  IS this possible?  or does the network plan need to have PRP production orders?</div></div><hr />

Generating NP is like running PRP.  It recalculates the dates on my timeline, and shows measures of earned value project management.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'M STUCK at <br />
<br />
1) copying my activities template over from project to project.  It is very long and pretty much common to all projects<br />
<br />
2) Generating a rough capacity chart.   I can aggregate rough capacity in a report, but I am having trouble finding a graph that shows this.</div></div><hr />

I've had some questions about using this feature.  One of my ideas was to create a template project.  I saw where copying the plan from project to a new one looked like it would take some time.  Copying only one activity at a time.  Let me know if you have any advice on implementing this feature.<br />

Thanks,<br />
