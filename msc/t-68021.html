Can anybody guide me what are the pre-requisites for rework order ? <br />
<br />
The item for which re-work order is to be created needs to be in inventory ?<br />
<br />
Does system create rework order against closed production orders ?<br />
<br />

by definition, Re-work order is created to salvage/ repair a manufactured item i.e. the finished good is in stock. However in LN there is a flexibility to complete the production order and report final item without issuing the raw material. The same applies for Re-Work Order as well. <br />
-There is no reference or relation between the actual production order and re-work production order. these are 2 independent orders.<br />
- While creating production order, you need to select the re-work check box to make the order as re-work order. In this case system automatically enters the FG item in Estimated material line with a qty equal to the order qty. BOM will not be defaulted in this case. All material requirements and routing details need to be entered manually. If the Valuation is Actual Costing then the cost of the production order will be the total of FG issued on the production order, Raw Material issued and Operation hours spent.<br />
<br />
Hope it explains your query. Let me know if you need any more information.</div></div><hr />
