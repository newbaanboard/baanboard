<br />
i am working for a factory, we produce consumer OEM goods. Basically each BOM contains 20-30 lines max.<br />
<br />
We are a young company and don't have very very clear process yet.<br />
<br />
I would like to implement a product codification system.<br />
<br />
Could you give me your advice on such system ?<br />
How are you doing in the company for who you are working for ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback !<br />

<br />
For which purpose will you use this product codification groups?<br />
It leads me to the idea of classification... <br />
<br />
I see more situations.<br />
<br />
Example 1: if you want to filter out the manufacturing environment, you can define an item group for each product type: for ex one for FG, one for semi FG, one for raw materials. If you want a more detailed clasiffication, go down on production work centers level ( where each work center is one production line) + additional item group for the purchased items.<br />
<br />
Example 2: I could imagine that all products are similar, so you do not need the example above. Then, are you interested in a filtering by destination of the FG? never used it... but guess it could be possible.<br />
<br />
In conclussion, which is the target you want to achieve with your action?<br />
Or let me know if I misunderstood you.<br />
