<br />
We have lot of items in item master which are not currently used. Now we decide the reduce the size of Item Master. <br />
<br />
We want to hide or delete those items which are not used at present. Is it possible. If yes, Please give me suggestion how to remove or hide that items.<br />
<br />
Also we wants those items are not display in the item master.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">25th April 2007, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Create a signal code which blocks the items from being used in any of the modules like sales, purchase, production etc..<br />
<br />
If any of these items were used in any session earlier, deleting is quite a headache(as it writes them into history tables). Its better to block them with a signal code and they wont appear when the item master is being queried from other sessions...<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">25th April 2007, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">By using signal codes, the item codes exist in the Item Master but wont appear in any Item Master Subsessions. This will hide as well as block item codes from being used in other sessions without much of a drag(performance). However if one was to scroll through item codes using the Item Master main session (tiitm0101m000), you would be able to see it. But untill the signal codes are present and you define the signal code in such way that the item codes are blocked on all modules, they would be invisible for all the other modules.<br />
<br />
Another way would be to create a new item group or selection code and put a user restriction(using Table Data Authorization) on these newly created group or selection code so that the users who are restricted, wont be able to see or use them in the sessions they have restrictions on. Does the same job as above, but there is a big performance drag on this and its tedious to maintain....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gpitre</div><div class="date">18th February 2008, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The best way I have found out over the years on dealing with items in tiitm0101m000 that cannot be delete because of history is as follow:<br />
<br />
Define a Siganl code for Obsolete part, block for all transactions.<br />
Define a new whse for Obsolete Items and asign this whse to all the items you no longer want to see.<br />
Delete all items by whse in Mainatain Item by whse of the relevant items, only keep the record of the items/Obsolete whse<br />
<br />
I do not suggest to change the item group as this could prevent retrieving historical info, however if you use product type, selection code, you can define a category for the obsolete items.<br />
To aavoid seing them in the display, it all depend how you make your search but I mostly use the Query, this way you can eliminateby the obsolete whse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it worked a treat and we have 'hidden' about 5000 items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DineshSharma</div><div class="date">20th February 2008, 05:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi David,<br />
<br />
Please what is the steps are to be taken in Baan V for hide the unused Item Master, write briefly.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David Eagar</div><div class="date">25th February 2008, 04:22</div></div><div class="posttext">As recommended by others, 1st create item signal that blocks all transactions<br />
For items that are to be flagged as Obsolete:<br />
Ensure NO inventory, planned Sales, Purchase or Transfer orders<br />
<br />
Create new warehouse for sole purpose of taking 'ownership' of obsolete items<br />
Enter the Item signal and warehouse code in tcibd001<br />
Enter the warehouse code in tdisa001 and tdpur001<br />
<br />
In table authorisations, mark these three tables for cwar = xxx (whatever code you use) to be 'Not Authorised'<br />
<br />
Item will now be 'invisible' to normal users in General Item Data, Sales &amp; Purchasing data - you will not have lost this item's history, but it will not clutter up users screens.<br />
<br />
A previous post made mention of deleting Item / Warehouse data - we did not go this far, but it sounds sensible to me<br />
<br />
Lots of luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">25th February 2008, 08:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on a special signal code, I have defined a job that uses the session tiitm0203m000 to (try to) delete items. That job gets started on weekends and holidays. However, deleting an item might last some hours, so be careful; I manually add some items to my job and I keep the log files.<br />
