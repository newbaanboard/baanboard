Have tested various scenarios and found that in session tdssc1117m000 - Confirm delivery in preparation, the sales order is created, but does not pick up the discount value that is on form 4 of the customer master for that customer or any other discounts set up for the cust/item. I am using Baan IVc4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">23rd July 2002, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">As the sales price in the contract is specific to the customer and item then there is no standard price to discount. so best to put the actual discounted price in the contract. If you really want to have a standard price in the contract then you could use the retro billed price change  session  which will create new sales orders to adjust the the contract prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lindym</div><div class="date">30th July 2002, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply Darren. I understand what you are saying, but we have a situation where the export customers are wanting to see the standard pricing less the discount amount on their invoices. I do not think that getting 2 invoices (one for the standard price and one for the discount) would be acceptable to them. <br />
<br />
Any other suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">30th July 2002, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case I can only think of two options<br />
<br />
1. edit the invoice report so it shows the discount but use the discounted price in the contract. <br />
<br />
<br />
2. Use the session Change prices and discounts after maintain deliveries tdsls4122m000  then you can use the standard price in the contract and apply the discount in this session before printing the sales invoice.<br />
<br />
option 2 looks the best</div></div><hr />
