<br />
I am implementing LN EP on my own after a few weeks of reading through manuals and held files, so please bear with me if some of what I say is a little like newbie speak...:p<br />
At present I have set up all items as Order planning only (i.e. order horizon = plan horizon), but I would like to use the Item Master Planning screen as a nice, simple way for users to see the planning data.<br />
As such, I have selected the Maintain Master Planning box for all items in Item - Planning and have selected Generate for all of the demand / inventory items (also in Item - Planning).<br />
After Initializing the Scenario, Generating Demand and Inventory Plan and Generating Order Plan (with the tick box to also Generate Master Plan) for all items, I find that only some (very few) items actually show an inventory plan on the Item Master Plan screen. Rerunning the Generate Demand and Inventory Plan does not fix this.<br />
Worse than this, the Item Order Plan does not take into account the item safety stock (correctly input in Item - Ordering and with the Warehouse - Item set to use Item Ordering data).<br />
I have been going around in circles for a couple of days trying to find any differences between the two types of parts without success.<br />
One thing that I have found is that when I choose to run either of the Generate Demand and Inventory Plan and/or Generate Master Plan specifically for any of the items that are not showing Inventory Plan, I get an error message stating the &quot;There is no Data within this range&quot; or something like that (sorry, ERP is down at present...:mad:). This would seem to indicate that the problem is that an Item Master Plan does not exist for these items?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions on what might be going on?<br />
Is it a good idea to have hybrid Order Plan (MRP) / Master Plan (MPS) parts? Or is it best to stick to the tried and tested MPS for end parts and MRP for supply parts?<br />
<br />
Wow, not written so much without my Ipad for a while!...<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />
