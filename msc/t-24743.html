<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankadam</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, <br />
<br />
Does anybody have any ideas as to how to deal with the following?<br />
<br />
Baan IVc4, ILC implemented<br />
Manual issuing = no<br />
<br />
- Production order for 10 pcs of the end item, with routing<br />
- One material line for 10 pcs of item A, not linked to any operation (so to operation 0), backflushing = yes<br />
- Report production order completed for 6 pcs: update preceding operations = yes<br />
- Backflush manually --&gt; 6 pcs of item A are backflushed<br />
- In ticst0101m000 (enter material issue) change 'issue' from 0 to -4 and leave 'subsequent delivery' on 4 in order to remove item A from the material list<br />
<br />
Now I want to add item B to the material list in order to issue 4 pcs of item B at the moment of completing the order for the remaining 4 pcs of the end item. Now it's not possible to put the backflushing flag of that new material line to 'yes' since backflushing has already taken place. <br />
<br />
Is there any other procedure that I can follow so that I can still include this item in the next backflushing run? Or any other suggestion of how to deal with this scenario in the least time-consuming way?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baazigar</div><div class="date">18th August 2005, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">only way you can issue the new item is through manual issues - cannot backflush it anymore - since some backflushing has already happened - system would not know how to behave for an item which is put in later.  so only option is manual issues.  gone through this many times - if you find any answers, please share</div></div><hr />

<br />
A bit late but I realise that I haven't thanked you for your answer yet. So: thanks for the effort you made to answer this.<br />
<br />
In the end what we did is creating a dummy operation 999 in the production order planning. Then we entered a new material line in the estimated materials, linking that to the dummy operation. This enables you to set the backflushing-flag to 'yes' and then to let the new material line participate in the ensuing backflushing runs.<br />
