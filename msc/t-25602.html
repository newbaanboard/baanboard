we use Baan IV c4 ags2 and need to differentiate an item's demand for different revisions. This is especially important when phasing in a new version. At that time we still have stocks of e.g. revsion 1 but a customer would like to order the first few samples of revision 2 (using call offs in automotive). Unfortunately, Baan does not distinguish between different revision during the MRP calculation.<br />
<br />
Is there anybody having similar problems and how did you solve it?<br />
<br />

We 'solved' it simply with a report that lists SO lines with the revision code, planners/purchasers amend the suggested PO's if necessary. If you find something better then please let me know.<br />

<br />
that would work if one revision replaces another at a given time. Unfortunately, we have to sell and continue to produce older versions for up to 7 years (spare parts). Hence, customers will order various revisions parallel. Some do create new items for it others don't (and we would actually prefer not to create new items for every revision).</div></div><hr />
