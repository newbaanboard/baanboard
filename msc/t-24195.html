Doesn't Baan include this?<br />
<br />
I would think it to be fairly basic questioning that an ERP should have built into itself &quot;What did we substitute?  What did we substitute it with? and When (which production order) did it happen?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Is anyone aware of where this (or similar) functionality is located?  If not already built-in, has anyone already done this (I would rather not reinvent the wheel if I don't have to).<br />
<br />
It should just be a matter of comparing material issue for production orders against the FG item's BOM.  Any item ID that doesn't match up is a substitution that should show up on the report.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Simply access the Estimated vs Actual Material Costs in BaanERP. It's under Production Order Costing menu in BaanERP. I have the feeling that it's also available in BaanIV under same menu, but I could be wrong<br />

I guess Paul is talking about session ticst0401m000 and related, but I'm afraid that's not what rdbailey is looking for. This session compares the estimated material against the actually &quot;used&quot;. Once materials have been substituted in Maintain Estimated Materials it wouldn't show up as a &quot;difference&quot; in the standard reports.<br />
As far as I understand the question from rdbailey he wants a difference report between estimated materials and the standard bom. Unfortunately I've never seen such a report.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdbailey</div><div class="date">2nd June 2005, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
Paul - I have taken a look at the ticst0501m000 (Display Actual Material Costs) session which appears to be similar to ticst0401m000 in its content.  Although it does show a list of actual vs. estimated costs, it does not appear to highlight when a part was substituted on a BOM through the production order.  I investigated this option a little further and looked into table ticst001.  Even on production orders where a substitution had taken place, the estimated qty was never 0 (what I think would happen if it was a substitution).  So, I'm not sure this report (and other similar ones I have seen in this area) will deliver what I am looking for.  I did however find a couple of interesting things we can use in the future for something unrelated (thank you for the &quot;heads-up&quot; to this functionality).<br />
<br />
Martin - Yes, I am looking for a &quot;difference report&quot; highlighting variations from the standard BOM (which should indicate a substitution may have been made).  At least I know I am not the only one who can't seem to find something like this.  I can't imagine I am the first to require this kind of functionality though.  I do hope it is hiding somewhere in &quot;the ocean that is Baan&quot;.  Thank you for clarifying my request.<br />
<br />
Thank you gentlemen for your efforts.  If you have other ideas, they would also be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
It appears (so far) I may have to get out the old chisel and invent a new wheel...  :(.  If we can't find an existing solution and end up building something, I'll post it here so others can benefit from the fancy new wheel on the block.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">3rd June 2005, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys, what we usually ask the users to do is not to replace estimated materials of a production order with something else. Rather, we ask them to change the quantity of the material being replaced to 0 and create a new line for the replacing material. That way, using the session I talked abouts we indeed can see that some materials are being replaced. If multiple materials are being replaced, then it'd be hard to pick out which material replaces which one. But if you're working with clients whose production only involves small number of materials (such as flexible packaging), then it should be OK<br />
