Hi Sandip,<br />
<br />
I haven't tried this yet, but according to the LN Production Order help session,  the Rework Production Order procedure for serialized items goes something like this ...<br />
<br />
To rework an item with a specific serial number, complete the following steps:<br />
<br />
To create a rework order, define a production order in the Production Orders (tisfc0101s000) session. <br />
Select the Rework Order check box. <br />
In the Item field, enter the serialized item, and save the order.<br />
<br />
You can register the serial numbers of the rework items in two ways:<br />
<br />
In the Production Orders (tisfc0501m000) session, select the newly created rework order, open the Specific menu, click End Item, and click Serial Numbers. The Serial End Item - As-Built Headers (timfc0110m000) session is started. In the Serial End Item - As-Built Headers (timfc0110m000) session, enter the serial numbers of items you want to rework.<br />
<br />
When you issue the rework items in the Material to Issue for Production Orders (ticst0101m100) session, move the quantity from the Subsequent Delivery field to the To Issue field. The rework items are now issued anonymously from the warehouse.<br />
