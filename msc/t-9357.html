How can I demonstrate the use? I am using B40c3 Supply Chain extension.<br />

Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">24th March 2003, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have SCH purchase contracts for the same item with more than one supplier, the Supplier Priority helps to determine which supplier will be &quot;awarded&quot; a purchase schedule.<br />
<br />
The supplier whose contract has the lowest Supplier Priority number (1 is the lowest, 2 next lowest, etc.) is given highest purchasing priority and will be considered first when generating schedules. <br />
<br />
If only one supplier has the lowest priority, planning engines will generate a purchase schedule for that supplier only.<br />
<br />
If two or more supplier contracts have the same (lowest) Priority, then the system looks at the Quantity Percentage (the next field on tdpsc0101m000) and splits demand for the item between the suppliers according to the percentage entered here.<br />
<br />
I don't know if there are any effective differences or issues between IVc3 and IVc4. Maybge someone else can comment.<br />

We used to apply this parameter in the case of supplier code changes (e.g. 100001 to 100002)<br />
<br />
So if you have a released horizon with 100001, you set &quot;Supplier Priority&quot; as 0.00 at the 100001 contract. This will permit you received material and no place more orders to him.<br />
<br />
And at the 100002 contract you set up it as 100.0, so all orders will be placed to 100002 supplier............<br />
