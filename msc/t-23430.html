<br />
Sorry if this has been discussed in the board before.<br />
We are using Baan IVc3 with MCR. Recently, we've noticed that across the Planned Production Orders generated by MRP run, some Production orders in timrp1120m000  - Maintain Planned MRP Prod. Orders session, the field 'Used Method' (timrp020.plnm) displays 'Lead Time' and 'Using Routimg' withput any known reason (for us)<br />
Consequently, Purchase orders, required for some Prod. Orders (using routing) are planned backwards! which forces the buyer to open Purchase Orders for dates in the past  :( <br />
How can we force Baan to use 'Using Lead Time' everytime? We couldn't find any parameter in the system yet.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check MRP parameters LTO scheduling outside CRP Horizon - It should be no.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<br />
Yesterday, we switched the parameter from YES to NO and did a regenerative MRP run. Unfortunately, we saw that ALL production orders have been planned using Routing  instead of Lead Time  :(<br />
So this parameter, definitely related with the result but can not set Lead Time for Production Orders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rocky6</div><div class="date">17th March 2005, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Change the MRP parameter &quot;Use LTO Scheduling Method outside CRP Horizon&quot; back to Yes.<br />
<br />
Then change the CRP parameter &quot;Length CRP Time Horizon in Days&quot; to a small value, e.g., zero (0).<br />
<br />
This value is used to determine at what point--i.e., how many days into the future-- MRP (&amp; CRP) will simply use the order lead-time from the Item master, rather than use the duration of all operations from the routing to calculate the lead-time.<br />
<br />
One point of caution here:  if the demand for the MRP item is coming from Safety Stock, Baan is going to use the routing lead-time regardless of these parameter settings (because it is using a requirement date of today--and today still isn't outside the CRP horizon).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Today, I've also set that parameter to zero but it didn't worked either:<br />
<br />
All MRP production orders are using Routing instead of Lead Time.<br />
And number of Production orders dcreased to 59 from 2100</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rocky6</div><div class="date">18th March 2005, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure what to tell you. It works for us here. We're running BaanIVc4, but that shouldn't be any different than c3.<br />
<br />
Where is the demand coming from that is driving your planned production orders? As I said before, order created to build safety stock are still getting planned using the Routing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">18th March 2005, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">If using the offset will result in a starting day earlier then today, the routing will be used. Change delivery date of the sales order to a later date and rerun mrp, eventually it will result in using the offset in stead of routing.<br />

I am trying to force MRP to always use the LTO but since I need the CRP data also I cannot reduce the CRP horizon to a low number.<br />
<br />
Let me know<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">13th March 2014, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">THe LTO value is in BOM. I don;t think it uses item master lead time. If for short duration you want to use routing then set the CRP horizon say of a week or two. System will use LTO after 2 weeks. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madmax33</div><div class="date">13th March 2014, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Arvind, I understand about reducing the CRP horizon as per my question.<br />
I am trying to force MRP to always use the LTO but since I need the CRP data (for 365 days) also I cannot reduce the CRP horizon to a low number.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tried the BOM LTO but it applies to the items components only so the end result in MRP is that the planned orders for the components have the right lead time but the finished product does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">13th March 2014, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Why don't you try this. <br />
1. Don't run CRP along with MRP.<br />
2. Change CRP horizon to a low value<br />
3. Run MRP<br />
4. Change CRP horizon to desired value<br />
5 Run only CRP.<br />
<br />
The step no. 2 and 4 can be automated. See if this will help you. Tis way you are decoupling MRP and CRP</div></div><hr />
