   We use Baan IV c4 [SP18] on SQL 2000 with location control implemented. While issuing or transfering items with different storage and inventory unit, we found out that the system calculates the inventory unit automatically when a storage unit is provided or changed but when the inventory unit was changed the system didnt bother changing the storage unit. This also happens during purchase receipts of items with different storage and inventory unit.<br />
<br />
Is this a standard functionality of Baan in going just one way while converting units(i.e Storage to Inventory and not vice versa) or is it a bug for which there is a patch? <br />
<br />
Please do let me know...<br />

  First of all thank you for your reply. I guess you are a bit confused about what i put down here. There is no need for changing anything through GTM. The system does the converion from storage to inventory based on the conversion factor defined for the particular item. My question was if Baan would calculate it vice versa (inventory to storage). <br />
Consider this, a person is trying to issue 2ltrs of a chemical, which is a part of the production of an item. The storage unit of this is drums. Now because of this one way conversion, the person issuing this item has to calculate how much 2ltrs is in drums. When you provide the result in the storage unit field of Maintain Outbound Data session, it converts it properly to 2ltrs. <br />
So why cant baan convert it the other way if the inventory unit was given instead of the storage? <br />
