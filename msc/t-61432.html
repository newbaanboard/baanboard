<br />
First of all thanks for this great forum, i've learned much from this site and I love it.<br />
<br />
I have an issue: A transfer(manual) order was made and the picklist was picked/released/confirmed, the shipment was confirmed with the actual qty but somehow the qty that was being moved from one WH to another stays in STAGING location with the qty on hand but allocated as well. <br />
<br />
I tried deleting the O/A but I'm stuck with this issue. Do you have any clues on what can I do to either move back the inventory or push it forward?<br />
<br />
I've tried fast transfers, generate new upl, but I had not have any success.</div></div><hr />
