We can go in and zero out the subsequent delivery but unsure where this large erroneous number comes from...<br />
<br />
See screen shot<br />
<br />
Order 72 boxes<br />
Used 72 boxes<br />
Subsequent delivery of 644.2068? <br />
<br />
Any ideas where to look? Doesn't happen all the time, maybe 5 times per 100 jobs.<br />
