If thats the case, <br />
1) You could create two separate codes for them, one being manufactured and the other being purchased. (Recommended step..)<br />
2) In Baan, you can include a manufactured item in a purchase order and you can make a production order for a purchased item. A message will pop up in both the cases informing you the type of the item you have included. (Work around step..)<br />
3) Another way is to change the item type of the Item code from manufactured to Purchased and vice versa. When changing it to a manufactured item, be sure to attach a BOM and routing(if applicable) and take off any surcharges thats to do with purchasing of the item. When its changed to a purchased item from a manufactured, dont forget to put a purchase price for the item, the BOM gets disconnected from the item and wouldnt play any role in the calculation of cost price. Dont forget to put back any surcharges. (This step is however not advisable as your costs will suffer..)<br />

Hope this helps.<br />
