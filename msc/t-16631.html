   Is there someway a drawing could be attached to an item in itm001(Item Master)? There seems to be a button named &quot;Drawing&quot; in Form 1 of Item Master session, but on clicking it nothing happens. Is there any place or session i need to go and activate something? Is it a parameter setting? Any help or documentation on this would be highly appreciated!!!<br />
<br />
I use Baan IV c4 (Service Pack 15) with SQL Server 7 as the database and Windows Nt4 as the operating system..<br />

Once set-up is done you can attch &amp; view documents of above extension.<br />
<br />
You may put a query to Baan for getting necessary documentation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">27th September 2004, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">By default, the &quot;Drawing&quot; button uses the item's current revision number and looks in EDM to find the engineering item with the corresponding revision number.  If that has a drawing file listed, it will try to display it.<br />
<br />
If you don't use EDM or want to do things differently, there are several options:<br />
<br />
 Try Nazdaq's  Hot Link program: http://www.nazdaq.co.il<br />
 Customize the tiitm001 table to add a field<br />
 Add a new miscellaneous item information table (a kind of extension to the item master)<br />
 <br />
<br />
In the latter two cases, you will have to do some script modification.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apart from the above mentioned solution one other option is creat sub-session and attach to the special menu of item master, now this sub-session whenever is opened, Item Code is passed to it, and then u should have a text box where u can enter the path of the jpeg file.<br />
<br />
For attaching the docs , u can uploading functions such as server.to.client and client.to.server.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse the solution which i am talking takes a few customizations of sessions, tables, without having a source code for Item Master.<br />
<br />
Hope this hint will give u some thing to move further.<br />

I guess EDM would be the best way to tackle my problem since it is a part of Baan and it would be linked with project control thus making it possible to attach a drawing to a project or customized item.<br />
<br />
Thank you again..<br />
