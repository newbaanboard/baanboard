<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have any ideas on how I can manufacture and purchase the same Item without using purchase orders..<br />
I want our MPS to create a production order for the manufactured Item as well as purchase the item from an outside source, based on the whatever?? Perhaps the % in the purchase contract.<br />
<br />
Currently the item is set up as a MPS manufactured Item.<br />
<br />
WE are manually entering a purchase schedule for this item for a supplier, however, since the purchase schedule is not a &quot;fixed&quot; order, the system does not recoginze this when running MRP or MPS and we still have the original requirement to build, and are purchasing materials for the full requirement instead of the split.<br />
Any info will be great</div></div><hr />

The base part number was 1234 then added a P for the Purchased Item, and Part number 1234 we added an M for the manufactured part. <br />
<br />
Standard costs were established for both individually, then Order Parameters set, and we made them alternate and interchangable on the BOM's.<br />
<br />
Accounting was satisfied with the cost issue, and planning although they had to do some mental manipulation knew exactly what was on order and the status of each purchased and or manufactured.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you<br />

How does the demand get to both items??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dmcgrath</div><div class="date">15th October 2004, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">No need to have two seperate items.<br />
<br />
The item should be a Purchased MPS item.<br />
Create a Sales Contract for the item<br />
Create a Purchase Contract for the item<br />
Create MPS Plan Item data for the item<br />
If you now create a sales schedule for the item and then run MPS, a Purchase Schedule will be created for the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">15th October 2004, 23:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We have this set up but the item is  manufacutred MPS. <br />
Will purchase / MPS create purchase schedules and production orders??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">16th October 2004, 06:33</div></div><div class="posttext">The set up for Purchased MPS item,does not work. It only creates purchase schedule demand, no production orders.<br />
I set the contract to 50%, hoping that the other 50% will create production plan, bu no luck. Only schedules were created</div></div><hr />
