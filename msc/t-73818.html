<br />
We are on ERPLN FP2 and evaluating LN 10.7. I just wanted to understand that while defining work centers, why we have to associate them with production department.<br />
<br />
Also, what is the role of production department? how it differs from FP2?<br />
<br />
Also, how to define machines in LN 10.7?<br />
<br />
Shall be grateful if someone can guide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdittmar</div><div class="date">30th April 2021, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">The production department, according to the 10.5 release notes, is part of improvements<br />
to the Repetitive Manufacturing module. <br />
It is a first step to enable the mapping of the commonly used hierarchy “site, building, <br />
work center, machine”. <br />
It groups work centers, work cells, and repair cells. You can maintain <br />
production departments in session Production Departments (tirou2100m000). <br />
More about the session can be found in <br />
https://docs.infor.com/ln/10.5/en-us/lnolh/help/ti/rou/tirou2100m100.html?zoom_highlight=production%2Bdepartment. <br />
<br />
However, Production Departments not only affect Repetitive Manufacturing. <br />
They work the same way that Departments used to in previous versions, and <br />
are mandatory for the use of work centers in Shop Floor Control. <br />
The main difference with the way Departments used to work is that now you can <br />
link multiple work centers to a department, as well as work cells and repair cells. <br />
Production Departments work as a grouping of work centers that may be in the same physical location. <br />
They define the default calendar for its work centers. The production department can <br />
also have a different enterprise unit (therefore, a different financial company) than its work centers. <br />
<br />
The use of the concept depends entirely on the layout of your factory. If the concept is not <br />
needed, you can create just one production department to group all work centers.<br />

<br />
Thank you for your update but I still have doubt. In our current ERPLN FP2 environment, we can define machines in session tirou0102m000. In this session we can define daily capacity and weekly capacity of machines.<br />
<br />
Once defined, the data goes to tirou002 (machines table).<br />
<br />
But In LN 10.7, the concept of machine type is confusing as there is no way to define weekly capacity and daily capacity of machines.<br />
<br />
Also, after defining machines, I can not see any data in tirou002 table.<br />
<br />
Is the table tirou002 obsolete in LN 10.7 of we missed something?<br />
<br />
Kindly guide.<br />
