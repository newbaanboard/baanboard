Only planned production and purchase orders are generated and used.<br />
<br />
I am looking for following help !<br />
<br />
- At present system generate planned production orders / schedule  based on the forecast input. The plan is manipulated by making a manual plan and then entered in forecast to get the desired result. Is there a way out in the system to schedule production based on cycle time defined in task/routings either backward or forward basis,  if the forecast is entered on a weekly basis or on a consolidated basis for the month. The system is generating all production orders for a single date either for a week or month !<br />
<br />
- How to change the forward and backward planning on a global basis for a particular company rather than change at production batch level. In some company (ours is a multi logistics company) it is taking forward planning and in  some cases it is taking backward planning</div></div><hr />
