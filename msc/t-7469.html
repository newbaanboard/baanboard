On requisition List, I got two different results. For the same item number why would I have a single level BOM on one and multi-level BOM on another? Another thing, on multi-level requisition I am missing one part number from the topmost level. does anybody know this problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's say that the finished good is at level 0. Then if the level 1 component (component directly below FG in BOM) is not marked as phantom, then when you create a production order for the FG, only data from single level BOM will appear in estimated material list. If level 1 component is marked as phantom, however, when you create a production order for the FG, data from multi level BOM will be used to find estimated materials. So, depending on this phantom flag on level 1 component, for the same FG, estimated material may contain data from single level BOM (phantom=no) or from multi level BOM (phantom=yes)<br />
<br />
Now when a component at level 1 is marked as phantom, then this component will not appear on (will be missing from) material list. In this case, only level 2 components will show up (or level 3 if level 2 were marked as phantom as well, and so on).<br />
