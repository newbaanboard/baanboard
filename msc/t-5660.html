<br />
We have Baan IVc4.<br />
For some items we have purchased items in production BOM in order to get the standard price right. We do not issue all the materials. Closing of production orders is troublesome. If You do nothing about issuing materials, you get this message &quot;Not all materials have been issued&quot;. Then You have to start &quot;Enter Material Issue for Production Orders&quot; and go through every materal line, which is not going to be issued according to BOM and set issued quantity and subsequent delivery to zero.<br />
<br />
Is there anything we can do to avoid this extra work?<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Heikki</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">28th June 2002, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I have asked several baan consultants and didn`t get a better solution than the one we have.  at least with the surcharge method you don`t get variances between estimated and actual costs which you must having now because you are altering the items being issued.<br />
<br />
Why are you not backflushing these items as there may be another way to solve it. In our case it is because we don`t know which exact part will be used until the item is being assembled because of the size of the parts.</div></div><hr />

You can ask your tools person to write a short update session that will set the &quot;subsequent issue&quot; and &quot;to issue&quot; fields to zero for selected order(s).  That would allow you to retain current logistics and finance setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
I tried this approach because I have the same problem. My item is in the 2nd level of BOM. I put the quantity as zero and in Maintain surcharges by Item i put a surcharge.<br />
<br />
When I print my multi-level cost price calculation for the top item, it shows the surcharge but looks like it multiplies it by zero so the surcharge does not carry through the total cost. Am I missing something here? TIA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 10:48</div></div><div class="posttext">:) I noticed that your version is Baan IV c2.  It is possible that you need to apply a patch. What you encountered seems similar to one of our client's case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This might be a bit off the topic of the thread, but regarding your concern:<br />
<br />
Item surcharges will always be counted toward its standard cost. However, if you include the item in the BOM of certain assembly and put its required qty in the assembly as zero (i.e. make a BOM line with zero quantity), you're telling BaanERP that you don't really need the item in the manufacture of that assembly. Hence, BaanERP won't propagate the item's standard costs - including its surcharges - to the standard cost of the assembly. You didn't miss anything there; it's the way it's supposed to be<br />

<br />
    We get the &quot;Not all materials have been issued and after solving this we get inbound advice not completely released. Is there a quick fix for this since we usually get to close alot of orders with the above errors every time.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
