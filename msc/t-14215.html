Today I experimented with alternative items. It seems to me in the process of using items (article items that is) for which (more than one) alternative items exist BaaN never comes up with a question wether or not I want to replace the original item with (one of) the alternative items. When there is not enough inventory BaaN replaces the original with the alternative without asking any question or warning. Is this correct?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In alternate items there are two possible areas for discussion, the first is where a part can be replaced, for this, there are choices whether you want to have the part interchangeable, or simply a one way replace.  I believe this addresses your question,  try by setting the various check boxes in the session, to see the results.<br />
<br />
The other area is Alt Code systems, which deals with part numbers that are diff. between suppliers, and customers, thus, allows a good way to track parts (the same) across multiple companies.<br />

<br />
I'ld like to know more about the first way of using alt. items. <br />
Suppose:<br />
Standard item 0000 Anonymous<br />
Standard item 0001 Anonymous<br />
Standard item 0000 can be replaced by item 0001<br />
Standard Item 0002 Anonymous<br />
Standard Item 0003 On Order<br />
Standard item 0003 can be replaced by Standard item 0002.<br />
Standard<br />
<br />
As far as I know items are only replaced when the On order item 0003 is being copied to the customer specific environment. When running a PRP-run in the PRP advice it says the On order item 0003 has been replaced by Standard item 0002. In this replacement process there was no warning/signal about the replacement.<br />
No where else I found a a replacement. So not between item 000 and 0001 when calling for 000 which had insufficient inventory.<br />
<br />
Is this the way replacement of items works?</div></div><hr />

<br />
BaanERP won't advise you to use the alternative items when there's not enough stock of the original intended item. The alternative item list is just there for informational purpose<br />
