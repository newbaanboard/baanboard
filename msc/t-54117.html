<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">*click*</div><div class="date">27th October 2008, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan A&amp;D, is it true that the MDD date for a single shippable be the nearest/soonest in order for you to ship it?  In other words, if I have 2 MDDs for product X dated 01/01/08 and 02/02/08, then I cannot ship the 02/02/08 one?  That is what we are seeing here.  You have to change the date of the MDD set at 02/02/08 to be sooner than any other MDD for product X in order to ship that specific MDD.<br />
<br />
Is this a result of some customization we have here?  Does anyone else have specific examples of this where they could ship clin 2/MDD 2 before clin 1/MDD 1 below and how?<br />
<br />
clin 1/MDD 1 dated 01/01/08<br />
clin 2/MDD 2 dated 02/02/08<br />
<br />
We are going to LN in 6 months thankfully and yes we have actually started doing our clin set up differently so that we are more one to one.  We currently have the clins set up this way because of multiple addresses to the customer and the order changes on the fly often.  Loading the clins is not really an option so just looking to see if there is anything that we broke where we should be able to ship out of order or something we are doing incorrectly.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
