<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">9844don</div><div class="date">5th July 2002, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Am looking for some information , hopefully more then the advertisingbrochures, as to what are the differences between Baan ERP 5.0 and Supply chain software.  <br />
<br />
Heard  that Supply Chain doesn't have the financials that ERP does but do not know that for fact. <br />
<br />
This is for personal use and not for selling or recommending to a clients.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
We are running the supply chain version of Baan IVC3 and this does contain Finance.<br />
<br />
I believe that the supply chain extensions are not available in ERP 5.0.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">9844don</div><div class="date">8th July 2002, 21:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your answer.  Still somewhat confused as what are the basic differnces between Baan Supply chain software and ERP 5.0b .<br />
<br />
Does anybody have or know what are the differentiators between ERP 5.0  and Supply Chain?   Specifics would be nice , as might be found in a Baan white paper- as not a client or a customer not easily obtained .<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">9th July 2002, 01:12</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan 4, supply chain used to be an extension which had to be installed in addition to the standard package and which contained some added functionality. In Baan 5 (Baan ERP), this functionality is not an extra extension anymore, but integrated in the normal standard package. Both versions have functionality like shipping based on sales schedules and contracts, purchase schedules, capabilities to print out advanced shipping notices etc. I believe that Baan ERP offers more for supply chain in the area of production planning but haven't had a chance yet to research that. As for financials: I'm not aware of big differences in the financial area between both versions. Both are fully integrated.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of general differences between Baan 4 and 5 though, which are applicable to both, supply chain and non-supply chain. <br />
<br />
If you're trying to decide, whether Baan 4 or Baan 5 is the right solution for you, I would rephrase the question a bit and you might get more responses.<br />

<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1207<br />
<br />
unless they have fixed them by now ?.<br />
<br />
We are using baanIV sch1 compared to IV standard you get sales/purchase contracts and schedules, purchase requistion, self billing,extra edi options to go along with schedules.<br />
Also at the end of last year baan released a new supply chain  extension  for IVc4 called AGS automotve global solution that is a combination of supply chain and NAS0 north american automotive solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">9844don</div><div class="date">9th July 2002, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Karin and Darren for your replies.<br />
<br />
Let me clarify my request.  I have worked in Baan 5.0b some 5.0C in distribution modules for last four or so years.  Did know that purchase schedule functionality had their challenges which was finally admitted by Baan less the a year ago and believed dropped (disabled) from in later 5c service pack.<br />
<br />
While I was with Baan working on a 5b implementation in 1998, heard of the new Supply chain software being launched here in north America with a primary focus on automotive industry.<br />
<br />
But even though working as employee of Baan, we got on site little formal information about what it was etc.<br />
<br />
Have seen recruiters and or clients advertise for Suppy chain experience on potential projects - but when tell them worked on 5b and 5c , they often don't have an ideas whether that is relevant experience , nor do some of their clients.  <br />
<br />
From Karin's reply , I gather , the Supply chain software was primarily for extending Baan 4 functionality to be more appealing to automotive clients.  Am I interperting that correctly?<br />
<br />
And if someone has worked in 5b and 5c , one should be able to understand and implement Supply Chain.<br />
<br />
Appreciate comments of all including those who may have worked in both Supply chain and ERP. <br />
<br />
thank you<br />
<br />

      If you know 5b or 5c distribution you will know from 1/4 to 1/2 of the back end of a Supply Chain implementation (depending on setup).  The Supply Chain Module in the IVc4 module is geared towards the Automotive industry but can be used in any supply chain environment.  5b anc 5c strictly use discrete processing and from what I have heard will not be doing Supply Chain for another couple of years.  If you would like more detail feel free to e-mail me and I will try to scrape up some documentation for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasnt aware, that Baan had disabled the purchase and sales schedules in 5c . On the ERP system Im currently  working on, they are still enabled. I just read the case on Baan support (SITUATION DESCRIPTION: Purchase and Sales Schedules didn't work properly.  SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: Purchase and Sales Schedules are disabled)....wow...these are the moments when I think about going into SAP..... <br />
<br />
I've implemented supply chain on Baan 4 (sch0) and I think if someone has worked for several years with Baan 5 he/she should be able to learn the Baan 4 functionality fast. (I have never seen AGS or Nascar though). <br />
<br />
In general I think, that business knowledge, analitical skills, having experience with problem solving on an ERP system and experience in change management are more important than knowledge of a specific module or functionality.  That can be learned fast. Recruiters probably just react  to certain keywords though....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hsaenz</div><div class="date">10th July 2002, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't indicate that if you had the proper motivation and analytical skills you couldn't learn it fast.  I meant, it is not a given that if you know distribution well that Supply Chain will all fall into place in a day or two.<br />
<br />
I agree with your perception on problem solving and analytical skills.  Unfortunately, when we are out looking and you don't have a whole lot of contacts we have to rely on buzz words so the recruiters think they know what we are talking about.<br />
<br />

<br />
Certainly agree with your comment about an experienced Baan professional can learn other versions of the software.   Unfortunately for most of us the way to learn it has been to be doing something with the actual software.<br />
<br />
Did work for a couple of months on 4b before rolling to first Baan ERP project in north America in 1998.  So I and the rest of the 20 person team learned on the fly.  That paradigm isn't what a client needs to accept these days.  Thus my search to at least understand what functions were added as part of the &quot;Supply Chain&quot; sales effort, so that can speak intelligently with a prospective client or recruiter.<br />
<br />
So if you have anything specifically wriiten about Supply chain improvements to 4 software that would be appreciative.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

my post wasn't a direct reply to your post. It was just a general remark...<br />
<br />
Don,<br />
<br />
I understand. Unfortunately I don't have anything written up....Sounds like Humberto has some documentation though.<br />

Best regards and good luck,<br />

Thank you both for your attachments which I have now downloaded.  Will take some now time to read and digest. If have furhter questions about the functionality described in them will post them to this thread.  <br />
<br />
Will also like to thank you on behalf of the others who have downloaded the documents, too. <br />
