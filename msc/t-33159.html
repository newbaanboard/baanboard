<br />
we changed an Item from Manufactured(it has BOM components) to Purchased type this Item is phantom on the Item Master. When we ran MRP, it exploded this Item structure. Is this a normal MRP behave?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">23rd March 2007, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">So... this means that it doesn't care what Item type is it. If phantom and has a BOM structure will explode. Am I right?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">23rd March 2007, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure the item is set as a phantom in the BOM it reports to. That's where Baan looks to see the phantom. I think setting it in the item master just acts as a default for the next BOM it's put into.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about exploding the phantom purchased vs manufactured. If it's purchased I don't think it should plan the components. Obviously a phantom will always have a BOM - you wouldn't phantomize a piece part! But why do you have a purchased assembly phantomized? It's a purchased assembly, so phantomizing shouldn't even come into play.</div></div><hr />

It just looks whether the Item is a phantom or not in the BOM.  As you might be aware, a normal item can be defined as Phantom only in BOM.</div></div><hr />
