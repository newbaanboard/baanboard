You can so operation overlapping, but that is restircted with in same item. I think in order to resolve the this, you may want to figure out effective time of getting item A. Starting of item A before full compltetion of production order B will ultimately result in reduction in mfg lead time.<br />

Thank you for your reply. What do you mean by&quot;I think in order to resolve the this, you may want to figure out effective time of getting item A. Starting of item A before full compltetion of production order B will ultimately result in reduction in mfg lead time.&quot; How to do it?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, item B is a semi-finish goods. There must be another production order for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know much about baan 6 , but to map this requirement you can use &quot;transfer batch less than production batch&quot; option in routing and can be defined in either % or quantity based on the parameter set in &quot;Routing parameters&quot;.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">9th February 2010, 08:43</div></div><div class="posttext">if we use transfer batch ,its only for arrange operations for 1 item ,is that right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">10th February 2010, 23:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the answer to your set up lies in Routing Operation - tirou1102m000, Transfer batch&lt;Production batch. Kindly go thru the Help on that field..<br />
<br />
I simulated as per that, and got the answer for your requirement.</div></div><hr />
