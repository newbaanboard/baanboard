<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nryan93</div><div class="date">4th June 2019, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I am working on building E-BOM's and was hoping I could reorder workorders to be printed out with each sub-assembly as an individual operation with its on operation notes, but with each operation's BOm (materials list) under each operation. Currently, it prints out each operation with it's operation notes on the first few pages and then the list of materials for each operation all clustered together within a few pages. It would be beneficial to have the operator scan their operation, review the operation notes and then have the BOM for just that operation in sequence and then move on to the next operation and repeat. <br />
<br />
Additionally, is there a way to have engineering assembly or weldment print attached as an order document to each operation? Any help is appreciated.<br />
