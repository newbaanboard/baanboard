I can create or amend purchase schedules but it will not directly impact the delivery schedule.  I need the delivery schedule to generate EDI.  Am I missing a step somewhere?  My purchase schedules will generate the requirements in the correct daily buckets.  I have print purchase schedules linked to generating 830s currently.  I cannot guarantee that a supplier would not get both an 830 and 862 or not.  So I cannot define the step using the relation.  Anyone have a idea?:confused:</div></div><hr />

You were correct in that I did not have the Autogenerate set to yes.  I deleted all of the requirements from the contract and reran my MRP with a new contract in place with autogenerate set to yes.  MRP generated the purchase schedules with the daily requirements but no delivery schedules.  Do I have to rerun MRP with the generating only DLS flag set to yes?  If I could use the print session for the purchase schedules then this would be easy but since it is also tied to 830 I cannot.  I am very confused.<br />

Have you setup a delivery profile it should have been a mandatory step when changing to auto dls on the contract.<br />
<br />
Also do you have the number days for DLS generation set on the delivery schedule info section on contract.</div></div><hr />
