<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">21st November 2003, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">We need to be able to sell phantom assemblies which are Configured To Order items.<br />
<br />
The way to do this (BaanIV) would be to put the assembly item on the Sales order, generate structures, and then set the Sales Order Line to Issue Components. [The assembly itself cannot be set as a phantom, because Baan IV explodes To Order assemblies into separate sales order lines.]<br />
<br />
In their wisdom, and because of technical difficulties related to re-configuration the Issue Components option has been disabled by Baan for Configured To Order items (although it works OK for Standard To Order items.)<br />
<br />
Personally, I am appalled that such a fundamental feature is now missing from what is otherwise a feature rich and sound system.<br />
<br />
Has anybody found a way round this, please?  We cannot be the only ones with this issue.<br />
<br />
(I am aware that the issue is solved in Baan V.)<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />

I also recently learned that this was disabled after the release of Baan IV.  I can't give any answers, but I'd also be interested to hear any possible solutions.</div></div><hr />
