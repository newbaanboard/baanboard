<br />
I'm currently facing a problem here which i need opinions from all the experts around. <br />
The question: 1) Made a blanket order on Monday, sell to own company to<br />
                       create planning and production. eg: 1000 (WIP) units<br />
                       (without color)<br />
                       This 1000 WIP item will be keep in warehouse and to be<br />
                       deduct from when real Sales Order came in.<br />
On Monday i have create a blanket order of 1000 units and planned it for production. Tuesday real Sales Order 100 (finished goods) units came in and to be deducted from the 1000 wip units which is still in production. <br />
How to solve this issue without having to plan the BOM for these 100 units?<br />
Can i approve the Sales Order and print the RMAs and when there is enough 100 wip item in warehouse i only start to initiate the planning for the 100 finished goods.?<br />
<br />
Thanks,:o</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all what do you mean by blanket order?<br />
<br />
In ERP ln to create demand for which there is no sales order, u dont have to puch a blanket sales order, use session &quot; special demand by Item &quot; in order planning.<br />
<br />
The system will plan the orders = qty in special demand + Pending sales order qty- stock<br />
<br />
now when actual sales order comes , u can reduce the qty in special demand and run the EP again , pegging</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Milo2009</div><div class="date">3rd August 2009, 04:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I think of this solutions before. my customer wants only to plan for WIP item while when the real sales order came in is on finished item. which should i plan? the WIP item or Finish good or both? <br />
<br />
example: Finished goods planning will consume the planned WIP. Can this works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mprakash</div><div class="date">6th August 2009, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">It is better in this case to plan for the finished goods. To track the WIP, you can raise a blanket sales order and connect it to the non nettable warehouse (so that planning will not consider this demand). When actual orders are received, you can run a customized session to reduce quantity from the blanket sales order from the respective line and keep track of the remaining WIP qty.</div></div><hr />

how is your bom structure for the finish good?<br />
is it 1 finish good blanket consist of non color blanket (WIP) and the colouring material?<br />
If that so, may be you can create a planning for WIP in special demand by item.<br />
After the planned prod /prod ord for WIP is processed,after the SO for FG came, you generate order planning for the finish good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Milo2009</div><div class="date">3rd September 2009, 04:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
thanks for providing various of useful ideas and solutions. <br />
Eventually my team have found the best convenient solution. <br />
solution:<br />
1) When create item (Finished goods, with colour), inside item subentities-planning, have to tick &quot;Dependent Demand Forecast&quot;. <br />
2) Then the whole process can be start from special demand (WIP item: without colour item) or forecast demand not to forget normal sales order.<br />
<br />
With this tick, every sales order will deduct from the forecast until empty or over the planning period. The sales order will be the finished item and process like other normal Sales order till the end.</div></div><hr />
