<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carlb85</div><div class="date">6th December 2022, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All, <br />
I am facing the following challenge. After a long discussion we finally want to introduce key figures for our production. For example, we want to compare the pre-calculated production time with the actual production time for individual operations. How do I get accurate data now?<br />
<br />
Is there a table in BaaN in which I can see a comparsion like this? (My ideas and problems with the table tihra100 see below)<br />
<br />
First thought: <br />
Printout of a report from an introduced add-on. <br />
However, this did not really work. Reason: In the report only production orders with status &quot;closed&quot; (tisfc001.osta = „closed“) are taken into account, not those that only have the status &quot;ready“ (tisfc001.osta = „ready“) Also, at the operation level, only the last reported date of the operation is taken into account. For example, if an operations number (tisfc010.opno) of the whole production order (tisfc001.pdno) is started on the first of a month, then interrupted, and then continued and reported complete until the 15th, the total production time for the operationsnumber is only reported for the 15th.<br />
<br />
Second thought: <br />
The table tihra100 &quot;Time Recording per Employee&quot; gives pre-calculated times (tihra100.hree) and actual times (tihra100.hrea) , and it also gives all production dates. (Both the time from the 01st of the month and the time for the 15th) However, the problem with this table is that after a certain date, all operations no longer have a precalculated working time, but only an actual one. <br />
<br />
Now I have created my own report that uses the order header to check the entire status and, depending on the status, refers to either the Operations per Order (tisfc010)  table or the thira100 table „Time recording per Employee table“. However, I would like to access only the  tihra100 „Time Recording“ per Employee table as a data source. <br />
Long story short:<br />
Which session do I have to trigger to get the precalculated operation times (tihra100.hrea) into this table?<br />
Problem is that I’m not a key-user and don’t have access to all function in BaaN. <br />
For getting informations from BaaN I’m only allowed to write querys via the session: ttadv3180m000<br />
Or do you have any other solutions to get the pre-calculatetd times vs. Acutal times per operations number. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th December 2022, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Well just using ttadv3180m000 gives you a lot of power.  You can query one table then go to the report and create all kinds of layouts to do all kinds of stuff that I won't go into. We use baan 4c4 so your version may be different.<br />
<br />
So what I usually did was just use tisfc010 - it has setup, run time, total production time and spent time.  I would generate a report off just those things.  Then if I wanted I could into a report - lets say you sorted on order number - add a after order number layout to go query tihra100.  But we developed sessions to do all this reporting - most of them are simple queries against tisfc010, then do other things like ask for date range to see what was charged between 2 dates, etc.  I recommend sessions, but if you can't do that, then you can query just tisfc010 (assuming your version close to 4c4).  <br />
<br />
You can select like tisfc001.pnno, tisfc001.mitm link to tisfc010 and pull like sutm, rutm, prtm and sptm or what ever other fields you want.</div></div><hr />
