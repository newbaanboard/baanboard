     We have location control implemented and using lot control for only two group of items. Out of these two, one of them(chemicals) we want to backflush. Correct me if i am wrong but Baan doesnt allow you to backflush a material if you have Lot specified for it. Its correct as there is no way the system would know which lot you want to issue from first till the total required quantity is issued. <br />
<br />
Why we want to do this?<br />
The requirement is there as this material forms a main ingredient to the item it helps in making. If this manufactured item gets rejected later and the fault is traced to this backflushed material then we could trace it out from which lot it was issued or backflushed from...<br />
<br />
Is there any work-around for this in baan, where-in backflushing can be done with lots???<br />
<br />
Our Setup:<br />
Baan 4c on Sql Server 7.0 with Service Pack 15<br />
<br />
Thanking you all in advance..<br />

But logically, what is the sense of making an item lot controlled if you backflush? Usually for backflush items there will be a stockpoint nearby the work centre, which will be used as needed. There is no way to control which lot is taken and if that will be the same as the lot that is backflushed. So backtracing as you described will be useless.<br />
<br />
Your solution might be to set it to backflushing no, and generate outbound advice after releasing the production order. Then instruct to the workcentre to use the specified lot for the production order.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">24th December 2004, 00:56</div></div><div class="posttext">We backflush lot controlled items by using customised &quot;genarate outbound&quot; program.<br />
<br />
We have a structured lot code that is comprised of a serial number for quality auditing and a customer order number to assist in selection when we &quot;sell&quot; if a finished good or comsume in a downstream operation.<br />
<br />
When a lot is used as a material it will be backflushed, the program looks for a specific series of numbers in a warehouse desigated for WIP material and selects lowest serial number first (oldest). <br />
<br />
I am not suggesting that you should have a customised program but just describing how we addressed a similar situation to yours. We determined that the saving we could achieve by having the process fully &quot;no-hands or mind&quot; out-weighed the cost of the customisation by a big margin <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pergerp</div><div class="date">4th January 2005, 14:29</div></div><div class="posttext">In BAAN4 you can use backflushing with lots and<br />
I suggest this buckflashing menthod because manually 'Maintain Outbounds' is rather complicated.<br />
<br />
As tjbyfield mentioned they are using WIP warehouses.<br />
I suggest that you should use WIP wh as well.<br />
Then you transfer material from main warehouse to WIP wh before you start production (move materials with inventory transfer or repl. orders).<br />
<br />
WIP wh contains only few (probably only one) lots: only requested raw materials for one shift or only for some production orders.<br />
BAAN will issue raw materials according to outbound priority (FIFO suggested), when you report operations completed.<br />
<br />
What is the adventage of wip wh compared to direct manual issuing to production orders? You can transfer raw materials (from main wh to wip wh) for more production orders and BAAN will issue them with backflushing, from wip wh.<br />
This process is much faster than direct manual issuing to several orders.<br />
<br />
If you keep more lots in wip wh. then you can provide strict lot control with work instructions:<br />
  ask workers to start with lowest prod. order number and phisically use up materials with lowest lot numbers, etc.<br />
<br />
With appropriate physical handling (in wip wh) you can insure exact lot traceability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use backflush as Pergerp explained above here but, we have a timing issue. It happens that, if there is a shortage of a backflushed component/item and the order has to be moved (for whatever reason) to then next operation these shortages still pending to be issued.  So, then new production orders are released, meanwhile new material arrives to the stores. It happens that the newer order that is at the backflush operation has enough material and backflushes its materials before than the older order that had been moved ahead with shortages. When the older order gets its materials from stores, it gets more recent lots than the orders were released later.<br />
<br />
This causes a problem with the control of our lots. Newer order has older lots than the older orders (we use FIFO).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
