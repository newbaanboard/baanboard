 <br />
I've been asked to look over the logic of our routings, which were setup long before I started.<br />
 <br />
My question is, where is the production rate (pieces per hour) used as compared to run time (minutes per peice)?<br />
 <br />
In a lot of the routings, the production rate (the pieces per hour) does not agree with the run time (minutes per piece). For example, the run time might be 1.6 min/piece, and the production rate is 6 pieces/hr. In many cases the production rate is just zero even if there is a run time.<br />
 <br />
I can see in testing that the run time (minutes per peice) is what is used to calculate the finish dates for production orders and in the capacity requirements graphs. So I'm not it matters much that the production rate is out.<br />
 <br />
Thanks,<br />
Rob</div></div><hr />
