<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">6th October 2003, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
 I have a production order with 10 operations, numbered 1 thru 10.<br />
<br />
After Operation No: 7, There is a situation of material non-conformance and I need to add a rework operation.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to insert a new operation between 7 and 10 ?<br />
Like say... 7.1  ?<br />
(From what I see in Baan IV.. the Operation field in the tisfc010 table does not support that)   :(<br />
<br />
I can move out the 8, 9, 10 operations... by copying these operations to new numbers and deleting 8, 9, 10 to create a gap to insert the &quot;new&quot; operation. But would not like to do that, since there might be labor Hrs clocked on 8, 9, 10. <br />
<br />
We are on BaanIVc2.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to accomplish this task ? <br />
All help is appreciated. Thanks<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Minhaaj</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to either re-design your routings (with some gaps between each operation) or shift the operations (8,9 &amp; 10)  as u said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">thnx for the reply Hitesh...<br />
<br />
Guess you are right. <br />
<br />
By resequencing the operations, I will have to &quot;un-allocate&quot; the clocked-in/processed Labor Hrs &amp; &quot;re-allocated/assign&quot; them to the new sequence of operation numbers.<br />
Do you foresee any problems with this ? Am I missing something here ? Apart from the tisfc010, ticst001, ticst002, tihra100 tables...<br />
Would I need to look at other tables ? Would this result in any data-inconsistency ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice. <br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

Instead you should go for maintaining production planning (change,delete, insert in tisfc1101m000) .<br />
<br />
I think that will save u of any inconsistency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">true... I would not be going thru the GTM route.... I was planning on using the appropriate Function Servers. <br />
<br />
Lets see how feasible the solution might be :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time. Appreciate it.<br />

<br />
let me add a hint to avoid the problem in future:<br />
the sequence number in production planning is generated from the routing for the manufactured item (tirou102.opno). If you change the steps from 1,2,3.. to 10,20,30.. you can easily insert operations in production planning.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">8th October 2003, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Martin... that hint sure helps. :)<br />

Have a nice day<br />

<br />
Just a short comment that in B5 you can simply add a new operation with whatever number and re-arrange the sequence of operations to include the new operation.<br />
<br />
For example, we originally have<br />
Op 1 whose next op is op 2<br />
Op 2 whose next op is op 3<br />
<br />
Now if we want to insert a new op (say op 1000) between op 2 &amp; 3, then we can have something like this:<br />
Op 1 whose next op is op 2<br />
Op 2 whose next op is op 1000<br />
Op 1000 whose next op is op 3<br />
<br />

U r right for B5 . But this will not help minhaz (who is on B40c2). <br />
<br />
We are on BaanIVc2.<br />
<br />
So what I and Martin Jung has told will apply mihaz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">10th October 2003, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
 Thnks for all the inputs, suggestions &amp; pointers.<br />
<br />
This is what I did. <br />
<br />
I built a routine to check for gaps in operation and move the operations around., so that I can insert a new operation in the newly formed gap. <br />
<br />
Example... Operations are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30.....<br />
<br />
I need to insert an Operation between 7 and 8. The subroutine will realign the Operations as ... <br />
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ..., 9, 10, 11, 20, 30.  <br />
(Operation 11 is a copy of 10, Operation 10 is a copy of Operation 9... and so on)<br />
As operation 10 is copied, The respective Hours are &quot;backed-out&quot; from Oper-10 and assigned to Oper-11 with the same dates. The Hours are processed to bring into effect the &quot;new&quot; hours. Now that Operation 10 has zero hrs, The operation is deleted.<br />
This procedure is repeated to copy Operation 9 to Operation 10.<br />
(Function Servers are used everywhere).<br />
<br />
Thus the gaps are created and I am able to insert a new operation.<br />
<br />
All this works fine in the test company... now before I put it into the production, Can you please advice, If there is something I am missing out on or If I might be screwing up something,  somewhere ? :p <br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
 As I am inserting negative Hours for the old operation and the same &quot;positive&quot; hours for the &quot;newly copied&quot; operation...  The processed Hours are backed out.<br />
<br />
I hope this is what you were asking...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th October 2003, 08:59</div></div><div class="posttext">As function servers are used , the probility for anything going drastically wrong is minimal.<br />
<br />
I would recommend u test ur routine for error handling part (what if the standard program gives errors / messages in function server ) .</div></div><hr />
