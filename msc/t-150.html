<br />
Has anyone customized (or know of someone who has) Baan so a specific location can be linked to an BOM line, so a BOM component will always backflush from a specific location, regardless of where else the inventory is?<br />

What you can do, is to give items fixed locations in a WH, and therefore force the system to always issue from the same location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obi-Baan-Kanobi</div><div class="date">11th September 2001, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I know.  The question is, has anyone performed this customization?  My users are asking for this, and don't want to add more warehouses (don't ask why, it's irrational).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sturla</div><div class="date">12th September 2001, 09:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Why should you add more warehouses? You only have to link an item to a fixed location in an already excisting WH. Items you receive from purchase/production will automaticly be given an inbound adviced at this location, and items for the shop floor will be issued from the same location.<br />
Regarding a customization, no Scandinavian customers have performed something like this. It's of course possible to make it, but it makes it hard to maintain your static data (BOM's). And how do you want to receive items at the locations they are planned to be issued from ?  This have to be done manually, all inbound advices have to be handled manually to get items to the locations they are going to be issued from.<br />
<br />
Some years of experience have learned me that it is better to use standard functionallity instead of making customizations. It's maybe better to change your bussiness.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 05:00</div></div><div class="posttext">We have switched to location and Lot Control in BaaN IV C4 and Discreet Manufacturing. However, we have some raw materials and other items which are Non-Lot items, when we reports Ops Complete, these Non Lot Items are not back Flushed.  Since when we check the session display Inventory transaction by item and warehouse nothing has come through compare to the Lot items. Now here what I have done for the Non Lot items:<br />
<br />
1. In the item Master, I have swtiched the Backf Flush Flags to &quot;Yes&quot; for them and the Repetitive Flag to &quot;NO&quot;<br />
<br />
2. In the SFC Parameters, I have set the Backflush Method to &quot;Automatic&quot; and the Backflush Goods by Out bound Pririty when using ILC to &quot;YES&quot;<br />
<br />
Any suggestions will be appreciated:cool:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We have baanIV4 and use backflushing without customisation in this area.  We have WH speciied in BOM and that is used by sfc when creating the estimated materials records that are backflushed. <br />
<br />
ie: wh specified in bom then only that wh is accessed for backflushing<br />
<br />
We use ilc, ltc and sfc in one company and use ilc process mfg in another company</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 04:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
&quot;We have WH speciied in BOM..&quot;<br />
-Which Warehouse are you referring ? is there a parameter in the warehouse which switch on?<br />
<br />
Exactly how do you backflush? Do you run a particular session or it happens when Report Ops complete?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 09:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We have the following setting in SFC parameters<br />
Backflush Method set to Automatically<br />
O/B Priority using ILC  = yes<br />
device ofr b/flush hours = a printer<br />
device for b/flush materials = a prnter<br />
<br />
We have the following Item Master settings<br />
b/flush Material =yes<br />
b/flush if material = yes<br />
b/flush hours  = yes<br />
These settings result in the production order having <br />
b/flush materilas = yes<br />
b/flush hours = yes<br />
<br />
We set warehouse from which to b/flush material in the BoM <br />
<br />
We use  Backflush materials and hours session tisfc0220m000 to b/flush overnight and also use generate out bound to clear any previously out of stock materials.<br />
<br />
We use report production orders complete session tisfc0505   to book in production progressively (we have automated product bookin)<br />
<br />
We have customised outbound session to select the oldest lot controlled materials as all our production  in the instance I have given notes for. (another two divisions use vanilla programs) <br />
<br />
Hope this gives you a lead <br />

There are a number of items that were set up as b/f = No.  It will not let me change through the baan gui, so I'm going to write a sql to make the change.  Are there any repercussions if I change these settings through the back door?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">23rd April 2003, 04:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Just go in to the GTM - ttaad4100 and table tiitm001 and change the flags(then press Ctlr Z to save.<br />
