<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baandude</div><div class="date">4th February 2004, 08:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the Alternate code systems/Item  to map teh part numbers used by each vendor, if the part is one that you produce and also purchase, you should insert a vendor in itm001 table, along with a purchase price, as well as setup BOM, routing, and all the usual methods.<br />
<br />
If the parts are sub-contracted, or are these actually processes that are subcontracted, you can set these up as cost items, and book PO using sub-contract order type.<br />
<br />
Also, you can use the Alt. Vendors List in Purchasing  / Misc, which lets you specify which vendors you want for each part.  baan allows you to choose an alternate vendor.<br />
