Setting for an item has routing of various operations and order method is Lot by Lot. For example demand is 2000pcs. Lot size for each planned order is 512. In order planning, system generated 4 planned orders. Each order has the same &quot;planned start date&quot; and &quot;planned finish date&quot;    <br />
<br />
In fact, there is only one machine. It can run one process for one order only at each time. <br />
<br />
By right, the first operation's &quot;Planned start date&quot; of 2nd order should be same as &quot;planned finish date&quot; of 1st order. This is the correct logic. <br />
<br />
Anyone has idea to do ? Please advise. Thanks.   <br />

<br />
As rightly mentioned in the previous post, the default EP works on Infinite Capacity. <br />
<br />
However the workaround solution for your case could be to use a Multi-level BOM structure.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
