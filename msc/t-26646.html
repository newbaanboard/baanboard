<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">15th March 2006, 03:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of all these peripherial systems that are being accumulated and which are not truly integrated with Baan nor necessarily an extension of its logic, it would be good to see some genuine attention and effort given to marketing the comprehensive ERP system which is providing the lucrative harvest of cash via its existing annual support contracts that is used to fund the boutique purchases. <br />
<br />
The problem is: if Baan was actively marketed then substantial ongoing investment would need to be made to ensure its survival.   We have heard nothing about software development since the initial announcement that Baan 6 was to be held back to ensure it quality. Then subsequently its release as LN 6.1 almost 2 years ago.</div></div><hr />
