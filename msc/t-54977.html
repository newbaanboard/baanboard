<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atul Khungar</div><div class="date">5th February 2009, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">We have the following scenario:<br />
Part P1 has Part C1 in its BOM.<br />
Part P2 also has Part C1 in its BOM.<br />
<br />
Part P1 needs to be manufactured in Warehouse W1 and Part P2 needs to be manufactured in Warehouse W2. I have one production order for P1 and another production order for P2. <br />
<br />
When I run Simulate Orders, I am looking for 2 planned purchase orders: one to be reecived in W1 and the other to be received in W2. <br />
<br />
<br />
How would I accomplish this? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
You can use cluster.In this case make 2 cluster s1 &amp; s2(tcemm1135m000).Attach warehouse W1 and W2 with cluster s1 and s2 respectively(tcemm1112m000).For part C1<br />
make 2 planning data with cluster s1 and s2 respectively.Part P1 and P2 will have cluster<br />
s1 and s2 in their planning data.Ithink this will solve your problem.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
