Would any of you guys/girls happen to know how I could get the actual operation costs by cost component the clean way? I found one way and that is to multiply the end item unit costs by the delivered quantity. But can I find a way to arrive at the numbers I want through the actual production hours logged instead? I think it's somehow cleaner because I can escape the rounding errors introduced in calculating end item unit costs. Thanks very much<br />

Finally solved it. I had to look outside Manufacturing module to find the suitable data. There are 2 options<br />
 Integration transaction tables tfgld410 and tfgld418, but they have rather complicated entries for finance illiterate guy like me<br />
 WIP table tcfin100. Simple and beautiful<br />
I now use the tcfin100 to get the report I wanted :)<br />
