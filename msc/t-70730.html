<br />
I have a situation. I need to store item inventory in multiple units. For example, the basic inventory unit of an item is in KG but at the time of production completion, there is a requirement to store produced values of that item in KGs as well as in meters and GSM. Conversion factor will not help in this case because the conversion rate is variable for every production batch for that item.<br />
LN does not provide 'Storage Units' like Baan IV.<br />
Can anyone provide help on this?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible in ERP LN to Store/Receive the Item in Different &quot;Storage Units&quot;. This can be different from the &quot;Inventory Unit&quot; of the Item.<br />
<br />
Note: The inventory is always counted in &quot;Inventory Unit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you need more details.</div></div><hr />

Thank you Sasikanth !!<br />
<br />
Inventory count &amp; valuation in 'inventory unit' is ok.<br />
Can you please explain me the process for receiving/storing the manufactured item in different inventory units?<br />
It would be really helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
