<br />
To process Direct Labor against a Production Order, you need to setup the following Master Data in the People package:<br />
<br />
- Labor Rate Codes and associate a Labor Rate (such as $14.00/hr) to each Labor Rate Code<br />
<br />
- Labor Types, such as REG for Regular, OVT for Overtime, DBL for Double Time<br />
<br />
- Working Time Schedule Codes, such as 001 - First Shift and their associated Start/Stop Times and Labor Types <br />
<br />
- Then setup your Employee - General with each employee's Labor Rate Code and Employee - People with each employee's Working Time Schedule Code<br />
<br />
Now you can process Direct Labor (Production Order Hours) using the standard LN Production Order Hours session or a third party Time and Attendance / Labor Reporting package ... we use RMCtime from Crossroads/RMC.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps ...<br />
