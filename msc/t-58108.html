<br />
The weekly variation in our sales schedules / customer orders is causing us a few headaches in respect of planning production. What is the best technique that can be used to acheive a smooth MPS Production Plan (ideally a constant weekly build)<br />
<br />
If we enter demand forecast or extra demand into Maintain MPS does this simply add to the customer orders to create more demand or is there a simple way of ignoring the customer orders.<br />
<br />

<br />
We basically want to try and smooth MPS wherever possible to give us a steady weekly build plan.<br />
<br />
If we can understand the session Maintain Master Produciton Schedule better and maybe intially update this manually.<br />
<br />
At the moment MPS is being injected by our Sales Schedules so is there any way to override this ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">19th April 2010, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">The demad forecast always get consumed by the sales order. The extra demand a sthe name implies is extra and is not consumed by demand forecast. If you want to say have a constant schedule and would like to have the sales orders/scehdule consuming demad forecast then yo should use backward and foward forecast consumption. E.g. say if the forecast is 100 and sales order is for 110, in the absene of consumption, system will generate production plan for 110, but say if you have foward consumption set up then it will try to get the forecat consumed from that period. Please, note that the MPS may appear to have a weekly or monthy bucket, but system does all the calcualtion at daily level. The calculation can be tricky, and sometimes takes effort to know what system generated a partucular result. But this is the solution that will resolve your issue.<br />
