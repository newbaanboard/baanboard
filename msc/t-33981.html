Is there a way for MRP to distinquish between commited forecast and non-commited forecast in the sales schedules ?<br />
Currently MRP will create PO's for all Sales Schedules demand, regardless of the status of the demand (e.g. immediate, planned, forecast etc.).<br />

You can enter the uncommitted sales forecast as sales quotation with success percentage as 5 % or 10 % and don't consider any sales quotations below say 20 % for MRP planning. If these uncommitted sales forecasts become committed forecasts, you can increase their percentages to say 75 % and later can convert them to sales orders thus reducing your order entry time. :) <br />
