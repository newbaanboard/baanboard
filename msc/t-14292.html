Doesn't the Baan text editor have a way to mark lines of text to print just on internal documents, or just external documents? I think it's the &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; characters, but I'm not sure. And if so, which is which? Any other notes on how this really works? <br />
<br />
I would assume that external documents would be sales orders and purchase orders, and virtually everything else would be considered internal documents (work orders, BOMs, pick lists, etc).<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. You'd expect this to be mentioned in the main help screens for text, but I can't find it.....<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">26th January 2004, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the response, this confirms what I thought I had seen, I just couldn't find it. This could be quite useful, I still wonder why they don't have it in a more generic text help screen somewhere. Oh, well, I guess that's our beloved Baan help.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm my supsicions on what constitutes internal vs external text?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">26th January 2004, 21:45</div></div><div class="posttext">In general, <br />
&lt; means Internal<br />
&gt; means External<br />
<br />
Keep in mind though that this is actually programmed into the report script, not an inherent part of Baan text.  If you are running a report that Baan has not programmed this logic into (minor report they do not expect external text to be on), then this logic to determine internal vs. external will not be in there.  Also, if you create custom reports you need to specifically code this in the report script for it to work.<br />
<br />
You can see the logic in just about any major external report script, it looks like this (as taken from Sales Order Ack. report script):<br />
<br />
<br />
field.tdsls040.txta:<br />
before.print:<br />
	validate.textline()<br />
<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
function validate.textline()<br />
{<br />
	if ( lattr.prline(1;1) = &quot;&gt;&quot; ) then<br />
		lattr.prline = lattr.prline(2)<br />
	else<br />
		if ( lattr.prline(1;1) = &quot;&lt;&quot; ) then<br />
			lattr.print = false<br />
		endif<br />
	endif<br />
}</div></div><hr />
