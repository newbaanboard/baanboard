<br />
I was craving to look for detail cost of manufactured item in BaanERP.  It is something like a BOM with all the components cost, but couldnt find such report.  What I can think of is the production cost report, but it is only available when there is a production order created.  Any other alternative?</div></div><hr />

I think your desires may be answered by the Cost report  &quot;ticpr2420m000&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a multi-level costed BOM.  It shows bom items and routing operartions together with the cost component codes and value<br />
<br />
Hope this is available to you<br />
