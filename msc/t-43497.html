<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">25th October 2007, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello - is there any way to set the standard cost price on a standard item manually?  Our finance area has some specific cost they want to put on some standard items and I don't see where they can do this.  It is a calculated field as far as I can tell.  i was able to get the cost they wanted by changing our Purchase Price Priority to Current Purchase Price then running the calc session.  Is there another way and would this way be recommended?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I think thats the best way you can do.<br />
<br />
Is this the additional cost or the whole standard cost?<br />
<br />
eg: item A consist of B(1 USD)  and C (2USD) ,A shoud be 3 USD.<br />
you want to change A = 4 USD?<br />
<br />
or you want to add 1,5 additional cost, so it would be 4,5?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">26th October 2007, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">This would be just the standard cost on 1 standard item.  I believe they are interested in just changing some of the purchased items so they do not have other components.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

Here you can put in any value and there is no need to worry about current/average/lastest purchase price which the finance group has little control.   The key is that in the defintion of the Cost Price Calculation Code ticpr1101m000 that the first priority be 'simultated purchase price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">30th October 2007, 21:59</div></div><div class="posttext">we could create another cost price calc code for the specific items that we want to control the prices for then set the 1st priority as simulated and change the cost price calc code on those items, Done!  Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">30th October 2007, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">If you created another cost price code, you would have to change the cost price parameter everytime you wanted to roll the items for that code, since only the calc code in the parameter will allow you to actually roll costs.<br />
<br />
I think you should be ok if you change your current active calc code to look at simulated first, then set up the priorities the way they are now.  If a simulated purch price is present, it will take that, otherwise it will keep looking.<br />
