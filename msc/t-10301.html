<br />
our production plant is owned by two companies. Every management wants to have inventory and financial reports. So it has been decided to work with 2 logistics and 2 financial companies. Of course we have common warehouse and equipment (workcenters, machines).<br />
<br />
The reason to work with 2 logistics companies is that the warehouse manager insists to have same warehouses for both companies. We are in the begining of implementing BaaN 5c here. In my opinion there is something wrong with the chosen schema - I can't imagine how we gonna share workcenters and equipment...<br />
<br />
I will appreciate any opinion from you.<br />

<br />
well, I understand your problem..<br />
To my opinion this is a typical multi finance / single logistic environment. Even if you set up multi logistic, how do you solve the problem with the warehouse which belongs to both financial companies? Does Baan 5.c handle that?<br />
Isn't it easier to set up single logistic and have some customized financial reports (if really necessary) than having this excessively complicated structure (at least to solve a single problem)?<br />
<br />
In every installation you have, especially in the beginning, you can solve about 70% of your problems. You should take care that these 70% are your key problems and not some 'nice to haves'. Beware of turning the Baan logic up side down!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">11th June 2003, 03:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had situations where a multi-financial or multi-logistical company had to &quot;share&quot; work centers.  Usually the work center involved was a specialized operation, such as painting, environmental chambers or some sort of testing.<br />
<br />
One solutions was to set up the work center as it's own &quot;company&quot;, and treat it as a sub-contract supplier to the other two (or more) companies.  We performed our capacity planning on the single workcenter company, with demand from its two customers.  Each of the logistic or financial companies were able to price and track based on their subcontractor costs.<br />
<br />
This is not a perfect solution, especiall if the work center shares inventory and labor with other workcenters.  However if theoperation is as specialized as it was in my cases, the labor and materials also tended to be specialized and therefore not too much trouble.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it seems the right solution is one logistic company and customized reports. I think this strategy is valid for most of the cases when BaaN functionality differs from the real business model. Reporting is the output of the system, isn't it? So changing reports is not going to affect the BaaN functionality at all.<br />
