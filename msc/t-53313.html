<br />
I was wondering if there was a quick way to see what sales order number is linked with the production order?<br />
<br />
Right now, i'm going backward from the production order and trying to match it with the first sales order i see. :eek:<br />
<br />
It's not always 100%.  <br />
<br />
The reason is that i'm printing a report of production order planning by machine and i want to show the sales order that the production order is for.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions from you would be helpfull.<br />
<br />

   The solution would depend on how production orders are created in your organization. Like for instance, do you create production orders for a batch of sales orders or per sales order or per sales order item.<br />
<br />
If you have implemented Project (pcs) then it would have been easier and straightforward to identify the sales order a particular production order is linked to (as the project number would be present in both sales order &amp; production order). <br />
<br />
If not (no project), then you could create a text group of 8 characters long and with each production order created you could enter the combination of sales order &amp; position number in this new textgroup text window to provide a link for your reports... (This is to be used when you create production orders per sales order line)<br />
Even though its a manual process of creating the link and is prone to data entry errors, its better than not having a link..<br />

As for we have STO (Standard to Order) environment for certain product and we don't want to go through the over head of implementing project. In our case implementing the project would have just added transactions overhead, without really giving us any benefit.<br />
<br />
Our customization creates the production order from sales order and then links both of them. When we try to ship the sales order, it will first complete the production order, issues the material and then processes the sales order. All these transaction we are doing via web, and our external users gives this info on a web page. In this process, system does alomost 15 transaction in tandem.<br />
