<br />
Fatal Error : Float exception in cprrp1210m000 during Simulate Order<br />
<br />
Understood that float reception error occured when something is divided by zero. However, I had check thru and do not found any item with order quantity multiple of in item ordering data as zero.<br />
<br />
I wonder where shall I check further in order to solve the said error during simulate order?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">25th January 2006, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a lot of dividing being done in this session. As soon as (possibly due to a programming bug) a value will contain 0 (for instance this could happen when a table field value is not available or simple is 0), you will get this error. The solution is either to make sure the required values are available, or to add a check on value 0. Do you have sources? Then you can easily debug and see. If not, you should give us more details at least; does this ALWAYS happen or only in some cases? Is it at a specific moment in the session, for instance after entering a certain value in a certain field? etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">atyeo5</div><div class="date">25th January 2006, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">TQ for your response.<br />
<br />
THis is the second time occurred after 3 years of using baan. The first round was found to be having 0 order qty multiple of in item ordering data. I am dunning simulate order once a week. last week was processed successfully.<br />
<br />
For this round my users are not able to recalled what they had done for the pass 1 week. What I thinking can be done is to check master data which is used in simulate order. What is your advice? Do you know which master data shall check besides item ordering data?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you trying to schedule / simulate a project schedule without allowing the amount of float time defined by the network plan?  Try reducing float time in the activity relationships to zero and rerun PRP.</div></div><hr />
