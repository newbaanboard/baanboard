<br />
I am having trouble understanding machine setups in baan 4c.<br />
<br />
ie.  I have 3 end products all using the same machine.<br />
<br />
In the routing for each product, do I use a machine qty. of .33, or do I use a qty. of 1.<br />
<br />
The products are not being run simutaneously.<br />
<br />
I am being told to use a qty of 1.  This is confusing me because I though that this would overstate my capital cost for the product.  When comparing my std capital cost for these 3 products to the actual, would it not be 3 x greater.<br />
<br />
If anyone could please help or provide any documentation, please do so.  This is driving me crazy.<br />
<br />
Thankyou</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pls record your Baan version in your user profile. Since I don't know your Baan version, I'll be speaking in terms of B5c.<br />
<br />
To arrive at the correct standard machine costs:<br />
 Define the average machine hourly costs correctly (as operation rates of the work centre/task the machine is connected to or as machine rate, depending on your parameter set up)<br />
 Define the correct production rate (production output speed) for each product<br />
 Define correctly the number of machines needed in the production of each product. If during certain production operation of an item only 1 machine is used (i.e. you don't have 2 or more concurrent machines running), then specify number of machine as 1<br />
If the steps above are done, then each product will have correct std machine cost, no matter how many products are using the same machine<br />
