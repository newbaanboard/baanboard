<br />
I'm working in ERP5c with the configurator and I'm trying to create a constraint before the input. Here i need to import the sales order number to search further on for some features.<br />
<br />
I do :<br />
<br />
string order global<br />
<br />
table ttdsls401<br />
<br />
import(&quot;tdsls401.orno&quot;,order)<br />
<br />
This field &quot;order&quot; is always empty. Seems that the import function doesn't bring anything. Could someone please help me by letting me know if there is in 5C an equivalent function to import the value of a table field?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance.</div></div><hr />

i did a little testing on your problem and have the following results:<br />
sure the import function works in 5c, but not on your special problem.<br />
It seems that import will only work on variables of the parent process.<br />
I think you want to import the order number while starting tipcf5120m000 from session tdsls4101s000.<br />
Your configurator script is started by tipcf5120m000 so the configurator session is the parent process of your script and tdsls4101s000 is the parent process to tipcf5120.<br />
I did a test whith the following construct:<br />
<br />
string order global<br />
get.var(get.pgrp(pid), &quot;tdsls401.orno&quot;,order)<br />
message(&quot;%s&quot;,order)<br />
 <br />
This worked for me because tdsls4100s000 is the 'starter' where the process group has the same number as the process and tipcf5120 and your script belongs to the same process group.<br />
with get.var you can get the variable from the specified process.<br />
<br />
But this only works for configuration from tdsls4101.<br />
What about configuration from tdsls1101s000 or even from tipcf5501m000 or tipcf5101s000?<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
