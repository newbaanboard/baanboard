<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">armiewei</div><div class="date">5th December 2002, 03:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, everybody<br />
I am using BaaN IVC4, and prepare to implement MPS in our comany. <br />
Previously we use MRP + sales forecast as our planning system for 2 years. Now as the historical data is plenty, we want to use MPS.<br />
Our company is a pure make to order company, Our main customer is about 40-50 big OEM plant. Our sales forecast is based on every customer's requirement next year. Our manufacture lead time is longer than customer order delivery time.<br />
So I decide make the plan item (family item) according to every individual customer , namely 40-50 family item. Chang the product's item type from MRP to MPS in item master. <br />
And in maintain planning bill of material. I set the percentage of our product's item against every family item.<br />
<br />
But the problem is when sales maintain sales budget in sales statistics module, they only know the customer name, but when we copy it to MPS, I have to manually point this customer name to plan item which means I have to repeat 40-50 times of copy sales budget to demand forecast. Does it be the right way to perform ? Is there any better solution to this scenario ?<br />
<br />
