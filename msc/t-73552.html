<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Georgia</div><div class="date">12th November 2020, 07:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Baan Board, I have a scenario where I want to apply a yield of 30% against Operation 7 of 9 in an item a routing.  MRP has generated a planned production order for qty 20 based on min order qty.  LN calculates (20*100)/30= 66.6667 as the qty planned output for Ops 1 through to 6, then qty planned output of 20 for Ops 7, 8 and 9.<br />
The problem is this is unit of an each which is also serialized.  We would never make 66.6667 eaches.  Plus it skews the estimated materials and they are in decimals as well!  I expected a rounding rule to be applied in the background to make 67 the qty planned output.<br />
Has anyone encountered this issue and if so how did you overcome it?</div></div><hr />

This was 20 years ago and we went round and round on each before we settled on .0001.  I am not recommending you make this change but it is something you could look at in a test system.  Of course since on LN  it probably has a cleaner solution.</div></div><hr />
