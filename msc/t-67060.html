<br />
I'm performing some test with the Generate Order Planning session since we want to implement the MRP in our organization.<br />
<br />
I have an Item defined with his BOM and routing.  I have created a Special Demand for that item for a few period.  In the Item General - Ordering data, I did specified a Safety Stock of 2,000 units.  <br />
Order Policy : Anonymous<br />
Order System : Planned<br />
Order Method : Lot for Lot<br />
<br />
When I run the Generate Order Planning session (cprrp1210m000) with the following:<br />
- Also Generate Item Master Plan<br />
- Online Update Item Master Plan<br />
- Update Resource Masterplan<br />
I can see the demand reflected and planned production order generated but it only covers my Special Demand.  There's nothing to cover my safety stock of 2,000 that I specified.<br />
<br />
Is there anything that I'm missing?<br />
Thank you in advance!<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
D.</div></div><hr />

That should fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darsidious</div><div class="date">7th November 2014, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Still didn't generate a Planned Production Order to cover the safety stock.<br />
<br />
However, I noticed that if I uncheck the &quot;Maintain Master Plan&quot; for that item in the &quot;Item - General -&gt; Planning Data&quot; session and regenerate the Item Order Plan, then I do have a Planned Order generated to cover my Safety Stock.<br />
<br />
Any idea why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">7th November 2014, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, that makes sense.  If the item is set up with master planning, then the safety stock would have shown on the item master plan the next time the scenario was initialised.  It should then have shown on the order plan if the master planning is an input to order planning.<br />
<br />
By unchecking the 'also generate item master plan' box, you have taken master planning out of the equation entirely, so order planning sees the safety stock unconditionally</div></div><hr />
