<br />
I have a problem with the Production Order. When we prepare the production order, due to wrong item code entered and it was released. I delete the same production order, and change in the first free numbers, but when i make new production order its sr. no. was the next from the deleted production order. <br />
<br />
I check the all SFC tables but not see any data related to the deleted Production order.<br />
<br />
Please give solution for maintaing the new production order at the same serial number. Is it possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

Since the production orders were released, i bet you must have used the GTM to delete the production orders, right?<br />
<br />
Was the production order number that important to risk using such a maneuver?<br />
