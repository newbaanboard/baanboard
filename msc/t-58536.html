<br />
Anyhow I have lost my notes on updating the company calendar in baan, it has been over two years since I last messed around with the calendars and cannot remember how to get the results that I want.<br />
<br />
What I am looking to accomplish is changing the company calendar to reflect the holidays in 2010 and 2011.<br />
<br />
I would greatly appricaiate a simple write up on how to change a normal workday to a holiday so that baan does not plan capacity on days nobody is here.<br />
<br />
oh, and I am using Baan 5c if it matters<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FoxxyPlanner</div><div class="date">15th June 2010, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, Thanks for replying but I actually figured it out myself, here are my instructions. I am going to attempt to attach the word document.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Process of Adding Holidays to Company Calendar<br />
<br />
<br />
1.	Start by opening the “Standard Calendar Template”<br />
 <br />
<br />
2.	The Standard Calendar Template should look like the following images. One image for each day of the week (Sunday-Saturday).<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
3.	Go back to Menu Browser and Open “Calendar Lines”<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
4.	Use the binoculars to find the Company Calendar if it is not already displayed<br />
5.	Find the day(s) that you want to update.<br />
6.	Select “New”  <br />
7.	Enter the date that you are updating<br />
 <br />
<br />
8.	As you can see in the picture below I entered 12/28/2010 and set the Availability Type to “HOLIDY”, leave Time Interval Type blank.<br />
 <br />
9.	Next select the other two lines (Sequence Number 1 &amp; 2 for 12/28/2010) and hit “Delete”. A prompt will pop up, select “Yes”.<br />
 <br />
10.	Your screen should now look like the image below.<br />
 <br />
11.	Repeat Steps 6-9 until all updates are completed. Hit Save.<br />
12.	Select Specific →Refresh Derived from Lines<br />
 <br />
13.	Once Refreshing is complete select Specific →Update Actual Calendar<br />
 <br />
14.	Within the “Update Actual Calendar” Session select “Company” then tab so that it appears in both text boxes. Make sure the “Process Child Calendars” Check box is not selected (Has no check mark) as you will see in the image below.<br />
  <br />
15.	Hit “Update” then “Continue”<br />
16.	Finished, the Company Calendar has now been updated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Updating Work Centers to Reflect Company Calendar Changes<br />
<br />
1.	Start by grouping all work centers by Time Interval Type. This is done so that you do not have to constantly change the Standard Calendar Template for each work center.<br />
2.	Open the “Standard Calendar Template” Session<br />
3.	Select Monday as shown below, then select the appropriate “Time Interval Type”. In this example I have selected “1”, which equals one 8 hour shift.<br />
 <br />
4.	Follow Step 3 for Tuesday thru Friday, you should never have to change Saturday and Sunday<br />
5.	The “Standard Calendar Template” should now look like the image below, take note that the template for work centers should only have one line unlike the way the Company Calendar was set up with 2 lines one with no “Availability Type” and one with.<br />
  <br />
6.	After the Time Interval Type has been changed for all of the WORKDY’s close the template session.<br />
7.	Now open “Calendar Code” session, select the work center you want to update, choose Specific →Calendar Lines<br />
 <br />
8.	Your screen should now look like the image below, next choose Specific →Refresh Derived from Lines<br />
 <br />
9.	After refreshing is complete select Specific →Update Actual Calendar<br />
 <br />
10. Once the “Update Actual Calendar” Session opens choose the work center that you want to update, make sure the work center name is in both text boxes as shown in the image below. Also make sure there is no check mark in the box called “Process Child Calendars<br />
 <br />
11.	Choose “Update”, then “Continue” on the next pop-up<br />
12.	Finished, you have now updated the Calendar for one work center.</div></div><hr />
