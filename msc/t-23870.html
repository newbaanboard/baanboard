<br />
I need some guidance for the below scenario. This is in Baan Vc.<br />
<br />
I have a Production Order, 1.. with 10 pieces on it.<br />
At some operation I send it out for subcontracting. (Created a Purchase Order and the respective data is linked in the tdpur451 &amp; tdpur402 tables).<br />
<br />
Only 4 pieces came back from subcontracting.<br />
When I recieve the 4 pieces from subcontracting, since its a partial, there is a back order created for that Pur ord line. A new sequence is created in the tdpur402 table. (session tisfc2410m000, helps a bit).<br />
<br />
At this time, We create a brand new production order of 6 pieces, for the same item on Production Order 1. Then, We transfer 6/10th of material, labor and costs to the new prod order , # 2. All Quantities on the Order # 1 are adjusted to 4, including the planning. Estimated Quantities &amp; the Planned Inv Qty is also adjusted. So.. at this point... the Order # 1, which started with 10 pieces... looks like it started with 4 pieces to begin with.<br />
(The reason why we are doing this process of splitting... we'll get to that later :) )<br />
<br />
Since, from the qty standpoint... I've received 4 from subcontracting and satisfied this order... this order can move on. The new order # 2, will wait till we receive the balance material of 6. The problem is, since the Purchase order is linked to the Prod Order #1, I cannot receive these subcontracted materials against the production order #2. <br />
IF.. ahem  :D  , I change the Production Order number in the tdpur402 table, thru GTM, from 1 to 2 (old to new)...   I can receive the balance Qty for the new production order. The system lets me do this.  (I can close the order # 1 without any errors as well).<br />
<br />
My concern is... Am I missing any other tables (in wh/td/ti) or am I messing up any data.<br />
Please advice. Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

Logisticwise you should be ok, except one thing: production order #2 will create a separate purchase order anyway (the operation indicates subcontracting) or do you modify the routing in this case?<br />
Financewise I'm not sure if those guys will hate or love you for this workaround  :D .<br />
<br />
By the way: you forgot to mention why you don't use the old production order until it is fulfilled completely - I'm just curiuos..<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

I am not sure what will happen to any variances. Variances are booked only when order is complete, you may want to check that.<br />

Hmm, it seems to be a good work around, although I usually hate going through GTM to fix things. Very creative, Little John<br />
