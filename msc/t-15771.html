Anyone have a manual that describes how to implement the Project module in Baan? I´m searching specifically for Baan IVc2.<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately the implementation manuals you are looking for do not exist but it would be a great help if you can let us know what you are trying to do with BAAN Project.<br />
I am sure we will be able able help you further.<br />
<br />
Are you planning to use BAAN Project or the project module (tipcs) in BAAN Manufacturing?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

In my company we want to sell a rebuild motor. The motor components includes, material (purchased, inventariable) and hours of work (cost, not-inventariable), and other items, like travels, cranes, etc.<br />
<br />
I think project can help me on this, but, is that the correct way? exist any simple way to do that?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not know if BAAN IV Project will be the best solution for you here as you have to also deal with invoicing, COGS and product delivery issues.<br />
BAAN V will be better suited for that. <br />
<br />
Perhaps it may be better to sell rebuild engines through a service order in BAAN IV as you can also book and bill hours, costs of cranes and the like.<br />
If I were you I would take a closer look at BAAN IV Service in combination with a PCS project. In tipcs you can determine a routing for rebuilding the engine and then sell, deliver and invoice this on the service order. At the same time you can capture all the different costs for labor, subcontracting, etc. on the service order and have good and simple visibility regarding the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).<br />
These advantages will not be available if you use BAAN IV Project for your purpose.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you are going to decide.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 11:40</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to consider is the level of detail you require in  finance. Look at the financial integration options; for Service these are fairly simple and limited, PCS and certainly TP are more flexible in terms of finance integration, but then TP is also more complex. I'd say if you primarily want to manage the production process then use PCS, if you primarily want to manage a project budget and actual cost, then consider TP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to all for your responses, all are important to me!<br />
Edwin, AWondergem<br />
Can you explain me more about PCS project? I didn´t recall on my Baan courses!<br />
By the other hand, actually, we are using the service module to invoicing the rebuild engine. But as well said AWondergem, there are some issues about the financial integrations that we want to control and the service module is not providing. Perhaps with PCS we will have the detail level that we want!<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm no PCS expert, so I cannot give you much help here. Basically, PCS projects are used together with manufacturing to produce customised items, using a customised BOM and Routing. You then use a production order to make that customised item. <br />
<br />
Cost (time, materials, surcharges) are recorded against the production order and passed on to the PCS project. I don't know about service orders, but in the case of sales orders (and TP) the total cost for the customised item is passed on as one lump sum, so you are unlikely to get a breakdown of the cost from within the service order.<br />
<br />
The only advice I can give you is to test the various options to see if they give you the information you need. <br />
<br />
I could give you some help with Baan Projects, but it doesn't sound like that's the tool for the job in this case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">10th January 2005, 23:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Projects may be just the answer for you. You create a custom, item, bill and routing.  You then can tract actual costs for that project.  SFC orders and POs are attached directly to the project.  Requirements for standard items are picked up in MRP.  There are some more steps in completing projects but you will have more control.  Usually Baan taught the Project class separate and you may not have opted for that class at the time.  If you would like a customized class to fit your requirements please let me know and we can arrange.  jmiller@rmcis.com</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please clarify whether you mean a tipcs project (in BAAN IV Manufacturing) or a tppdm project (in BAAN IV Project) when you say &quot;project&quot;?<br />
The implications are rather big. Especially in BAAN IV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">11th January 2005, 00:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that project PCS is the answer for this implementation.  Project TP is a little overboard I think for this application.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot and I agree with you here.<br />
In that case this thread has to be moved to the Manufacturing forum on BaanBoard.<br />
