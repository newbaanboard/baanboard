<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
    The item type places the item in a group of items, so that certain<br />
    functions of the package will only apply to that item.<br />
<br />
    The item type, together with the item group, here only serves to<br />
    record default item data.<br />
<br />
    You can choose from the following item types:<br />
<br />
    Purchased<br />
    Items of this type may also be made in-house. In that case, it will not<br />
    be possible to link a bill of material or a routing sheet to the<br />
    relevant item. This kind of item is used throughout the package. The<br />
    need for purchase items may arise from the following modules:<br />
    - Material Requirements Planning (MRP)<br />
    - Master Production Scheduling (MPS)<br />
    - Project Control (PCS)<br />
    - Inventory Control (INV)<br />
<br />
    This need is converted into planned purchase orders.<br />
<br />
    Manufactured<br />
    Items of this type may be manufactured end products and subassemblies,<br />
    and even purchased items. Both bills of material and operations can be<br />
    recorded for manufactured items. A manufactured item can be used<br />
    throughout the package. The need for manufactured items may originate<br />
    from the following modules:<br />
    - Material Requirements Planning (MRP)<br />
    - Master Production Scheduling (MPS)<br />
    - Project Control (PCS)<br />
    - Repetitive Manufacturing (RPT)<br />
    - Inventory Control (INV)<br />
<br />
    This need is converted into planned production orders.<br />
<br />
    Generic<br />
    Items of this type can be used in the module &quot;Product Configuration<br />
    (PCF)&quot;. A generic item is not a real item but a collective term for a<br />
    large number of product variants. So a product variant is a derivative of<br />
    a generic item. Consequently, it is not possible to purchase, produce<br />
    and deliver generic items for a sales order. Yet if you do want to<br />
    sell a variant of a generic item, the system will ask you to define<br />
    the item's options, so that a product variant can be configured.<br />
    Eventually, the relevant generic item will be delivered as a<br />
    customized item for the sales order in question.<br />
    The following characters are not allowed for generic item codes:<br />
    % ' &quot; ^ \ ! @ # $ &amp; * ( ) | / ; ~ ` ? { } [ ] &lt; &gt;<br />
<br />
    The reason for this is that object files generated for constraints in<br />
    the module &quot;Product Configuration&quot; (PCF) may not contain these characters.<br />
    Items of this type can not be process items.<br />
<br />
    Cost<br />
    Items of this type are administrative items, which cannot be held in<br />
    inventory. Cost items are used to post extra costs to an order<br />
    separately. Extra costs are, for example, accounting expenses, clearance<br />
    charges, cost of design, and freight expenses. Cost items are only used<br />
    in the following modules:<br />
    - Purchase Control (PUR)<br />
<br />
<br />
    - Sales Control (SLS)<br />
    - BAAN Service Master Data<br />
    - Formula Management (FRM)<br />
    - Production Management (PMG)<br />
<br />
    Service<br />
    Items of this type are administrative items, which cannot be held in<br />
    inventory either. Service items are used to post service-related costs.<br />
    Services are, for example: costs of maintenance and repairs. Just as<br />
    cost items, service items are only used in the following modules:<br />
    - Purchase Control (PUR)<br />
    - Sales Control (SLS)<br />
    - BAAN Service Master Data<br />
<br />
    In these modules cost and service items are:<br />
    - normally included in invoices (excluding item codes and quantities);<br />
    - reported back as ordinary items;<br />
    - included in the late payment surcharge base;<br />
    - included in the order discount base.<br />
<br />
    In the module &quot;Sales Control (SLS)&quot; cost and service items:<br />
    - are normally posted via the detailed purchases/sales invoiced<br />
    - are not posted separately via the invoice analysis.<br />
<br />
    Subcontracting<br />
    Items of this type also belong to the administrative items. These<br />
    items are non-physical items which are used to record subcontracting<br />
    costs. So the subcontracting item is not the item whose operation is<br />
    subcontracted. The costs posted to the subcontracting item will also<br />
    be visible as operation costs in the cost price.<br />
<br />
    Subcontracting items are used in the modules:<br />
    - Shop Floor Control (SFC) for subcontracting operations;<br />
    - Purchase Control (PUR) for &quot;buying&quot; subcontracted operations.<br />
<br />
    In principle, it is possible to define a separate subcontracting item<br />
    for any imaginable subcontracted operation. You can also define a<br />
    general subcontracting item, to which all subcontracting costs will be<br />
    posted.<br />
<br />
    Once you have assigned an item type to the item in question, some<br />
    combinations of item data are or are not be allowed (see the table<br />
    below).<br />
<br />
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+<br />
    |Item Type     -&gt;|Purch./Man. Part|Generic |Cost |Service | Subcontr|<br />
    |----------------+----------------+--------+--------------+---------|<br />
    |Cost price comp.|                |        |              |         |<br />
    |with cost type  |    material    |material|   general    | operat. |<br />
    |----------------+----------------+--------+--------------+---------|<br />
    |Order policy  -&gt;|      free      |to order|   anonymous  |anonymous|<br />
    |----------------+----------------+--------+--------------+---------|<br />
    |Order system  -&gt;|      free      |FAS/MPS/|   manually   | manually|<br />
    |                |                |MRP     |              |         |<br />
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+<br />
<br />
    As soon as you choose a wrong combination, the system will respond<br />
    with an error message.<br />
<br />
    Mandatory Input     : Yes<br />
