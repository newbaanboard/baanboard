<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mprakash</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone explain me what is reference type in the product variant (tipcf5501m000 in Baan5c). As per baan help it can carry 5 values sales quotation, sales order, budget, project and standard variant.<br />
<br />
I like to know under what situation reference type is filled as sales order and sales quotation<br />
<br />
I created a quotaion. selected a generic item in the sales quotaiton line and then ran the session generate budget structure for the sales quotation session. System generated the customised part in the sales quotation line and new product variant is created. when I checked the reference type it is filled with Budget. If so in what situation i can get the value for this field as sales quotation?<br />
<br />
Please clarify...we have many sales quotation lines in our live company with reference type filled as sales quotation and we dont know how it has happened...</div></div><hr />

<br />
When first inserting a sales order line and entering a generic item on the item field (tdsls041.item) the question &quot;Define product options immediately?&quot; is asked. After saying &quot;Yes&quot;, and exiting the product configurator a product variant has been created with the reference option as &quot;Sales Order&quot;, and the reference order as the sales order.  Now, if a project structure is created for the sales order the reference option will change to &quot;Project&quot;, and the reference order as the project.  Exactly the same happens for sales quotations and budgets.</div></div><hr />

The logic work similar in Baan5. another thing I noticed was that when we regenerate the structure(Project or budget) for the variant, the reference type again changes back to sales order (quotation)...which I feel might be a bug and this issue is now loged with Baan support..</div></div><hr />
