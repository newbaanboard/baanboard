<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radhagkrishna</div><div class="date">11th September 2008, 08:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, if you want to short close the Production Order first change the status to completed by using report orders completed. After that you close the prouction order. Then system will automatically cancel the warehouse order for the remaining quantity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pinkey</div><div class="date">11th September 2008, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">but in report orders completed,status is only to be completed .<br />
tht also it is not allowing &amp; giving the attached error</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radhagkrishna</div><div class="date">12th September 2008, 07:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
as per the error message i understood that you are trying to cancel the production order. Cancelling the order is different from short closing. In report orders completed session your status 'To be completed' indicates that inspection is pending in the warehouse. First approve the inspection order for 12 meters. Then your status will be changed to Completed. Then close the production order. Don't cancel it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">12th September 2008, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe there are pending Inbound/Outbound lines to be transacted and that is when you get status as To Be Completed. <br />
<br />
If you want to short-close, you want to complete part of Production order then only deliver that much and Complete the order; I dont think you can cancel production order which has status Active</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pinkey</div><div class="date">15th September 2008, 13:50</div></div><div class="posttext">i am not trying to cancel the production order.<br />
I want to short close i.e receiving only 12 out of 36 ordered.<br />
But while doing-report orders completed-Its showing only -to be completed.<br />
there is no inspection orderline also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">15th September 2008, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">So, what is the order status now?<br />
<br />
If it is 'To be Completed', see if there are any inbound line that does not have a confirmed receipt or any outbound line that has status which is not 'Shipped'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pinkey</div><div class="date">16th September 2008, 08:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes there r oubound line pending which i dont want to complete.as i want to short close it.Its is also not allowing me to change -to be completed.<br />
The error u can find in the attachment.Why 8 is coming there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jayverma25</div><div class="date">20th September 2008, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Pl Check If 8 qty is thr in Production warehouse order, If it is thr then make it zero Or process (from specific) it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yshokeen</div><div class="date">21st September 2008, 10:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pinkey<br />
<br />
In open inboud line plz confirm only 12 qty as u completed and then chk ur ur order status its change to completed, after that u can short close ur order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">22nd September 2008, 08:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the following:<br />
1. What is the delivered qty (reported complete) for this order<br />
2. What ss the status of the production order<br />
<br />
If the delivered qty is 0, then report 12 as completed qty with the status set to 'to be completed' and save the record. If you get the same error, then don't change the status just report the qty and check if the same error comes again.<br />
<br />
If the delivered qty is already updated as 12, then report the completed qty as 0 and try changing the status to 'to be completed'.<br />
<br />
BTW is there any customization on this session, this error message doesn't look like a standard message?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pinkey</div><div class="date">23rd September 2008, 07:53</div></div><div class="posttext">finally i completed the production order only when i hav done inbound line of complete 36 qty.<br />
Thanks to all.</div></div><hr />
