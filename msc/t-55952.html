<br />
I have a production order for an item of 20 qty. Production order had 2 operations . Operation 1 was OK &amp; it has been reported complete.<br />
Now during operation 2 -15 finished products were manufactured &amp; then machine broke down. It was decided to subcontract rest 5 items . Operation 2 was changed to Subcontracting operations &amp; completed.<br />
<br />
Now issue is that I want to maintain hours for operation 2 for earlier 15 units. System is not allowing as the operation is subcontracting right now. I don't want to post it against opeartion 10. <br />
Now I don't know how to post  hours accounting:confused:</div></div><hr />

You cannot upload hrs for subcontracting work centre.While reporting hrs for operation 20 , change the workcentre in hours accounting session, u will be able to record.<br />
