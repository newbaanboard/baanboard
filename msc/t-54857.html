<br />
So first you should check the warehouse on the inbound order line, if this matches the warehouse in which the inventory is updated then there is no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bond007</div><div class="date">19th February 2009, 08:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem has been solved now<br />
<br />
After release production Order, warehouse has been changed to FG1<br />
<br />
But in the warehouse order which was showing warehoue FG which is defaulted from item master data.<br />
<br />
Therefore after posting inventory which is going up in the warehouse FG</div></div><hr />
