Having said that, we have some items that could have different manufacturing structures, what is the best method (if any) for handling this situation in Baan ? We have found several workarounds, but since this is IMO not a strange situation at all, I was wondering how are you solving this ? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Quantities aside, the same manufactured item may have different BOMs. <br />
A simple example would be : item A manufactured with item B+C+D, but we could have the situation where item F is a substitute of C+D.<br />

   How about using Projects (pcs). A customized item of a standard item can have a different BOM, depending on the requirement. So in all the standard would remain as A = B+C+D, while the customized variant of the same item would be A1 = B+F<br />

Did you check out Unit Effectivity ? This should do the job pretty well. The draw back: The item need to be lot controlled (which is quite logical in this case).<br />
