<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">25th July 2012, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a forecast for a Family of items of say 100 units/period.  The Family item has a synthetic breakdown and is disaggregated into a number of top-level items for Order planning.<br />
<br />
Sales orders are received that are not in the synthetic.  So there is no forecast to be absorbed.  So the customer will be in a position where they have a total requirement for the Family of perhaps 110 units – the original forecast plus orders for items that were not included.  Thus capacity and materials planning will be over-planned to some degree.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else come across this problem, and ideally have a solution/workaround?<br />
<br />
Cheers, Andy</div></div><hr />
