Using paint on practically all manufacturing lines with a single item number.  Item is represented on BOM with a unit of measure of gallons.  Due to inaccurate production line inventory the purchasing of the paint is currently performed manually using information provided from warehouse personnel.<br />
<br />
My Idea:<br />
Setup 3 additional item numbers representing 5 gallon bucket, 50 gallon drum and 280 gallon pallet.  Utilize SIC and incorporate the re-order point based on the current logic of the warehouse representatives.  Set all 3 items as alternates for the current item number on the BOM.<br />
<br />
Concern:<br />
Possibility of a better solution for the situation.  Having not utilized alternate items I'm concerned how it will appear to the schedulers.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Would like to know if this solution is sound and/or if there's a better way to address this issue?  Please note that I'm confident the company will not be interested in changing the current BOMs so the solution must allow for the current BOM setup to remain unaltered.</div></div><hr />
