No matter what we try the estimated qty actual qty and to issue by whse qty do not reflect what we are asking the system to do. We do this many times and it's fine. it's only certain times when it doesn't. Any ideas on what makes each time different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quelle</div><div class="date">20th January 2009, 05:05</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, <br />
can you explain, what are u asking the system to do?<br />
As far as i know,in LN. est qty is read from the Bill of material from the item, the actual qty is the material qty which u has issued, and to issue by warehouse is appear when you have issue the material, but havent process it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davisado</div><div class="date">21st January 2009, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">The estimated qty for the order is 1. The actual qty issued to the order by the user was 26. When I try to unissue the qty of 26, I enter -26 in the to issue field. When I Init. Inv. the results end up where the actual qty remain 26 and the -26 are now to ready to be processed. I'm trying to make the actual qty 0 (see attachment)</div></div><hr />

Maybe u can check in Inbound Order LIne (in FP3 : whinh2110m000),<br />
Find the production order number, then you check the status.<br />
Is it still open, to be inspected, etc..<br />
You can continue the process until the status is put away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
U r using which version of baan, in LN i know the solution.<br />
once u issued the material in the production order, and after that you want actual qty is zero. than put -26 in to to be issue warehouse and initiate.<br />
this will solve your problem.<br />
