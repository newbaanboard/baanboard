<br />
I want to implement supply chain sales environment for an automotive supplier. <br />
May any body help me on the ssc (Supply Chain Sales Schedules) functionality, how it works, what are the optional and mandatory sessions, what are the procedures. <br />
Also, I would like to know how planning engines take into account this functionality?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

Or are you the customer and want to create purchase schedules for you supplier?<br />
<br />
This is the procedure if you are a supplier wanting to enter sales schedules received from your customer. <br />
<br />
You need to first enter a first free number for the contract series. Next you need a customer and delivery address in Common data. Once this is in place then you can enter a supply chain sales contract. Once that is in place, you can now enter a sales schedule. You will need to set up the schedule series numbers as well as the authorization codes. <br />
<br />
If you are using MPS, you can generate the item and the schedule requirements will appear on the customer order line. <br />
<br />
You will need to create supply chain shipments in order to reduce the schedule amounts. (See Planned Shipments).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am the supplier and will receive schedules from my customers.<br />
My problem is in that step. I can not generate a sales order for the planned delivery. May you send me your ssc parameters session screenshot and the session codes you use for the ssc procedures.<br />
If I understood correct, I have to implement MPS for taking into account the reqirements of the sales schedules. So the end product should be an MPS item. Is this the only way that I can plan the requirements of sales schedules?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your interest and feed back.<br />

How are you now purchasing materials for your current orders?<br />
<br />
