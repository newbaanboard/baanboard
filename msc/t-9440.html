<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">descartes</div><div class="date">31st March 2003, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if someone could point me to a site that lists the different transactions/sessions executed from the SFC system. Specifically, I am trying to identify the different options for issuing material to a production order. I am working with a customer on implementing a consignment inventory program and in the process, found out that they are performing manual entry of each part number and quantity being issued to the production orders. They are not aware of a way to execute the issue by exception.... i.e. have the system pull-up all of the information for a complete issue and then allow override of quantities being issued short. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Pls fill in your Baan, DB, and OS version in your user profile<br />

I'll be talking in terms of 5.0c. If all materials for an order are always issued in one go, then you can go to Material to Issue for Production Orders, choose to Transfer Subsequent Delivery to Issue, then perform Initiate Inventory Issue . This will instruct BaanERP to prepare the issue of all the remaining production materials for the production order. If some materials are found short, then record a negative issue for those materials to account for this matter. This will work well with the patch for 5.0c that allows SFC to correct the production material transaction in INH, i.e. update the SFC with the latest patch<br />
