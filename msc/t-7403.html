1.where can I find the field so-called &quot;production lead time&quot;?<br />
2.When I transfered a planned prodution order, a error message shown as:<br />
	Operations are not Planned,May be Operation 20 of Item N500 is not within the resource's operation storage horizon.<br />
<br />
can you tell me the reason?And how to solve it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddy G</div><div class="date">29th October 2002, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Production Leadtime is in TI IPD - Items Production Data - 2nd Tab, called Order Lead Time.<br />
This will only be used for offsetting production order dates if there are no operations. (no routing).<br />
<br />
Your 2nd question:<br />
During the transfer the network routing is built up again from routing operations.<br />
After that it checks if the number of planned operations (present in EP for this PO) is the same as in the newly built operation network.<br />
If not, this error comes up.<br />
I'll come back on what this can be caused by.<br />

Production lead time is either calculated according to to routing of the item (setup time, production rate, waiting time) or - if you don't have any routing - the value in the item data (order lead time). <br />
The error message you get indicates a missing company or workcenter calendar.<br />

<br />
In B5c, you can have a look at prod lead time per operation on MPS, MRP, and SFC side quite easily. For MRP side, look at Capacity use by planned order. For SFC side, look at Estimated vs actual hours. All these will tell you which operation require how many hours.<br />
<br />
I'm not so familiar with mfg on B4 though, so when I looked for similar sessions in B4c4 CRP and SFC I couldn't find it. Maybe someone else can help :) ?<br />

In addition to the comments of the others:<br />
<br />
The &quot;resource's storage horizon&quot; you can find on the Resource in EP. The storage horizon is there for reason of performance.<br />
Planned operations will only be saved within the time fence of that 'storage horizon'. So it is important to have enough horizon to get the operation stored.<br />
For critical workcenters capacity is important and you typically have a long horizon.<br />
Orders can only be transferred if all operations are present.<br />
<br />
So in your case maybe indeed the horizon is too short for one or more operations (resources).<br />
