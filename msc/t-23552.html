<br />
We have released the production order, and out of 15 operation, 4  number of  operation have been completed. Now due to modification we need to cancel the production order. If we are using standard session to cancel the production order, it is giving message  Already Quantity reported as completed or rejected at operations<br />
<br />
How to cancel this production order? Any Way other than backend.<br />
<br />

<br />
You cannot cancel the order because there has been work done and general ledger entries posted.  What needs to be done now is for the oder to be &quot;closed&quot; and costed.   <br />

<br />
To solve the problem We did the following since operation 10 -140 has been completed. so we have rejected planned qty for operation 150 and completed, 160 &amp; 170 just completed with zero. and then completed the production order with 0 (zero) quantity.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pergerp</div><div class="date">29th March 2005, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">you could write back completed quantity by operations to zero, at operations 10-140, and report all qty as rejects at op. 10. <br />
(You should delete hours/materials from op. 10, or indert an other operation, e.g. op. 5 with zero hours and materials, and report rejects at this operation)<br />
<br />
As a good solution, you could move back every issued materials and hours to zero.<br />
<br />
It is not possible to cancel &quot;Active&quot; orders but always possible to report to &quot;Completed&quot; status with zero balance. (with zero completed qty and zero hours and materials)<br />
<br />
You can perform this recall during &quot;Active&quot; status. After completion, you could write back hours and materials only manually because not possible to access &quot;Report Operations...&quot; session.</div></div><hr />
