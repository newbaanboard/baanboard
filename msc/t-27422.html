<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd June 2006, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just wondering if someone new why when you complete a production order the production date, earliest finish date and latest finish dates can change on the production planning?  In test I completed a couple of orders and the dates changed - I tried with fixed planning set to yes and no, but the dates changed anyway.  I was just wondering why these dates change?<br />
<br />
The reason for the question is that I developed a report for a user based off these dates.  Management is trying to find where certain orders are running into problems - which workcenter, etc.  So we use these dates to compare when time was first charged and the date the operation was completed to see if there was an issue.</div></div><hr />

It's got something to do with cost accounting. When releasing production order (or printing document or creating order, depending on parameter), BaanERP will freeze the estimated production cost, using the ordered quantity to arrive at a dollar amount of it. When a production order is declared completed and no more production activity can take place, BaanERP will have to update this estimated cost using the actual produced quantity instead to arrive at a dollar amount of it. To do this, BaanERP update the estimated material and estimated hours (thus changing dates of operations)<br />

<br />
This does not make sense to me.  First in Baan IV when we complete a production order the users can still charge time or issue material.  They are not suppose to but they do in some cases.  We are not closing production orders just yet.  I would expect the planning dates to stay the same - why replan a completed order?  Yeah - probably has something to do with finance, but I would expect the hours, cost, etc. to come from other tables.<br />
<br />
As it stands my report is only valid until the complete the order.  So they have to stay on top of things.  Not really what they wanted, but good enough for now.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's a pain. They should store the &quot;before correction&quot; cost estimates somewhere instead of overwriting them<br />
