<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">therese</div><div class="date">1st July 2002, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way in Baan to link the Sales Order to Production Order? The user will not be allowed to maintain production order unless there is a sales order linked to it.  This scenario is applicable to a certain customer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">1st July 2002, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way of doing this is via projects.<br />
Maintaining the production order is possible at all times but you would get an exception/warning message in the planning module if more is produced than needed. More orders would be generated in planning if less is produced than needed on sales order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">6th October 2004, 21:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just looking for some information on this issue and came across this posting.  I bit old but I thought I would add something.  We've programmed an actual cost report based on the fact that Baan did not have a link between Manufacturing and sales.  We've created an artificial link using item and date using production order, sales deliveries, and inventory adjustments tables.  I then match production order to sales orders by item and delivery date.  This is how we've acheived a &quot;link&quot; to show that this production order produced parts that went to this sales order or customer.<br />
<br />
It was brought to my attention today that there actually is a link and I wondered if anyone else out there has ever gone this way to actually link the production orders with sales orders.  There is a session called Display Inventory History by Location (tdilc3510m000).  This session shows transactions for Production receipts and sales deliveries by Item and Date.  So basically you can see that a production order produced so many parts that were then sold to a sales order.  It looks to me that the link is Item and Date so it's basically doing what we did artificially so I'm skeptical that this really is a good, hard link.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone make any comments on this for me?</div></div><hr />

This doesn't really link production to sales. While it may be possible to deduce a relationship where quantities and/or dates are distictive, situations where multiple production orders are receipted before sales are dispatched would preclude accurate deduction. <br />
<br />
For one of our lines of business where we 'make-to-order' and use the system to print identification lables with customer details and product serial numbers that are affixed to the prodcut (spools/pallets), we have customised sls order entry programs to record the production order number in sales order line using a field that is not otherwise used by that operation. (This has worked happily for the past 5 years) <br />
<br />
Note: Baan4_c4 does provide a link for purchase orders. If this were not required in your business it would be a fairly straight forward candidate for customisation.  <br />
<br />
Whilst we have customised the system to handle this requirement, I am not suggesting that you should necessarily do this.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">7th October 2004, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">David - your company has created a customization that has created this link?  Say a field on the sales order where you put the production order number?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 02:12</div></div><div class="posttext">One way you can provide a link in standard Baan is to use 'text'. On sales orders there are several choices: Order Header and/or footer and each line item.  Similarly, the production order has text also. If manual 'linkage' is enough for your situation the text facilities should be ideal. <br />
<br />
In my earlier post where I indicated that we have customised programs, we also automatically add text to the production order to provide a reverse 'link' ie: sales order no and customer name for easy reference.<br />

The sales order number and business partner then appears on the production documents.</div></div><hr />

we made this link by a customizing, using afs from baan tools:<br />
when you are in the sls-position you click a new button an start an afs-procedure: create a new production order for this sls-position (you need only item, date and quantity) and write the production order number in the customer-purchase-position-number field (Baan 5.0c).<br />
