<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">achavezf</div><div class="date">18th December 2002, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi: We are upgrading from Baan 4b to Baan 5c, and I have some problems with the backflushing process(tisfc0220m000). For example: for 80 manufacturing orders and an average of 500 components Baan 4 took about 2 hours in backflushing all this orders; but in Baan 5 the same scenario takes 16 HOURS. We have tested a lot of scenarios and the conclusion is that Baan 5 is much more slow than Baan IV in the backflushing process. Both versions are in the same machine. Does anyone have a similar problem?</div></div><hr />

- bad query/queries (in one or the other version<br />
- different use of functionality<br />
- added functionality<br />
<br />
If this is not the case I like to refer to my document: Performance Tracing and Tuning Guide (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7665) <br />
<br />
If you need more info don't hesitate to post again.<br />

Kind regards,<br />
