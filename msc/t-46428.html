<br />
we are implementing ERP Ln. We are in mass production. Our practice is to release every day production orders for the next day, and the main wh does replenish the WIP warehouses with the parts needed based on the allocation and quantity in SFC warehouse. If there are already parts in the SFC warehouse from perviuos orders, and not allocated, only the difference is replenished. Today in BaanIV we replenish our WIP warehouses with the drp module. In Ln there is no such module, but we could do it with clusters, which I think is a little combersome to use.<br />
<br />
We evaluated the line supply system OrderControlled/Single, but this system, generates automtically transfer order back for any parts not not used by an production order. Our practice is to leave the parts in the line for the next order, means next day. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions which method to use?<br />
<br />
pls help.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
Immanuel</div></div><hr />
