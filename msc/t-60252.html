I use MRP for a long time but always for the global run and never by single item. I tried to run by MRP item (top level) but without success - MRP keeps generating for all items. Or maybe I should delete all the orders some how first?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an exprerience in running MRP by single item and want to share it here?<br />
<br />
Business reason - for time to time it's required to run MRP by one top-level item to see the inventory/orders impact.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

Better delete the previous created MRP demands and then re run the MRP for the single level (top level) item, properly select the item range (do not select the whole range) and careful about the date ranges before the run, let me know if you still have the problem.<br />

In Baan IV, it's difficult to delete the whole list of planned MRP orders at a shot (in LN it's easy to select and delete), you need to choose one by one each order to delete, you need to open the session 'Maintain Planned MRP Production/Purchase Orders' and then select the required item code (top level) and delete the same MRP order of the top level item, followed by all below level items with the same procedure.<br />
