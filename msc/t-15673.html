<br />
I have some questions about TRP.<br />
<br />
After transferring Planned Production Order to Shop Floor, I run session Plan Tools to calculate tools usage.<br />
Session Availability check for tools shows correct information about tools usage.<br />
<br />
But then I decided to change production order qty. the estimated tool requirement also changes but strange thing is, the system is advising wrong planned tool usages, that is using tools that are already used in another production order or already out of tool's life.<br />
<br />
Do you ever encounter this?<br />
<br />
Second thing is, if i intentionally delete the estimated tool requirements entry, running Plan Tools session doesn't create the tool usage again. Is that also your case?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
