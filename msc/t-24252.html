We have a production process in which diferent items results in a production order. In Baan we don't know if there is a way to assign diferent items to the Producition order. The fact is that we cut a big board and the result are diferent sizes small boards.<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Actually we have a similar problem, but only for very few items. Our workaround is to put the spin-off products with negative quantities in the BOM of the &quot;main item&quot;. The result is a positive inventory transaction of these products when reporting the operations complete. Also the MRP takes the spin-off quantities into account.<br />
I think this works fine with a fixed correlation of products (cutting the board is always the same).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
I was facing a similar problem. I solved this by using the lot.<br />
<br />
I defined the finished item as a lot item. When completeing the final operation, based on the square meter of the size of the sheet that is cut, I gave a lot code eg: 5mx2m<br />
<br />
It works well for me...</div></div><hr />
