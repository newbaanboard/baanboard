For some reason, planned production order (000009879) is bucketing the demand for our Sept. although there are several orders through December sales orders. We  canâ€™t see a reason this one section of orders is bucketing the way that it is. <br />
<br />
<br />
We would have expected several planned orders from September to December for 200 per month based upon the sales orders but we see one order of 800 in September. What could cause this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john crystal</div><div class="date">22nd January 2019, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd start by looking at the order multiple and order minimum at both the item level and at the item data by warehouse level. Next I'd look at the planning horizons and the plan periods. <br />
<br />
If all items are behaving the same way and doing a 4 month bucket past September 2019 I'd look at the plan periods, Then look at the planning horizons.<br />
<br />
It only the one item is behaving this way then the item data by warehouse would be where I would start.<br />

Thx for your reply I already checked what you described above and it seems that the majority of the items behaves with bucket at the end of the period. Although a few items do not behave that way and have a planned supply after end of September.<br />
<br />
Planned horizon is 545 days <br />
The plan periods are 52 weeks of 7 days<br />
Example Item A:<br />
Min Ord and Ord Mult are 4<br />
- Planned production orders upuntil the 23rd of august are all mult of 4 <br />
- Planned production orders on the 22nd of September is 1140 <br />
- Demand however is 285 on the 22nd of September, 285 on the 22nd of October, 285 on the 20th of November and 285 on the 20th of December.<br />
<br />
<br />
And indeed if all items would behave this way and have a bucket at the end of September this would make sense but some items don't behave that way.</div></div><hr />

It looks like your horizon exceeds the number of periods you have out there. Try increasing the number of 7 day periods to cover your 545 day horizon. I'll check back later today to see your result.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronald65</div><div class="date">24th January 2019, 13:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried to increase the number of periods but that also did not seem to work. I was guessing that some calendar settings might also cause this issue. So I think some items have planned orders that differ from other parts. Would that be possible? And where could I find this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abattoir</div><div class="date">24th January 2019, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">it could happen due to the calendar for the work center not created further out in 2019. Please check the calendar for the work center of the item and make sure it is defined for further out until 2020.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronald65</div><div class="date">25th January 2019, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx for that remark. I think I am now in the right direction. I ran the update calendar work working hours session tcccp0226m000 and it seems to split up the planned production orders.</div></div><hr />
