         I have a doubt in Baan Manufacturing.<br />
I created a new production order. In BOM I have another item which is of the type manufactured under the item for which I created the production order. Logically a production order should be generated for the item under the main item in BOM. But I dont see a production order for the child item in BOM. Can anyone throw some light on this?<br />
Thanks a lot<br />

There is a different forum for such queries. Please post it there.<br />

<br />
If you have a multi level BOM with non phantom items, BaanERP will consider every level as independent. Creation of production order at any level will only involve that particular level of BOM. The BOM &amp; routing below will give 2 production orders, one for A and one for B. But creation of production order for A doesn't automatically create one for B.<br />
A (non phantom)<br />
| operation 2<br />
B (non phantom)<br />
| operation 1<br />
C<br />
<br />
<br />
If, however, some of the sub assemblies in your multi level BOM are moving fast enough in the shop floor that it's unnecessary to track their actual stock, then you can declare it so in BaanERP as phantom item. This way, BaanERP will group together all phantom sub assemblies of a non phantom item in one production order. The one below will give 1 production order for A only<br />
A (non phantom)<br />
| operation 2<br />
B (phantom)<br />
| operation 1<br />
C<br />
<br />
You can further simplify your multi level BOM if you'd like and just include all production operations needed to manufacture a non phantom item in its routing. BaanERP will then make separate multi operation production order for each non phantom item. The one below will give 1 production order for A<br />
A (non phantom)<br />
| operation 2<br />
| operation 1<br />
C<br />

MRP always look at the whole BOM tree, whichever BOM design you'd choose. Should you choose a multi level BOM of all non phantom items (like the first diagram in my posting above), MRP will still know that it needs to create a planned order for the non phantom sub assemblies when necessary. Hence, with MRP you don't have to worry that your sub assembly production order is not being created when you request production for the finished good.<br />

<br />
Obviously, if stock was already on hand or was already planned to be on hand at the appropriate time.<br />
<br />
The other replies are correct, but outside of Baan, and any other software for that matter, basic manufacturing planning and control methodology governs this process.</div></div><hr />

That is not a good idea I think.<br />
<br />
SFC orders that are entered manually, generate extra (materials) demand for MRP.<br />
The next MRP-run, MRP will consider these material requirements.<br />
That's how it works.<br />
