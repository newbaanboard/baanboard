<br />
we want to have 2 different kind of bom's:<br />
<br />
(1) EDM Bom containing all materials which are on the drawing including small parts like bolts, washers etc. (-&gt; maximum bom, input is from the cad system).<br />
<br />
(2) Production BOM (tibom010) without this small parts.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to set those &quot;small part&quot; items within the edm bom to a status, so they are displayed in the production bom, but you do not have to handle them in the production (e.g. book the material) or that they are only in the edm bom but not transferred to the production bom (we do not have to see them at all).<br />
<br />
We want to avoid to maintain 2 different bom's for each item on in edm and in the production bom.<br />
<br />
The reason behing: The small parts are handled as indirect costs and are booked seperatly with containers (like kanban) and afterwards the costs are shared to all produced products.<br />
<br />
Thank for any hints.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Kozure</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you for your answer.<br />
<br />
Can you please modify the following example for better understanding your solution: <br />
<br />
EDM BOM manu item: A<br />
Pos. 10 purchase item<br />
Pos. 20 purchase item<br />
Pos. 30 manu item (with own bom)<br />
Pos. 40 washer (small part -&gt; indirect cost no booking)<br />
Pos. 50 screw (small part -&gt; indirect cost no booking)<br />
<br />
How can we avoid Pos. 40 and 50 in the production bom without modifying the production bom separately. Because everytime we update the edm bom and transfer it to production bom, the Pos. 40 and 50 would be inserted and have to be manually removed.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
