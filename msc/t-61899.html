and i have a problem to trace the scrape<br />
<br />
for example<br />
<br />
my item to produce is a ring (piece)<br />
and the scrape is in grams<br />
<br />
and i must trace it as i collect it back in GRAMS<br />
<br />
also when i put items to sales?<br />
i deal with it as a piece but its cost is calculated on its weight<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
thanks for concern</div></div><hr />

There is a below mentioned work around on which you can think over: <br />
<br />
Item Setup:<br />
RING001 (End Item) - Inventory unit ‘pcs’ and Sales unit ‘pcs’<br />
GOLD001 (Raw Material) - Inventory unit ‘gms’<br />
GOLD002 (Scrap Material) - Inventory unit ‘gms’<br />
<br />
Activity:<br />
In Production Order, BOM will be like this:<br />
GOLD001 (100 gms)<br />
GOLD002   (-5 gms Negative Quantity, Suppose Scrap is 5 %)<br />
<br />
Execution:<br />
There will be two type of transaction against that Production Order<br />
Issue: GOLD001<br />
Receipt: RING001 as well as GOLD002<br />
<br />
Can you let me know if it’s work fine, or any other complication in process?</div></div><hr />
