We would like to open a Project for such jobs and charge all the related costs directly and capitalize wehn the project is completed.  As we cannot open a Production Order for this, can we charge materials issued from inventory directly to the project?  If so, how, as we do not have any production order to charge the material against?<br />

just create one PCS-make item and manually start an SFC-order.<br />
use ticst0101m000 (or when already known from the start, add to PCS-BOM) for used materials. hours accounting can be handled like &quot;normal&quot; orders.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VilasoorRavi</div><div class="date">1st March 2005, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.  Direct expenses could be, for us, transportation to the project site, commission payable to third parties, use of cranes to off-load etc.  Hope it is clear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of this may be obvious, but just to clarify a few things:<br />
<br />
When you create the project, make sure that &quot;Internal Project&quot; is set to &quot;Yes&quot; (on form 2 to of Maintain Projects). You will not be able to sell an item that is made on an 'internal' project (not that you want to), but most importantly no COGS transactions will be posted when you close the project.<br />
<br />
Then use Maintain Project Transaction Accounts (tipcs8150m000) to define project-specific financial integration mappings. Here you can specify exactly which debit &amp; credit ledger accounts should get hit for applicable combinations of Transaction origins and Financial Transaction--e.g., Production(SFC) and Material Costs, or Production(SFC) and Operation Costs-- for the specific project.<br />
