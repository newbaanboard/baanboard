<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">10th November 2004, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We have subassembly item A which can be configured into finished good item 1,2 or 3. Items 1,2 and 3 are made up of subassembly A, plus unique labels and packaging per each configuration. <br />
<br />
Consider the following example:<br />
<br />
We build items 1,2 and 3 to a forecast. <br />
Item 1 has a forecast = 100<br />
Item 2 has a forecast = 100<br />
Item 3 has a forecast = 100<br />
<br />
Baan creates 3 finished good MRP orders, each for 100. This creates one subbassembly MRP order for the subassembly A for 300. Item A is converted into 100 of item 1, 100 of item 2, and 100 of item 3. <br />
<br />
During that period, the customer who orders items 1,2 and 3 decides that they would rather buy 300 peices of item 1, rather than 100 of each finished good. We enter a sales order for item 1 for 300 peices, and then MRP tells us to build 200 more peices of item A and convert that into 200 peices of item 1. <br />
<br />
What I would rather do is simply re-work item 2 and 3 into item 1. This means I would only have to re-label and re-package these items, rather than rebuilding 200 new subassemblies. <br />
<br />
The problem is that MRP does not see any relationship (the subassembly) between item 1,2 and 3, so it does not know that we would rather re-work the existing inventory than build new subassemblies and finished goods. <br />
<br />
Is there any way in Baan for us to tell MRP not to plan new subassemblies when this happens. We have a huge product mix and over 2,000 finished good SKUs so this we cannot manage this manually.<br />
<br />
We also cannot store inventory at the subassembly level.<br />
<br />
thanks!<br />

<br />
try to make items 1,2 and 3 also distribution items (sourcing rules:Item 1 is 50% made from item A and 50% supplied from item 2)<br />
and make supplying rules so they are a supply-source to each other.<br />
<br />
You still have to enter the 'rework' orders yourself when Baan plans the distribution orders......</div></div><hr />
