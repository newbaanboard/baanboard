The production order qty is 10. But by mistake, the user completes 11.  the order status is &quot;Active&quot;.Item is lot item (lot control =by unit).<br />
<br />
When reversing  the order qty with negative qty (-1), in session tisfc0120s000 - Report Order completed&quot;,  the system gives an error message as &quot;Not all lots can be returned or no open outbound line can be undone&quot;.<br />
<br />
Pls advice the method to correct the completed qty to 10 in the same prod order.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
If the extra unit you completed has been posted to the inventory and not release the inbound. You can do this. <br />
Go to report production order completed on field Quantity to deliver enter -1, leave the field completed order to &quot;No&quot;, then click on the Rep Complete button, your unit will be there(if it hasn't be realeased the inbound). Just selected and delete it. Then you can go to the  operations and change the quantity completed to 10 starting from the last operation to the first one.<br />
