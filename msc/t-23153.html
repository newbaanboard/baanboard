just wondering if anybody knows how to do warehouse receipt for production materials you never issues ? <br />
<br />
FYI, one of our manufacturing process (i.e: printing process) is using several items as its base materials. Those items are inks and solvents (maintained in General Item Data table). Before being used, those base items are mixed, resulting in various combination of new items. After being used,  we want to return the remains of those items (mixed and unmixed) back to the warehouse because those items (mixed and unmixed) still can be used for other Production Order. We want the return to be accounted in Production Order Costing.<br />
<br />
Anybody knows how to handle this?<br />
<br />
ps: we don't want to create and maintain any new item for every mixed item because the combinations are too many.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just try this,<br />
<br />
Enter the unused materials in the 'Material to issue' session with a negative value. Issue these negative quantity. These materials will go back to the warehouse.<br />
<br />
This is usually called negative issue. This will help the issued materials to be returned back to the warehouse.<br />
<br />

that will do for the unmixed items (pure inks and solvents) because they were issued by the warehouse.<br />
But what about the mixed inks and solvents? <br />
<br />
Remember that from the beginning these mixed items are never issued by the warehouse because they don't have any item code in General Item Data.<br />
<br />
And we don't want to create any new item every time we got these residue items for there will be too many item codes di General Item Data and it'll be very burdensome to maintain all of them. (#_#)v<br />
<br />
Any solution to achieve this?<br />
<br />

finally we created in Baan an item (call it MIXEDINKS) that will represents all those mixed inks and solvents. The item type is Purchased Item. We assumed one value to be its cost price.<br />
<br />
So at the end of the process, everytime we want to put all those residues into the warehouse, we enter this item in session &quot;Material to Issue&quot; with the negative value. The return will be accounted in the Production Order Costing.<br />
<br />
As for the residue variations, we maintained them manually via the warehouse stock card and identification labels on each of the residue containers (cans and drums).<br />
<br />
