<br />
The item they select in Sales order lines should be Purchased ( but it defaults to manufactured)<br />
<br />
As it is now, A Sales order Lines entry means that the user needs to manually change the item on Form 2 to &quot;Purchased&quot; instead of default &quot;Manufactured&quot; to work correctly<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated !  Thx ....</div></div><hr />

A purchased generic item doesn't make sense to me.<br />
If you're trying to just buy thing to stock, then you should just create purchased item, not generic. And if you have a kit, where all components are purchased items and there's no manufacturing (just putting the purchased components together in the kit box), then you can use phantom manufactured item to handle this. If you can tell us in more detail about your requirements, then we might be able to offer more appropriate suggestion<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">25th August 2005, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll try and make a little more sense  :) ...<br />
<br />
We use an internal process ( manufacture ) a product. We also use an outside vendor to supply the 'printed label' portion of this product ....  So, half is manufactured and half is purchased.<br />
<br />
Our offshore company will 'purchase' both pieces. After creating an order, we look at the customized item data and there are 2 entries for the project, one 'manufactured' item type and one 'Purchased' item<br />
<br />
They will not manufacture this, as it is done at our plant. Every order they need to select maintain Customized item Data and changed half the project to Item Type = 'purchased' to reflect this.  <br />
<br />
We'd like to see how we can redo this to either default to Purchased for these items or something else, we're really not sure. By changing the one project item to purchased, it does work for us currently however ....<br />
<br />
Does this make more sense ??</div></div><hr />

We do this. We have a sales org that sells the end item. They configure it and then purchase the customized item (via edi) from our manufacturing plant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">25th August 2005, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">OK cool, I'll check to see if those Gen BOMs and routings exist ( Actually I know they do, I imported all that data )  and try it out. Thanks for the insight folks  :) ....</div></div><hr />

The customized item Data came through as one entry that is purchased instead of 1 purchased and 1 manufactured .....</div></div><hr />
