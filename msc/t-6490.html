<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">1st September 2002, 23:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Estimated and actual costs co-exist in Baan.<br />
<br />
You cannot calculate your actual costs until you finished your project.<br />
After all, not until you know the exact amount of material and operational costs that were required are you able to determine your actual costs.<br />
<br />
However, if you want to know how much a project will probably cost you before you start manufacturing, Baan can provide you with an estimated cost, based on BOM and routing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">2nd September 2002, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">This parameter is part of initial set up . Once there are projects with active status , it's not allowed to modify. If one changes in GTM , then all existing transaction calculation and current project calculation will go wrong.<br />
<br />
So practically it can't be changed.</div></div><hr />
