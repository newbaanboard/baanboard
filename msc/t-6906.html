<br />
Does any one know what the 'SUBSEQUENT OPERATION' suppose to do when we put the value &quot;DO NOT MOVE'. That field is in the session 'TISFC0101M000' (Maintain Production Order).<br />
<br />
We expect that all &quot;subsequent operation date&quot; won't move but it appear that's events or transactions make them move anyway !<br />
<br />
Also, sometime the production order delivery date is changed. <br />
<br />
Our planners are very confuse here. They do some cleanup in 'Production Order' delivery date and 2 weeks after there is a lot of them have been changed. Productions Orders are in 'BACKWARD' capacity planning.<br />
<br />
We are trying to find a solution where only planners will be the owners of all the operations delivery date and all the production order delivery date.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

<br />
I suppose several problems are mixed up in your question:<br />
The options for subsequent operation refer to production order planning. If you set it to 'Don't Move' and you move the first operation of an order (manually) the subsequnt operations are not moved. The delivery date in a production order is set by the end date of the last operation and I'm not sure whether the setting 'Don't Move' is what you expect when changing the production order planning.<br />
Production planning can be done manually or automatically. It depends on the sessions you run and on the order status. Production order planning for orders with status released can only be done manually. If you want to gain full control about the planning process, release the orders and change production planning manually. The graphical planning board may be a good tool for this.<br />

<br />
   Unless you have interface between Baan and third party production scheduling, the production order dates are indeed belong to planners only by design. With a good authorisation system, the planning part (maintain dates, estimated materials, production order planning, etc) of production orders should only have been given to planners while execution part (reporting qty completed, prod hours, etc) to production. Outside the planning part, nowhere else can the production order dates be changed, not even in MRP.<br />
<br />
   I suspect that access to the planning part was given to people other than the planners in your site, hence they can change it, or the planners press a button by mistake in the planning part and changed them all.<br />
<br />
   By the way, Martin is right that moving method has nothing to do with production order dates. It has everything to do with relations between operations in a production order instead, how they interact when one of them is moved.<br />

<br />
I just got a defect on this issue.<br />
<br />
In Baan IV even when you ran Shift Production Orders, it would only shift the first non-completed operation, and then consider the moving methods for what to do with the other operations.<br />
<br />
Now in BaanV we changed this a little: Shift Production Orders will fully replan the production order. So it does not consider the moving methods anymore.<br />
Is this also your problem?<br />
<br />
I can tell, we are considering to restore the BaanIV functionality, because even then it is possible to force a replanning, just by putting the moving methods to 'Move All'.<br />
<br />
Comments/suggestions are appreciated..!<br />
<br />

<br />
we are on Baan IVc4 and are very happy with the production order planning functionality. It's very flexible and meets exactly our needs. We are currently thinking about a migration to Baan V and I'm suprised to hear that planning will not be same.<br />
What has been the reason to change it?<br />
<br />

<br />
We thought the Moving methods should merely relate to shifting operations and not to shifting Prod. Orders.<br />
<br />
Therefore we decided to replan the order in case it is shifted.<br />
