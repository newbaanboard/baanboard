<br />
&gt;Who is &quot;customized item&quot; ???<br />
<br />
Oh.... one could go into pages of detail here.<br />
In (very) short terms: A customized item is an item that is produced / purchased for a particular customer order (a project in Baan). The costing for customized items is not item centric, but project centric. Not everything that can be done with standard items can be done with customized items due to this paradigm.<br />
<br />
&gt;How i can create a rework order ???<br />
<br />
Enter a production order and set the rework orer flag to yes<br />
<br />
&gt;In Production Planing how works the &quot;count point&quot; ??<br />
<br />
It forbids reporting complete of operations after a count point, when the count point operation is not yet reported complete. However there are some parameters in manufacturing that<br />
also control when subsequent operations may be reported complete and what happens with the previous operations then.<br />

<br />
My problem is<br />
<br />
In an die casting operation i obtain an assembly, and in the next operation (cutting) i have 2 pieces with different itens codes.<br />
<br />
The Production Order is for the assembly item, but i need to report quantities  not this item but for the pieces that i obtain after the cutting operation. <br />
<br />

<br />
You want to manufature item X (that is the manufactured item at the production order),<br />
In the first operation (casting), you issue some raw material, for instance steel, and get a new product, X1 (maybe a phantom), <br />
After the next operation, cutting, you get 2 or more different products out of X1, and at least one of them are your manufactured item X.<br />
The other item(s) are some kind of surpulus products, that you want to put in stock.<br />
Can you please tell me if this is the situation you want to get a solution for, if not, can you please give me the details.<br />
What kind of industry is it, process or manufacturing? Which Baan version do you use?<br />

<br />
Sturla <br />
I use BaanIVc4 SupplyChain<br />
<br />
My industry is manufacturing....  we produce car parts in alluminium. <br />
The bom of the X1 item is for example 0,500 Kg alluminium.... Correct. If i release a production order for 100un of this item i obtain a 100 X1 and i consume alluminium (0,5Kg x 100). The routing for the item X1 is an operation of casting. I put this items in an &quot;work in progress&quot; warehouse.<br />
The next operation of the item X1 is a cutting operation and i obtain for each X1 two new different items (items &quot;W1&quot; with 0,400Kg and &quot;W2&quot; with 0,100Kg, for example).<br />
What the W1 bom's???<br />
My problem is define this correctly....  I need planned Orders for my item X1 but i obtain items &quot;W1&quot; and &quot;W2&quot;.... Is impossible to produce only the item W1. <br />
<br />
I hope that you understand my problem...<br />

<br />
You can define your bom like this.<br />
<br />
        w1<br />
       __|_ _     <br />
      |         |<br />
     x1     w2 - (enter negative value)<br />
<br />
Anything mentioned as negative would be considered addition in the stock.<br />
<br />
You can raise a production order for w1 and issue materials x1 and w2.  Since w2 is negative, stock for w2 will raise in the warehouse.<br />
<br />
Also backflushing/generate outbound advice will not work for negative quantities. You have to use maintain outbound data for that.<br />
