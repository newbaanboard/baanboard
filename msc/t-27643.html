<br />
I'm releasing a production order using the session tisfc0204m000. All the dates are extended and correct. <br />
In the form tab of 'Print Status' of the production order, all the documents I want to print, get the status 'Document Printed'. <br />
The status of the Production Order still remains at 'Documents Printed' !?!. what causes it to stay that way and not get 'Released' ? <br />
<br />
This is in Baan Vc.<br />
All help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
The component is defined as a Backflush item and on the BOM, its got a Lot selection of 'Specific'. I think this should not be allowed. <br />
<br />
A Backflush item when initiated to issue, will pick the first avaliable lot and issue it. The lot selection should not be allowed to be 'specific' on the BOM for backflush-able items.<br />
<br />
Is this a logical expectation ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The lot selection option of 'Specific' will create a problem while executing Initiate Inventory Issue session, it should not stop the user from releasing the production order. Can you re-check the dates, ensure that the from date is in past and the to date is in future and the corresponding dates in production order falls in between. Also try releasing the same production order from Production order session (tisfc0101s000).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 23:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.. it still stops from releasing it. When I go to the BOM and change the lot selection of component to 'Any'... the release goes through fine.<br />
<br />
I'm on SP18, wondering if there is a bad fix somewhere. <br />
Logically it should not stop me from releasing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">20th July 2006, 00:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sorry, I did not check this earlier. I am able to simulate this problem at my end also. In case of items where the lot selection is set to specific, you need to enter the lot details in the Estimated materials before you release the order. Once the lot details are entered the production order gets released.<br />
I wonder why Baan has put a check at releasing stage???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">20th July 2006, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you release the order using the sub print and release from tisfc0101m000?<br />
In that case you know it hasn't anything to do with lots etc.</div></div><hr />
