We have a setup of 4 companies, All Multi fin/ Multi Logistic.<br />
<br />
We require to send some WIP to another plant, as we use single level BOM, the goods can be transfered without material option.<br />
<br />
We considered subcontracting without material option for the process.<br />
<br />
We are not sure about the process to be performed. Need to understand Purchase, Sales, manufacturing and financial transactions to be performed. Intercompany settlement of work done and their cost.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or if we can opt any other process instead of subcontracting?<br />
<br />
Pls update.<br />

Yes, you can perform subcontracting process, only purchase order will take place for the same here, not the sales order. How many operations are there that need to be performed for that manufacturing item? in case the first operation itself is subcontracting process then at the begining you need to send the material to the other company for subcontracting process.<br />
Apart from subcontracting you can split the production order; the WIP product will be considered as the semifinished good which further need a warehouse transfer from current company warehouse to other company warehouse and followed by second production order will take place at other company. However subcontracting is better approach i guess.<br />
