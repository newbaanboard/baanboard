Now we have encountered a big trouble for our BAAN system, detail as following:<br />
when we created some production orders in sfc001 table, but we found nothing orders or material in cst001 table(by session 'Maintain estimate Material'), and we confirmed the routing &amp; PBOM have nothing problem for those production orders, <br />
We are very confused now and have not any way to solve such problem, dear everybody, is there one BUG for BAANIV??? and any solution able to solve this problem???<br />
<br />
thanks and best regard.</div></div><hr />
