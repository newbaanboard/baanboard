This is in BaanVc.<br />
<br />
I have users completing production orders and delivering Qty to stock, without materials being issued to the order.<br />
This is causing lot of problem in costing/variance.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to stop users from completing Qty to Stock in the tisfc0520m000 session (Report Orders Complete), if materials have not been issued to it ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all suggestions.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

I guess users delaying the input of production material issue happens in many places, huh? The only solution I can think of that wouldn't necessitate customisation of BaanERP is that the cost accounting department should print the cost sheet of the production order before closing the order. That way, not only can they check if no material has been issued, they can even check if the material issue being recorded is way too low.<br />
