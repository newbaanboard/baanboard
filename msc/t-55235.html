<br />
I am having a problem, I have a variance in some items when I get cost information from tables ticpr300 (STD Cost) and ticpr200 (COST PRICES). I think if I Choose the standard &quot;cost price calculation code&quot; in table ticpr200, I should have the same costs as table ticpr300 (using the same item of course).<br />
<br />
This is not true for all my items.. any reasons why? Some are the same , some not.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

There could be few reasons, one reason is not setting the flag for updating the cost prices while calculating the cost prices or not running the actual cost price session later on to update the prices. Another could be, ticpr300 the std. cost prices are stored datewise and cost componentwise, it is possible that for items having multiple cost price history, you may not be able to see the correct cost price for correct date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philb70</div><div class="date">4th March 2009, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">It is feasible that the cost price in ticpr200 is caclulated using the same Cost Price Calculation but at a different time in the Financial calendar, a movement in purchase price, operation rate and/or routing could mean that cost price calculated today is different to cost price calculated, say, last month - hence you can see differences between these two tables (and possibly why trying to compare the two may be fruitless).</div></div><hr />

ticpr200 stores the cost by price calculation code (cpcc). One can defiene numerous cpcc and they all will be available in ticpr200. Only once an update to cost is done (for actual cpcc), it is transferred to ticpr300. Also, ticpr300 contains history of cost, so one can know the cost over a period of time.<br />
So ticpr200 may not always match with ticpr300<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">12th March 2009, 20:59</div></div><div class="posttext">The Cost Prices table (ticpr200) is updated anytime that you run Calculate Cost Prices (ticpr2210m000), whether you set the update box to &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. As noted in the previous replies, the table holds calculations under all CPCC Codes -- not just the Standard Price CPCC -- and the entries are not dated. Also, it is possible to delete entries from ticpr200 by running Delete Cost Price Calculations (ticpr2260m000).<br />
<br />
Standard Cost Price (ticpr300) is only updated when you run Calculate Cost Prices with update set to &quot;Yes&quot; or by running Update Cost Prices (ticpr2220m000). As noted, the table contains std cost history and you cannot manually delete records. <br />
<br />
Note that when you run Update Cost Prices (ticpr2220m000), the system performs no calculations, it simply retrieves the previously calculated value from ticpr200 (assuming that there is a calculated value under the standard cost CPCC) and enters the records in ticpr300.<br />
