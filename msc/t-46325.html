   If there are no parameters or default settings that could help you with this then you could just edit the form using the Maintain Form session.. <br />
Every field has a &quot;Default&quot; value that can be set and so by giving the name of the field that holds your default values (namely Routing Unit or Formula Size) might give you the desired results you are looking for. <br />

This ought to do the job. Atleast it did for me...<br />

btw, this qty not default for production bacth order only happen for item data with specific container.<br />

  I am not too familiar with &quot;Containerized&quot; items and so not in a position to tell you about the impact...<br />
<br />
However, as a last step in what i suggested with the Economic Order Quantity... could you tell me what is the &quot;Order Method&quot; (Form4, field 3 down in Maintain Item Data) for that item that you are creating a production order for. Try to change the value in this field to &quot;Economic Order Quantity&quot; and try what i suggested in my previous post, again....<br />
<br />
Good Luck!!<br />

Container mean finish good with different packaging.<br />
order method for main item (tiitm0101m000) use lot fot lot but order method end item (tiitm0130m000)  use fixed order qty.<br />
usually this never happen until we create new item data then this problem appear.<br />

In your case that wont work as you use Lot for Lot. <br />

usually this never happen until we create new item data then this problem appear.<br />
What are you talking about here? The problem with production qty <br />
or the order method?<br />

but now qty production take from previous order in production ?</div></div><hr />

What is so different about this new item that you created after which the production qty started behaving in the fashion you described? Doesnt this item share the characteristic of an existing item? Is the production order qty only behaving in this fashion for this item alone or for all items? Its quite hard to beleive how one new item code creation could bring forth this sort of a change in production order creation... There must be something else behind it..<br />

Or even running Create runtime for application? Parameter or certain item specific value changes could also play a part. Can you make sure that all the items old or new brings upon this problem when creating production orders?<br />

this case was happened but the solution is when input production bacth, first enter series number then enter main item but skip container go to qty ordered (usually this default in from qty in main item or formula size) after that input container field.<br />
usually this work for solve this problem but now it can't.<br />

There must be something different, in terms of specific item related configuration, thats triggering this problem at the production order level. <br />

From your attachment, i could see that in session Maintain Item Data by Item and Container, there exists a container for the item 2201551. However, when it comes to session Maintain Formulas for the same item above, the container field is empty. Could this be the problem? <br />

I think this problem cause we must update SP.<br />
I have simulation with two server, server for real transaction use SP 18 but we have server simulation with SP 21, this probelm can be solve.<br />
<br />
maybe this the best solution for us.<br />

thank you very much.<br />
