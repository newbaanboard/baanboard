<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ylwong</div><div class="date">10th April 2014, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
         I'm very new to this LN product, I would like to ask if anyone could help my problem here. First, I have a BOM list with the following:<br />
<br />
Finish Good - Part A + Part B + Part C + Part D + Part E + Part F<br />
<br />
Before delivery, part D,E,F need to be assembled together into part G. During delivery, we will need to deliver Part A + Part B + Part C + Part G.<br />
<br />
Here is the problem, due to the variations of Part D + Part E + Part F is too large, I could not pre-define part G BOM up ahead. But part D,E,F category will always assembled together.<br />
e.g.        part D have 100 variation<br />
             part E have 500 variation<br />
             part F have 200 variation<br />
             part D,E,F always will assembled together into part G before delivery<br />
Forgotten to add this information, these items have revision control which the Engineering Item and Engineering BOM were created to begin.<br />
<br />
is there anyways to handle this kind of situation? Really appreciate it if anyone could provide solution for this problem. Thank you.:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ylwong</div><div class="date">24th April 2014, 03:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Abattoir,<br />
       Thank you for the reply. Actually the current situation is like this, when we use LN Infor to key in our product variant requirements, then with the product variant, we will export the product variant to a 3rd party program to generate the BOM for our product. First, we will completely create all the E-Item and E-BOM in LN waiting for the 3rd Party program to generate the BOM. After that we will match back the generated BOM into LN and tie it back to our Product variant. The problem here we are facing is the 3rd party program are not generating only 1st level of BOM. Due to the nature of the business, there is a huge possibilities combination of multiple parts, therefore, some of the generated parts will need to assembled together before shipping out to the customer. So, the BOM generated by the 3rd party program is a mixture of some goods that can ship direct to customer and some require additional work such as assembly before shipping to customer. At the moment, we use product line category to group those part that need to assembled together and customized a program to combine them into a new parent part that will have a running number in it. I was thinking if there is any other way that we could achieve the same solution with LN standard features. Please let us know if there are still confusion about my explanation. Thank you.<br />

I am afraid, I don't have direct experience with PCF module in Baan, so wont be able to give my two cents on it.<br />
<br />
Somebody from board should be able to answer it.<br />

G will be a manufactured item. So based on the configuration one can change the BOM of G. Then process G's production order to get G in stock and ship all the orders. In Baan IV since it is std costing one can expect to get the production variance, but one can map this variance to one account to get actual BOM cost.<br />
