We manufacture physically small items which are packed in trays.  Each tray holds 10 items.  The BOM for the item has 0.1 of each tray on it.  Thus a production order for 45 will backflush 4.5 trays.  That is invalid, the trays are indivisible so they must be backflushed in integers.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to round the demand on the BOM to the nearest tray?  Thus MRP would correctly order complete trays and the issued quantity on the production order would be complete trays as well.</div></div><hr />

MRP then should round this up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David_Booth</div><div class="date">9th December 2004, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">That will round up Planned Purchase Orders, for instance if Order Qty Multiple is set to 1 and the totalled demand is 37.7 it will round to 38.  Unfortunately the Demands themselves are not rounded up, for instance Planned Production Order requirements in timrp010.</div></div><hr />

Try the following:<br />
The inventory unit of the trays should be integer. So you won't be allowed to enter 0,1 in your production BOM's. To achive proper BOM's you modify the BOM unit in your manufactured items that need a tray to 10. This means the BOM is now valid for 10 items and contains 1 tray  :) .<br />
<br />
Rounding is done correctly now including a mathematical disadvantage: 34,1 is rounded to 34 instead of 35 (what I guess is what you actually need).<br />
<br />
But perhaps it's better than your current situation.<br />

<br />
you should develop customized application as follows:<br />
<br />
 1. do not issue trays with backflushing: change bckfl switch to &quot;No&quot; at tiitm0101m000., for trays.<br />
 2. mark trays with appropriate code, e.g. Selection Code.<br />
    you can filter better at your customized application.<br />
 3. your application will issue trays:<br />
    original 'Estimated' contains decimals and your app. will round upwards and rewrite issue qty. filed. After rounding you can call standard BAAN processes to issue from WIP WH.<br />
<br />
Your customization could be called from order closing session or maybe from prod. order reporting completed.<br />
