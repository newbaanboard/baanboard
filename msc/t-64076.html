<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan1123</div><div class="date">16th May 2013, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">We want to use the product configurator to guide our customers to standard items. Here's an example:<br />
<br />
Generic item : WIDGET<br />
Generic BOM for WIDGET<br />
       12345                if Left Widget<br />
       12346                if Right Widget<br />
WIDGET is coded as a phantom on its item data<br />
<br />
A sales order is entered for a WIDGET. The product configurator asks how many left widgets, how many right widgets. When session tipcf5260s000 (generate product variant structure for sales order) is run, the system recognizes that WIDGET is a phantom and places two line items on the sales order, one with 12345 and the appropriate quantity and one with 12346 with the appropriate quantity. A project and product variant is on each line but the item catagory is Standard Item. The sales price comes from the sales price on the item master. This works well. <br />
<br />
If we have a need to change the quantity of one of these lines, the price is changed from the item master price to the product variant price. Is there a way to prevent this other than removing the project?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
