Refer to business situation as below. A peoduction order has been released and work has been completed partially. Now the customer has put the requirement on hold till further instructions. In such situation we want to block the production order. We have the provision to block the operations. But there are specific requirements as below which do not get satisfied<br />
1.Status (any kind of identification) of the production order should be displayed as blocked so that information regarding hold be communicated to all concerned.<br />
2.Once the production order is blocked, no user should be able to modify production planning<br />
2. No user should be able to issue materials against production order<br />
3. No user should be able to process hours accounting against the production order<br />
