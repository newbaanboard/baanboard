<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">31st July 2009, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are a subcontractor then I think this is the way you would need to set up<br />
<br />
1. Set up the item that you are returning to manufacturer as top level item<br />
2. Set up the item that you are getting from your manufactuer as BOM component to top level. Also, these items will be classified as purchase item and it can be at zero standard cost.<br />
3. When you receive the material you can receive either through PO or  thru inventory adjustmet<br />
<br />
4. You need to create production order for main item and that will consume the components. This way you  can control inventory of parts as well as exeute your production orders<br />
5. You will need tocreate a sales order to bill your mfr<br />
<br />
The cost of main item would be same as what cost you to do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BhushanPatil</div><div class="date">19th September 2009, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">While working as Subcontractor in LN6.1, if you are taking the stock in &amp; applying the Purchase Receipt-Production Order-Sales Delivery, then you will end up creating more mess, in a way you will be having Inventory piled up for manufactured item at top level, which you will be sending to your customer, but you will have to bill for Operation cost only thru cost item.<br />
This inventory in receipt store &amp; in WIP &amp; in finished goods will mix up &amp; your inventory run will also count this stock, which is not yours. Its preferable if you dont go by this route.<br />
There has to be other way around in LN6.1 &amp; someone there might be using it, and can help us. Check &quot;Job Work&quot; receipt &amp; handling in LN6.1 because when you are working as &quot;Suncontractor for someone else&quot;, then in LN6.1 you are doing &quot;JobWork in your area&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding subcontracting in FP5, it is whole new and big functionality. The method as suggested by AVPatil was something which we used to follow prior to FP5 and baan4c4 versions. In FP5 , you need to set up 1)Terms&amp;Conditions(Hard Pegging), 2) Subcontracting and ofcourse you will need to enable the parameters in Common module. Extensive documentation on this is available both in online help and infor support site.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Best of Luck.</div></div><hr />
