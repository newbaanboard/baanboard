<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">15th June 2009, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">When I tried to Cancel the Purchase order line, I get the error message &quot;Called/Invoiced quantity cannot be negative&quot;; <br />
<br />
The current PO line status is Release to WH = yes; No receipt made yet. <br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to fix this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">16th June 2009, 08:55</div></div><div class="posttext">It has something to do with the linked contract. By cancelling the order line the called quantity on the contract is lowered by the order quantity. Somehow the called/invoiced quantity becomes negative if you cancel this line. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">19th June 2009, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I notice that Called Quantity in Contract line is already -ve; When are these 4 field getting updated (called qty, called amnt, invoiced qty, invoiced amnt)? I created invoice for a bunch of received POs and did not find any update to this field. <br />
<br />
Are these fields useful? Is it safe to just make them +ve?</div></div><hr />
