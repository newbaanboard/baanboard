<br />
Is there any way  or any field in tdsls051 (sales order lines history) that indicates that it is a freshly entered sales order line.<br />
<br />
Please guide.<br />

Index5 of tdsls051 starts with the date. You could do something like the following in your script to find the newly eneterd lines:<br />
<br />
	domain	tcdate	date.from<br />
		long	last.ckor<br />
	<br />
	|Get all Positions entered since January forst 2018<br />
	date.from = date.to.num(	2018, 	|long yearno <br />
					01,	|long monthno<br />
					01)	|long month_dayno<br />
					<br />
	|or alternatively enter &quot;date.from&quot; in your session form!<br />
<br />
	select	tdsls051.orno, tdsls051.pono, max(tdsls051.ckor):last.ckor<br />
	from	tdsls051<br />
	where	tdsls051._index5 &gt;= {:date.from}<br />
	group by tdsls051.orno, tdsls051.pono<br />
	selectdo<br />
		|Possible values of tdsls051.ckor are: <br />
		|1 =entered 2 =deleted 3 =invoiced<br />
		if last.ckor = 2 then<br />
			|Line was deleted!<br />
			continue<br />
		endif<br />
		|Print or process found lines<br />
		...<br />
	endselect</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your guidance. Below is my scenario:<br />
<br />
1. On 22nd Feb, I added pos 10 in SO and did some modifications in line on same date. When I ran the report, it came fine printing only first record.<br />
2. On 23rd Feb, I modified same line in same SO. When I ran the report for <br />
23rd Feb, it printed the line with pos 10 thinking it was entered and not modified.<br />
<br />
and one more thing, Wethere we add a new line or modify existing line, value of ckor remains 1.<br />
<br />
function read.main.table()<br />
{<br />
	on.change.check(tdsls051.pono)<br />
	select	tdsls051.* <br />
	from	tdsls051<br />
	where	tdsls051._index5 inrange {:trdt.f} and {:trdt.t}<br />
	and 	tdsls051.cuno inrange :cuno.f and :cuno.t<br />
	order by tdsls051._index1<br />
	selectdo<br />
		if changed(tdsls051.pono) then<br />
			get.customer.name()<br />
			get.item.description()<br />
			rprt_send()<br />
			on.change.check(tdsls051.pono)<br />
		endif<br />
	endselect<br />
}<br />
<br />
Initially I wrote the above logic thinking everything from sales order line creation to modification happens in same date, but, it did not work if I modified a line which was created on a previous date.<br />

I don't think your code is correct. Also, if a line is entered  then deleted and again get created ckor will be 1, 2 and 1 again. What exactly is the definition of new line. Is it the first time the record getting created or what?</div></div><hr />
