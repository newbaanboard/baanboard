<br />
Working in baan5 where I have set up aggregation relationship &quot;all&quot; between a plan lvl 10 Family item and many plan lvl 20 top items. Looking in Item master plan at the family item ,the demand frc qtys are planned in production by baan instead of planning production only for the unconsumed frc qtys. Regularly as  the top items are being ordered they consume frc from the family (in the same bucket) all this visible in the item master plan.<br />
By replacing frc, the child items generate demand and production is planned and scheduled accordingly. The issue is with the planned production orders for the family item's unconsumed frc. Instead of planning only the unconsumed qty, baan is planning the demand qty from the top row in item master plan. This is the initial frc qty loaded and it brings excessive materials.<br />
Please feedback if there are any thoughts or questions (also include relevant codes from baan as I am not an advanced user).<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

From the description it looks like somewhere the aggregation functionality is misinterpreted and implemented. You may use the help in standard BaaN or proprietary document of BaaN &quot;UP095A US&quot; (Master-Based Planning) to understand more about this functionality.</div></div><hr />
