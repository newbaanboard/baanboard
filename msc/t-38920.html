<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">er.maninder</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 08:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I am working in a manufacturing company and using Baan LN 6.1. We have thousands of items in ERP Item Data. I want to customize the BOM of an item while printing by using BOM session (tibom1110m000). <br />
<br />
For Example:<br />
<br />
A customize item A has some B, C &amp; D standard items in its BOM. And B has some other standard items named X, Y &amp; Z. And same case in D there has some P, Q &amp; R items. But C is a purchase item. Whenever, I print BOM of A, it prints like: <br />
<br />
	A<br />
                -------B<br />
                -------C<br />
                -------D<br />
<br />
But it should be like as shown below<br />
<br />
	A<br />
    -------B<br />
                 --------Y<br />
	     --------X<br />
	     --------Z<br />
   --------C<br />
   --------D<br />
<br />
Is it possible to print this type of customized BOM?<br />
<br />
The requirement in BOM while printing is to print (Level, Position, Item Code, Description, Net Quantity, Units of Quantity, Effective Date, Expiry Date &amp; Warehouse) columns. Here one column Units of Quantity thats very necessary with others.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />

When you print the BOM, you should be getting an option to print it in MultiLevel format. Atleast it does provide this in Baan4 and i dont see why it would be taken off in Ln<br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shalini_narang</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">This functionality is also available in LN6.1. Go to Bill Of Material session (tibom1110m000), search the item, go to Print option through File Menu. There u will get 3 options: Bill of Material (Single Level), Bill of Material (Multi Level) &amp; Multi-Level BOM (Summarized). Here u can select any option as per your requirement.<br />

<br />
But my problem is not solved by using these 3 options. These 3 options (as you have written in your Email) have already been used by me. <br />
<br />
By using these options, ERP prints as shown below:<br />
<br />
In<br />
<br />
1. Single Level<br />
<br />
	A<br />
                -------B<br />
                -------C<br />
                -------D<br />
<br />
2. Multi Level<br />
<br />
	A<br />
    -------B<br />
                 --------Y<br />
	     --------X<br />
	     --------Z<br />
   --------C<br />
   --------D<br />
     --------P<br />
	     --------Q<br />
	     --------R<br />
<br />
3. Summarized (This option only shows total no. of purchased items in Top item A)<br />
<br />
	A<br />
   --------Y<br />
   --------X<br />
  	   --------Z<br />
   --------C<br />
   --------P<br />
   --------Q<br />
   	   --------R<br />
<br />
But I want that it should be like as shown below<br />
<br />
	A<br />
    -------B<br />
                 --------Y<br />
	     --------X<br />
	     --------Z<br />
   --------C<br />
   --------D<br />
<br />
I hope you will understand what I mean to say.<br />
<br />
Here, I also have another solution for this problem that is to print in BOM Tree session. I have also tried this option in past few days but here one loose point is the non availability of Units column.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to add this column in BOM Tree session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I think there is a bit of formatting problem in your thread or is it just me, i wouldnt know. To me, the representation of multilevel report format given by baan and the one that you need seems identical...<br />
 <br />
Anyways, If you can customize this session that gives you the BOM in the tree structure format then well and good. Otherwise, the same could be easily created with a few SQL codes...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">If the single level is<br />
<br />
 A<br />
-------B<br />
-------C<br />
-------D<br />
<br />
...then the multi-level should be<br />
<br />
 A<br />
-------B<br />
--------Y<br />
--------X<br />
--------Z<br />
-------C<br />
-------D<br />
--------P<br />
--------Q<br />
--------R<br />
<br />
(C &amp; D report to A, not B)<br />
<br />
From your request -<br />
<br />
 A<br />
-------B<br />
--------Y<br />
--------X<br />
--------Z<br />
--------C<br />
--------D<br />
<br />
 it appears you are asking for the report to show the components of B indented under B, as they should, but then you want it to show C &amp; D under B instead of A and then don't break down the components of D.<br />
<br />
If that is indeed your requirement, I don't know what the logic would be in creating such a report - or why you would need it. How and why does it break down some levels and not others, and why would it shift the level that some items are shown reporting to?<br />
<br />
This doesn't make sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 21:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
You should use BOM conventions to make it clear instead of using &quot;----&quot;<br />
I believe you need<br />
A<br />
.B<br />
..Y<br />
..X<br />
.C<br />
.D<br />
<br />
I only see that you don't want to explode D. And any reason for not exploding D?<br />
<br />
May be you can explain that. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">er.maninder</div><div class="date">13th July 2007, 08:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I have observed that the way I have explained about the levels was wrong.<br />
<br />
But Mr. PATIL has understood what I said.<br />
<br />
So Mr. PATIL, if you have any solution for the same then please let me know.<br />
<br />
My main problem is to add Units column in the BOM Tree session (otibom7200). Can my IT department customize this session.</div></div><hr />

I am still not clear on what you need. If you want to take this offline, may be I can help you out. My email address is avpatil@hotmail.com<br />

It is always possible to add anything in the report. But if your requirement is not to explode &quot;D&quot; then you will need to be able to identify the criteria and can stop the layout from printing. Again, if you want to take this offline, I may be able to help you out.<br />
