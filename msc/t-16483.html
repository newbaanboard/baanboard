We have created one routing for one manufacturing items.<br />
operation 10,20,30,40 till operation 190.<br />
for each operation task and work center has been attached, after each workcenter we have mentioned count point.<br />
in every operation we have mentioned  opr. overlap (%) equal to zero.<br />
<br />
we want to overlap some of the opeation. like<br />
<br />
after completion of opeartion 20 of workcenter 01, opeartion 80 of workcenter 03 should start parallel, means if we see the planning board, we can see that task of operation 20 finish date 15.09.2004 (example) and operation 80 start date (15.09.2004), but at the same time operation 30, 40, 50 should go on as per normal procedure.<br />
<br />
operation   startdt                  enddt. ( example)<br />
10            14.09.2004             14.09.2004<br />
20            15.09.2004             15.09.2004<br />
30             16.09.2004            16.09.2004<br />
40             16.09.2004            16.09.2004<br />

80            15.09.2004             16.09.2004<br />
90            16.09.2004             17.09.2004<br />
<br />
how to configure the logic in routing, what we have to fill in operation overlap (%), or any other place for input. we are running BaaNIV.<br />

as can I suppose you manufacture two components and you assembly them at operation 90.<br />
<br />
you should split manufacturing process as follows:<br />
presently your current manuf. item 'A' has routing ops. 10-90,100,etc:<br />
 - create a new manufactured component 'B', move operations 10-70 into routing of 'B' item (or maybe 10-40 enough),<br />
 - routing of 'A' will have only operations after 80 (or after 50),<br />
 - insert 'B' into BOM of 'A' and link to routing op. 90 of 'A'.<br />
<br />
Disadventage: more production orders, but you can perform parallel operations 10-30 and 80-90</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are following one production for each sales order lines, so we cannnot move for multiple production order for one item.<br />
<br />
As per BaaN Support &quot;Baan IV can only work with sequential operation numbers&quot;<br />
<br />
Does any one is having idea whether the above can be solved in BaaN Schedular.<br />
<br />
Any Input on the above will be great.<br />

<br />
For most functional consultants, we work best if you can actually describe the actual business process you need to find work around for, and in your case, that would simply be stating what actual product you're trying to produce instead of just coming up with description of operation numbers which means little to functional consultants. Please supply the info so we can help you better<br />

I am trying to explane our routing.<br />

<br />
line 1 - operation 10,20,30,40,50,60 are running sequentially means, after completion of operation 10, 20 will start and so on.<br />
Line 2 - Operation 80,90,100,120,130,140 are running parallel with Line 1 but no link between Line 1 and Line 2 , operation 80 of Line 2 will start same time as operation 10 of line 1. after finish of operation 80, 90 will start and so on<br />
<br />
Line 1 and line 2 will complete at same time, means finish date of  operation 60 Line 1 is same as finish date of operation 140 of line 2<br />
<br />
Line 3  Operation  150,160 are running sequentially after finish Line 1 &amp; Line 2 .<br />
<br />
Line 4  Operation 170,180,190 are running parallel to Line 3, means start date of operation 170 will be the same as start date of operation 150.<br />
<br />
How to configure the above routing in BaaN routing.<br />
<br />
Hope I am able to explain my requirements. <br />
<br />
Any more clarifications are welcome.<br />
<br />
Our End to End Solution Starts from Sales Quotation and we are creating production Order from Sales Order Lines. for each sales order lines, we create one production order. we are using project control. <br />

<br />
Indeed it calls for network routing similar to what pergerp mentioned, but simply set the sub assemblies (such as the casing sub assembly and coil sub assembly) as phantom items. Then you'll have only one production order whose operations running correctly in parallel<br />

<br />
Thanks for the input, If using phantom item we are able to solve our problem, then we can try for this.<br />
Can you send me some example how to make routing using phantom item. I am a Tools Consultant and helping Manufacturing guy who is having not much experience in BaaN Manufacturing.<br />
