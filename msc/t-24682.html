      This is regarding Item creation in Item Master.<br />
Is there any session or table present from where we can know which user has created the Item Code and what is the creation date.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Kind Regards,<br />

<br />
You can put audit on tiitm001.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">5th August 2005, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We did this once and it wasn't really that successfull due to the fact that in general the item table and some of its fields gets updated very frequently by various processes. ie. Stock levels tiitm001.stoc updated by inventory transactions.<br />
<br />
This means that to find anything you have to sift through a lot of audit data and you also have to be careful about the amount of disk the audit is consuming.<br />
<br />
Try it out but keep an eye on it.<br />

Probably you can look up in there (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=24510) to find out whether it can help you. I want to merge these 2 threads, but since I'm only moderator of manufacturing module (not distribution), I can't do that<br />
