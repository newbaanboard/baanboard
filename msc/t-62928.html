i have inspection order for origin SFC production. as result of my inspection order, one of my item is scrap. but for me it not a scrap, it can be reworked by another SFC(rework order).<br />
it is mean then i fill the scrap quantity the system generate adjustment order and i cannot use this item any more. but i would like to put it on the blocked location.<br />
maybe somebody know how can i put the scrap of production order to block location without adjustment order?<br />
<br />
as additional the produced item has a serial number.<br />
<br />

Yes, this we already faced earlier and functionality of LN such that once you reject the piece through QMS it will generate the adjustment order and throw the inventory out of the system, so you need to create another adjustment order with the same serial number and bring it back to one warehouse (say named as Scrap warehouse) and issue the same piece for rework production order.<br />
if you want to specify the rejected serial as a separate item code (say 'scrap-item001') then you need to maintain another item code and against the same item code you need to raise the adjustment order with the same serial code.<br />
