<br />
We have INFOR LN 10.5.   In Planning Module when we run Generate Order Planning. the planned purchase orders are not  totaled in one line for the same item &amp; same date. Same behavior when we transfer order planning from planned purchase orders to purchase orders.<br />
<br />
Anybody has an idea to group the above in one line, pls. communicate<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th October 2018, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">My first thought is to look at your planning parameters on the item.  Make sure you do not have a max order quantity.  I know we limit some of our make items, but not most of our purchased items.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">11th October 2018, 11:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at the item Ordering Data -- Order Interval - Fill in the number of days if, for example, you want to group the requirements per 5 days. In that case you will receive only one order per 5 days, and not per day.</div></div><hr />

May be max order qty. is part of item ordering not planning <br />
<br />
Thank You DStroud for your solution<br />
I understand your solution , but If there is one item has 3 lines have 3 dates withing 5 days, could be consolidated into one line against the earliest date ?<br />
I hope that your solution is to be applicable .<br />
I will try &amp; feed back<br />
<br />
Best Regards for All<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">13th October 2018, 00:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, based on your order interval planning will group demand into 1 planned order.<br />
<br />
Order Interval - The number of workdays or working hours for which all the requirements of a specific item are bundled in one (planned) order, during an order planning run. ERP LN calculates the order interval from the day when the first requirement occurs. Order intervals are used to prevent an excessive number of planned orders in one time period.<br />
<br />
•	Order Interval is defined in Item-Ordering Data<br />
•	Upon generation, EP looks for the date of first demand.<br />
•	At the date of first demand, EP groups demand within the order interval.<br />
•	Advice is created for the grouped demand.<br />
•	EP then looks for the next date of first demand and calculates again.</div></div><hr />
