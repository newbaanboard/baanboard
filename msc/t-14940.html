<br />
Anyone knows how to change the routing once the production order has been released?<br />
<br />
I made many tasks for one machine and these tasks will be linked to one item. Therefore one item will have many tasks (for one operation) linked to many routing codes. (we're doing costing based on each machines which is finally interpreted as task rate in Baan using estimated rates).<br />
<br />
When I need to change the machine, I simply change the routing code. But I can't change anymore if the Order status is released.<br />
<br />
I tried to make changes in Task in Production Planning session since the routing field in Production Order session has been greyed once released, but it does not update the cycle time, setup time, etc... :(<br />
Just changing the machine does not help because the alternative machines are in the different work center and the system refuse the entry.<br />
<br />
Anyone has any idea how to handle this?? Help please....<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
Hendra</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">31st March 2004, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of possibilities:<br />
1.  Try changing the Work Center first and then the machine.  A work center can have several machines connected to it, but a machine can be connected to only one work center.<br />
<br />
2.  Still in Production Planning, Add an operation with the new data you want and delete the old operation.  Assuming that your operation numbering scheme was set up to allow insertion - 10, 20, 30.... so that you can put in an OP 11, 23.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janneman</div><div class="date">1st April 2004, 09:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Partly correct!<br />
Adding new operations for running orders is possible when<br />
1. Costing parameter &quot;Production results per workcenter&quot; is off<br />
2. Above parameter is on, but workcenter is not changed.<br />
<br />
This option 2 (parameter = on) will create so called operation sets wherein the cost per workcenter are collected. And here changing between workcenters is not possible anymore after freezing the estimated costs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">2nd April 2004, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">In BaaN 5 you have the option of when to freeze estimated costs for production orders. In tisfc0502m000 - Default Production Order Data you can select to freeze estimates at Order Creation; at Order Release; or Before the first WIP transaction. So, it is possible to make changes to the order that would not get reported as variance if this is set  to and changes were made before the first WIP transaction.<br />
I am not clear on where the parameter &quot;Production Results per Wrok Center&quot; is set?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janneman</div><div class="date">3rd April 2004, 00:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Parameter &quot;Production results per workcenter&quot; is set in SFC parameters, costing tab, first row. (B50_c and B52_a only)<br />
Former versions don't have this option.</div></div><hr />
