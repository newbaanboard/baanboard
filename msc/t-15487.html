<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">27th May 2004, 09:25</div></div><div class="posttext">the following problem occurs in our environement:<br />
<br />
I want to make a simulated cost price calculation for a project via tipcs3250m000. I have defined a cost price calculation code (not the one that is used for standard cost prices) with first priority simulated purchase prices and some simulated purchase prices for some of the materials (Purchased items) used in bom of customized items. Furthermore the operating rates are defined for that calculation code.<br />
Baan Help says that if you calculate the project in Simulation then the cost prices for customized items (tipcs3550m000) and the cost price for project (tipcs3560m000) were not updated but the cost prices by item in ticpr2500m000 should be calculated under the defined cost price calculation code.<br />
Now when i calculate the project i indeed get cost prices for customized items under my defined code but they are calculated with the standard cost prices of the purchased items not with the simulated purchase prices.<br />
If i do the same for standard manufactured items it works fine.<br />
What do i do wrong?</div></div><hr />

long time back.<br />
Finally this problem was solved by a Solution (146067) from Baan. It was a bug indeed.<br />
I wonder that no one ran into this problem before. is this not a usual requirement? ;)</div></div><hr />
