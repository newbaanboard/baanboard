We have been on Baan IV for about 8 years. We recently acquired another plant that is interested in using the MRP sesssions, but we don't know a lot about them. <br />
Is there someone from another manufacturing company that would be willing to talk to the people here and explain how the replenishment module and MRP works in Baan IV and maybe the good points and bad points?<br />
We are located in Blacksburg, VA.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

  A simple explanation on the difference between these two would be that...<br />
<br />
MRP calculates materials based on certain calculated figures that we set in the Item master(safety stock, minimum order qty, order interval etc) together with requirements generated in various sessions like Sales Orders and Production orders. This is then used in a caclulation process called &quot;Generate Planned MRP orders&quot; where the system gives you what and how much of an item should be ordered. <br />
<br />
Replenishment order on the other hand is a means to replenish the stock in different warehouses by transfering materials from one warehouse to another. This however is done manually as there is no calculation process involved here. A Replenishment order is made and then delivered from one warehouse and received to another warehouse. <br />
