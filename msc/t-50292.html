<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kplbhll</div><div class="date">7th April 2008, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">engineering boms are used to create bom for a new item (under development) or an existing item having any engineering change.<br />
<br />
wheras production boms are used for  existing items.<br />
<br />
after making engineering boms we can copy it for prodcuction bom for its realese in mass production after its development.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">7th April 2008, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're using the Engineering module and revision control (as should be done for discrete manufacturing), then Engineering BOMs are where you create the BOM under the new revision. It is the center of the design data information. Copying it to production gives you the Production BOM, which defines the material used on work orders. It is also what will drive material requirements. It's possible to have non-physical items on the EBOM that won't show up on the PBOM.<br />
<br />
Also note that EBOMS are revision-centric - you view each revision as a separate BOM - whereas PBOMS are date-centric - you see one BOM with effectivity dates for each line showing what is and isn't effective on any given date. By default, displaying a BOM will display all BOM data and printing the BOM will only print the currently effective BOM (same goes for Where Used).<br />
<br />
Engineering is the control, Production is, well, production - what the rest of the system looks at.</div></div><hr />
