<br />
Quick question about customizing the Report Order Completed session as I'm not familiar with Infor development.<br />
<br />
Would it be feasible to duplicate the Lot # &amp; Quantity being reported more than once?<br />
I mean, we are putting multiple Lot # on a pallet and I'd like to report them all at once so we don't have to save multiple time.  On top of that I would like that the Handling Unit behind the scenes are merged automatically.<br />
Is this kind of customization feasible?  I would say yes considering that usually you can do pretty much what you want, it's just a matter of time &amp; money invested at the end :)<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
