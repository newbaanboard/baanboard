I want to ask you , how system calculate material needed for production ? And how system calculate qty rejected ??<br />
<br />
Our BOM like this :<br />
Manufactured item : 108A1 - 1000 kg need materials <br />
Raw Material : SA01012001 - 300 kg<br />
                        SA01012002 - 300 kg<br />
                        SA01011003 - 400 kg<br />
Yield percentage = 97<br />
<br />
But when we create order for 1000 kg 108A1 and we print report ticst0415m000, system print data as follows :<br />
qty ordered : 1000 kg<br />
qty delivered : 1000 kg<br />
qty rejected : 25.6 kg (how to calculate this amount ???)<br />
<br />
and for raw materials needed :<br />
SA01012001 - 307,7 kg  )<br />
SA01012002 - 307,7 kg  )  How to calculate this amount ??<br />
SA01011003 - 410,2 kg  )<br />
<br />
Sample reports Attached.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WE ARE ON BAAN IV C4<br />
<br />
The following is the reply :<br />
<br />
For Manufacturing 1000 kgs. Of item 108A1  your bom specifies the following requirements :<br />
<br />
1) SA01012001                                        300 KGS.<br />
<br />
2) SA01012002			300 KGS.<br />
<br />
3) SA01011003			400 KGS.<br />
<br />
NOW YOU HAVE REPORTED A TOTAL PRODUCTION IS 1000+25.6 (REJECTION)<br />
<br />
I.E.  TOTAL PRODUCTION OF 1025.6 KGS.<br />
<br />
SO FOR PRODUCING 1025.6 KGS OF ITEM 108A1  YOU WOULD REQUIRE  1025.6/1000*400 = 410.24KGS<br />
<br />
OF ITEM SA01011003 , LIKEWISE  IT CAN BE CALCULATED FOR OTHER TWO BOM ITEMS.<br />
<br />
NOW REGARDING THE QUESTION OF REJECTION QTY  25.6 KGS, IT MUST HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY YOU / YOUR COLLEAGUES, EITHER THROUGH SFC OR THROUGH QMS  IF IT IS IMPLEMENTED.<br />
<br />
IT IS NOT CALCULATED BY THE SYSTEM AS I UNDERSTAND.<br />
<br />
THANKS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thks for your reply.<br />
<br />
We are not implement QMS.<br />
<br />
For Yield we are using Continuous type and factor = 97.<br />
<br />
And qty rejected 25.6 kg comes from system automatically.<br />
<br />
If we are using Yield Discrete type, system calculate qty rejected correctly with this formula : 1000 / 0.97 = 1030.92 , it means rejected = 30.92 kgs<br />
<br />
But we don't know how system calculate if we are using Yield with continuous type ???<br />
<br />
Do you know which other factor related with this calculation.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I think there is slight confusion at my end. I was referring to Baan  Manufacturing package (ti). I think you are using Baan  Process package  (ps). Sorry I have no  idea about the ps package.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
We (Ms. Rini &amp; I) are using Baan Vc, with ti package.<br />
Like Ms. Rini said, we just set melting process (e.g. item 108A1) with continous yield factor of 97% (scrap factor &amp; qty = 0) and no other setting are made.<br />
<br />
According to our manual calculation, the rejection should be: <br />
(1000/0.97) - 1000 = 30.93 kg (for the manufacture of 1000 kg).<br />
<br />
So, can you (or anyone) give us answer regarding our problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Al</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the problem reproducible? The &quot;funny&quot; number you were reporting fits perfectly well if the yield had been 97.5% and not 97%. Could there had been an accidental wrong input somewhere? Or did BaanERP rounded down (I doubt it) the number on display? I don't have a BaanERP system in front of me right now, so I can't really check<br />

<br />
I've tried to change the value of yield factor. The &quot;funny&quot; rejection result came from un update field of yield factor.<br />
It was stated &quot;97.&quot; but after I changed to &quot;97&quot; the calculation is correct. It happend for all items with continous yield factor.<br />
I don't know why Baan didn't show a complete number (&quot;97.5&quot; like you guessed).<br />
I'm afraid this case will occur again to other items.<br />
<br />
