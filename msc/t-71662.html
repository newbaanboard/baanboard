<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patotools</div><div class="date">23rd January 2019, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">We have Production orders that require subcontracting operations for which a purchase order must be created. We are using Baan IV C4 service pack 32.<br />
<br />
The problem is that sometimes we have production orders for big quantities lets say 100 unit to be manufactured.<br />
<br />
We start manufacturing the units and we are ready to send to the subcontractor for example 20 units. We want to create a subcontracting purchase order using session  &quot;tisfc2250m000 - Generate Subcontracting Orders&quot; only for the 20 units. <br />
<br />
The problem is that this session creates a subcontracting purchase orders for the whole quantity of the production order, that is 100 units and of course we are not able to create additional purchase order for the rest.<br />
<br />
Has anybody had this issue and how did you solve it??<br />
<br />
It is possible to do what we want in new service packs or in Infor LN??</div></div><hr />

They just ended up creating the Purchase order for the 100 pieces and did partial receipts such as when the first 20 pieces came back.<br />
<br />
As far as later service packs and LN I'm not sure if anything has changed there.<br />
