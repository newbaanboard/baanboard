we want to know how many parcels on one pallet. the parcell size differs from item to item. so the the no of parcels may be various.<br />
is there any input session to maintain this?<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />

We are on BaanIVc2 sch and developed a customized session to maintain these details and some more details required during shipping process for an Item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Chandra.  I am a developer, and I have developed Pallet Quantity solutions twice, so seems like a common need.  I don't think the standard can support this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">volkan</div><div class="date">1st June 2002, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">This is generally for sales people who even dont see the product. There is a terminology in navigation called 40 ambar which means you load different items with diffrent densities and with different quantities. So there is load limit of trucks meanwhile you don't want any space left.<br />
So we genereted a new session to check the weight, length,  weight, height of each item as well as how many colis can be loaded on a container of 20 or 40?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">4th June 2002, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue you are struggling with, depends on how you use the software. There are various units for which the value pallet can be used.<br />
<br />
1) The stock- or inventory-unit. This is the base unit for items. There is no smaller unit than this one for items (in a way...). Since you want to put more items on a pallet, I assume you do not use pallet as inventory unit.<br />
2) There is the storage unit. This one is tricky, because you will need location control *(ILC)* when you use this one. Also: the conversion factor is not rigid. There may be 4 items in a box, and 5 in the next. This is ok for a storage unit.<br />
3) There is a sales unit. This is the unit in which items is sold. There is a rigid conversion between stock unit and sales unit. You can sell per pallet<br />
4) There is also (as you could guess) a purchase unit. The same as sales unit, but now you buy things. Conversion factor fixed<br />
5) Last but not least (I think this is the one you need) there is a capacity unit. This is the unit used for determining the capacity of a location (so ILC required).<br />
<br />
The conversion between item unit (better: inventory unit or stock unit) and alternative unit can be set per item. So where you can put 1 item A (let's say a washing machine) on a pallet, you can put 1,000,000 of item B (replacement nozzles) on the same pallet.<br />
<br />
If your capacity is limited, you should use the capacity unit. But be aware. The capacity limitation must be used with precaution and with understanding of the matter. If you have capacity of 1.5 pallets, you cannot store 2 pallets with 2 washing machines, but you can store 1 pallet with a washing machine and 0.5 pallet with 500,000 replacement nozzles. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if your physical location can only store whole pallets, you can store either 0.5 pallet with item B or 1 pallet with item A. <br />
<br />
Also, if you store 2 pallet-places with 2 * 0.25 pallets (so in the system would be 0.5 pallet), your location is not capable in holding another pallet. In the system the capacity is free, but in real-life it is not.<br />
<br />
Actually these kind of discrepancies between real-life and the software may cause a lot of headaches. Ask for a good ILC consultant.<br />
<br />
Reading the thread over ... you are talking about parcels per pallet, which indicate you use a double conversion between stock unit (per item) to parcel (most probably sales unit) into capacity unit (pallet). Since there is no storage unit involved, all of the conversions are via fixed conversion factors, there should be no problem in the extra conversion.<br />
