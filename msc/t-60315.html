Could you share some tips? I don't think there is any formal documentation available for this at this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There a couple of things that you could look at to get an overview of how to setup Distribution Requirements Planning:<br />
<br />
 Infor ERP LN 6.1 Enterprise Planning - User's Guide for Clusters (U8730A US)  <br />
 Infor365 Support Site ... Support Briefings ... Cluster Planning (this is a new video)  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">30th March 2011, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick reply Mike. I did stumble into Cluster Planning, was able to generate a Warehouse Transfer Order for at least one warehouse. I'll check out the documentation that you have noted as there seems to be something missing in my setup.<br />
<br />
Also, is it right to say that we will need to use &quot;Channels&quot; if we need to use forecast for each store? If this is necessary, I just hope channels and clusters can work together.<br />
