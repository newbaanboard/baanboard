The solution can be resolved by maintaining 2 production orders for the above case, but I am trying reduce the production orders as there are other prodcution orders to be mainatained in the process.<br />

Can shopfloor warehouse be used to show inventory of work in process items.<br />

When you complete a production order, the finished material is posted against the warehouse recorded for that production order.<br />
Shop-floor warehouse is used to receive material required to complete that production order.<br />
In your case, (after you complete operation 2,) the finished material from operation 2 would be used in operation 3. Unless you report &quot;order complete and post inventory to  warehouse&quot;, the material does not get posted in any warehouse attached for that production order.<br />
Shop-floor warehouses are used as &quot;line stocking warehouses&quot;. Those are temporary warehouses which are used store material before it is used for production. &quot;Shop-floor&quot; warehouses are generally maintained by the department head / line supervisor and not by stores / warehouse department.<br />
Hope this clarifies your doubts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes you have cleared my doubt, your answer was precise and to the point.<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So in Ln6.1, there is no way one can track work in process items in quantity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seeace</div><div class="date">8th October 2008, 14:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally what we call WIP is not treated as WIP in BaaN / ERPLN. In order to get the desired details, you may have to customize a report in which you have to consider:<br />
- Input material issued to a production order and<br />
- Output coming out of the production order.<br />
This report would be very rough as you would have cost details for finished goods and raw / input materials only and will not have cost details for every operation.<br />
If you want to be more precise, then you can add the operation cost per operation in this report. however this would make it more complicated and may not justify the efforts unless operation cost is very high compared to material cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">priyanko</div><div class="date">8th October 2008, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree, this WIP term is a misleading thing in LN/baan, your reply is a confirmation to what I assumed, while exploring abt WIP in baan.<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

In that case your production order will be generated but one of the operation will say that the operated item is your phantom item.</div></div><hr />
