<br />
We are currently experiencing a problem within a BaaN IV environment trying to load demands against a GRP environment passing 24-12-2009.<br />
 <br />
A demand raised on a Project (Ie Milestone, CCN link &amp; Hardware Demand) have been raised for 18-03-2010 with the top level item containing a 1 day leadtime, 0 safety time and no routing.<br />
 <br />
PRP has raised a correct MDO, MDD and top level GRP order against the correct date.<br />
When running GRP however, the calculated start date for this item reverts back to 24-12-2009 and proceeds to raise orders for its BoM correctly based on this incorrect date.<br />
 <br />
We have changed this requirement back and forward in time and all works correctly until we pass the 24-12-2009 date.<br />
 <br />
We have changed all manner of parameters, project &amp; costing dates, item/group/leadtime settings, raised manual orders directly into GRP, added false routings, etc. to no avail.<br />
We have also cleared down both PRP &amp; GRP system tables to remove any possible corrupting data and still the problem persists.<br />
 <br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you checked if the Company Calendar is set up for future dates?<br />
<br />
Could you check if there are any error messages logged in the log.bshell/ log.oracle8 (assuming you are using Oracle).</div></div><hr />
