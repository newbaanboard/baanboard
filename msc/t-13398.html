<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">23rd October 2003, 20:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We're finding that our product lines are becoming varied enough to consider using configurations instead of having a separate TLA for every possible combination. We've looked at the configurator in IVc4, but found that the overhead (using Projects, maintaining difficult constraints, etc) makes it too cumbersome for our needs.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a way to manage products as configurations without having to implement Projects and Configurator? For now, we're probably looking at 10 - 20 configuration possibilities. We're looking for either a work-around within Baan or a simple add-on. The idea would be to maintain a handful of major components/assemblies instead of having to maintain a large number of top levels assemblies. It would have to integrate cleanly with Finance and be user-friendly for order entry. Any thoughts would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vavs123</div><div class="date">24th October 2003, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a client who used manufactured phantoms to create the standard effect you may be looking for.  They were a faucet manufacturer and would have the configurations predetermined but not assembled as a configuration until the order was ready to go out.  When the order went to the floor they would have the phantom exploded and pick the appropriate parts.<br />
<br />
This is a distributing solution but could be modified to handle standard manufacturing situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NicoleR</div><div class="date">27th October 2003, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I developed a solution for a client who had 2 product lines  each with about 100 different configurations. They did not want to implement the configurator and projects. Although they had BOMs and part numbers for every possible configuration  they did not want to plan at every finished goods item code. At order entry  they enter the sales order for a specific configuration  using the specific part number.<br />
<br />
The solution offers them the following benefits: planning at the product family level (2 families instead of hundreds of configurations); consumption of the family forecast  in other words every sales order can be related to the product family; MRP is driven using a generic BOM with planning %s. Shop floor control orders are used and these are also incorporated into the MPS  consuming the production plan. <br />
As an added feature  subassemblies are planned through the MPS/MRP for long term planning. However, subassemblies are built based on a kanban mechanism using shop floor control work orders. When a sales order is received the final configuration is put together at shop floor level  using the built ahead subassemblies.<br />
To build this solution I used the MPS (product families); generic BOMs in the configurator (without implementing the configurator per se); shop floor control.<br />
