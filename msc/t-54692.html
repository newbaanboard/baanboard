I need to set a queue/waiting time for operation/routing in BaaN V, but I found I can only set this function for work centre in the system, but you know, for the routing there will be several types of combination among work centres, so, if I set the queue/waiting time for the work centre specified, I can not get the lead time matched with situation of business variably.<br />
For example:<br />
if one routing is from Work centre 1 to Work centre 2,  another routing is from Work centre 1 to Work centre 3, then to the Work centre 2 at the end, if I set the queue time for the work centre 2, that means they have the same queue time regardless from W/C 1 to 2, or from W/C3 to 2. However, according to the real life, may be the work centre 2 is closer with work centre 1, so it should be having a different queue time for different combination.<br />
So, guys, do you have any suggestions for me?<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

you can define many various condition in many item  routing.</div></div><hr />

The work centre is tied to operation in routing, so if the queue time in work centre not changed, the operation queue time would keep the same, which can not meet my demand based on logisitc.</div></div><hr />

I mean, maybe you can create 2 or more  item routing, depend on how many alternative condition that can be applied on your site.<br />
eg: <br />
Item Routing STD (Standard)  :Op 1 WC1- Op 2 WC2- Op 3 (with queue time eg: 1 hour ) WC3<br />
Item Routing ALT (alternatif) : op 1 WC1- Op 2 (with queue time eg: 2 hour) WC3 <br />
So the person in charge can  change the item routing in the production order, than the correct queue time will appear.<br />
What do u think?</div></div><hr />

I understand what you mean now.<br />
So, for Baan way, we can only set the queue time by maunally change, which may add extra work to related man. However, this method is also a way to solve my problem.<br />
Thank you!<br />
Have a good day!</div></div><hr />
