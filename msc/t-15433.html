<br />
I have a problem to understand the logic in Baan and I hope someone can help.<br />
So please try to follow by heart or build up the structure in a test version.<br />
I have 2 manufacture articles A and B with a lead time from 5 days (tiipd0101s000) each.<br />
A is the main article and B the sub in my BOM.<br />
I place the A article at two different times (30 days distance) in my MPS planning and run the MRP, first A and then B.<br />
In my MRP-View Window (cprrp0520m000) at every article I can see planed production orders on time. On time is: Article B is finished first and then the planned production order from article A starts without having negative stock at any time.<br />
Now I make a (PO) production order (tisfc0501m000) for article B which ends at the same time where my planned PO for the second B article ends.<br />
After running the MRP I have a strange situation.<br />
The first planned PO from article B is removed because I made a PO (still ok). I have a Signal which says accelerate your PO cause you need it for the first planned PO article A (??)<br />
The first planned PO from article B is not on time and I have a negative Stock for a long time!<br />
Why Baan did not rethink the planned second order from B and rank it new.<br />
Is it true when there is a incoming quantity by a PO it is always settled with the first demand in the time row? <br />
I hope everyone can follow the description and thanks for your answers,<br />
Harald</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firm planned orders are used first to cover demand. If any firmplanned order is present you will get a reschedule signal.....just as you described.<br />
<br />
After all firmplanned orders are 'replanned' and any uncovered demand is left, new planned orders are generated. These new planned orders 'assume' you follow up on the signals. <br />
(I know......it's a bit annoying....... )<br />
<br />
Also timefences and orderintervals might be the reason for the  planned order to be late (yet another signal....) and you have a negative stock......<br />
<br />
not sure at which SP you're working, but there are/were a few problems with rescheduling.</div></div><hr />
