I am trying not to set up separate repair part numbers every timer we repair product.<br />
We are the service centre for Europe for our product and do not manufacture or repair in house, all repairs would be sent to the original manufacture or an approved sub-con repair house.<br />
My ideal would be to open the part number and then have the option's of standard  or repair costs. <br />
At the moment we use the same part number but with a 'R' within the number string giving it a new part number.<br />

<br />
Repair the part with a manual production order.  Create the order for the part using the same item number.  Using the Estimated Materials and Production Planning sessions, delete all defaults (based on the BOM and routing) and replace with what you actually use in terms of materials and labor for the repair.  These costs could be put into seperate Cost Components for ease of reporting later.<br />
<br />
The item will be put back into inventory at standard cost, but the production order will retain the actual cost of the repair.  You could create individual lot codes for the repaired items to have the link between that particular item and the production repair costs.  Additionally, if cost components are set up correctly, the reporting would be much simplier to query.<br />
<br />
In Baan V this is made simplier with the use of the rework option on the production order.  I'm not sure if Baan IV has this option.<br />
<br />
Don't hesitate if yoy need further assisitance.<br />

Thanks for your reply. <br />
We do not use production orders or the BOM options here, we are a service centre and this work would go subcontract.<br />
