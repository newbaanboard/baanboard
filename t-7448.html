When trying to use the Crystal print device, the error is &quot;2101 Failed to read from worker process! Error occured in worker process:&quot;.  When trying to connect to Baan using the Baan driver Crystal Reports the error is &quot;BDB Error(0): Error occured in BDB Library!&quot;  Any ideas what the problem is?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">17th January 2003, 13:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Although not directly connected to previous posting we have a problem with Crystal Reports not working in as much as the server stops processing jobs , usually at night .<br />
<br />
We have 5 reports running at any one time.<br />
<br />
The techies who look after the NT server say they cannot see any particular problems<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?<br />

<br />
We found no less than 17 &quot;orphan&quot; crystal processes that were running on the unix server.<br />
<br />
All but 3 had been started in the last 3 days.<br />
<br />
Since &quot;terminating&quot; these we have had no problems.<br />
<br />
We have assumed that when server was rebooted the processes became orphans but this  does not account for all of them<br />
<br />
We have been unable to reproduce the problems<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?</div></div><hr />
