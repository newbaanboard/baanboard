<br />
I would like to have some information to know why do we need to have native drivers for crystal reports when developing reports for BaaN.  Is it possible to connect two databases using the crystal reports?  <br />

Because our underlying database for Baan is Oracle, we can access it that way. The data is not as rich as you would see it through Baan though. The driver provides the means to get data out that looks like the data you see when you use Baan. The driver provides the same level of security that you have when logging into Baan. It provides enum string values along side their numerical values. It provides text without having to create the table relationships to get it. As for Crystal, it can connect to multiple data sources in the same report. We have had the Crystal/Baan interface and have used Crystal and Crystal Enterprise since 1999. We have used it to connect to Oracle, SQL Server, Access, Excel, Sybase, etc. Works good.<br />

<br />
Have you tried calling Business Objects support? Other than that I could only speculate any number of possiblities. What version of Crystal and the Baan driver do you have? What Baan porting set do you have? Have you searched the Business Objects knowledge base? I know that sometimes the problem is on the Baan side and we have had to involve Baan support. They knew what it was and fixed it.<br />
