 NAZDAQ (http://www.nazdaq-it.com) Newsletter: Since B2Win was launched in October 2000, it has become a must product for every Baan installation, and likewise in the last few years, for every Infor ERP Ln installation. <br />
  <br />
 We are proud to announce the launching of our latest version, B2Win 7.0 (http://www.nazdaq-it.com/utilities.php?prod=bwinse-pro). <br />
  <br />
 Here are the top reasons to upgrade to B2Win 7.0:<br />
 •    Easier to convert complex Baan and Infor ERP Ln reports to Excel and XML<br />
•    An improved and enhanced method to produce PDF files with PDF logo and different fonts and languages<br />
•    Automatic mode and archiving are now simpler to use and more intuitive</div></div><hr />
