Your post or thread probably does not show up because it needs to be moderated (verified) first by one of the Moderators. To combat spammers we require that all newly registered have their very first post vetted by Moderators. Upon approval by one of the Moderators, the post/thread will be published and additional rights will be given to post in the future without moderation.<br />
 <br />
So to summarize, if you are new registered user and you have already activated your account:<br />
 <br />
<br />
 Post #1: needs to be moderated<br />
<br />
 Post #2 and beyond: like before, will pass without moderation (unless you are a spammer of course!) <br />
Note that we aim to moderate new posts within the same (working) day. </div></div><hr />
