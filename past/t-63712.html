 Merino Services successfully migrates Veethree Electronics and Marine LLC from ManMan to Infor ERP LN<br />
<br />
  <br />
 February 15, 2013, Windefermere FL, USA.: Merino Services a Business Consulting and IT Services organization today announced successful migration of Veethree Electronics and Marine LLC, from old Infor ManMan system to  Infor ERP LN.  <br />
  <br />
 Veethree was using the ManMan ERP system as their Enterprise Application for more than 15 years. Because of horizontal &amp; vertical growth of the organization, the scalability of the application was at challenge. Apart from that there was a need to move to a modern application which can be a backbone to the organizations growth in coming years.<br />
 Veethree management considered various options. Infor ERP LN which is a logical roadmap suggested by Infor to all Infor ManMan customer came up as a favorite choice. Infor ERP LN was considered because of its strengths in manufacturing as well as lower TCO because of Infor’s support in getting ManMan licenses upgraded to Infor ERP LN.<br />
 Merino Services executed the project using On Site- Off site – off shore methodology to migrate from ManMan and implement Infor ERP LN. Merino Services unique approach helped Veethree reduce implementation costs substantially. Merino Services also used its own proprietary migration tool to migrate data from any legacy applications to Infor ERP LN.</div></div><hr />
