<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">21st December 2010, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor, a leading provider of business application software serving over 70,000 customers, today announced that Ventana Research has ranked Infor as a top software vendor in its 2010 Value Index for Financial Performance Management (FPM). Infor scored 90.4%, placing it among the highest rated &quot;Hot Vendors&quot; alongside SAP (90.5%) and IBM (90.4%). Ventana's annual ranking is based on the firm's proprietary independent research methodology, developed throughout the past decade. It assesses how well a vendor's offering meets buyers' requirements, taking into account product usability, manageability, reliability, capability and adaptability, as well as total cost of ownership and return on investment (TCO/ROI).<br />
