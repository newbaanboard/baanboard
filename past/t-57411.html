Merino signed TC Terrytex (TC Terry) one of the leading Terry Towel manufacturing companies as customer and a new logo win for Infor in India. <br />
  <br />
 TC Terry selected Infor ERP LN as a solution because of the Textile Industry Specific Pre Configuration and Add On created by Merino. Though the Add On is a customization but TC Terry was amazed to know that it has been done without touching the source code of Infor ERP LN and hence not making any impact on the support and future upgrades. With solution almost ready to deploy Merino aims at achieving the Implementation with in 60 calendar days.<br />
