With the year drawing to a close, it is time for the usual Seasonal Greetings. But first of all I would like to take this opportunity to thank again all good folks that contributed into making our site the success that it has been over the last 12 years, from posters to promotors and to sponsors. We hope to see you continuing to support and benefit from Baanboard.com in the new year.<br />
 <br />
Finally, I would like to wish all visitors of Baanboard.com a happy year ending and a healthy and hopeful 2015!</div></div><hr />
