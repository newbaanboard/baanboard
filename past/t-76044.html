Baanboard is shutting down on 31-dec-2023!<br />
<br />
This is very likely going to be the last thread ever that I am going to  start on the site. As the title says: we are shutting down permanently on the  last day of the year. When I and my my ex-colleague James Gittins  started the site in 2001, we never imagined it would become such a big  success. 22 years has been a very good run indeed but it is time to move  on. <br />
 <br />
 For the last few months, I have tried to find a serious party who could  continue the site as-is and also bring sufficient commitment and  resources to make the site more up-to-date again. Unfortunately these  efforts have failed so I am discontinuing the site forever. I do not not  have the time anymore to revive the site as is really required to make it a modern &amp; secure platform to go into 2024 and beyond.<br />
<br />
 So what is going to happen?:</div></div><hr />
