 Have you thought about upgrading to LN but don’t know where to begin?<br />
  <br />
 Are you tired of demos where you can’t play in the sandbox?<br />
  <br />
  Do you want to see other Baan users this year?<br />
  <br />
 OST is partnering with the MOSAIC Baan/LN User Group for  a 3-day ERP LN  Lab February 8-10, 2011 to provide a hands-on ERP LN experience.<br />
  <br />
  Registration is $900 per user for the hands-on lab, or, if you’d prefer a  hands-free experience,  $500 to attend the presentations and networking  sessions. <br />
  <br />
 So grab your team and register at http://lnlab.eventbrite.com (http://lnlab.eventbrite.com/)!<br />
  <br />
 Here’s what others have said about the upgrade experience:<br />
  <br />
  “I can assure you that your approach is exactly what we are looking for  from a partner organization… We are excited to move forward with  implementing LN and will be working with our internal folks to get them  on the bandwagon.   You folks have taken a lot of stress off of us while  helping us move forward and I can certainly see opportunity for us to  work together in the future…”</div></div><hr />
