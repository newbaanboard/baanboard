Move customized package/modules from 10.x to package tx in 10.7 or higher to be able to move to cloud semi-automatically <br />
<br />
Hello,<br />
we have developed a tool that moves any customized package, e.g. xx, with all modules to package tx or stand-online sessions in standard packages, e.g. td, to allow Infor customers to have their add-ons run in the cloud with just a fraction of the costs.<br />
The tool has been applied for an Infor customer to move more than 600 customized sessions from individual sessions or standard sessions to package tx and have them run error-free. <br />
Of course, source code has to be converted manually, but also with a minimum effort (tables, domains, and DLL-access have to be changed). <br />
It is also possible to move a customer with Baan V to 10.7 maintaining their customized packages/modules.<br />
For further information contact me.<br />
