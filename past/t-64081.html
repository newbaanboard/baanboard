Why Do We Need ERP and Business Process Automation?<br />
<br />
 Somewhere along the line we started talking about “Serious Business”, we are all “Serious” business people so this comment is not meant to slight anyone or the way business is conducted, it is meant to make people stop and assess their choices and decisions they are making in everyday business. There comes a time when the business starts to be larger than the people who started it and requires multiple people working together, sometimes in multiple locations, multiple time zones, and it just begins to press us to seriously consider how to make our lives easier and to be able to grow our Business with more profits. A few of the reasons why we need ERP and Business Process Automation.<br />
  <br />
 Better Communications with Colleagues and Clients <br />
 More Efficiency = More Profits <br />
 Organization + Standards = More Profits <br />
 Company’s Databases become our Data Warehouse and our ultimate value <br />
 ERP leverages our existing resources</div></div><hr />
