Infor releases ION Support Assistant<br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/system/files/u1/infor_front.gifInfor has recently released the ION Support Assistant (ISA). This tool is available, free of charge, for all customers with a maintenance contract and can be installed on your Baan4 and/or ERP LN system.<br />
Get incidents resolved faster with the help of this automated tool, which gathers reliable and precise information about the setup of your Infor Software and the environment in which it is running. When you contact us with a new incident or question, the Infor Xtreme Support engineers can begin resolving the issue immediately because they will already be acquainted with your specific installation details like portingset, tools version, installed solutions etc.<br />
The ION support assistant also enables Proactive Support.Â  This makes it possible for Infor to send the right message, to a targeted audience, at the right time. A few examples are: when there is a critical bug that only customers running a particular version of the software need to be notified of, or a timely notification when a Database Vendor stops supporting a certain version of their product to only those customers that are running on that database.<br />
More information is available via the Infor Xtreme Portal. <br />
  <br />
 The following Knowledgebase Articles provide further details about ISA.</div></div><hr />
