Technology solutions companies merge, expand client services<br />
<br />
  GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN, March 19, 2008 - Open Systems Technologies, Inc. (OST) announces today the merger of OST and CBS Solutions, Inc. (CBS), strengthening OST's position as one of the fastest growing companies in the IT industry. The addition of CBS will more than double OST's capacity for consulting engagements, adding services such as application development, implementation, and IT staff augmentation. Together, CBS and OST are projected to increase revenue from 30 million in 2007 to over forty million dollars in 2008. <br />
  <br />
 This new expansion into application development and IT contract services significantly expands service for OST customers. &quot;Now we are entirely equipped to cover every conceivable customer requirement,&quot; says Jim VanderMey, OST Chief Technology Officer. &quot;When a complex web application has to be developed for a project we are working on, we can do that. We saw a customer need, and we are glad to meet it.&quot;<br />
  The collective staff of full time employees and contractors now exceeds seventy people - including over fifty technical and business process consultants. That is ten times the number of employees compared to just five years ago. This extensive resource pool enables OST to provide superior depth of service and resources for its customers.</div></div><hr />
