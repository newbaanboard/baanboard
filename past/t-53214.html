 About OST:<br />
 What do you look for in an IT partner? Brilliant solutions? Of course. But how about brilliant solutions coming from friendly, likable people? That’s our modus operandi at OST. And it’s what’s made our last few years such a whirlwind of growth. Like having Inc. 5,000 put us on their 2007 list of fastest growing private companies. And being recently named to CRN’s prestigious FastGrowth100 for two years running. So come on in, kick the tires, and take a look around. We’ve got lots of very sharp folks standing by to take the stress out of your most complex IT needs. You’ll be glad you stopped by.</div></div><hr />
