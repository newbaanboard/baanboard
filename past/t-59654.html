  <br />
 The scope of this project included migration of modules like manufacturing, finance, purchase, sales, warehousing, quality and services with specific reports that were required according to the Bry Air officials. The project was rolled out in 4 different subsidiaries /companies spread across India.<br />

This was a challenge for our MSL team involved in project but we mapped client's requirements 100% within the standard system without any hassles or failure on the time lines.&quot;</div></div><hr />
