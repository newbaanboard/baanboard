Pemeco's Planning Dashboard Enhancements<br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/system/files/u1/pemeco_logo.jpg (http://www.pemeco.com)As a result of feedback from several of our US and European clients who've  provided their inputfollowing enhancements have been added to the  program's functions: <br />
  <br />
 Multi-user Mode<br />
 User and administrators can now create a &quot;back-end&quot; Planning Dashboard instance that centralizes the ERP system data. Many &quot;front end&quot; Planning Dashboard instances can be spawned to refer to this single &quot;back end&quot; version. And only one data refresh to the &quot;back end&quot; is required.<br />
  <br />
 Unattended Data Refresh<br />
 The data in the &quot;back end&quot; Planning Dashboard instance can be refreshed in an unattended mode. Using standard Windows functionality, &quot;appropriately quiet&quot; times can be chosen to refresh the ERP data. <br />
  <br />
 Improved Calibration<br />
 In addition to the new function to spawn &quot;front end&quot; Planning Dashboard instances, the calibration routines have been fortified. Problems where the routines failed to properly calibrate have been corrected.<br />
 Some Baan systems have customizations or localizations that cause the calibration or data load to fail. Please contact us if this occurs at your site. It will be our pleasure to correct the problem or adapt the Planning Dashboard tool to your specific environment.</div></div><hr />
