We currently are on BAAN IV, Oracle database, HP-UX.  One package I have been looking into is Prophix and was wondering if anyone was using it or any other packages people could recommend.  Not looking for Crystal, Hyperion, or Cognos as the last 2 are out of our budget class and the first is now part of another ERP company.</div></div><hr />

We settled on Infor's PM10 solution.  It was a nice package which we were intending to purchase until economic conditions placed the project on hold.</div></div><hr />
