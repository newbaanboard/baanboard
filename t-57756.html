<br />
Absolutely great work!, I really like the game developed by you. Still playing and studying it.<br />
<br />
A piece of advice for its betterment. In any new game the 9th row is always blank, It initially gave me impression whether there was a bug in the code,  but later I enjoyed playing and debugging it. I hope some enthusiasts will suggest upgrades to it in due course of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways thanks a lot for a gr8 code for a wonderful game :)</div></div><hr />

Really there is no reason to make only last row empty. <br />
I think one of first algoritms didn't include &quot;brute.row&quot; array, so leaving more numbers in the top of the board makes the game to be solved faster.<br />
Thus, without any wishes I signed every generated game :)<br />
But yes, for the better visual effect it shoud be corrected<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
