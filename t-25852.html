<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuple9i</div><div class="date">8th December 2005, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Ran into a bit of a problem. I have been playing with the TTAAD4225M000 session to reorganize various tables. The first set were tables that showed chaining and then I went to another set of tables with empty_blocks=0. The first set of tables reorganized perfectly. Problem:<br />
<br />
when I did the first table in the set that showed empty_blocks=0 (Number of never used blocks in the table), the reorg process appeared to go well. It produced the R.{tablename} file, reorged the table and the R.{tablename} file released. Well, when I checked the table, it appears that the data within the table is gone!<br />
<br />
Initial Statistics:<br />
<br />
TABLE_NAME      INITIAL_EXTENT AVG_ROW_LEN  CHAIN_CNT   NUM_ROWS  AVG_SPACE<br />
--------------- -------------- ----------- ---------- ---------- ----------<br />
TWHINH200750         65536           361            0          46340        739<br />
<br />
After reorg:<br />
<br />
TABLE_NAME      INITIAL_EXTENT AVG_ROW_LEN        CHAIN_CNT   _ROWS  AVG_SPACE<br />
--------------- -------------- ----------- ---------- ---------- ----------<br />
TWHINH200750         65536               0            0                0           0<br />
<br />
The R.{tablename} file no longer exists. It dissappeared after the reorg process completed. Please note: there were no errors generated during the reorg process and the process was not interrupted.<br />
<br />
Database: Oracle 8.1.7.4<br />
BaaN:       Porting set - 7.1d.03 (heavily modified)<br />
<br />
Help! Luckily this is a test database/BaaN app, so I lost no production data, but I have planned on doing this in prod very soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">9th December 2005, 02:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Great news!<br />
<br />
There's a &quot;bug/design flaw&quot; the oracle driver. Baan will automatically<br />
estimate statistics for you on your tables after they are created (if you use 0214 in your ora_storage) but it's tied to index creation. <br />
<br />
So, in your case, if you run reconfig without the &quot;fast&quot; option then Baan will create the table, create the indexes, generate statistics then load the data.. So your statistics are on a table with no data. <br />
<br />
I logged a bug on this a year or so ago and i think it was fixed in Baan 5 and up, but it was too much for them to do it in Baan 4 (especally when there is an easy workaround)<br />
