<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sushanta</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Friends,<br />
What exactly the use of stpapi.synchronize.dialog() function.It is not being recognised by our ottstpapihand dll.I am using B40Cc4 with SP8.One peculiar session is there i.e,<br />
tdslsl205s001 which is opened when I am doing save and exit operation on tdind0205s000 which is derived from the session tdind0205m000.But I am not able to import data from the previous sessions to tdslsl205s001 wherein all excise details are maintained.Neither zoom nor application option are working here.Because I think the session ,I am repeating again tdslsl205s001 is opened when I am doing Save and Exit Operation on tdind0205s000.Will synchronize work here or any other technique is there to handle such sessions.<br />
<br />
It is to be noted that I have tested this session independenlty wherein the mandatory fields do not come default.But these come default whenever I am opening from tdind0205s000 by saving and exiting in a user mode.How can I handle in API mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pl. give some solution<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanking You.<br />

You can't use stpapi.synchronize.dialog()  in Baan IV c4. It is only for Baan ERP.<br />
<br />
I feel the subsession tdslsl205s001 is starting independently, instead of starting from its parent session. <br />
If you could post your code, somebody can suggest the solution here.<br />

I could not follow you.What is the difference between Baan ERP and Baan B40Cc4.I have given the VRC.I am also working in Baan ERP.I want clarification from you in this regard.<br />
<br />
Sushanta<br />
<br />
stpapi.handle.proc(&quot;tdind0205m000&quot;,&quot;tdind0205s000&quot;,&quot;add&quot;)<br />
stpapi.put.field()<br />
---<br />
---<br />
stpapi.continue.process(&quot;tdind0205m000&quot;) opens tdind0205s000<br />
<br />
stpapi.end.session(&quot;tdind0205s000&quot;) opens tdslsl205s001 <br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdslsl205s001&quot;,----)<br />
<br />
where defaults fields are not getting imported.Whenever I am trying to put field values in this session,same session independently gets opened.How can I use the derived session tdsls205s001.Because when I am giving ps command in stp shell,then tdslsl205s001 gets opened two times.How this problem can be handled.<br />
<br />
My problem is how can I use the derived session tdslsl205s001 which gets opened from tdind0205s000 when I am doing save and exit operation on it.<br />
<br />
Pl. suggest<br />

Arun was referring to Baan ERP, he is referring to Baan V.  Baan V uses syncronized sessions for main / sub sessions.  This functionallity is not available in Baan IV.<br />
<br />
As for your problem, this is often the frustrating part of AFS programming.  Sessions auto open instead of your hitting the continue process to open them.   I do not have a definate solution as each one can be different.  But you can try playing with the 'add' portion of your handle sub process.  Sometimes this type of problem has been solved by first adding it with a 'kill' option, then after it has been executed and killed automatically, you can issue another handle with the 'add' option, and call the continue process yourself.<br />
<br />
Logic does not always allow for this, but you can try.  Also, read the many posts on AFS problems to get a feel for what people have had to try.</div></div><hr />

I do not see a stpapi.handle.subproc() for tdsls1205s001.<br />
Add a stpapi.handle.subproc() before stpapi.end.session(&quot;tdind0205s000&quot;)<br />
<br />
You can try this.<br />
<br />
stpapi.handle.proc(&quot;tdind0205m000&quot;,&quot;tdind0205s000&quot;,&quot;add&quot;)<br />
stpapi.put.field()<br />
