<br />
We are currently running on BaaN 5.0b and need to start archiving. I was wondering if anyone has any Archiving document on BaaN ERP. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

We are in the same situation with 5b. The responses I have been getting from Baan after logging cases where, &quot;there is a document but it is not realeased yet!&quot;, to the latest where &quot;there is no document&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what is going on because now I am informed that the only way to get documentation on Archiving is to go through the support-eye product and pay for consulting time.</div></div><hr />
