I have seen it working successfully with Seagate Info and shall be setting it up on our server in the office later in May using Crystal Enterprise. It does really require Baan IVc4 sp9 or quite a number of patches if not on sp9.<br />
<br />
If you require any more help please contact me.<br />

It was pretty buggy, the layout extractor code on the Crystal side seemed to have problems with missing sequence numbers and/or duplicate sequence numbers in the report input fields. Unfortunately this is sometimes the case in the &quot;forms&quot;-Reports.<br />
<br />
Working with the template reports for header and footer works ok.<br />
<br />
Worst thing for practical use is that your modifications in the generated Crystal Report are lost any time you recompile the report in Baan! <br />

<br />
Once again many thanks<br />
<br />
On the point of  &quot;losing&quot; the reports is this the case with SP9<br />
as we were told by Crystal &quot;issue&quot; had been resolved with this SP</div></div><hr />

However, we received the CE update 8.5 but it is recommended to install this only with Connector 2.5</div></div><hr />
