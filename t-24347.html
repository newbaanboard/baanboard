<br />
Now I`m testing Crystal Reports XI integrated with Baan.<br />
<br />
I instaled the Integration kit for Baan.<br />
<br />
In the Instalation Manual said that when the instalation finished sucessfully you must copy the file <br />
<br />
shdbapi.dll   <br />
<br />
in a path in the local machine.<br />
<br />
My problem is that I can't find this file.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<br />
if you have an NT Installation then shdbapi.dll should be on your server in BSE\shdlib directory. This only when you have a recent porting set (71d.08 for ERP Vand 7.6a.01 for LN)! In case your are on Unix then your system admin should be able to get ist somehow from the Installation CD's. Or register a case with SSA Global Support!<br />
<br />
As I 've found out you must also license this DLL under the BCLM! <br />
Type of License = Server<br />
Product ID = 7044<br />
This is naturally going to cause unnecessary delays as you have to make a request and enter the activation key when it finally arrives.<br />
<br />
The good old days when you just installed the Native Driver from &quot;Baan Solution Kit&quot; are truely over! (Except if you are using XI with Baan IV).</div></div><hr />

<br />
i noticed you said that if you have enterprise and baan iv you don't need to setup the license server on the baan side.  <br />
<br />
What has to happen for our baan db to show up as a connection within business objects enterprise?  Currently all of our people with standalone crystal enterprise XI can create reports using data from baan, but i need the webclient to do this also.  i have installed the baan driver on the server and copied the shdbapi.dll to to the SSA_BaanIV folder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as you are using Baan IV all you need is to install the Integration Kit for Baan Native Driver and nothing else. <br />
<br />
What has to happen for our baan db to show up as a connection within business objects enterprise? <br />
<br />
In Enterprise you don't see the connections any way. Just publish your reports to enterprise and set the password for the user. <br />
<br />
 i have installed the baan driver on the server and copied the shdbapi.dll to to the SSA_BaanIV folder.<br />
<br />
There was no need to copy the shdbapi.dll to to the SSA_BaanIV folder. It doesn't do any harm either, as the native driver doesn't look for it for Baan IV.</div></div><hr />

I'm now using CR  v10 with Baan V. However i identified that database in CR didn't show tables' name. It only display tables code. Therefore, may i know is there any solution to make it display in CR.</div></div><hr />
