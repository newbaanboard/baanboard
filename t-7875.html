<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunprasath</div><div class="date">29th November 2002, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I am running  Maintain Transactions (tfgld1101m000) session through AFS.<br />
<br />
From Maintain Transactions, second Session is tfacr1110s000 and from this third session is tfacr1111s000.<br />
<br />
I am reading from an ASCII file and running the 3 sessions in a loop.<br />
I am closing all the sessions and opening them again within the loop.<br />
<br />
Now the problem is when I give a huge amount of data in the ASCII file, after execution of approximately 475 records, I am getting a Fatal error.<br />
<br />
Fatal Error: Error base_extern api.messages not found in process 2214<br />
Fatal Error: Can not continue in tfacrsession in DLL: ottstpapihand().<br />
<br />
Has anybody experienced this error. <br />
There is no problem with the input data as I have checked loading them separately. I have the loaded the latest solution 10923. <br />
Please help<br />
thanks in advance.<br />

I can only make a couple of guesses here.  First are there any other processes that may be hanging around that are not mentioned?  Maybe another process that needs to be killed.  <br />
<br />
I see that you check the records individually, but what about checking a 5 or 6 records around the record causing the error.  Maybe it is a combination of these.<br />
<br />
I know this is not much help, but it is all I can think of - short of calling Baan support. <br />

<br />
There are no other processes apart from these three sessions that are running.<br />
And I have checked nearly 100 of records around this error causing record(s).  But that are also working fine. <br />
That shows there is no error in the input record.<br />
<br />
The error comes only after processing 475 records(approx).<br />
<br />
The error message that comes from baan doesnt give any idea of where the error might be. <br />
This error is strange.<br />
pls help<br />

With regards to the Error message you are getting, i.e<br />
<br />
Fatal Error: Error base_extern api.messages not found in process 2214<br />
Fatal Error: Can not continue in tfacrsession in DLL: ottstpapihand().<br />
<br />
<br />
I used to get similar messages  , in the following case :<br />
<br />
Imagine session A calls session B , Now after some processing in session B , commands for closing session B are executed, though ur program logic assumes session B is closed and tries to use stpapi commands in session A ,sometimes session B is still open due to programmatic error or due to some case u didnt take care of .<br />
<br />
Basically ur the AFS program executes the wrong stpapi command at the wrong session which shud have been closed but didnt bcoz u didnt consider a case in the program or the data inthe ASCII file lead it to the above case.<br />
<br />
These are the cases I encountered such errors with.<br />
<br />
I dont really know if the same applies to you , but u can just give it a try , by testing ur program for 4 or 5 reocrds at a time instead of running all the 400+ records at one time ..<br />
Infact as Mark said , check aroung 5 or 6 records before the error occurs....infact taking those last 10-15 will also not take a long time...<br />
<br />
This way u will know on which record did the error occur.<br />
<br />
While debugging these records just see which Sessions are open at each Step in the program...<br />
<br />
U will get the error at a particular point , where u can then check whether the  sessions u expected are up or are there any extra session still up and current.<br />
<br />
Just  let me know if this did help....or if u have already tried and the sessions are opening correctly.<br />
<br />

<br />
There is no possibility that I am not closing the session. because, my code works for records &lt; 470(approx).<br />
I also selected records from 450 to 550 (i.e., around the error causing records)and executed them separately and they ran smoothly without any errors.<br />
<br />
The things I have noticed today will give some idea I suppose.<br />
<br />
What I do is I create a single batch number in Maintain Transactions and each time, I am finding for the batch number and then inserting records into the next subsessions.<br />
<br />
so as the number of records go more and more in the next subsessions, the speed of the closing the session is becoming slower and slower.<br />
<br />
So when I see in Debug mode, it takes more time to execute the line <br />
1.stpapi.end.session(&quot;tfacr1110s000&quot;)<br />
2.stpapi.end.session(&quot;tfgld1101m000&quot;)<br />
In my code, I get the error after execution of the line 2.<br />
Manually also when we close this session after such huge data, it is taking long time to come back to the main session.<br />
<br />
so what I feel is that there is an internal API memory allocation problem. I might be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunprasath</div><div class="date">3rd December 2002, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Today I checked running Maintain Transactions with different subsessions.<br />
Here, I have Maintain Bank Transactions as my next subsession. (tfcmg2100s000).<br />
<br />
so now there is only two sessions. <br />
1.tfgld1101m000 - &gt; tfcmg2100s000<br />
<br />
Here also I open these two sessions and close them inside a loop.<br />
<br />
I again tested with more records.<br />
But today also It failed after processing 475 records.<br />
This is strange.<br />
<br />
The last 2 lines of my AFS code is<br />
<br />
1.stpapi.end.session(&quot;tfcmg2100s000&quot;)<br />
2.stpapi.end.session(&quot;tfgld1101m000&quot;)<br />
<br />
Situation is same as my previous post.<br />
I am getting error after executing last line. (i.e.,stpapi.end.session(&quot;tfgld1101m000&quot;)<br />
Here also I have noticed that, closing the session takes time as the number of records increase.<br />
so this makes me think that this is again internal memory problem.<br />
Baan support is of no use..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd December 2002, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - I think you are right about it being internal memory.  The question I have is it possible that you limit how many records you run through tfgld1101m000?  I do not know enough about the sessions, but from your post it sounds like you open up tfgld1101m000 and then process 475 transactions, before closing tfgld1101m000. I know you should not have to limit the transactions, but it may mean that you have more batches(?? -just guessing) with fewer transactions, but it allows the function server to run.<br />
<br />
And I agree about Baan support - they need someone that is proficient at both the sessions and function server code.  The couple of times I called they really did not help at all.  I have been lucky so far on needing to call them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rohan_rege</div><div class="date">3rd December 2002, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Arun,<br />
<br />
From what I understand of ur problem now is that , ur second session takes longer to end after u execute the stpapi.end.session for it ........<br />
<br />
<br />
The program executes the stpapi.end.session for ur second session and assuming it has already been closed it moves on to execute stpapi.end.session  for tfgld1101m000....<br />
<br />
It hangs because the second session is still open as it is taking longer to close<br />
<br />
Try giving the second session some time to close by putting the foll. command between the two stpapi.end.session's <br />
<br />
i.e  try the following ....infact u can put the delay only when the no of records is greater than 470 <br />
<br />
<br />
stpapi.end.session(&quot;tfcmg2100s000&quot;)<br />
<br />
if record.count &gt; 470 then<br />
 ret=shell(&quot;sleep 1&quot; ,SHELL_NO_OUTPUT)	<br />
endif<br />
<br />
stpapi.end.session(&quot;tfgld1101m000&quot;)<br />
<br />
please let me know if i have understood ur prob correctly and if yes then try the above.<br />
<br />
i tried it in my prog for the same ..it works..... :-)<br />

<br />
Mark, Yes, I can restrict the number of records in the file.<br />
so I can restrict the number of records. that is one workaround.<br />
In that case, I would be creating more number of batch numbers. That is not a problem. So there is a work around.<br />
<br />
and Rohan, I have tried ur idea. <br />
I have added the line suspend(1000) between the two stpapi.end.session().<br />
<br />
Now some good news. I am able to process more number of records.But I get error after some time. after processing 609 records.<br />
that means,  the break between two sessions helps.<br />
I dont know if I increase the break between two stpapi.end's the number of records processed will be more. <br />
<br />
anyhow.. after much struggles and discoveries with of course with your suggestions, I could do something with AFS.</div></div><hr />
