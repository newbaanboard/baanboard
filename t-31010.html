I have heard PlanetPress working in MK, but not in Baan. Is anyone using it? <br />
Our users are looking for PDF, report formatting with images and colors, and signature functionality.  If not PlanetPress are there any other options. <br />
<br />
TIA <br />

I believe others use Crystal Reports, streamserve(I think).  You can do some searching around here - I also think there is a post in the polls about 3rd party products being used.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skennedy</div><div class="date">1st March 2007, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been implementing PlanetPress for over 10 years and have countless installations around the world on just about every version of BaaN or MK.<br />
<br />
We've taken the standard PlanetPress features (fully automated internal/external distribution and archiving) and added additional functionality, via ingenious interactive elements and workflows that  bring  entirely new functionality and logic to BaaN reports <br />
<br />
For instance, emailed POs can be sent to vendors with an Acknowledge button, which vendors can simply click to send email acknowledgements directly to the issuing buyer. Failing to do so within an allotted time triggers the automatic sending of a reminder email to the vendor and the issuing buyer. Any document can be routed through internal approval workflows, each based on data within the given report, as per the rules you define. <br />
<br />
There are also signature capture features, full audit trails and archiving of all documents processed within approval workflows, Sarbanes Oxley compliance auditing features etc.. <br />
<br />
Please visit  &lt;http://www.xpert-inc.com/solutions/intelligentForms/&gt; for some examples. Feel free to PM or contact me for a guided webinar.</div></div><hr />
