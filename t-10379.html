<br />
This will involve upgrading servers from WNT to W2K.<br />
Also involves upgrading from SQL 7 to SQL 2000.<br />
Not to mention our current version of Baan is highly customized.<br />
<br />
Any info would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joergm</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">We did an upgrade from BFO 98.4 SP2 to iCRM 4.2.<br />
Our BFO installation was highly customized (Database and<br />
VBD Templates). <br />
<br />
How can I help you?<br />
<br />
PS one Question:<br />
Why are you upgrading to 4.2 and not to 4.3? According to Baan<br />
all known problems of 4.2 are fixed in 4.3 and 4.3 is faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camdaddy</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Since posting the original message, I found that we would be upgrading to 4.3.  <br />
<br />
I was just trying to get some feedback on the effort required, problems encountered, things to watch out for, etc. when upgrading from a highly customized BFO.  It has not yet been decided if we are doing the upgrade at this time, so I don't have any specific questions.<br />
<br />
Any info would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joergm</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">It is hardly possible to provide usefull information without having<br />
an idea, what you are going to do. To migrate the database for <br />
example you can Install a new Database, modify it with your customizations and migrate your data. Or you can modify your<br />
customized database with the changes in 4.3 (we made it this <br />
way, when we migrated to 4.2). <br />
<br />
Different ways mean different problems.<br />
<br />
In our case we needed about 4 weeks to migrate from 98.4SP2<br />
to 4.2. One week we needed to modify the database scripts. <br />
The other 3 weeks weeks we customized the VBDs.<br />
We means two programmers.<br />
<br />
If you have concrete questions, I will help you as good as I can.</div></div><hr />
