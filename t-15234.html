<br />
Could anyone help me in setting-up of our multi fin/multi logistic company. I have made an initial setting to one of our live company by checking on the archive documentation. Kindly  confirm to me if the below set-up is correct.<br />
<br />
<br />
Set-up:<br />
Company 231 is multi Finance/multi-logistics Company  <br />
Company 210 is a consolidation company <br />
Company 010 is also a consolidation company<br />
<br />
Tables sharing of company 231 has been set for company 201 and 010<br />
<br />
In maintain Logical Tables (ttaad4120m000), company 231 is the Logical company and 210 and 010 are the physical company.<br />
<br />
Now, We have 3 archive companies namely :<br />
<br />
For  231 -&gt; Archive company is 831<br />
        210 -&gt; Archive company is 810<br />
        010 -&gt; Archive company is 020<br />
<br />
From the archiving documentation it says that, make sure that the Logical Table linking between your Archive Companies is set-up in the same way as it is between the live companies.<br />
<br />
And my understanding with that is this:<br />
<br />
Our Logical Company named 831 should have the same set-up with the Live Company 231.<br />
<br />
So, in session maintain Logical table (ttaad4120m000), Archive company 831 is the Logical Company and 810 and 020 are the physical company. While Logical link for mandatory tables like tccom000, tttxt004, tttxt005, tttxt007 and tttxt008  will be shared  to live companies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance.<br />
<br />

<br />
Like you say; the setup for the archive companies has to be same as the live<br />
companies. So archive company 831 is the logical company an 810 and 020 are the fysical companies. Exept table tccom000, which is shared to the live<br />
group company.<br />
The tables ttaad and tttxt we have shared with the archive group company.<br />
This set-up by our company has been made in 1998, according to the BAAN-dcumentation.<br />
