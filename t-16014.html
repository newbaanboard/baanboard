<br />
Please let me know from your experience what is better : to create Crystal Reports based on Baan Tables or on views on these tables. We run Baan 5c  with SQL Server; Crystal 9.0. I need to report on table tdsls451 (sales order lines history) and I'm afraid of a bad performance in Crystal for such a big table.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to create the view on tdsls451 directly in Crystal (maybe using Crystal Query as Database) or do I have to create the view directly on SQL Server ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot and regards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">28th July 2004, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to create an ODBC connection for your SQL Server DB using the provided driver. With that ODBC connection you can then connect and access tables in your database with Crystal. The database may not have primary keys, but index 1 of each table is always created as a unique index. It is just as good as a primary key. All the referencial integrity is controlled on the Baan side, but that just requires that you do a little work in contructing some of that. The table definitions contain a lot of those references that you'll need to go by. I don't have any magic formulas to address this, other than just taking the time to try and understand each relationship.<br />
