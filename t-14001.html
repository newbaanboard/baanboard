I would like to experience the Function Server: it is possible to use the Function Serveur (example &quot;tdilc4201b000 - generate_outbound&quot;) from a script VB? Where I can find an example?<br />
<br />
Thanks to all</div></div><hr />

There are 2 types of function servers in Baan:  AFS Function Servers and DDC Function Servers.  There are standard Baan versions of many functions for both kinds.  <br />
When accessing Baan through VB, you are usually referring to the AFS function servers.   These can be found as libraries you can call from VB.  You can see some of them in the 'cc' package, though they are mostly used by Baan for their open world development, and somewhere there is a listing of the ones they support for outside development calls.  You can also develop your own fairly easily.<br />
<br />
The &quot;b000&quot; function servers are for the DDC.  They require the use of the DDC module to interface to them, usually with 3rd party product (my company sells one) or further in house development, which is a whole other discussion, and I don't think it's what you want.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
