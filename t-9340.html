It takes about 5 minutes or more to show the first record, it opens the session but not data is shown.<br />
<br />
First time I tried to investigate the problem it ran just fine (of course the user thinks I did something :) ). I did run the session with TT_SQL_TRACE and I saved the file &quot;just in case&quot;. Two days after, I ran the session again and I experienced a 10 min delay! , so I saved the TT_SQL_TRACE again.<br />
<br />
These are some of the facts I have encounter:<br />
<br />
1. In the server, the &quot;sqlservr.exe&quot; process is using 1.7 GB of Memory and is specific to this transaction.<br />
2. The first log file is 464 KB, the second is 30.6 MB ! for the same transaction.<br />
3. There is no queries where the fetch time for 1st row is greater than 1 sec.<br />
4. The CPU utilization is minimum (10-15%)<br />
5. I run same session in test company and it runs fine.<br />
<br />
Has anyone experince problems with this session? Or any ideas on how to fix this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<br />
As the data can be different between time A and B I assume it is possible that a bad query behaves different between time A and B, but it sounds weird to me that TT_SQL_TRACE differs between time A and B for the same session. Is it possible to upload the first 100 lines or so of each trace?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
