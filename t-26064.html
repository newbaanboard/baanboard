Refer to the thead - Authorisation... Does it tax the performance (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=22620&amp;highlight=field+authorization) <br />
<br />
Please search for existing theads for gain more insight. You have specified  different BaaN versions, databases and OS in your profile, be specific to the version. Specify what kinda of table field level authorizations did you setup in the Role Data ? Are they part of indexes ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th January 2006, 00:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I will add, that SSA Development is aware that field level validations cause a major slow down.  In some cases, like what data do we display on the form, it's bad but not SO bad.  In other cases (Baan V / Outbounding / Warehouse field level restriction), it's ridiculous, I assume because the same table with the field level authorizations is read like 50 times.  In these cases, SSA Development may have a patched version with more efficient code that will lessen the problem.  So, contact them with specifics as well, and make sure you have the most recent version of session code and tools/porting sets.</div></div><hr />

We had tried to use field level authorization but  left the idea due to poor performance. We are managing the authorizations through sessions only .</div></div><hr />
