   We are using Connectware and some of the calls get the message back from the Server &quot;Transaction already Processed&quot;.<br />
   The transaction key that goes along with the call is redundant, therefore The DDC Server thinks that the transaction has already been processed.<br />
   Has Anybody faced this problem and is there a solution available which can help eliminate this problem.<br />
   Thanks and appreciate the help.<br />

There is a known bug.  The keys are stored in the Baan table tuddc130.  This should be cleaned out, but for some versions of the Baan code, they had a problem holding these values forever.  So, after a period of time, duplicate keys were being found.  This has been somewhat corrected in the recent versions of ddc code - specifically session tuddc1205m000.   There is a problem in the &quot;fix&quot; that it actually deletes keys too recent (15 minutes I believe), but it should work for most.  <br />
<br />
We have a custom version of that code that corrects this properly.   We have that available for all our ddc clients (along with several other DDC code fixes).  We supplied the solution to Baan, but they have not acted on it for years, and are not likely to now.  You may want to check with Connectware, as this problem should be well known to them as well.<br />
<br />
Hope that solves the problem - good luck.<br />
