I am trying to use the stpapi.synchronise.dialog() function but it doesn't synchronise the child session with the parent session. Hence, I am not able to perform the insert operation even after folloing the syntax given in some of the earlier mentioned posts/threads. Please advise the patches I need to put to successfully execute this functionality.<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please have a look at bug patch 15555 for the latest update on BaanERP 5.0b STP (standard program).<br />
<br />
If the bug patch doesn't help solve your problem, please post (fragment of) your code so that we can analyse it better and hopefully shed some light. Also, please be reminded that there's a typo in the AFS manual that can lead to very frustrating mistake when issuing stpapi.synchronize.dialog(). Pls make sure you use all small caps for the 2nd argument of that command, i.e. use &quot;add&quot; even though the manual says to use &quot;Add&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th April 2003, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend that you contact Baan.  Even if we were on Baan V I would be hesitant to recommend a patch.  It seems like every system is a little different - porting set, SP level, etc.  Baan should really provide you with the patch.  We just installed the latest tools patch and had a problem with some stpapi function servers.  Baan said they new the problem(fixed it for another customer) and provided us a fix - which did not work.  So they are still working on our problem.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

After putting the patch it seems to have worked. Also, for the segmented item field tiedm010.eitm = &quot;         001&quot; was not working but tiedm010.segment.2 = &quot;001&quot; worked.</div></div><hr />
