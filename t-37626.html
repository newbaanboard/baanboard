<br />
we use a Kanban system to control stocks in our subcontractors' warehouse. This warehouse belongs to company A. The components for the subcontractor are delivered from company B. Currently, we use a SSC call-off to communicate the demand from A to B, and B has to deliver direct to the subcon. Receiving goods will be done in Company A.<br />
<br />
Quite frequently B is not able to deliver the full quantity but slightly less, which is fully acceptable for the process. As the sales call-off still exists the system will generate another delivery for the remaining quantity. How can we get rid of this? We want B to produce only Kanban sized quantities and under deliveries are ok. Any ideas?<br />
