<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jerrod</div><div class="date">10th December 2001, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Within the documentation for installing the Baan solution kit for Crystal, a mention of creating a device within Baan is referenced but only mentions the Baan admin guide in order to create this device.  Has anyone setup this device and know the setting for Device Data?  I would assume that some conversion and directory layouts would need to be setup, but the documentation doesn't cover this.</div></div><hr />

I know that Crystal's Baan driver support folks are very knowledgable about their product. If you've paid for Crystal Care, then you have a right to access their support group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on Baan IV you need to be on c4 sp9.<br />
on Baan V you need c sp6<br />
<br />
Attached is a screenshot of our BaanERP device, obviously change the port,  server (which is the Crystal Enterprise Server!!)  and path as required.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jerrod</div><div class="date">13th December 2001, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the screen shot!  Just a couple questions.  The port address, what is that being defined for?  Is your environment NT or Unix based?  I'm just trying to determine the settings to insure this is created properly.  Also,  the path you are defining, is this to be written to your machine's d: drive or is this a network drive where the file is written.  I, again, am trying to compare these to the current configuration which is all Unix based, other than the Crystal server.<br />

Thanks again.<br />

<br />
That screenshot was from our W2K enviroment (it was the same when we had NT as the O/S) - however it should apply to UNIX as well.<br />
<br />
The port number is the default port that Crystal Enterprise is listening too, so you should not need to change this.<br />
<br />
The path relates to a directory on the server.  In our case Baan IV, BaanERP and Crystal are all on the same server.<br />
<br />
If you have any further queries I suggest that you contact stewart.oakden@bsp-uk.com directly.</div></div><hr />
