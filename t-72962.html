Creating an Archive Company<br />
Number of archive companies<br />
When you set up an archive company, various concepts and strategies are involved. <br />
You can have one archive company, which will be fed with data yearly, that is, the <br />
operational company will archive its data each year to the same archive company. <br />
Therefore, all data will be centrally stored. However, this concept has one <br />
major drawback: performance degradation. <br />
Due to the transfer of large amounts of data from the operational company <br />
to the archive company, over time, the archive company grows larger than the <br />
operational company. Therefore, you must make enough disk space <br />
available, which, in turn, significantly decreases the performance of the <br />
archive company as more data is archived.<br />
<br />
The second concept of setting up an archive company implies the data <br />
of the operational company will be archived each year to <br />
a new archive company. Having one archive company for each archiving<br />
period limits the size of the archive company, which, in turn, stabilizes <br />
the performance to access this data. You can easily store this archive <br />
company onto an external device for a longer period of time. At the end<br />
of the archiving cycle the data will be cleared. With one archive company <br />
for each year, you can easily drop the entire company at <br />
once, whereas filtering the old data that can be removed from one <br />
large archive involves more investigation and takes more time.<br />
<br />
Another point worth considering setting up the archive company is the <br />
strategy towards migration. If the operational company will be migrated <br />
in the future, the archive company must also be migrated. With this strategy, it is <br />
easier to migrate multiple smaller companies than one large archive company.<br />
<br />
When you archive in LN, you must keep close watch on the company numbers (operational â€“ archive).<br />
<br />
Note<br />
The subsequent procedure for creating an archive company is valid for a standard, non-localized and non-customized ERP environment.<br />
In the examples used throughout this document, companies 001 and 002 are operational companies; companies 901 and 902 are archive companies.<br />
To perform the steps to create an archive company, you must be super user.</div></div><hr />
