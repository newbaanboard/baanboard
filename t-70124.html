<br />
This is for Baan IV<br />
<br />
I want to call Print Purchase Order session (tdpur4401m000) for a range of supplier. I am selecting a Device with Re-write file type . I am specifically setting spool.fileout variable but the system is not generating the file at given path with given name. It is not generating any file.<br />
<br />
The status of purchase order properly set to tdpur045.spur = 3<br />
<br />
Can anybody guide what could be wrong in the given code ?<br />

Second before I do a set.report I typically set spool.device to something specific and then spool.fileout to a file name.  Quick example is something like this:<br />
<br />
                spool.device = &quot;ASCIF&quot;<br />
                spool.fileout = creat.tmp.file$(bse.tmp.dir$())<br />
                print_goods_received(purchase.order,tdpur.kofl.inc.printed,errmsg)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st June 2017, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot to mention - that there have been times where I want to run the same session in 4c4 repeatedly and put the output to a new file.  When I do that the spool.fileout does not always change - so for example if I ran the above code in a look even creating a new temp file the output would always end up in the first file I created.  To get past his what I ended up doing in a couple of cases was importing spool.device (using code extender qkey) and spool.fileout into the called session - that solved my problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your guidance. I was able to generate file after using spool.close() before stpapi.end.session(). Once, the file is generated in temp folder, i just rename it using file.mv(fileout, CURRDATE_BATCH_SUNO). The problem is that it does not generate file for another supplier (obviously as spooler is closed before calling stpapi.end.session).<br />

<br />
I was able to successfully generate a separate file for every vendor. <br />
<br />
The mistake I was making is I had kept the stpapi.end.session() inside the loop. I kept the spool.close() inside the loop and moved out stpapi.end.session() and it worked.<br />
<br />
I have attached sample script if anybody encounters the similar issue.<br />
