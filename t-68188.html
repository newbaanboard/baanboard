<br />
I have developed an SSRS report of standard LN invoice report. Report is coming fine but few calculated fields in report script are not showing their value in corresponding SSRS field. Even those fields are not having any value in xml design. For ex: I have rounded invoice amount field but its value is showing without rounding, whereas same report printed in LN is showing proper values.<br />
All such problematic fields are defined extern and included in input fields of report too.<br />
Basically my problem is i want &quot;invoice amount in words&quot; to show rounded off value and in LN it is showing. But in SSRS, it is showing value without rounding for std variable. I have tried this using standard variable that was present initially in std. program script and also by defining a variable in report script. I assigned rounded value in words to my report script variable but it is showing blank value. Even the value is not present in xml design.</div></div><hr />
