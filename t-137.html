<br />
What version of Proloq are you using?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">James</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 21:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Proloq is an add-on software package for Baan.<br />
<br />
The main area of additional functionality being the use of multi-dimensional items (Manufacturing Package).<br />
<br />
This is useful for example if the business in question manufactures goods which are not finite in quantity.  For example, a cable making company will produce rolls of cable in un-determined quantities(and of different item types) and will be sold in dynamically sized quantities.  Mapping this kind of business model to standard Baan software is not possible.  <br />
<br />
The software is (was) problematic to say the least :)  Its now wrapped up as Baan Dimensions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I'm not a functional guy I'm probably not the best person to consult about this.  Though I can put you in contact with many people who can.<br />
<br />
My few thoughts are:<br />
<br />
* &quot;Size&quot; would not be a dimension, and I'm unsure how you could use specifications.<br />
<br />
*What version of Proloq do you have installed and what purpose does it currently fulfill?<br />
<br />
* Could you not just use standard Baan functionality for this?  Maybe you could create an Item for each combination of Shoe Type, Colour, Size.  I guess it depends on how many variables you have and whether the item list would be manageable or not.   But I cannot see why this would not work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Does the item's feature change frequently during process?<br />
YES -&gt; the feature is a dimension<br />
NO -&gt;  the feature is a specification (spec)<br />
<br />
2. Does the value of the inventory unit change when feature changes?<br />
YES -&gt; feature is a dimension<br />
NO -&gt;  feature is a spec<br />
<br />
3. Is the sorted inventory based on one of the features?<br />
YES -&gt; feature is a dimension<br />
NO -&gt;  feature is a spec<br />
<br />
4.Is the feature part of a standard item shape?<br />
YES -&gt; feature is a dimension<br />
NO  -&gt; feature is a spec<br />
<br />
After you have answered the questions, you'll have a list with a number of characteristics that can be considered dimensions.<br />
