I found some great software at www.fytek.com that enables this.<br />
<br />
text2pdf takes the text output from a report &amp; converts it into a PDF file.<br />
pdfmeld allows you to use a take a predesigned PDF file containging logos, watermarks etc &amp; use this as a template, overlaying the converted PDF file from text2pdf therefore creating a combined PDF document that looks like it has been printed on preprinted stationary.<br />
<br />
I created a new device &amp; print spooler that incorporates the software &amp; e-mails the PDF to the recipient. Maybe this could be a start to the mythical paperless office.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, if someone knew the PRICE DIFFERENCES between these packages, that would be nice.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to get a feature-by-feature breakdown?  I am having difficulty in choosing.  <br />
<br />
From what I see, Formscape might be OVERKILL for our needs.<br />
<br />
Is Formscape an industry standard package?  I need to know if I should train myself in it, or not even bother.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">30th July 2008, 16:59</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I take it back what I said about Formscape being overkill.  It is actually inefficient, and this &quot;FormDesigner&quot; is EXACTLY what we need.</div></div><hr />
