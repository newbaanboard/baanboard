<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GeekGirlAkshara</div><div class="date">3rd August 2020, 08:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello There! This is my first ever post on Baanboard, so pardon me if i do some silly mistakes. <br />
I have created a CC BOD for ReceiveDelivery by following instructions mentioned in Infor LN BODs and BDEs Development Guide , <br />
The Concern was - we want to send in ION the requester name of PR if any for the purchase order for which GRN is being done. (simple query. that's not the problem)<br />
By my senior's advice i chose ReceiveDelivery BOD to work with. Now the problem is, when i try to run the BOD in debugger mode, i expect it to be open while GRN process. But no luck.. It did not open.<br />
Also, i tried to publish it in simulate mode and kept Logging output as - BOD and ticked Single XML file per BOD so that i can get an output in xml file to check whether the values passed by my CC BOD are there in UserArea or not. Hardluck this time as well.. there are no values in User area.<br />
So my question is - is the chosen BOD correct for the purpose? is the method of publishing it is correct? or is there anything wrong with my proceedings.? Please suggest.:confused:</div></div><hr />

1. Is the BOD Registered in BOD Implementation Registration<br />
2. Is the Order Type a valid order for publishing ReceiveDelivery BOD?<br />
3. Is your CC script named correctly? <br />
<br />
AFAIK,the ReceiveDelivery BOD can NOT be used for Direct Delivery PO's receipts.<br />
<br />
Also, check if you have an entry in tlesb300 for ReceiveDelivery.<br />

Hi Bhushan! Thanks for the warm welcome and prompt reply!<br />
I checked all four things you told me to and i found that all of them are on place at my end. <br />
* There is an entry of the BOD in Implementation Registration<br />
* We don't use Direct Delivery method, instead we do receive process from warehouse order (If I'm not wrong, Direct delivery is when you release the purchase order, it is considered as it's receipt.)<br />
*CC script name is boinhbl801cc00 which looks good to me as i followed the naming convention from user guide.<br />
* Last, there is also an entry in the table tlesb300 for ReceiveDelivery.<br />
still i have the same problem. what could have gone wrong?:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">4th August 2020, 08:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the entry in tlesb300 correct? Is it for a Sync or for Process or both? Is it for the correct company from where you are triggering the BOD? Also check if the noun in present in your ION repository. You can use session whbod0200m000 to simulate the BOD. See if it is giving you a positive count for your receipt number. Also you DLL function should be something like - boinh.bl801cc00.get.additional.elements()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GeekGirlAkshara</div><div class="date">4th August 2020, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">The entry in tlesb300 is for sync only. does that affect it?<br />
Yes I'm triggering it from the same company we are using.<br />
checked with whbod0200m000 it is giving count as 1.<br />
Now the unchecked things are ION repository and dll function.<br />
can you pls suggest which DLL to check as im not able to recognize the correct one. we have one as whinhdll8000 i.e. BOD support functions. but it is standard and cannot be opened.<br />
and about the ION Repository, I will check and will let you know. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Akshara.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">4th August 2020, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">By DLL I was referring to BOD CC script.<br />
<br />
The script should be named as boinhbl801cc00 and should have a function called boinh.bl801cc00.get.additional.elements.<br />
<br />
The tlesb300 entry should be in the same company and should look something like - <br />
<br />
Verb = Sync<br />
Noun = ReceiveDelivery<br />
 Logical ID = Correct Logical ID<br />
<br />
Now, put the CC script in debugger mode and do a confirm receipt for a PO and it should be triggered and CC script should open up in debugger. If not, then there is something wrong with the setup as discussed earlier. If nothing helps, try contacting Infor support and see if you are missing any solution related to this BOD.<br />
<br />
 I don't recollect anything else apart from the points already covered in above posts.<br />
<br />
If the session is giving you the count = 1 then I think the only thing preventing it could be  a wrong entry in tlesb300 (Either noun name/logical ID) or absence of the metadata in ION Repository. I am assuming, there are existing BOD's running in the same company and being published, so I can skip the ION side setup issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GeekGirlAkshara</div><div class="date">4th August 2020, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Bhushan, I will recheck the mentioned things and will post again if i get the solution. <br />
Thank you so much for your time. Take care!<br />
