<br />
I have changed the sort of an item through VB.<br />
When I look at the new screen on my pc the screen looks fine but when I load it onto another PC the elastic does not seem to work, even when you maximise the screen it still stays small.<br />
<br />
What could be the reasons for this to happen<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can I ask what version you are on and what operating system you using and VB?<br />
<br />
The only thing I can find is that it worked and compiled fine on windows 98 now we are on XP I get the same issue with the elastic.<br />
<br />
I'm using VB 6.0 windows XP and CRM 4.3 SP4<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraP</div><div class="date">25th May 2007, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to be something to do with the vsocx6.ocx file.<br />
This is in c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
My original one was dated 8/12/1999 baan support sent me one dated 24/05/2007 and replacing this file seems to have done the trick.<br />
<br />
I have attached a copy for you.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
