We'd like to start archiving data, but would like some kind of procedure to follow.  We're running B4c3...  Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is the document you mean. I did post it on an earlier thread to someone but now cannot find that thread.<br />
<br />
This document is a good start and the section on setting up archive companies is extremely useful. Please be aware that the document is dated 1998 and obviously since then there will have been minor changes to some of the sessions and obviously patches as well.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
