   please see the situation and let me know of any suggestions.<br />
   If i introduce a new argument in the Function Server , the new argument is not being recognised during the test function server (tuddc2530s000) Run. It shows up on the form and all that but when i put the script in the debug the value that i give on the form is not showing up while debugging.<br />
  i debugged the tuddc2530s000 also and the Bucket is sending the vlaue for the new argument....so this one beats me.<br />
    Ex :- <br />
   i have a putaway in bound advice with 5 arguments and then i add the sixth one.<br />
   To test the same , i run the test function server and the argument value is zero , all the other values are shpwing up right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vavs123</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you running Baan IV or V?  At one point, Baan IV introduced a patch which added a field to custom written function servers.  It caused all of the fields to be off by one.  The odd part is it was introduced by a patch to the finance module.  I am not sure if that is what is happening here or not.  Who wrote the function server?  What middleware are you using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanv_consultan</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">It is Baan V (B) and the middleware is connectware. Anyways...even if i make a new function server , all the field values are not being recognised.  The masking looks ok to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Vavs is correct on the patch (Hi Vavs :))  If that's the case, all of your variables would be off in sequence by 1.  Make sure you have the latest update to Test Function Server.<br />
<br />
The middleware would not affect Test Function Server unless they customize tuddc scripts....did they customize the ddc scripts?<br />
<br />
Is the value not passed even before the 'init.ddc.vars()', 'format.variables()' and 'check.variables()' functions are called? First check if it is there before those functions and maybe one of them is resetting the value.  If it's not there right on the entry, check the naming and domain as displayed in Maintain DDC Function  (tuddc0130m000) are correct to your thinking.   <br />
<br />
The bmsmask would allow the function to run or not run, but after that's set up it does not need to be updated for input field changes.<br />
<br />
Worst case try copying the function and requerying to make sure you didn't get stuck somewhere in the conversion.  If still the others come through and yours does not, check the naming again.  If none of the input fields comes through...maybe a problem with your query script?  <br />
<br />
Send script pm to me or post if still problems - just the ddc entry part without your inbounding logic should suffice.  If I can query and run and get accepted values here - then it's the ddc.  If not, maybe I can see what is wrong real quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanv_consultan</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 01:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response...<br />
<br />
The ddc scrips are vanila Baan...no customizations on those.<br />
<br />
The value is NOT passed before init.ddc.vars()...the other values are on entry but this one is not present on entry<br />
<br />
Funny thing is that the same code wroks fine in a different dev environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">If they work ok in 1 environment, and not the other...it should be a VRC dependent problem.  Maybe the domains are not properly defined in both?  <br />
Did you try copying to a different script number/session number and compile/requery.  Do all the fields show up, or is it still missing only your added field?</div></div><hr />
