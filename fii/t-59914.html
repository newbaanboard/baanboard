<br />
We didn't have it in 5C and not being aware of it's function is causing invoices to go unpaid.<br />
<br />
In the attached document you can see that the invoices are approved, but the &quot;Approved For Payment&quot; box is open.  Unless we select &quot;Yes&quot; those invoices won't pay.<br />
<br />
If the 3-way match has already taken place, what is the reason for having to approve an invoice?<br />
<br />
Lastly, is there a way to turn this option off?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Mike</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">4th February 2011, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">The different approval terms may also cause some misunderstanding:<br />
1) Approve the invoice, with this action you create the approval document with the relevant postings.<br />
2) Invoice Approved field in tfacp1142. If there is a price difference or additional cost added and the user who starts tfacp1142 has enough authorization to approve the invoice, then the user can switch that field on, so that during 1) the real approval these checks are not executed again and everybody is able to approve that invoice.<br />
3) Approved for Payment. This is a new topic introduced in FP3. If you switch on this functionality (you can switch it off by deselecting all checkboxes in the ACP parameter session for the Payment Approval groupbox), then you first have to approve the invoice for payment before payment can take place, no matter what setting in CMG.<br />
