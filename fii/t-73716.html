<br />
you should check user setup as Mark said. After that, if one user getting &quot;Table does not exist&quot; error, then it can be, the user using different company from the others. <br />

<br />
I've check the user setting whose getting the error with users in the same company. the settings are the same.<br />
the other users who can access the session without any error are also from the same company.<br />
<br />
i've tried to change the company code for the user, she can login to tfgld3501m000 without any error.  meaning she's getting the error only in one of the financial company in LN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've deleted the users defaults for session tfgld3501m000, and she's able to open the session in the specific finance company.<br />
<br />
delete user defaults session - ttstpdeldeflt, it works.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

Still don't know why it happens, but it does happen. ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th February 2021, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">A different user?  Is there any information in any of the other log files?<br />
<br />
I did find this on thread on the board http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=38650 - it is possible there is some data corruption on some records.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">17th February 2021, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">It's an error somehow caused by the stored mask data (the data retrieved by the function get.screen.defaults()).<br />
While I understand, this is a very useful function in print and update sessions, Baan/LN seams to store data in display sessions, too. <br />
We do have this error in some tf session (tfgld3501m000) and in some wh/logistic sessions. I think it is some kind of data corruption within the stored mask default data.<br />
The session will not start, but crash. It is always &quot;corrected&quot; with ttstpdeldflt.<br />
I've never reproduced the error (I remember trying once). My theory is like this: it happens, when the user changes the field layout with personalisation (i.e. hiding fields on the mask or moving fields in a grid). Then the stored default data does not initialize some fields in a correct way and the session will crash because of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th February 2021, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point! We used to tell user not to save screen defaults - period.  If we modified something on the form the user might not get the form to open and it would error out, but usually with a screen default error.  I don't recall all the errors we got from defaults.  And the worst offender was ttstpsplopen - saving a printer would eventually corrupt on its own.  I used to go and delete defaults on it often back in the day. <br />
<br />
The same with cutting and pasting from word - we used to get weird stuff in the data when they did that.  And some of it was almost impossible to find and fix.</div></div><hr />

Yes, we used to have this, too! I remember fixing texts in baan4 by copying and pasting them into a normal text editor (getting rid of hidden special characters in the text).<br />
<br />
With the switch to LN this problem seems to have disappeared.</div></div><hr />
