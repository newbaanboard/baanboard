<br />
We have bought an asset in form of Land. Now we want to maintain this assets in our fixed assets module. Few of the queries we have is<br />
<br />
What depreciation method needs to be defined for this asset, It's a non depreciable asset. In fact its a appreciable one.<br />
<br />
What should we enter as &quot;Date of Last use&quot; for this asset in the Fixed Asset master data.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to avoid any depreciation calculation or 0 amount as calculation against this asset.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
You can creat separate category and link depreciation code having method &quot;None&quot;.<br />
<br />
In asset life you can enter maximum life for year is 200 and month 11.<br />
<br />
Since depreciation method is None system will not calculate depreciation for Land<br />
<br />
Please try and put result on Baanboard for information to others.<br />
<br />
In case of Baan 4 maximum life can be entered 99 years and enter 0 for the method &quot;Fixed Amount&quot; <br />
<br />

Thanks for the reply. Please note that my question was related to BaaN IV and there we don't have any depreciation method as None, in fact we have this in LN 6.1.<br />
So I assume that I should use here a depreciation method as &quot;Fixed amount&quot; and the amount should be maintained as '0'.<br />
<br />
Please clarify, How the end date affects depreciation calculation amount. I understand that the end date denotes the useful life of an asset by which the asset would be worn out completly.<br />
<br />
I appreciate if you can have any Baan IV Fixed assets document to share with.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
End date is getting calculated based on number of years of asset life we enter. it will be 99 years in case of land asset. End date is applicable for the depreciation method &quot;No. of Years in Use&quot;. So in your case it is not relavent. In any case 99 years are too long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot for the provided clarification. One more query, If we are not linking depreciation code with Fixed Asssts group through &quot;Maintain Group depreciation data&quot;, will system gives any message while depreciaition for other assets are being calculated.<br />
