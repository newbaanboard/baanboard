<br />
I need help on EU VAT on Sales. The Business Partner (Sold-To, Invoice-To, Pay-By) is Switzerland which is a non EU Member. The Ship-To country is Germany which is EU Member. The Goods are Shipped from Belgium which is EU Member. This Business Partner has a valid Tax ID Number of Germany. <br />
<br />
Baan calculates VAT on the Sales Order - since the Invoice-To Country is non EU member, the country is defaulted to Ship-From Country in this case Belgium and the Tax is defaulted to the code on Item Sales Data.<br />
<br />
Our client says Tax should not calculated on the Sales Order. Would like to know if Tax should be calculated or not. Is there any document for VAT on this scenario where goods are shipped between EU Member states but the Invoice to is for a non EU Member state.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Babu</div></div><hr />

 i got something for you as follows...<br />
<br />
For the purpose of exports between the Community and non-member countries, no VAT is charged on the transaction and the VAT already paid on the inputs of the good for export is deducted - this is an exemption with the right to deduct the input VAT, sometimes called zero-rating. There is thus no residual VAT contained in the export price.<br />
<br />
if that helps you its ok else let me know about what else you wanna know,<br />
regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
first the customer is right. It is an EC Sales if the ship-from address is in one EC country and the ship-to address is in another EC country and if the invoice-from-company (so the company issuing the goods) and the invoice-to company (so the company receiving the goods) both indicate their VAT number,so that they can occur on the invoice.<br />
<br />
What you need to do is to create and use a correct Invoice-to-address that the user has to choose correctly in the Sales Order. This must look like this. As I attach an example I refere to the countries in my docu n ot on your example but it is basically teh same. In my example goods go from germany (so assume u are a german company) to UK but the Inovice goes to Hong-Kong. So create an address wherer you enter on the first form the country Hong-Kong and the address in Hong-Kong. The country in this case is needed to select e.g. the correct address format. Usually as well it determins the VAT country but.................................<br />
<br />
............................an enhancement shiped with a solution has been done to define on form two a country for VAT. And if you enter a country there the system uses this one - not the one on form one - to determin the VAT country. So u enter UK. And now the VAT calculation will find DE to UK which is an EC Sales. As well you have to enter in the address the UK VAT Id-Number, else system does not return EC Sales, it returns Germany / VAT code from item master file as the system believes the customer has not VTA number and is a private person.</div></div><hr />
