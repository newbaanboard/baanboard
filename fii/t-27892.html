<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brad997</div><div class="date">16th August 2006, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi gurus,<br />
I need your help urgently.  Please help.<br />
<br />
Somehow my users incidently produced one document displayed in tfacp2525s000  (Display Purchase Invoice Data) with invoice status=Approved but the Document Approval is blank in tfacp2525s000.<br />
But this document is printed out in the &quot;Finalized Transaction by Doc. Date&quot; under a ledger account (say 2121933).<br />
<br />
Upon checking report tfacp1433m000 (Print Invoices Receipts Specifications) , the document is not printout , means it is actually not yet Approved. Only status in tfacp200 is changed as Approved and there is no Approval document details present. <br />
<br />
I am advised by someone of 2 options:-<br />
<br />
Option A. To change the invoice status to &quot;Registered&quot; from tfacp200 table and Write off the Invoice <br />
OR<br />
Option B. Issue a Purchase Credit note for the same amount and link it to this invoice and to Delete the Invoice postings from tfacp200 table and from tfgld102/tfgld106 table.<br />
<br />
MY QUESTIONS:-<br />
1. Based on option A, how to Write off the invoice (I'm non finance)? <br />
<br />
2. Based on option A, since this transaction is reflected in the Finalized Transactions report and under the ledger Account 2121933, will there be any impact on GL, opening &amp; closing of the ledger account, Trial Balance, Ledger History table,  and other tables?<br />
<br />
3. Based on option B, how to do the Issue Purchase Credit Note for the same amount and link it to this invoice? Also do we need to skip the matching and proceed with the approval to ensure only one sided transaction is taken up?<br />
<br />
4. Beside Delete the Invoice postings from tfacp200 table and from tfgld102/tfgld106 table, are there any other table such as those impact on GL, opening &amp; closing of the ledger account, Trial Balance, Ledger History table ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
No need to attach credit note as there is no problem in the invoice and once approved it can be paid.<br />

Baan used is BaanIV.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reply.<br />
However the  document was finalized and found in tfgld106.<br />
The document somehow is approved invoice status displayed in tfacp2525s000 but with no document approval. It  is actually not yet approved as checked against tfacp1433m000 report.<br />
<br />
What does the write off invoice means as suggested by someone?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">h_baan_ln6</div><div class="date">16th August 2006, 13:28</div></div><div class="posttext">This means the approval field in tfacp200 is wrongly updated. Make it registered and then approve the invoice.<br />
<br />
By Write off one could mean attach a credit note and make balance 0... then make a new invoice...<br />
<br />

<br />
It sems I am not getting your Question correctly.. You have a fair Idea of BaaN Finance and should not be stuck in such a small issue..<br />
<br />
Process:<br />
<br />
Make Invoice : Table tfgld102--&gt; tfgld106, tfacp200 with status as registered.<br />
<br />
Approve Invoice : Tfacp200 status changed to Approved and approval document no updated in the table. Approval document also created in tfgld102  ---&gt; tfgld106.<br />
<br />
Now what is the status in youjr case..<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
