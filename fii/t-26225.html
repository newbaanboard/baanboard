<br />
We are on Baan IVc4NAS0 SP19 on an HP/Unix with Informix.  I have a question regarding ledger accounts.  We have an account that is off by a few dollars and would like to do a one sided entry to get the account in balance, since we had a batch error when our system went down in the middle of a process and we know why it is off.  All other accounts are fixed and okay except for one.  We used to be able to do this by flipping a couple of fields in the tfgld008 table, but it seems that is not possible any longer.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone that knows how to do this now or at least all the tables that definitely are affected so they can all be put back insync?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Best way to handle this is entering the open(purchase/sales/advance) entries  . <br />
<br />
Other than this for normal ledger account u can insert records in tfgld106 and rebuild the ledger from trx .</div></div><hr />

There is a report that can be run over imbalanced documents - that you can fix in tfgld106. If a controll account is concerned - please do give more details.<br />
