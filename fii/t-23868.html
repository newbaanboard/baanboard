Hi Moon,<br />
   We have finished above items, but still cannot close current year. It is very strange :( <br />
Best Regards,<br />

<br />
1. Period Status Record not present in tfgld007 for those company and those year<br />
2. Period Status Record not present in tfgld007 for those company and next those year<br />
<br />
Please check the record directly on table tfgld007 with GTM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cucucucu</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 03:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Moon, we had checked. They all exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moon Lok</div><div class="date">28th April 2005, 08:23</div></div><div class="posttext">It should be my last chance to guess on your situation. Have you defined the period status with all kind of period type (Fiscal, Reporting and Tax). If No, try to add those back. If Yes, I think you should log this case at Baan Support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cucucucu</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, we defined all kind of period type.<br />
Anyway, I am very appreciated your help. :)</div></div><hr />

First of all, is your problem solved? ;)<br />
If no, what is the end date of 2003 and the beginning date of 2004<br />
Are you in a multicompay setup?<br />
If so, is the compay 155 a group company or a sub company?<br />
Is the table tfgld007 shared?  (You can see this in session display logical tables)<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

I have checked all areas as well.  MariaC says to check that your period status record exists.  Where do you check that? :confused: Does anyone have the answer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
AND<br />
<br />
tfgld006!!! (as mentionied also for the TAX Period).<br />
<br />
(Subsession tfgld0106s000 from Maintain Periods in the finance tree).<br />
<br />
Our finance had this error today with the 31.12.2006 because tax period was ending in table tfgld006 on 30.12.2006, which results in this error message.<br />
<br />
