<br />
We have a client who produces excise products (alcohol drink, pop drink) (excise is one kind of tax). Classic tax (VAT) depends on sales price (e.g. Sales price =1000; VAT=20%; Total VAT=1000* 20/100=200). Excise is tax that depends on shipped quantity (e.g. Shipped quantity =10 pcs; Excise per unit (pcs) = 1.5; Total excise amount = Shipped quantity * Excise per unit = 10*1.5=15). <br />
I hope that you can understand our problem. <br />
We tried  to simulate excise with item surcharges with surcharge method fixed cost on issue from warehouse. This is OK when we made issue (finance transaction Sales-&gt;Item surcharge) from warehouse but that surcharge(cost component) appear in other finance transaction (Cost of goods sold,...) and when we made warehouse analyzing that tax (excise) is included in cost of goods. <br />
Do you have idea how we can solve this problem? Does exist any localization which support this type of tax?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Maybe there is a localization...u should ask Baan.<br />
In the meantime my suggestion is:<br />
Instead of using a surcharge u could use a cost Item and when booking the sales invoice u would generate diferent bookings for the sale of that cost Item (i.e. Tax acounts Credit ).<br />
The cost Item does not have a &quot;standard cost&quot; so it will not go into cost of sales,  but for the sale u could book it into a credit tax account.<br />
Hope this will help.<br />
