<br />
you want to avoid the invoice route, i.e. you don't want to book an invoice and then process the payment. You have a free payment, am I right?<br />
Instead of &quot;booking an invoice&quot; you &quot;maintain a standing order&quot;. <br />
But the process after &quot;Maintain standing order&quot; is the same as for an invoice. <br />
<br />
Then you do tfcmg1220m000 Select Invoices for payment, the last field &quot;select standing orders&quot; should be set on YES. <br />
And you process the payment as usual. <br />
<br />
Bye, Juli:p</div></div><hr />
