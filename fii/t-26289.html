<br />
i am a bit in problem (rather confused...) on this Fin. Company &lt;-&gt; EU &lt;-&gt; Logistic Comp. Concept &amp; relationship in LN6...can anybody plz make it clear to me...?if have some help file or document or link on this topic...plz give it to me or plz mail me on: dilipk.pandey@rediffmail.com. i hope this much is sufficient to let the seniors know what i want...else: well ther is a financial comp.(FC) linked with a logis. comp(LC) through EU which is a seperately defined corporate structure having PO,SO, warehouse etc... , one FC can hav more than 1 EUs and in ever trasaction all the Financial part goes to FC while the LC works as common register for all EUs under FC to provide the common info like BP, logistics info,production details etc...so now inLN6 no LC is directly connected with the FC but via EU...this is what I understand about FC,EU and LC...I may be wrong somewhere/everywhere...so please help me to understand the concept if any of you hav worked on this part of LN6..<br />
hope to hear from some of you soon,<br />
<br />
thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
best regards,<br />
Dilip, IND.</div></div><hr />
