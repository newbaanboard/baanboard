.:confused: <br />
I have tried various combinations but not sure about the combination. I am doing a check print for a different payment method for one check for multiple invoices. <br />
<br />
If I have my composing option as invoices and limit one, shouldn;t the composing take place of individual invoices.<br />
I am not sure about composing action.<br />
<br />
Appreciate replies.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

With remittance is does not do it. I will again try with more documents and then test.<br />
<br />
If not then I guess there is a bug and need to get help from BGS !<br />
<br />
But would you be knowing the exact functionality of composing action. This has always been confusing.<br />
<br />
THanks for your inputs and posting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a payment document the payments can be done per invoice or group of invoices can be composed to one payment line. With the composing option it is decided how these payment are to be composed per supplier or customer. Payments of sundry supplier are not composed.<br />
<br />
Composing Option<br />
<br />
-- Invoices : Based on a number of invoices the payments are composed. This option is used when on a payment document a number of lines are available to print the invoice details(checks)<br />
<br />
--Characters : Based on number of characters used in the reference of the payment the douments are composed. For bank orders a number of characters are available to print the payment reference.<br />
<br />
--Remittance : All invoices for the same supplier or customer are composed to one line on the payment document.  A remittance letter is printed which can be send.<br />
<br />
Composing action<br />
<br />
--Remittance : When the number of invoices/characters is exceeded all payments will be composed to one line and a remittance letter will be printed for the payments.<br />
<br />
--More : When the number is exceeded a new composed payment will be created. In this case more than one payment will be done to the same supplier.<br />
<br />
--None : The payment will not be composed automatic but it is to be composed manual.</div></div><hr />
