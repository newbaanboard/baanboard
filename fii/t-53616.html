as far as I know there is no special french localisation for IVc4.<br />
We use Baan in France, too, and they used for some reasons the italian localisation there in the past. But we plan to change Baan-France to standard (means without localisation) maybe next year.<br />
Of course, depending on processes e.g. payments you might need some small special customizations (a special structure for the payment file to send it to the bank), but that is not the size of a complete Baan-localisation.<br />
When you are experienced in D/ A/ CH and have a person in France (Accountant or somebody) who can provide you with legal requirements I would not expect big problems in implementing the system there. <br />
