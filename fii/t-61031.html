<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alex Peng</div><div class="date">23rd August 2011, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
I had question regarding where to find the cost breakdown of a backdate?<br />
for example, in session Print multilevel cost price calcualtion (ticpr2420m000), if I choose a previous date, says April 1st 2011, in the field &quot;Cost Price Calc. Date&quot;, but the cost is same as current day's cost, that means whatever which date you choose, the cost is same. but in Item - standard cost price details (ticpr3505m000), the cost in April 1st is a different cost.<br />
<br />
Anybody can advice me how to get the detailed cost breakdown? i need the material cost breakdown to each material line like I saw in Print multilevel cost price calcualtion (ticpr2420m000). thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Alex Peng</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is no such list that gives you the information required. Running ticpr2420m000 will show you the current standard cost on the top right and a simulated cost price on a desired day. The report will not show you a breakdown of cost to any date prior to the actual one. Try a report with Crystal, QlikView etc. <br />

<br />
Hope this will fulfill your requirement<br />

Instead, when these changes happen (usually once a year), create a new standard cost price code, copy all data from the old one, apply the changes and put that new code in the parameters. Not the most elegant way, and it needs some more database space, but I have some customers doing it that way. <br />
<br />
(The reason while there is no standard session to do the calculation for a date in the past is the fact that surcharges, operation rates etc. don't have effective dates. You can work around that issue with using other another code each time you apply changes)<br />
<br />
