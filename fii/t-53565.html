<br />
The error comes because the system cannot find the correct record in tfacp006. <br />
In this table you can setup the tolerances per user, financial company, enterprise unit and department. The idea of this is as follows:<br />
1) If you approve the system will go by all matched order lines and will only save the financial company, if it is the same on all the order lines. The same goes for the enterprise unti and department.<br />
2) With the outcome of 1) the system will look in tfacp006 with that set of user, financial company, enterprise unit and department.<br />
3) If if finds a record in 2) then the system stops otherwise it iterates with first departement empty, then also enterprise unit empty and then also company empty (which means zero).<br />
<br />
This functionality was created in the 5.2a (Reger) release. The idea was, I guess, that you can give a user only 100 EUR price difference authorization for an order coming from purchase office &quot;A&quot;, but maybe 30 EUR for an order coming from purchase office &quot;B&quot;.<br />
I do not believe that this functionality is used much.<br />
<br />
In your scenario you do not have matched order lines, this means that the outcome of step 1) will be a financial company of zero, an empty enterprise unit and an empty department. <br />
I guess therefore that you did not enter a record for the relevant use with company zero, empty enterprise unit and empty department. It is wise to setup this table starting with the lowest level (everything empty or zero) and only enter a non zero company, non empty enterprise unit, non empty department, if you really want to use the above described funcitonality.<br />

<br />
 Thanks your valuable advice, our company setup is single logistic and multi finance. As your instruction I have setup purchase invoice authorization for one user and try to approve purchase invoice but same error come. <br />
Some purchase invoices status are matched and registered. I want to approved registered invoice with additional cost, reason is above invoice can’t match with purchase order (this invoice link purchase order match other purchase invoice). Actually we want to clear these invoices to system. Please give your kind attention for this matter.<br />
<br />
Tanks in advance<br />

<br />
If you have an invoice related to orders and the full amount has been added as costs (through tfacp1133s000) and you made the amount unassigned zero, then you will be able to approve.<br />
The error you were describing can only occur, if, for the user who approves, there is not enough tolerance to approve the costs, see session tfacp0150m000. And like I said in this scenario the department, enterprise unit and financial company should all be empty/zero. I just tried it myself and it works.<br />
