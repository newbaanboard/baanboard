<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Woeste</div><div class="date">22nd October 2004, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We've started having a strange situation with the matched with orders field in AP (tfacp200.link).  Occassionally when the person goes to match/approve a PO there is an amount in the matched with orders field even though no matching has taken place and there isn't a record in table tdpur046 (which I'm told populates when something is matched).<br />
<br />
Unmatching and matching does nothing and in one instance she managed to get it approved but the entry was out of balance and required table maintenance to correct.<br />
<br />
Baan support does not have any bugs listed as far as I can find.<br />
<br />
Any ideas???<br />
<br />
We are running 4c4 SP3.</div></div><hr />

If you are in SP-3, then definitely you are very very behind. The problem which you mentioned comes at the time if 2 people are processing bills for the same supplier.<br />
The same has been solved by Baan with solutions. Hence, please upgrade with new SP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Woeste</div><div class="date">25th October 2004, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the information.  The way our AP group is segragated I doubt that two people are working on the same supplier at the any one time.  Would the situation occur if there were two batches going at once?  I need to check but it's possible that she could have one batch that's completed but not finalized and working on another.<br />
<br />
Also if you have any idea of the solution number that would be very helpful.<br />
