<br />
Could you answer the following.<br />
<br />
Currently in Baan4, when i create a direct delivery sales order, the cost taken up in tdsls051 and tdsls045 tables are still the standard cost from the item master table. I would like the cost of this order to be the purchase price of the purchase order that is linked to this sales order.<br />
Can LN do this? If can, then i will look into upgrading. If not, i have a problem. Any suggestion?<br />
<br />
<br />
eg.<br />
<br />
SO with sales price USD 100.00<br />
Standard cost of this item is USD 76.00<br />
For this order, I tick on Direct Delivery, so a PO can be generated and linked to the sales order.<br />
In the PO, purchase price is entered as USD 85.00<br />
<br />
But when I check tdsls051 and tdsls045, the cost there is USD 76.00 <br />
I would like actual cost taken up for the sales, since I am buying the item at USD 85.00 today.<br />
<br />
I know LN has actual costing as one of its costing methods. But is this how it works?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />
