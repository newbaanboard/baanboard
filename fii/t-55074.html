<br />
 You need to create a Transaction type With Tran.category as &quot;Purchase credit note&quot;<br />
and then make an entry in &quot;maintain transaction&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then Go to Form2 -&gt; enter the Purchase invoice number in the Column &quot;original invoice&quot;<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Hope in your case, you have a finalized Purchase invoice and Finalised Credit note and want to link credit note to invoice.<br />
<br />
Create /chcek a transaction type &quot;Purchase corrections&quot; with the session1 - tfacp2120s000 and session -2 tfacp2121s000 and when you start this transaction type, first screnn will show the list of credit notes by Supplier, then select and proceed, in the second screen it will show the list of invoices of same suppliers.  Mark and assignment amount, then process assignments.<br />
This will take care of assignment of credit notes to invoices and updating in GL/ACP.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if the problem does not solve.<br />

Hi sukdev,<br />
<br />
This problem comes because of invoice type (Cost Invoice &amp; Invoice related to Order). <br />
If you purchase invoice is related to order &amp; credit note related to cost invoice. in that case  system will not allow you to assign both of them.<br />
Please check is this you case ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gopal_pv</div><div class="date">1st March 2011, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Sukhdev,<br />
<br />
Your invoice is of type &quot;Related to Purchase order&quot;, but I am sure the credit note must be a &quot;Cost invoice&quot; type.  As Sushil mentioned, this is not possible to like to each other.<br />
<br />
But, the actual way is:  While maintaining the Credit note itself, you should have make it as &quot;Related to Purchase order type&quot; and then without matching, you can do the Approval.  Here system will ask for the account to input.  There you can give the account which you want to give in Credit note lines.  Then for this credit note, invoice related to orders will appear for linking.<br />
<br />
Solution for the current situation:  For your current situation,  one workaround solution is there.  You have to use GTM (ttaad4100).  In tfacp200 table, find the Credit note document record and change the credit note type = Invoice related to order, then you can do this credit note and invoice linking.  Once the linking is done, revert back the changes.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  Try and let me know if this solves your issue.<br />
