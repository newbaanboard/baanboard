There are already built  in reports and functionality  for multi-company working . In fact dimension usage for company may not let u use such reports and functionality like inter company transactions . Ant dimensions may require u to do all that through some other workarounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have multi-logistic single finance, or you have multi-logistic multi-finance structure.. The reports will depend on the structure you have chosen.<br />

This is derived from the FST functionality of BaanIV.</div></div><hr />

Than using financial Statement module you can do teh consolidation of the statements. The Standard software gives some reports like Debtors, Credits across companies so these reports need not be taken from financial statements.</div></div><hr />
