Now, we are using the fixed assets system other than BAAN. We are trying to migrate fixed assets management to BAAN.<br />
Off course we have fixed assets in the middle of depreciation, but we do not know how to register fixed assets in the middle of depreciation in master of BAAN Fixed Asset.<br />
Could you provide us with good advice?<br />

if you are migrating from LN to LN version, system will maintain the same depreciation value even after the Data Upgrade Run session (i.e. FP5 to FP7) but if you are migrating from Baan4 to LN, it will be totally different table structure and maybe you need to select two options: register in LN only the remaining net book value with service date as of your choice now or register the original purchase cost and service date as in 3 years ago, by then system will depreciate accordingly when you capitalized the assets. Make a test for a single asset and if ok then you can do so for others. i hope this will make a little help for you.<br />

Hi <br />
You can register the Fixed Asset Original Amount and also enter the Accum. Depreciation as the Last Depr. Date also.<br />
Then the asset will follow the depreciation on the next periods.<br />
