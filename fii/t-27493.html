This is my first thread so I hope I will have some luck. We have about 600 suppliers and currently making cheque batches every two weeks. I would like to make cheques every month but there are some suppliers(30%) that need to be paid every two weeks.I was wondering if any one would know how we could create a recurring batch, or something similar, with our specific urgent suppliers to make cheques every two weeks. <br />
<br />
The only thing I could think of was to create a new payment type but then I would need to create a new cheque series(I think), which I do not want to do.<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated...<br />

This will allow you to determine the dates the supplier gets paid.  Standing orders can be selected in the session &quot;Select Invoices for Payment.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I do not understand how you can use the same cheque series. In the session tfcmg2115m000, where we create a new payment type, it also asks for the series of cheque. Would you be able to let me know how I could do this? Do you use more then 1 payment type? We use two, automatic cheques(CA) and manual cheques(CH) and they both have different cheque series</div></div><hr />
