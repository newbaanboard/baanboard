<br />
The question is: if I'm setting up a new company, and create the current fiscal year as 2002 in the company parameters (tfgld0103s000), can I load general ledger history subsequently for 2001 when I convert the general ledger?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The final closing of a fiscal year is what changes the Current Fiscal Year in the company parameters.   I assume that you are converting from one version on Baan to another and that is why you are setting up a new company?  If so I don't see a problem with bringing in history information for 2001 even if the current fiscal year is set to 2002 as this information would already have been in Baan on your previous version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I'm starting Baan from scratch, but converting historical General Ledger information from a previous system.<br />
This is so I can have historical (Last Year Actual) numbers to report against.<br />
This means I want to load data dated from the year before go live.<br />
In the initial company parameters you have to enter the fiscal year, before you do any period set up, period closing etc.<br />
I was wondering if I have to set up the current year as 2001, load my historical data, close &amp; finally close for 2001, do a year end etc before live data ever goes in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately that is what you have to do. If you need to enter data into a previous year that should be the current year in Finance.<br />
<br />
Then once you have gone through the year end close process that will update the current year in company parameters. Also please note that the current year is only important in the year end close process anyway and does not have any bearing on the day to day workings of Baan Finance, so it shouldn't really matter that it is pointing to last year.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's very clear. It was what I expected, but I haven't done a history load (in Baan) before. Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I forgot to say that you do not have to wait to load live data. It can be loaded at the same time as the historical stuff, Baan allows multiple periods to be worked on at any time, just ensure you use the correct fiscal periods when loading the data.<br />
<br />
You simply will not have the opening balance to the new year until you go through a year end process, but this can be done whenever!</div></div><hr />
