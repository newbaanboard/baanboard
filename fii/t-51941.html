<br />
We are facing a problem in purchase integration. In some purchase order lines our users enter values for dimension (tdpur041.dim1) in order to see these values in integration transactions (table tfgld410).<br />
For items of type COST this works, however for items of type PURCHASED the dimension value from tdpur041 is not transferred to tfgld410.<br />
Anyone knows the possible reason?<br />
<br />

<br />
I do not know that problem (because we do not work with that option), but ... is it the same account that you enter in case of cost-items and purchase-items? My idea is, that it is not depending on the type of the items, but that perhaps the entered account is not set up for usage with dimensions? (not tested if that is possible at all) But on the other hand you would get an error-log in that case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nikos1</div><div class="date">15th May 2008, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
No, even for the same account it does not work for purchased items (but for cost items it does).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ath999</div><div class="date">16th May 2008, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">So, if I understand correctly, you can enter for purchase items a account in &quot;Maintain Purchase Order Lines&quot; tdpur4105s000, you can even enter dimensions in the same program, and in the integration the account is transferred, only the dimensions not (for purchase items)??<br />
<br />
I did an entry in our system and it was not possible even only to enter a account-number in tdpur4105s000 for purchase items. So in our system it would not be only a problem of dimensions not to be transferred, it would be a problem in general to enter financial information in tdpur4105s000 that are independent from the settings in &quot;Inventory and WIP-Accounts&quot; for purchase items.<br />
<br />
For cost-items it works, and that makes sense because cost items are not on stock, the account (and dimensions) you enter in &quot;Maintain Purchase Order Lines&quot; is used in debit for the purchase/ receipt-transaction (in case of purchase items there would be the stock-account).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
You are right, the accounts in purchase order lines are taken from 'Inventory and WIP-accounts', it is not possible to change them in tdpur4105s000.<br />
<br />
Our Cost items and Purchased items have the same item group and so the same accounts in tdinv8150m000 are used.<br />
<br />
It is possible to enter dimensions in tdpur4105s000 (we have set up tfgld0108m000 'Maintain Chart of accounts, field 'dim1', to 'optional' for all accounts we need).<br />
<br />
I did not understand your last point. Why does it matter whether the items are on stock ore not?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

Correct, it is only possible to enter financial informations in tdpur4105s000 for cost items. But this is optional, you can define the accounts for cost-items in tdinv8150m000 if it is possible to pre-define the accounts for all needed purposes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our Cost items and Purchased items have the same item group and so the same accounts in tdinv8150m000 are used.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, letÂ´s assume that you have a warehouse with (purchased) items in value of 100.000. When there is a receipt of (purchased) items, this value of the stock increases. That is correct, because you have more items in the warehouse.<br />
When you have the same accounts in tdinv8150m00 in debit for purchased items and cost-items and you have a receipt of cost-items in value of 30.000, the value of the stock-account (debit) increases though you do not have more physical items on stock. Or, in other words: when you take all your items out of the warehouse, in the finance-account for this warehouse still a value is shown though the warehouse is empty. Is that wanted by your accountancy-department?<br />
<br />
It is possible to enter dimensions in tdpur4105s000 (we have set up tfgld0108m000 'Maintain Chart of accounts, field 'dim1', to 'optional' for all accounts we need).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only for cost-items it is possible in standard-Baan. For the purchase-items you should set up detailed financial informations (accounts and dimensions) in the integration settings. Normally this is possibly for purchased items because the processes and accounts are not changing often for them.<br />
<br />
In our company, we have only a very small number of cost-items, mostly it is possible to pre-define the accounts (then we use the normal tdinv8150 on level of item-group or item), and only for the cases where the accounts change often we use the possibility in the purchase order.<br />
<br />
Remark: if you set up a dimension to be used &quot;optional&quot; in the chart of accounts: for integration-transaction this is used like &quot;mandantory&quot; for this ledger-account, so even if its only &quot;optional&quot; you have to set up the complete integration-settings including dimensions.</div></div><hr />
