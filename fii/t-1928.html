<br />
In case you want to add to the cost of a fixed asset, you can select that same asset code when you are booking the capital expenditure for the asset.<br />
<br />
But what I would suggest is that you book the capital costs separately under a new code and give the code of the original asset in the field &quot;Parent asset&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
In case of maintenance, have you tried using the enum &quot;Maintainance&quot; in the field &quot;Fixed Asset Integration&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have this option for you:<br />
<br />
Through ACP or purchase invoice post costs normally. Account has to have parameter 'Integration with fixed asset' set to value: Investment. Then choose the same Asset number or that You are making investment on but different extention number.<br />
<br />
According to that You have in asset's register a new asset with old numebr and different extention. Than You run capitalization process. Depreciation next month will run as for a new asset.<br />
<br />
Try this possibility!<br />
<br />

<br />
To collect costs, we set up an internal project in the tipcs2101m000 (Maintain Project) session and then set the integrations for that project to go to the balance sheet in a Fixed Asset In-Process account.  That way we can charge invoices or time to the project, or even transfer materials (since we are a job shop and will rebuild some of our machines inhouse).  When the work/installation is finished we close the project and print out the Actual Cost by Project report to see how much needs to be transferred out of the Fixed Asset In-Process account to the appropriate Fixed Asset account.  Then we make whatever appropriate data entry goes into the 3rd party software.</div></div><hr />
