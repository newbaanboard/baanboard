<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">will5411</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 19:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a logical link, other than dimensions, to tie a cost center to a g/l account?  We are implementing Baan with a small core team, and we are sorta learning finance as we go.  Also, if anyone has any good financial setup documents (or know where any are) we would also appreciate that info!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abennett</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">You would normally use dimensions for this purpose. <br />
<br />
The only other solution is to have an intelligent GL code wich also denotes the cost centre. However this is somehwat old fashioned and has been replaced with dimensions.<br />
<br />
If I were you guys I would try and get atleast some help with the financials or you will pay the price further down the line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">myerphelp</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 21:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I too think that dimensions are the best bet. You may also think of using transaction types to tie to cost center. But if there are many cost centers, it might be little tough.<br />
<br />
we can discuss with you and suggest any solutions if needed. Pl. feel free to send your phone number and / or email to myerphelp@yahoo.com and we can contact you<br />

Make sure that you test all of your financial integrations before you go live!<br />

We implemented Baan 4c2...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">20th February 2002, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree to the other writers that dimensions are the best to make the link. It is the easiest and most efficient way.<br />
<br />
Besides, which version are you implementing Baan IVc4 or ERP?<br />
In IVc4 a controlling package (German Localization) exists which uses also the dimensions. In ERP you have controlling functionalities integrated in the Finance Package, using also dimensions. <br />
<br />
But anyway Abenett is absolutely right with the advice that you should get some professional help, at least for the finance part. Not only you won't know all functionalities but there are also parametres which are very difficult to change after implementation. You will be much more effective with a good finance consultant. <br />
I am not talking like that because I am consultant, at present I am fix employed in a company using baan worldwide. So I am not thinking of any consulting turnover. <br />
