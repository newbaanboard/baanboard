<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KendalPhipps</div><div class="date">4th November 2015, 19:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a process that can be used for charging internal departments for use of inventory items? <br />
<br />
 We have several items we purchase or manufacture then inventory that are also used internally. Such as paper stock, cleaning supplies, etc. These items are held in inventory to support the manufacturing process but are also used in internally. Currently we use Manual Warehouse order to relieve inventory and the GL Mapping to get the money into the correct accounts. The problem with this is that the tax is not getting captured and we cannot markup the item to cover overhead expense from the originating department. Then manual warehouse order will only transfer at cost and we are having to use some creating reporting to determine what the taxes should be. <br />
<br />
 What we would like to do is to be able to utilize sales order for relieving inventory and sales price with tax to cover markup and tax accounting. However I’m unsure of how to clear the AR. We are a single logistics with a Single financial. We have over 50 business units that we sell to that have been setup with their own purchase and sales office. <br />
<br />
 I’m interested in knowing what other are doing to solve this issue.</div></div><hr />

Its good you mentioned sales order and by this you can utilize bilateral invoicing using warehouse manual transfer between your warehouses setup in the entity relationship. In your inforxtreme search bar pls find these kb and pdf (KB 1633206 and U9504DUS_01 page 56 and 57, if this is not exactly your requirement maybe this will help as samples) for your guide.<br />
