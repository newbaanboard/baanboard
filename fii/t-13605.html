<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milsykor</div><div class="date">13th November 2003, 11:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We are unable to use tfgld5201 because the account used in sales invoice wasn't setup for currency analysis-cur.dif.. I'v heard that it could be done in GTM but only for future transactions.<br />
Is it possible to do it somehow backwards ?<br />
The sales invoice is still in open items and I suppose that we can't use tfacr2250m000 because of none payment.<br />
We'd need to solve this issue ASAP.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not understand your problem.<br />
ACR currency differences are done by tfacr2250 and the outcome is regidtered in table tfacr200 and relevant transactions are created in GLD for the control account and for unrealized currency differences account.<br />
<br />
ACR accounts are not supposed to get currency differences directly in GLD using tfgld5201 !!!!!<br />

<br />
tfacr2250 deals only with open (not paid) invoices !!!!<br />
<br />
If an invoice is fully paid there is no need to calculate currency differences any more.<br />

<br />
As soon as I used new account (profit-loss) with indicator calculate currency dif. in gld008 and created invoice in ACR it was possible to print out currency diff. by session tfacr2250m000.</div></div><hr />
