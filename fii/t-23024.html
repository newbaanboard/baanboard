<br />
 We got something here that is new to us,some purchase orders that have been issued and received in 2003 but they have been matched and approved in 2005,the problem we got is that the lot price of the items in these purchase orders changed and became very high which affected the integration ,I have reviwed these purchase orders and the only thing that may cause this problem might be the change of the conversion factor of some of the purchased items...,But not sure if this is the problem,and if it is the problem,what would be the solution?<br />
<br />
Please If anybody has any explaination or solution for this problem,I'll apperciating of his/her help.<br />

<br />
It is not a problem, but a functionality.  The purchase entry in the Finance and the lot price initially takes the price specified in the purchase order at the order currency multiplied by the currency rate factor populated in the purchase order itself (thus converting it into the home currency value).  In the meantime, the lot price is subject to change due to so many factors, main among them being<br />
1. Subsequent change in the price of receipt line (effected thru. session &quot;Change Price after Maintain receipts&quot;)<br />
2. Matching and approving of the receipt line in Finance with a different currency rate.<br />
<br />
Please note till a receipt is matched and approved in Finance the lot price is subject to fluctuation any number of time due to the first reason.  Once the receipt is matched and approved, it finally updates the lot price by applying the invoice (latest) currency rate, and this is the FINAL Lot price<br />
<br />
Hope your doubt is clarified.  Please get back in case you need further clarification<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
