<br />
I have tried to find similar topic in the forum but unfortunately without success. Apologies if there is already something for this topic.<br />
<br />
I am using Infor LN for posting cash management transactions - basically every day I am downloading several bank statements and book manually all transactions from them into LN.<br />
<br />
My question is do  you know is it possible/is there such functionality in LN where I can create some csv file with all bank transactions from the bank statement with filled GL accounts and just to upload it in LN.<br />
<br />
I know that there is similar functionality in SAP and I am wondering can this be done in LN as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to the forum. <br />
<br />
If you have your IT team with you, the entire process can be automated by customizations i.e. downloading the files everyday and uploading it to LN. Have done it in past and it should not take much time to customize the automation<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding, standard module, I am not sure if uploading of bank transactions using CSV is available in standard product. But will check and update the thread if I find one.</div></div><hr />

upload / Import &quot;Statement of account&quot; ?<br />

Have a look at session tfcmg5202m00 ff<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tom de Valk</div><div class="date">26th February 2018, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Best approach would be to make use of Electronic Bank Statements handling in LN, instead of uploading a CSV file which is still manually filled with G/L accounts.<br />
<br />
Bank statements are possible in all kinds of formats. <br />
Native LN supports MT940 (Structured) and ASCII fixed position bank statement formats. The MT940 is a 'Bank Relation' option and for other formats I refer to (help text of) tfcmg5202m000 session.<br />
Other formats (e.g. XML or CSV) are not supported by native LN.<br />
<br />
From LN 10.3 and onwards these kind of formats (ISO20022/CAMT xml messages, BTRS/BAI2, etc.) are supported in LN with the 'Infor Local.ly - Banking Services' addition, which makes use of ION (11.1 or better 12.x). <br />
Please have a look at Infor Xtreme for more information about this solution (https://www.inforxtreme.com/espublic/EN/AnswerLinkDotNet/SoHo/Solutions/SoHoViewSolution.aspx?SolutionID=1926258)</div></div><hr />
