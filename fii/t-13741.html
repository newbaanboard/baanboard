<br />
Company scenario - Single Finance / Multi Logistic<br />
<br />
Using dimensions - warehouse, prod. line, Dept<br />
<br />
Also using an interim sales account to post initial invoice totals, which will be debited out @ Sales Invoice Details Accounts.  Need the sales account by warehouse, cc for financial statement setup.  As seen in screen shot, setup is providiing correct posting for all cases except the interim revenue vs. AR (as seen)<br />
<br />
Is there some step missing in integrations?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Please check the following:<br />
If is an sls invoice, all the integrations regarding must be defined.<br />
Review the session tfgld4510m000 (display transaccions by project/order).<br />
The most common problem is when, the numeber sales order change from one digit to another. For example, if you start with the series order 10 and now the series order changes to 20, this new series order must be defined also in the session tfgld4112m000 (Mantain options by integration element).<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that  the situation is as follows:<br />
<br />
Dimension values for the control account 1140 comes from tfacr0111 - Ledger accounts by customer group.<br />
<br />
Dimension values for the sales interim 4105 comes from tcmcs0136 (Form 2).<br />
<br />
Both are not influenced by the SLS integration element.<br />
This is the reason you do not get values in dimension PRD.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baandude</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks All,<br />
<br />
So for the first 4105 transaction coming from Form 2, the only way you are saying we can get PRD is if we code it directly into Form2.  When I did that, the dimension shows up for 1140 but not 4105.  <br />
<br />
The other option is to define the financial statements with only 4105 Dept / CC dimension, as there should be a cancelling of Debit / Credit in that transaction .  The only problem with that is the position 0 for 4105 ledger account retains a debit balance.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
