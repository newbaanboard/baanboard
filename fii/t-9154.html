<br />
While releasing the outbond data for the material issue for a production batch, what date is picked up by the system?<br />
<br />
Is it the date on what the outbond is released??<br />
<br />
In case the data is required to be released for past period, how the date of integration transactions can be controlled???<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Baan V b, the outbound date is the date on which the outbound advise is created. Since the actual financial transaction is created at the time of shipments, you can specify the date you want to at the time of Confirming the shipments.<br />
<br />
I would assume that the same would work on Baan IV too.<br />

<br />
There's no shipment procedure for production in BaanERP. I don't know a way to back-date production issue in BaanERP<br />

<br />
I might be able to help you, but don't understand what outbound data means. <br />
<br />
When issuing material to a production order, the systemdate is taken for the integration transaction and thus the current period for this transaction.<br />
<br />
If you have questions about certain data or fields, please add the table+fieldname.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your replies.<br />
<br />
Dear bvdj,<br />
<br />
To clarify more. In SFC module there are 2 ways to show the consumption of raw material. The procedure can be carried out either by using the backflushing procedure or by generating and releasing outbond(if ILC is implemented). In our case ILC is implemented.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, at the startup of any implementation it is quite common that companies stay behind the date. The same is the situation over here. The company is behind the date and reporting the production for the past period. In this case how to control the date for the raw material consumption either through &quot;backflushing&quot; or &quot;Outbond&quot;??<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maxime</div><div class="date">7th March 2003, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">One way I can think of is by Migrating the data from your old system to Baan.<br />
<br />
The following are the activities that you can do :<br />
<br />
1)  Data Mapping of your Legacy System : Create a Data Mapping of your legacy system and send those fields from the legacy system in the form of an ASCII file. This will provide you with the option to send the date corresponding to that production order.<br />
<br />
2) Write a Customized Migration Program: Transfer the data from the ASCII file (or read the data from the ASCII file) and perform the Backflush Process/Outbound process by using this Migration Program. This way your Integration Transactions will be created with the Data sent by the ASCII file. So you can send the whatever date you want to.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
The final conclusion is that BAAN picks up the system date while outbond is generated.</div></div><hr />
