<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baaniac</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using Baan IV c2, with Oracle Back-end.<br />
<br />
In Integration Parameters of our Baan System, we have set &quot;Compression&quot; as &quot;Compression by Transaction Origin&quot;.<br />
<br />
Despite, system creates a large volume of Integration Transactions in a day. This is true, especially for entries of Transaction Origin - Production (SFC) and Financial Transaction - Issue; where more than 1000 records are getting created every day.<br />
<br />
I believe, these transactions are getting created by INV Parameter &quot;Link with Finance&quot; = Yes; as it has been set in our system and when  session &quot;Backflush Matrials&quot; or &quot;Issue Inventory&quot; or &quot;Release Outbound Data&quot; for SFC Orders is run.<br />
But, we cannot turn this parameter off; as we require the other Finance Integration Transactions created by it, like Production (SFC) - Issue, Production (SFC) - Surcharges, Production (SFC) - Subcontracting, Sales - Issue, Warehouse Orders - Inventory Transfer, RPL Orders - Delivery and so on.<br />
<br />
One peculiar observation is that the system is creating transactions of Production (SFC) - Issue for each component issued for the Production Order.<br />
Can we get only the total of Production Order issue in Integration Transactions i.e. the system should club together all issues and pass just one entry for the whole Production Order.<br />
<br />
The other Parameters at our end which might be of interest are :-<br />
in INV Parameters - Link PUR Parameters to Finance = No,<br />
Link SLS Parameters to Finance = No<br />
<br />
in Integration Parameters - Handling of Document Numbers = Doc No by Fin Trans/Date,<br />
Handling of Batch Numbers = Batch Number by Date<br />
Compress code for Cost Price Component = &lt;blank&gt;<br />
<br />
in SFC Parameters, Backflushing Method = Automatically.<br />
<br />
Please suggest. <br />
Thanks for bearing with me so long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
This is a description of the compression option that I have found.<br />
<br />
Compression: When entered in the general ledger, the transactions will be compress. Therefore, for each procession a total amount will be entered per ledger account. With parameter set to Compression: If the following fields for a new transaction are equal to those of an existing transaction in tfgld102, the data will be compressed: Year, Batch, Finance company, Ledger account, All 5 dimensions, Transaction Type/Document, Debit/Credit Code, Country for tax, Tax Code, Tax Type, Currency, Fiscal Year &amp; Period, Reporting Year &amp; Period, Tax Year &amp; Period, and Customer &amp; Supplier. <br />
<br />
The functionality for compression of integration transactions is only designed <br />
for journal voucher type transactions, and not for sales invoices or purchase <br />
invoices. The reason is that sales or purchase invoices are written to the <br />
integration table with the documentnumber (=invoicenumber) and linenumber. The <br />
compression functionality is working in the function where the <br />
documentnumber/linenumber is assigned to integration transactions. This <br />
function is skipped for invoices, because the documentnumber is already known <br />
and therefore the compression is not possible.  <br />
<br />
<br />
From this it seems that compression only applies to data going into tfgld102 and tfgld106.  Unfortuantely I haven't had any experience with compression maybe someone else can comment on this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baaniac</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Maria,<br />
<br />
Appologies from my side for the late feedback. I was out of the office and hence, could not write back.<br />
At the same time, please pardon me for being a little pushy on this matter.<br />
<br />
The entries of Production (SFC) and Issue are getting created of Journal type only. <br />
<br />
The compression is working fine at our end as you have rightly pointed out i.e. when Integration Transactions are posted to Finance through session &quot;Post Integration Transactions&quot; (tfgld4201m000), the System clubs entries as per Transaction Origin and so, table tfgld102 gets few entries.<br />
<br />
But our problem is different. <br />
The Integration Transactions tables are increasing at a frantic pace everyday and that is a thing to worry for us.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if Baan system provides Compression of Integration Transactions at the point of their origin only i.e. when the Integration Transactions are generated, they will get compressed in Integration Transactions tables just at that point itself and not in tfgld102 when the Integration Transactions are posted to Finance.<br />
<br />
Specific to our problem of Production (SFC) - Issue entries growth, is there any mechanism by which only these entries are passed at the level of Production Order only and not at the level of components.<br />
<br />
I will make it more elaborate by this way :-<br />
Production Order - 1234<br />
Components Issued are as follows - <br />
Component       Amount<br />
A1                     100<br />
A2                     400<br />
A3                     300<br />
<br />
Right now, system populates Integration Transaction tables (tfgld410 etc.) with all the 3 records with their individual amounts.<br />
What is required for us is syetm creates only 1 record in Integration Transactions table with total amount of 800.<br />
<br />
Please advise, if this thing is possible in Baan IV c2 by any means.<br />
<br />
One solution we have envisaged is that before session &quot;Post Integration Transactions&quot; (tfgld4201m000) is run, a stand-alone customized session is run which will delete all un-posted entries of Production (SFC) - Issue from Integration Transactions tables.<br />
At the end of the day, session &quot;Print Actual Costs by Production Order&quot; (ticst0401m000) is run which will give the value of Production Order issues Production Order wise and manually, a Journal Voucher entry is passed to that effect.<br />
<br />
Can you please check, if anything else simple is possible ?<br />
<br />
You might have rightly guessed that I am not a Functional person in these matters.<br />
Hence, still pushing.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abennett</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 13:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Compression only compresses the postings into tfgld102 (then tfgld106) it does not compress tfgld410.<br />
<br />
This table is held in full detail, and will unfortunaltely grow at great speed. The only way to reduce the size of this table is to archive data, but as we all know that is not possible for most companies until atleast a few years have passed.<br />
<br />
It was helped in later versions of Baan (Not quite sure which Baan IVc4 definitaley) splits out some of the postings ie Credit details into tfgld417 and additions into tfgld415, but this does not really help as the number of records generated is still the same.<br />
<br />
Not what you want to hear I'm sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately I don't know of any why to compress transasction in tfgld410.  I seem to remember that tfgld417 and 415 came in around c4 or it could even have been c3(not sure).  As far as I can see it is necessary to have all this information to allow for a greater leve of detail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baaniac</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 04:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks AJB and Maria for your reply.<br />
<br />
I can understand that Baan system does not have facility to compress Integration Transactions in tfgld410 tables.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
