   We are working with single logistics and multi finance setup.<br />
   I'm facing one serious problem that is due to ignorance of Master Data we 've posted some of the purchase without checking the ledger account associated to one of the cost item now is there any way by which we can change the ledger account even after posting.<br />
<br />
Or any way to reverse posting and re-do the posting so it will take the correct ledger account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kindly revert back at the earliest.<br />
<br />

You can create your own reversing journal voucher batch to set the accounts straight.  Debit the amount to the 'bad' account, and then credit it to the correct account.  I think this is standard procedure for correcting account balances after posting.  These reversing entries because of error should be documented special in case of auditing later.  Physically changing the original posting would be very difficult, the entries are in many tables, and I have not seen a supported/standard procedure for that (but again, I am no finance expert!).</div></div><hr />

This option was open to me but can not try due to dependency of lots of reports for such transaction.<br />
<br />
All our customized reports will not work for such JV's ..<br />

Thanks any way<br />

If you are assigning the batch to INDIVIDUAL USER, then you will need to give access to accomplish this action.<br />
<br />
Hope this works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monica1</div><div class="date">14th January 2005, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem of the last solution if that you lost the integration between the financial data and the integration data. You have to change the ledger account in the tfgld410 records.</div></div><hr />

     You just to change ledger account in table tfgld102  (If you not yet Finalized ) and to change in tfgld410 to change the ledger account but I think it a lot of details to change ,My ideas may be to check to transaction record and to reverse on JV and to record correct on JV also .<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiber01</div><div class="date">19th January 2005, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">The best solution could be to change the value of your record in table tfgld410 and in table tfgld102. But still carefull, because you solve the problem for this time but NOT DEFINITIVELY. You must take several action to be sure that in the future te correct parameters should be used. If your have already finalised your batch you can change it in the table tfgld106 but you need absolutely rebuild your accounting whit the session tfgld3203m000</div></div><hr />
