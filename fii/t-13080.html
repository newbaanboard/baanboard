<br />
I have a problem with reconciliation of Debtors A/c with the ACR's report--&gt; Customer balance by Company report (tfacr2434m000). Its showing a difference and the same difference is being shown in the report:Print Control A/c Check List (tfacr2415m000). <br />
<br />
There are no 'non-finalized' batches remaining, all are finalized.<br />
<br />
We are running BaaN IV c4 with only standard version.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows how to solve this problem and advises to solve this problem are welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
and for payables tfacp2245m000?<br />
<br />
First both as a testrun to check if there are differences, when running not as a test run, u better have no 1 working in finance<br />
<br />
(and parameter integrations real time to finance = no in case people are working in sales / purchase)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!!<br />

You will have to investigate each one individually.</div></div><hr />

Dear mdruijter,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply, the sessions you mentioned are not available. It might be because, we are running only 'Standard BaaN' - BaaN IV c 4.<br />
<br />
Is there otherway around..???<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<br />
<br />
We are also use BaaN VI but we have the above session No. tfacr2245m000.<br />
<br />
You may try otfcor0280 this session. It is used for recalculation of customer balance.<br />
<br />
Hope solve the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I think the answer of MariaC is correct. You have differences between your tfgld106 table and your tfacr200 table. You must print your control account checklist in detail and you must search for the documents which are creating these differences.<br />
<br />
When you found these differences you can analyze what to do.<br />
<br />
A better solution is that you log a call to the Baan support centre. Solving such a problem is mostly a complex activity.<br />
<br />
Booking manually at a control account isn't possible too.<br />
<br />

Jaap</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before running the print out sessions to check the control acc. (tfacr2415m000 and tfacp2415m000) make sure that all posting have been recalculated. The sessions mantioned in my first postings are standard. If u cant run them; you might check on upgrading to a more recent SP or u just don't have the user rights to access them.<br />
<br />
MariahC and Jaap are right too! (I didn't want to go into table details immediatly)<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
