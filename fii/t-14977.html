The invoice is not link to Purchase Order. Is there a session<br />
or do we have to do this through GTM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">7th April 2004, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I remember u can do approval, even without matching. <br />
And with approved status u should be able to delete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">7th April 2004, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I am assuming that the invoices with registered status are service or utility costs (i.e not cost of goods sold)<br />
<br />
<br />
1)<br />
You can have more than one type of invoice as a transaction type.<br />
one of which can be invoices that the registration status is inappropriate the status is shown as &quot;transaction entered&quot; instead.<br />
<br />
2)<br />
or for occasional use you could go to form two of the purchase invoice screen and change the match with purchase order selection to NO. Again the the invoice staus will be shown as &quot;transaction entered&quot;<br />
<br />
There is a down side to these options; if you rely on reports that select between registered/matched/approved invoices. &quot;transaction entered&quot; will appear on all reports. This is probably less of a problem if you have a different transaction type as you may be able to de-select them.<br />
<br />
Another option (which has already been suggested) is to ignore match and go straight to approve. You may find that the matching screen is brought up but this is baan being cautious in case you did not mean to approve. Just exit the screen and you will be taken to a screen where you expense the cost to the P&amp;L. Finally if you use a default block on invoices, baan will ask you if you want to remove the block. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emgnde</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">These are POS transactions (&quot;Registered&quot; status) with zero value.  We have no Purchase order to match them to. We want to just remove them.<br />
<br />
Can we just delete them from the tfacp200 table or will this cause more problems for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 08:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Then u should delete the same in tfacp1110s000 itself if it's non-finalized. There is no need for GTM.<br />
<br />
If finalized, u can do approval in session, tfacp1130m000. It should not prevent u to approve 0 value invoice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">My apologies if I am misunderstanding this, but why do you need to delete the invoice? <br />
Surely it represents a financial transaction that occured in regard to the companies activities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Penfold,  Emgnde is justifying backend manipulation because of 0 invoice value and he can not  remove fully paid invoices(tfacp2250m000) to delete the invoice with registered status. So he wants to remove the legitimate transaction only .<br />
<br />
But as discussed in earlier answers backend manipulations are not required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emgnde</div><div class="date">9th April 2004, 00:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem solved by approving without matching.<br />
Thank you very much for your assistance.</div></div><hr />
