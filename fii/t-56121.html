<br />
Don't know if this is of any help but in 4C its on form 2 of maintain chart of accounts.<br />
Session tfgld0108<br />
<br />
You name your own legal accounts and the report puts them in alpha/numeric order which means you can have a mix of account types if you're not careful.<br />
<br />

<br />
I assume - you are trying to find a ledger code in table tfgld008 in a particular company - but it is not found.<br />
<br />
the table might be shared - try finding in the shared company (most of all in the group company).</div></div><hr />

However, if you do not want or are unable to use these legal ledger account numbers  (for instance, in connection with the reporting requirements of a holding company), you can define the chart of accounts to your requirements and enter the legal ledger account number here. You will then be able in &quot;BAAN Finance&quot;, at lists of balances and transaction reports, to select whether to print out using the &quot;private&quot; or the legal account number. <br />

Thanks,<br />
