<br />
Thanx for the reply.<br />
<br />
As per my understanding it would be difference between ledger totals from tfacp200 and that from tfgld106/tfgld102.<br />
<br />
What i need t know is what could be the reason and significance of  this difference ??  and how can it be rectified.....<br />
<br />
And as u must have guessed , reason for this querry is we are having a major difference when i run this report though no complaint has yet been encountered from Finance deptt.<br />

The fixing of the problem usually require General Table Maintanace and digging in the tables.</div></div><hr />

I have noticed these errors in FAS investment transactions..The corrections can only be done by inserting the record in tfacp200.<br />

<br />
When there are lots of documents on the control list, it can be that archived documents are on the list.<br />
Untill now, there are still problems with some archived documents on this list</div></div><hr />
