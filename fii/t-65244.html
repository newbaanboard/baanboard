<br />
Can anybody tell me how to make invoice for commissions [tdcms201] ? I calculated the commission for supplier. In the session Commission Calculated by Relation I can see the approved commission. But, I am not able to change it's status to Ready. Ultimately this commission can not be posted in Finance.<br />
<br />
When I am trying to print the Commission calculated by relation, I get message 'Unable to Determine the Invoice number for relation .....'<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me in coming out of this message. I guess this message is displayed because there is no invoice record in tdcms201 for the linked relation.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
