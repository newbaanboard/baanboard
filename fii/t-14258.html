We want to match/approve purchase invoices with order (tfacp1130m000). Invoice  and P. order come to tfacp1130m000. But, Purchase order does not appear to tfacp1131sm000 for matching. Does anybody know what problem is? This order is purchase to project. Receipt is already done, Invoice is already created by the user. I think that everything is OK.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once the purchase order has been transferred via integrations you should see the dr, cr balances in integrations inquiries /. by project. Check to see transactions as expected.<br />
<br />
Ensure all transactions are finalized, then setup PO type with 1130 session, and it would then create an entry in tfacp200 (open entries), i suspect your transaction has not created a value in tfacp200<br />
<br />
If it is already in tfacp200, then you may want to check if the project number is properly referred.  Also, if you are using &quot;Received Invoices, and Approval&quot; process, ensure that all related steps are followed, to link project #.<br />

I checked purchase to project transactions which from integrations inquiries /. by project  seem correctly. Purchase invoice and purchase/Material cost integration are already finalized. I have seen P.inv, which is created last month with PO (without match/app. Process) in tfgld106, tfacp200. Receipt process is already done this month. And I want to match/app.  process for this inv.  and receipt. But, PO does not come in session tfacp1430s000 for matching. How to solve this problem? How can I get this receipt to tfacp1430sm000?<br />
<br />
thank you for your reply.</div></div><hr />

Just by specifying the order no. doesnt help. U should specify the project no. &amp; order no.<br />
<br />
Try it out.</div></div><hr />
