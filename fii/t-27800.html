<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VilasoorRavi</div><div class="date">6th August 2006, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">We are having products relating to multiple divisions but within one BaaN company. These products relating to multiple divisions are sometimes supplied to one customer. We would like to get the details of the outstandings by division(each division invoices separately) as well as total outstanding of the customer, for credit control purposes.<br />
<br />
Similarly, one division of ours maybe supplying to different divisions of the same customer. Here, the customer requires separate division-based invoices. Here also, we would like to get the outstandings by customer's divisions as well as total outstandings.<br />
<br />
Can some one help me on this?<br />
<br />
tks and rgds,<br />

<br />
or try using separate sales order series.<br />
<br />
else, enter the division in the sales order reference. which will get populated into tfacr200 after invoicing.<br />
<br />
then customise reports accordingly.</div></div><hr />
