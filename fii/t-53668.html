<br />
Our Finacne user matched &amp; Approved the Supplier Invoice. But after that he told us that there is the Price variation in the Invoice &amp; the PO. Can any body suggest me how i change the PO Price and their finance implication.<br />
<br />
We have two problem related to this.<br />
<br />
1. How we correct the Price Variation, When batch is finalised<br />
2. How we correct when the Invoiced is in the condition of Matched &amp; Approved.<br />
<br />
I am waiting for your early postive response.<br />
<br />
For ur information we are using LN 6.1 SP0<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />

<br />
I have no idea why you would want that. If you create a purchase order, then the ordered item has a certain price. The total order line amount minus discounts is communicated to finance, so that it can be used in the match/approve procedure. <br />
As long as the order line/sequence has not been used in any match with an invoice, then you can change the price and/or discounts of an order line in purchase itself. Any change then will create a purchase price variance posting.<br />
Of course it is not necessary to change the price after receipt in purchase, you can stimply match the invoice for a different amount from the order (tfacp2150s000/tfacp2151s000) and during approval the system will create the purchase price variance posting.<br />
<br />
So, please explain, why you would still, even after approving of the invoice, want to change the price of the purchase order?<br />
<br />

<br />
You can change price and discount before matched and approved, but not possible after &quot;Matched and Approved&quot; thus you have to go thru Debit Note/Credit Note.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">16th September 2008, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not clear to me.<br />
If you ordered an order, for let's say 100 EUR, then what are the reasons to change the price?<br />
1) You notice you made a mistake and the order should actually be for 120 EUR?<br />
O.k., then if there is not a receipt present, you can change it on the order line itself. This new order amount is communicated to finance.<br />
2) If there is already a receipt, you can use the purchase session to change the price/discounts after receipt. The order line is updated, finance is updated and a price difference posting will be created for 20 EUR to update invoice accrual.<br />
3) If there has already been done a match in ACP against this order line, then you received already the invoice, isn't it? If you received the invoice, then I guess in this example the invoice would be for an amount of 120 EUR. You can then match through session tfacp2540m000 (Match to Order) or tfacp2544m000 (Match to Receipt) click on the orderline/receipt line and go through specific to tfacp2150s000/tfacp2151s000 and there you need to overwrite the matched invoice amount (default) from 100 to 120 EUR. This will create again during approval of the invoice the price variance posting of 20 EUR to balance invoice accrual.<br />
<br />
So, I do not understand why you need to use any credit note in this procedure, can you again explain?<br />

<br />
There are only one point how can you changed price after matched and approved/batch finalised as it is mentioned in above issues...<br />
&quot;1. How we correct the Price Variation, When batch is finalised<br />
2. How we correct when the Invoiced is in the condition of Matched &amp; Approved.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hope , It is clear now to you ...<br />

<br />
Basically, our case is related to the Subcontracting. Our Operation Price is changed every month. And we communicate our vendor related that order. But, in some cases we receive the qty from the old rate. The new rate may be less or greater than the newer Rate.<br />
<br />
The Store department received the material and sent the documents to the finance department. The Finance user is correct the rate, but in few cases they are not checked and Matched &amp; Approved the invoice. <br />
<br />
I request to all,<br />
<br />
Please advice me the solution for the same. For your information we not finalise those batches which have this type of problems.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Umesh &amp; Michiel for their valuable inputs for me.<br />
Please also provide the session also, where i correct the data.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
I am working in BaanIVc.<br />
<br />
I found that if we not finalized the batch of match n approved invoice, then we can reverse that approval and then unmatch the same. Then you will be able to change prices in session 'Change prices/Discount after receipt'.<br />
<br />
Do it and hope your problem will resolve...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You state that there are problems with invoices, which are matched and sometimes even approved. You can only approve an invoice if the nett invoice amount is split up, by either matching to purchase order lines/receipts and/or by adding costs (tfacp1133s000). If the amount unassigned is zero, only then (of course the system will check user tolerances for additional costs and price variances) you are able to approve.<br />
<br />
But indeed, if you want to correct approved invoices, then you can unapprove them, either from the invoice session (tfacp1110s000) and also unmatch (depending on the matching scenario, session tfacp2541m000/tfacp2544m000). <br />
If an invoice is already finalized, then you should use session tfacp2507m000, through specific also show the approved invoices and you can then double clikc (tfacp2107s000) and from there unapprove, unmatch etc.<br />
<br />
So, although it is still not clear to me, what you want to correct, I hope with this information you are able to change the invoices.<br />
<br />

The result will adjust the previous booking.</div></div><hr />
