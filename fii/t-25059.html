<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">10th September 2005, 00:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Our company wants to reduce the number of invoices it cuts to its customers by consolidating invoices and send the customer a single at the end of the month or quarter.  However, the company still wants to recognize the revenue once the product has been shipped/delivered to the customer.  Can this be achieved in Baan IV?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">10th September 2005, 03:19</div></div><div class="posttext">In general terms I think this would not be possible as 'revenue' figures are an output of the invoicing process.  That is for the system to know the revenue it must have performed an invoicing process.<br />
<br />
Whether or not the customer sees invoices throughout the month or ever sees them is a separate issue.<br />
<br />
We have a couple of examples of where customers do not get the invoices that are processed. One group of these relate to sales to large distributor-type companies who pay upon receipt of goods referenced to their order numbers. They do not want our paperwork so we do not print it.<br />
<br />
Another type of invoice relates to the sale of products with a very large content of commodity-metal whose prices change throughout the day. For some customers a notional monthly invoice rate is set at the beginning of the month and adjusted with the actual prices on the first day of the following month at which time all of the prices are known.   For the items adjustment invoices are raised (by customised system) for adjustment but the customer only sees an invoice that is a summary of all the adjustments.<br />
<br />
Hope our expamples give you some ideas<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">13th September 2005, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">The Baan IV Projects module has the ability to record revenue at a different time to the invoice. ERP LN has enhanced this functionality to allow differing types of revenue recognition on different projects for the same customer.  The Projects module is meant for long term contracts and may not be suitable if you just want to consolidate multiple sales invoices - then you should use collect invoices (as per tjbyfield).</div></div><hr />
