<br />
I have a purchase order in a PCS project. The order quantity for this PO is 10 pieces and with the price of $1 each. So, the total PO amount is $10.<br />
<br />
Warehouse staff register a receipt of 10 pieces for this PO.<br />
<br />
Later, we receive the invoice from the supplier. The invoice quantity is 11 pieces with $1 each. The invoice amount is $11.<br />
<br />
For some reason, I approved this invoice with the discrepancy in quantity using session tfacp1130m000.<br />
<br />
What I expect is that the project cost will have a total cost of $11 for this PO. Unfortunately, I only see $10 for the project cost.<br />
<br />
Can someone explain where is the $1 go to ?</div></div><hr />

    When the warehouse user to regis the P/O receipt thare match receipt with P/O that record of Inventory should be 10$ and the difference on price thair should when you to maintain A/P Matching and system pop up the Difference amount for you to entry chart of Account thier mean the difference only record on Finance modules not to update in Distribution.<br />
  P/O   QTY  10   Price  1$<br />
  Receipt  ref. to P/O Number and show only QTY 10 that system records the price from P/O Price = 1$<br />
  But when You Matching Invoice 11$ <br />
    And Receipt                         10$<br />
   Pop up for entry ledger             1$<br />
   Inventory Records                  10$<br />
That effect to you project only show the Inventory Price on the purchase Order.<br />
