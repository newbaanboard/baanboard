<br />
We have an audit in the 4th week of June and our Closing Balances in the Trial Balance does not match with the Supplier Aging Analysis Closing Balance.<br />
<br />
Trial Balance does match the Finalized Transaction by ledger account report .<br />
<br />
Control Checklist does not give a big difference either.<br />
<br />
Has anybody faced a similar situation? Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Pratibha .</div></div><hr />

Are you using the last period of the Invoices and payments as the same period you are using for the GL?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem was ...someone in finance had finalized transactions for the month of JULY that were created in Feb. We were running  the TB and Aging for April so the TB was not taking into account the july finalized transactions.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
