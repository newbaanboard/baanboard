Recently we installed solution 78047 from INFOR, in order to update the GRINYA module. As many you can know, this solution creates 2 new sesions:<br />
tfacp1235m000(Select values for receivable invoices) and tfacp1436m000 (print receivable invoices specifications). This also upgrades the sesions tfacp1435m000(Print receivable invoices specification-financial) and tfacp1432m000 (Print receivable invoices specification-logistics).<br />
Well, after run the session tfacp1435m000 the report are giving me some transactions with the legend: Amount of record in table tdpur046 inconsistent with transactions. And when I run tfacp1436m000 the report give me a logistic balance of 0 and a financial balance of &quot;X&quot; quantity not equal 0. So this is giving me some diferences between logistic balance vs fin balance.<br />
This orden have been matched and approved. The invoice have been paided also.<br />
So I donÂ´t know how to track this diference.<br />
Anybody has faced with this problem?<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />
