<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tap268</div><div class="date">10th February 2004, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Should it be possible to change the period status from closed to opened for &quot;Fiscal&quot; and &quot;Reporting&quot; if the &quot;Tax&quot; status remains closed?  Memory says that it did not allow us to do this in the past and that it would not be a good accounting practice.  We did recently change our tax period from fiscal to calendar.  Does this have something to do with it?  Did we miss a step?  Any help would be apprecitated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">10th February 2004, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">We use IVc4 and we find there is no problem in having say the reporting period closed and fiscal period open. You can even have different part modules closed in different types of period.<br />
<br />
What you cannot do is have part of the tax period closed it is either all closed or all open.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
