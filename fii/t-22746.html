<br />
I would like to know where can I change the field value (Person in Charge-PIC) in Payment Advice Report.<br />
<br />
<br />
In current Payment Advice the field is showing the previous PIC in the Report.<br />
<br />
So strange that the new PIC is given a new id with new payment authorization.<br />
<br />
There must be some place the authorization is showing the previous PIC.<br />
<br />
<br />
So can anyone help me to change the field value to the new one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance people....<br />
<br />
<br />
 :p</div></div><hr />

Are you sure that you are not running a customized report? Are you running a specific localization?</div></div><hr />

In the payment advice, there is a field name -Preparer.<br />
<br />
<br />
In this preparer field the employee number of the payment advice preparer should appear.(user employee number)<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
The preparer of this document is user02.<br />
but the employee number of user01 is appearing in the payment advice when it is printed.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It must be something to do with the authorization because I previously I copied the authorization of user01 and gave it to the user02.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Do anyone know which table is storing the user employee number?<br />
<br />
or any idea? :) <br />
