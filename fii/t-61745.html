<br />
We need to set up factoring for our own side<br />
<br />
After having parameterized “Factor” as a customer (itbp, pfbp) and having defined each BP to be yielded to “Factor”, We tested the process<br />
<br />
Step 1) Invoicing<br />
Step 2) Send to the factor selected Invoiced<br />
<br />
Step 3) payment<br />
At this stage we don't understand the logic of ERP LN :<br />
-Is it the payement from the “Factor” of the yielded invoices?<br />
Or<br />
-Is it the stage of payement of the invoice by our customer?<br />
<br />
This is not clear and in each way, it seems to miss a step or something else<br />
Our need is to yield invoices and in the same time to continu to &quot;ticked&quot; payement by customer<br />
<br />
-If we see step 3 as payement from Factor, Invoices are regarded as balanced and we can not follow real payment<br />
<br />
-If we see step 3 as customer payement, we can not follow &quot;Factor&quot; payement for which invoices<br />
<br />
Have documentation which we could use?<br />
Is somebody have implemented that?<br />
How to solve this problem?<br />
<br />
All your help or ideas are welcome<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

It's a payment by factor that is considered invoice payment here and as a result, the invoice balance in tfacr200 gets updated. Next step is the reconciliation after the payment is collected from the real customer. You run tfcmg6200m000 Settle,Repay/Unfactor Factored Invoices session. This way you tell the factor the money has been collected and the invoice is no longer outstanding.</div></div><hr />
