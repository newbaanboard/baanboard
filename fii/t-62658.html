<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stefano</div><div class="date">25th July 2012, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a cost allocation from one dimension to another one. At a dimensional level it is correct. But I would like the transfer amount to happen also at the level of general ledger accounts and not through the secondary credit and secondary debt accounts. I want the transaction of the allocation modify a GLD account for the  dimension ”source” and another one (or the same one) for the dimension “destination”.  Is it possible? <br />
PS.  What does  “primary” means in the allocation type in chart of accounts? What is its use? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Primary costs are the costs directly booked in Finance and copied over / use in costing.<br />
