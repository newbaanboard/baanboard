<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimbacon44</div><div class="date">4th August 2007, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Run the non finalized transactions for the batch.  It is possible that an approval for that particular document was reversed (deleted) and there are still other transactions in the batch which were correct.  Try and finalize the batch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BIPLAB SINHA</div><div class="date">7th August 2007, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The status at the first screenshot is related to document and not the batch.  The Approval Document might have been deleted. But it is possible that batch has some other transaction too. Print Non Finalized Transaction to be sure. Try to finalize and if not possible then check the error log</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimouyang</div><div class="date">8th August 2007, 07:19</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for reply. I did try to print the non-finalized transaction before posting this question; but NO data at all, which means all transaction has been finalized!? and I could not finalize those transactions that in fact belong to deleted status, but visually free in tfgld1111s000.  My workmate in europ just removes records from table(tfgld100) and it works, but has no idea the cause and how to prevent it happen again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">8th August 2007, 19:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally printing non-finalized means no data but not always.  In certain rare circumstances there can be a disconnect between the batch and the unfinalized data.  What I like to do is actually look at the table tfgld102 and verify that there is indeed no data.  If you determine it is an empty batch then you should update the status in tfgld100 to deleted (tfgld100.stat) but never actually remove the record from the table.  If I was really going to play it ultra safe however I would want to be sure that there are no finalized records with that batch number  this however requires a custom report / query as there is no standard report that prints by batch number.<br />
<br />
I noticed in your screen shots that you have Invoke Backround process session open.  This as you may know is only successfully used on transaction types that have update mode as real time or End of Session.  You might consider changing the mode on this transaction type to finalization as real time can introduce performance problems and could possibly contribute to this issue you are having.<br />
<br />
On a side note your user profile says you use Baan 7.1d.08.161 but that is the version of the Baan Windows client and not the actual software.  Since that version of the BW is used normally with either Baan 5b or 5c you might want to indicate which as the BaanBoard community might better answer your questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimouyang</div><div class="date">9th August 2007, 11:14</div></div><div class="posttext">5802 batch only has one transaction that was &quot;deleted&quot; in tfgld1504m000. <br />
5802 has many records in tfgld1111s000 sessions. However I can only print the screen shot next time (I believe it will happen again)because my workmate modified it already.  Sorry, I should say document status difference,<br />
but document status of 5802 was ok: deleted. I don't know the free batch 5802 contained which non-finanlized transaction because no such transaction can be found at all. <br />
<br />
<br />
I did try the 'Invoke Backround process and 'rebuild transaction', but no help.   End of Session is what used for APR transaction. Your advice is great. <br />
<br />
I use baan5c, my computer is vista which brings lots of headach. From the screenshot you may see my BW. <br />

Thank you -jim in shanghai</div></div><hr />
