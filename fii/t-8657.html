<br />
One of our customers, using BaaN 4c, tries to implement T.O. = Purchase and Inventory On Order Integration Transaction.<br />
<br />
He says that the integration transaction is not created for Cost Items.<br />
I have never used this transaction.<br />
<br />
Does any one know of such a problem?<br />

It's normal that for cost items no inventory related transactions are generated, since cost items are, per definitions, non stockable ones, so they dont have inventory transactions.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the answer.<br />
I tend to agree with you although BaaN do creates financial integration transactions for purchase reciepts of a cost item. (For this they added GLD account and dimenssion fields in the purchase order line of a cost item).<br />
<br />
Since they did not define accounting fields for on order transactions, I suppose it is not a bug and thats the it works.<br />
<br />
Maybe I will try to check relevant programs, just to be sure.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Integration Transactions do need to be mapped for purchase receipts of cost items, as the purchase order value and subsequent invoice difference need to get into the accounts (typically into overhead). This is nothing to do with inventory.<br />
If these are mapped in integrations, they default into the account and dimension fields on the P.O.<br />
<br />
To reiterate the point correctly made before, cost items, by their very nature, have nothing to do with inventory.<br />
<br />
Back to the &quot;on order&quot; integration transaction, this is for non-cost items, and is activated by one of the Sales Order Management and Purchase Order Management parameters. Can't remember which ones at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Baan IV, the &quot;on order&quot; integration transaction for Purchasing is activated in Maintain INV Parameters (tdinv0100m000) by setting the field &quot;Link PUR Orders to Finance&quot; to yes.<br />
<br />
The &quot;on order&quot; integration transaction for Sales is activated by setting the field &quot;Link SLS Orders to Finance&quot; to yes.<br />
