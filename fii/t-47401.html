<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcransom</div><div class="date">29th January 2008, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been receiving the following error over the last two (2) weeks.  I have been running TFGLD4201M000 via a JOB with the immediate start of finalization parameter set to YES for literally &quot;years&quot;.  Now recently I am getting this error.<br />
<br />
<br />
Process 35 - fatal error:  Error 107 (Record is locked) on tfgld106100 (max retries (1) exceeded)<br />
<br />
process 45 - fatal error: Can not continue tfgld1212s000 in DLL: otfglddll1126 (&lt;0&gt;)<br />
<br />
Baan support is also &quot;stumped&quot; on this one.  At their recommendation I changed my JOB to add a step for global selection of batches for finalization and the YES parameter (to No)... but I still get the error listed above.  <br />
<br />
After some investigation, I have concluded we have not made any configuration changes that would affect this process.  We have 75M records in the TFGLD106, which is large, but am unable to archive at the present time. Lastly, its an oracle DB.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help<br />

<br />
Just some thoughts to ponder on... although you may have already looked at these...<br />
<br />
I suspect the second error is a result of the first and that you have just the one error which because it's not resolved keeps aborting the job.<br />
<br />
Do you get the error message when you run the session manually? Maybe the script is the problem. <br />
If you narrow down the range of intergrations looked at does this avoid the problem?<br />
(This might help identify, in terms of date, where abouts the problem is in the tables)<br />
<br />
75M is a fair sized table, is there a chance that it's size of the data causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Has a file got hung up in the table - flags set wrong/corrupted<br />
<br />
Is there anything in the error log, that could shed light on the problem?<br />
<br />
All the best,<br />

When a integration batch generation is interrupted by any cause (computer reboot, network problems, electricity fail, etc), the process marks the last integration batch as in use or locks the record.<br />
<br />
I suggest you to review the Enterprise Manager Console to review if there is a lock on the record (usually table tfgld102) and delete them. Also you have to review in baan, for batches in use or locked, using session, ttstpdellocks.<br />
And finaly, review in table tfgld101 and tfgld100 for in use status for batches.<br />
This last one, have to review it without users using finance module due to, some in use batches status could be correct if the user is using that batch.<br />
Sesions tfgld1116m000 and tfgld1117m000 could help you on this.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
