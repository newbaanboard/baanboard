<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">31st March 2005, 01:34</div></div><div class="posttext">My inventory reconciliation was working fine each month till November 2004 to penny. I used to run  tdinv6230m000 and tie with the Trial Balance inventory account. But all of sudden, for December month there is a difference of $1366. I looked in detail but got no clue. There is no manual JV done with these accounts.<br />
 <br />
I also run the session  tdinv0256m000 to check if anything has criss-crossed the December 2004 to/from January 2005. But could not find anything. Do you know any other &quot;Correction program or any other session&quot; which will help me to find why this difference happned all of a sudden only in december. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">31st March 2005, 18:55</div></div><div class="posttext">When running the inventory value you should be aware of the following:<br />
If you run it for the current day Baan takes the on hand inventory quantity from tdinv001 (inventory by warehouse).  If you back date the report it does the following:<br />
   tdinv001.hstb (historical balance)  this is created when you archive and is the total quantity of the archived records.  It then adds or subtracts the quantity from tdinv700 (history records) up to the date you enter when you run the report.  <br />
<br />
Now things can get bad if one of the history records is bad or if tdinv001 is not correct.  Here is what I do to find this.  Run the report twice.  Run the first time at the end of a day when there will be no more transactions for the current day. (This uses the values from tdinv001). Run the report the next day (anytime) but back date it to yesterday.  Compare the reports.  If you run by item group first you probably will find one or more groups that do not match.  You can then do the same for the detail by these item groups.  When you find the differences you then need to investigate the tdinv001 totals and the tdinv700 records.  The tdinv700 record contains a field tdinv001.stoc which is the inventory by warehouse after the transaction.  You can look at these records and see if this field look correct.  It may indicate a missing or corrupted record.  I often add this field to of tdinv7510m000 form 3.  I early versions of Baan this was displayed.<br />
<br />
Hope this makes sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might check the integration transaction log, maybe not all warehouse transactions have been posted. Other possibility is to check the integration set up, are you checking all ledger accounts that are mentioned?<br />
<br />
As for the valuation session tdinv6230m000, it is not as efficient as could be: if valuation is needed on a certain date, this usually will be a recent date; like Judy stated, it starts from scratch (or history) and calculates up to the given date. I changed this session, so that it start with the actual stock (most reliable) in tdinv001 and calculates backupwards to the given date using tdinv700. It's more reliable and better for performance.<br />

If not then you can identify which groups are having problems and work towards that.</div></div><hr />
