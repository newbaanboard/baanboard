<br />
I wonder how other LN/Baan Finance Users do write off customer overpayments. Example:<br />
<br />
A Sales Invoice over 1000,-- EUR has been posted, an unallocated receipt of 1001,-- EUR entered and matched with the invoice - there will be a negative amount on the open entries for the particular customer. The standard session tfacr2240m000 (write of payment diff.) ignores this amount so I wonder who has encountered that &quot;problem&quot; and how did you fix that. <br />
<br />
My solution was to create a transaction type (kind: payment) and added the Payment Diff. Account  - but that does not seem to be very comfortable.<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be much appreciated.<br />
