<br />
 :) Indeed after a long time.<br />
<br />
Scenario: BaaN 5c SP8<br />
<br />
While processing depreciation (mass depreciation) for a period and for a particular asset, it is posting twice in GLD but shows the status as posted only once in FAM.  This is only for one asset and its happening from period 4<br />
of the current year 2004.<br />
<br />
What would be the possible problem or defect?<br />
<br />
Thanks to all in anticipation<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rocky6</div><div class="date">27th October 2004, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">This parameter has to do with how EP will generate &quot;rescheduling messages&quot;--it won't effect the quantities on planned or actual orders.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you set this to &quot;yes&quot; -- i.e., check the box -- EP will give you a message to move an entire order, not just part of it.<br />
<br />
Maybe an example will help:<br />
<br />
Say you have an item (A) that has a safety stock of 20 and you have a Purchase Order (in PUR, not a planned order) that has a planned receipt date of next Friday. Then you have a demand for a parent item (B) of this purchased item, where five (5) pieces of the component (A) are needed next Tuesday. You Simulate Orders, and then go look at the rescheduling messages (signals).<br />
<br />
If you have the parameter checked, you'll have a message to move in (expidite) the entire PO quantity to Tuesday.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the parameter checked, you'll have  a message to move in (expidite) part of the PO quantity (5 pieces) to Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is only a messsage, and you're planners still have to do something about it.</div></div><hr />
