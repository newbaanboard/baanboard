<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">altfplak</div><div class="date">1st August 2006, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">If you set in CMG parameter &quot;Adjust Tax for deductions&quot; to yes (tccom000.avat = 1), you can select, if you want to set-up the accounts by Financial BP-group or by tax code (tccom000.dedu = 1 or 2).<br />
<br />
this is legal requirment for instance in some European Countries, that VAT is reduced, if discount/payment differences are applied<br />
<br />
If you set the parameter to tax code, you need to enter in tfcmg0510m000 for each tax code for purchase- and sales transactions a ledger account for discount and  payment differences (and late payment surcharge if located in NL).<br />
<br />
If you realize a discount and/or payment difference at cash receipt/payment then the relevant ledger accounts are picked up.<br />
<br />
Since tccom0510m000 offers you no possibility to add dimension, the dimenstions must be added in ledger accounts by Fincancial BP group session (tfacr0111m000, tfacp0111m000) in all cases.</div></div><hr />
