<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently working on a complete overhaul of our commission system.  I cannot find any documentation listing the key elements that are available for the CMS transaction types (CMS-Reservation and CMS-Purchase Invoice).  For other integrations the answers lie in this help section:<br />
- Open session tdinv8150m000. <br />
- Click on the Help Menu and select Using Session option.<br />
- Click the Inventory and WIP Transaction Accounts link.<br />
- Click the Integration INV with Baan Finance link.<br />
<br />
This gives you help tfgld00060sf000020 which provides this information for a wide variety of other integration transactions but not CMS related ones.  I then went into SSAGlobals documentation and found SSAGlobal document U8832A US (Baan Finance Integration) and again it has significant information on integrations but nothing on CMS transactions.  <br />
<br />
I also searched wtihin Baanboard, but found nothing there either.<br />
<br />
Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />

The ledger account numbers defined in session tdcms2101m000 Maintain Commission/Rebate Transaction Accounts.  <br />
<br />
The system will automatically post the accrual reversal for CMS/Purchase Invoice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">5th June 2006, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your response.  The tdinv8150m000 was only used to get to the help section that provides information on what key elements are available to drive the costs to dimensions.  All transaction combinations are documented there except for CMS.  That is the information I was looking for.  I have submitted a support case and even they are having difficulty finding the information...</div></div><hr />
