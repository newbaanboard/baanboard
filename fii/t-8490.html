<br />
I am totally unaware of finance module &amp; posting this thread onbehalf of my accounts department.<br />
<br />
Our accounts department generates an aging analysis report thru session tfacp2420m000 &amp; get the report in a no of formats.<br />
<br />
There are always some receipts not posted to finance &amp; accounts wants a againg analysis report which should also include unposted receipts.<br />
<br />
i.e. Is there any standard report which include aging analysis by supplier (with  posted transactions &amp; unposted transactions)<br />
<br />
This may be one of the absurd thread but please suggest something. Infact I don't know anything regarding finance module.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

The aging analysis report only prints data which is in the open entries table in finance.  Basically this is any invoices or cash in the open entries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 11:39</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some purchase orders for which receipts are made but purchase invoices not printed. Also thse transactions are yet to be posted in finance.<br />
<br />
These purchase orders are having status as print purchase invoices. <br />
<br />
In other words our management analysis of suppliers based on receipt date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">20th January 2003, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a report tfacp1432m000 which shows orders which have been received but have not had invoices entered in Finance.  <br />
<br />
Invoices for purchase are entered manually though finance and are not posted through integration.    As far as I know there is no way to age receipts which have no invoices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Maria is right, there is no possibility to see the receipts in the aging analysis because there is no booking on liability account for it. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajnish Goyal</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">first of all i need some clarifications<br />
<br />
1. Do you want to see the outstanding of suppliers or customers?<br />
<br />
2. If it is in case of suppliers, there will be no receipt from suppliers?<br />
<br />
3. what do meant by posting or unposting? is this finalised or unfinalised transactions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">1. I want to see outstanding of suppliers with aging.<br />
<br />
2. Receipt if made against a purchase order generated against a supplier (Vendor)<br />
<br />
3. I want to include those purchase receipts having purchase order status as <br />
<br />
1.      Maintain receipt     -  Yes<br />
<br />
2.      Maintain approval  -  Yes or No<br />
<br />
3.      Maintain CENVAT Receipts - Yes or No<br />
<br />
4.      Print Purchase invoice - Yes or No.<br />
<br />
More clearly I want to include purchase order having status as any of above. <br />
<br />
Also there is one field matched as tdpur045.matc in tdpur045. I want to include the receipts having status as no.<br />
<br />
Thanks for extending me an helping hand. Our management wants to have an debtors included in aging as soon the material is received in factory premises rather then the party's bill is booked in finance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajnish Goyal</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">1. When you make a Receipt against a PO, there is no financial document generated ( only inventory entry is passed, inventory dr &amp; PBR Cr).<br />
2. In supplier aging only those docoument comes which are passed in finance module. (when purchase is match and approved, payment to supplier etc.)<br />
<br />
So as per your requirement this is not feasible to see all the documents.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can customise your own report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajnish Goyal</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 11:18</div></div><div class="posttext">as per your query regarding that your management wants that creditors updated as soon as material comes in side the premises<br />
<br />
this is already happening, might be you have not studied the entries of receipt<br />
<br />
when any receipt is made the entries are generated like this<br />
<br />
<br />
Material      Debit<br />
<br />
<br />
Purchase bill to be received      credit</div></div><hr />
