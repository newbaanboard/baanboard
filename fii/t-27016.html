 <br />
I am facing a problem, during the &quot;Post Integration Transactions to Finance - tfgld4201m000&quot; Session. It posts the transactions with Transaction Origin &quot;Sales&quot; and Fin. Transaction &quot;Issue&quot;.<br />
But In case of  Transaction Origin &quot;Sales&quot; and Financial Transaction &quot;Sales Invoice&quot; it is displaying the Transaction Status as &quot;Erroneous&quot; in tfgld4510m000 Session. <br />
When I go to Display integration Transaction Lines The Ledger Account for Line No. 1 is Missing, My problem is where to define this Ledger A/c. and How can I map this.<br />
<br />
I printed the Integration Transaction Log also, It is giving Error Message: Ledger Accfount cannot defined:tdsls6000/tcmcs036<br />
<br />
I am also attaching the Screen Shots of this. Please find the File IntegrationError.zip<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It is under Finance/General ledger/Integraton with other modules/Miscell (in Baan IV), it may have moved in your version.  You can specify a ledger for both the debit ledger and the credit ledger.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

I have seen this where the warehouse or one of the dimensions cannot be mapped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">4th May 2006, 20:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at your settings in tdsls6102m000 'Maintai Invoice Detail Accounts' you can set up by a number of different variables.  warehouse is one of them.  This is under Baan/Distribution/Sales Control/ Link with FINANCE.  Then check into session tccom0106m000 'Maintain Unit Sets' under BaanIV /Common/ Tables/ Maintain Logistics Tables/Maintenance 3<br />
Hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francisco DÃ­az</div><div class="date">10th May 2006, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that the Customer has the field &quot;VAT&quot; empty, so the software is unable to stablish which sales ledger account should use.  It can only be repaired by modifying rows in tfgld410, tfgld417 and tfgld418.  I do not have access at ths moment to tell which fields tou should check.  Try looking at properly integrated sales invoice and make the changes in those tables.  All the customers should have the &quot;Vat&quot; field set to yes to avoid this error message.</div></div><hr />
