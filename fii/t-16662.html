At this site, we run this session twice a month.<br />
<br />
How often would you reccomend running this session ? What are the advantages / disadvantages running this session more frequently?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We only ever run any of the finance repair options on a needs to basis. Immediately after implementation we were running some on these sessions quite frequently due to various issues (normally user errors or bugs). Since we have managed to make our system more stable we hardly ever run any of these sessions.<br />
<br />
I suppose another factor to be taken into consideration here is the size of your data and the number of companies you are running. I also notice you are running Baan V which may for whatever reason require these sessions to be run more freqeuntly.<br />

We run the session only when we have to, i.e. when we had to make changes to table tfgld106 or when a finalisation run failed and has caused problems with the trial balance figures. The only 'regular' run is before year end. Running it does take a couple of hours, we schedule it as a batch job to be run overnight, so it's not really an issue.<br />
I found that in Baan V there is a lot less need to run it since there are less problems with finalisation runs failing.</div></div><hr />

1. When total of trial balance in not zero.<br />
2. When the parent child relationship of ledger accounts has changed.<br />
3. When the parene child relationship of dimensions has changed.</div></div><hr />
