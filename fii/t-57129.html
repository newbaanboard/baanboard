1. Tax code for a sales invoice was wrongly mapped to a diff account.<br />
2. With the help of Infor support line, we discovered this and corrected the same using the correction program.<br />
3. while we were posting thr invoice to finance (after correction), we got an intergration error 'Cannot define ledger account(sls).<br />
4.Again infor helped us out by creating the mapping for the respective item group on session(tdsls6102m000).<br />
PLS NB: The company never maintained the mapping for individual item groups in this session.<br />
<br />
The question i wanted to clarify is:<br />
1. If there was no mapping maintained in the past for specific item groups, how were the invoices being posted correctly all this while???<br />
2. If the default setup, was already present( which was existing), then why did the particular invoice did not get posted?<br />
3. has it got anything to do with the correction programs (of deleting records from specific tables???)<br />
<br />
Following is the attachment of the same.<br />
Need help!</div></div><hr />
