<br />
We have a situation where we have received overpayments from customers and would like to issue checks from A/P to reimburse.<br />
<br />
In Vc, if appears that this is not a trivial task.<br />
<br />
Steps appear to include:<br />
<br />
Issue invoice/negative credit note in A/R and link<br />
Issue invoice for payment in A/P and write check.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a method for linking a cash receipt to a check for reimbursement?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

You could also flag any such customers, as suppliers as well, thus, allowing you to do either of two options, offset AR and AP, if applicable, OR<br />
Pay regular chq's to the customers as they will also be recorded as suppliers<br />

<br />
The apparent issue is that these overpayments are category &quot;Cash&quot; and we cannot get the system to reimburse them.  We have tried setting up the Business Partner with Supplier roles as well as Customer, which is the same as linking Suppliers and Customers in Baan IV.  We still are not able to directly pay these overpayments.<br />
