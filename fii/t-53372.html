<br />
We are using ERP LN. <br />
<br />
We would like to include the non-finalized transactions into our financial reports. But no matter how we process the financial statement, only the finalized balances are shown.<br />
<br />
We even check in the General Table Maintenance session, check the table tffst 305 and tffst 300, the non finalized transactions balances does not appear at all, only the finalized balances are shown.<br />
<br />
Is there is parameter that we need to select in order for us to include the non finalized transactions balances?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

I would say that the reason is a special setting in the transaction types. In Baan IV you choose in the transaction types, at which status in the transaction the figures are shown in the ledger-history (immediately, end of program oder finalization) but I do not know Baan LN. Perhaps there is somewhere in LN a similar setting regarding the ledger-history?<br />

<br />
Thank you for the info.<br />
<br />
We have created a new transaction type with Real Time, and find that the non finalised transactions is now updated to the financial report.<br />
