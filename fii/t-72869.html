<br />
We are currently on a dematerialisation of our Suppliers Invoices and would like to know the options to integrate them in the Invoicing module in ERP LN7<br />
<br />
One would be to create from the scan a *.txt or *.xml file and convert the file to an INV001.txt EDI INVOICE file or perhaps an Exchange Import ??<br />
<br />
We also have some Suppliers who are using an EDI platform, but I am searching to standard INFOR (or SSA Global) documents in which I could fin an example of an INVOIC:D:96A and its translated INV001.txt for integration.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help.<br />
<br />
Best regards from France :)<br />
