We are facing a problem in year closing process and your help is more than needed.<br />
While closing year  for a company using tfgld6203m000 session we receive the following message:<br />
&quot;Balance Ledger 30010000 does not tally for currency USD.Table gld201/3=6209.93 and Table gld205/6=5294.93&quot;.<br />
<br />
We have checked that all transactions are finilized.<br />
Any idea of the problem?</div></div><hr />

For the close year, there is a specific procees that involves reconstuct from finalized batches.<br />
<br />
Do you have this process? If not, I will glad to send you.<br />
<br />
But also, I suggest to contact the SSA Global Support for a trace for this problem.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mvanta</div><div class="date">18th July 2006, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a process that we follow while closing the year but in this case with no success.I have asked SSA for help, hoping for a solution.<br />
Any idea of the problem??Have you seen it before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">18th July 2006, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
Yes, in fact, in our installation, if we don't follow the procedure, this error appears. SSA global also upgraded the programs involved on the year close.<br />
<br />
<br />
The tables 200's are the history of balance for ledger accounts an dimensions, if there is a difference this mean that the total credit/debit are not equal on both tables. So teoretically, running the sesion tfgld3203m000 for all the year, the error must be corrected.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mvanta</div><div class="date">18th July 2006, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes we are thinking that rebuild will be our first move tomorrow morning.<br />
Hope will solve the problem.<br />
Thank you very much for your time!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mvanta</div><div class="date">20th July 2006, 11:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The solution is as follows...in case someone else faces a similar problem.<br />
We changed Period Status to closed(from ttaad4100)then ran Rebuild(tfgld3203m000(or tfgld3206m000).<br />
By running tfgld1206m000 (with final closing all modules) and at the end tfgld6203m000(Close Year), year was closed succesfully.</div></div><hr />
