In accounts payable/transaction processing there is a session to match and approve invoice.  Try match it there.  Unfortunately I do not have access to a system right now to give you the session name.</div></div><hr />

Tks for reply. The invoice is matched and approved. Sorry for the omission of word approved. <br />
<br />
I am trying to insert another invoice to the order in session tfacp1132s000 with 0 qty for the difference amt of 100. Later on I want to pass a debit note for the diff. amt to the supplier a/c. This has generated a price difference amt of -150.   tdpur046.clos displays &quot;No&quot; which indicates that no price difference should be generated for the new insertion.    ?????<br />
<br />
Will this work around work and enable me to close project????? <br />

<br />
MariaC is correct in her comments and the session she refers to is stated above.<br />
<br />
Dont forget that the approved invoice still has to be finalised and all integrations have been completed to finish the process.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a seperate note:<br />
You may also need to consider if you should have set the receipt as partial and cleared off the full quantity and set the price to actual. As you have entered it the cost price calculation will take the receipt price and not the actual price when calculating the cost of a component. This may not be important if the price is a &quot;one off&quot; special and you want to use the normal price but if the lower actual price is the normal then the cost price calculation will be overstated.<br />

<br />
When Finance is implemented, the average/latest purchase prices are determined during the match/approval process as Maria and Penfold have advised. I believe, however,  they are not actually updated and definitely not written to history until processed by tdpur4223m000.<br />
