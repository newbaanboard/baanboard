<br />
I am not able to close the tax period only.<br />
I have closed the period for fiscal and tax but gives error in closing the tax periods .<br />
<br />
the error is in tfgld 100 with some intergration transaction.<br />
If we check the batch status then that particular batch shows &quot;Fianaly successfuly&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please can some one help me in this case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimbacon44</div><div class="date">24th November 2007, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">check the tfgld 101 table, sometimes the transaction is not set to finalized even though the 100 shows finalized.  Make sure that the tax period you are trying to close does not overlap, ie. closing November but the tax period runs until Dec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
In both the table (tfgld100 and 101) batch status is finalized.I have checked that. even after closing the period the system does not show all the batch at one time it always shows only 4 batches every time. <br />
<br />
I did not understand what do you mean by overlap of tax period. I would request you to breif more deeply. I my case the compay is working on NOV to OCT,year end was on 31st oct 2007. and the error is coming in last 3 periods. As per my knowledge we set up the start date for every period then too it overlaps....?<br />
<br />
Awaiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
As per what you are saying you are getting error on tfgld100 while trying to close period Aug, Sept and Oct. Use the maintain periods status session and here when u close the tax period of Aug, it will show you the batch number and the table number that has the error. <br />
<br />
This will always show you the first batch that is wrong. After this is rectified then it will go to the next batch that has the problem<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
now my query is how to find the errors,as the batches are integration batches and they are finalized sucessfully.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Yogesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajhyd</div><div class="date">28th November 2007, 08:13</div></div><div class="posttext">While period closing if there are errors then normally the system checks tfgld100,tfgld101,tfgld102 tables. Even if it is an integration batch, check these tables thoroughly.<br />
<br />
I would repeat what was told earlier, the session will tell you the batch number and the table number that is error.<br />
