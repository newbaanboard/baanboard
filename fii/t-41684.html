<br />
in LN 6.1 (FP3) we do use valuation method MAUC for all item types and need to set up surcharges for raw materials. The requirement is that the surcharge is only used when the raw mat. is being consumed through a production order. Since the surcharge setup when using MAUC is cumulative (other then using FTP) I only found the solution to setup the surcharge on the raw material warehouse when purchasing. So actually we are increasing our inventory on purchasing rather then doing that on consumption the material.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have another solution for me ?<br />

Even if say it is possible to add a surcharge after consuming to rawmaterial, it  will get applied to the inventory on hand of raw material (which is not used), so your requirement will not be met. Once the invenotry is consumed, it is part of WIP. I am nit sure if in LN one can jhave surcharges on WIP. The option of adding surcharge at parent should work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">14th September 2007, 22:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is that the setup of surcharges does not distinguis between &quot;warehouse issue&quot; on production orders, warehouse orders or any other type of transactions. Anyway I have found a solution that solves the problem - playing with negative surcharges on additional costs when it applies.<br />
