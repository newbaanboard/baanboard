<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">staugner</div><div class="date">8th March 2006, 01:00</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently using Baan IVC4 and have a horizontal structure of several companies (101,102,103, etc.).  We would like to change this without losing the existing structure so that they all report to one financial company and no purchase orders or sales orders need be exchanged between them.  We would like this to be done in the background by Baan without our interference.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone done this?  We don't have any ideas as to what needs to be done to make this happen.  All advice will be considered!<br />

Thanks,<br />
