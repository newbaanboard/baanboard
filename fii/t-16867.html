Because when we run the session 5202 the system displays &#8220;file not present or not in good format&#8221;<br />

<br />
This message occurs if there is no file present for conversion or the file is present in the wrong directory. The file for a particular bank relation should be present in the directory given in session tfcmg0110m000 (maintain bank relations). In the form 2 of this session u should specify the path for the ebs files and also the archival of ebs files. U should put the conversion file in the path given for ebs files.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps<br />

<br />
We defined for the Bank relation boths paths.<br />
For the File is  \\lxpro\baanf\exchange1\file\<br />
and for the archive \\lxpro\baanf\exchange1\archive\<br />
<br />
and we create a test file (stat01.txt) in the first path. but the system is sending the same error message. Could be another think or parameter to check.<br />
<br />
These paths we use for the exhange module Import and Export.<br />

MY path is \\server\D$\EBS, but it keeps popping up directory not present. What do you mean put the conversion file in the given path for EBS files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">1st September 2010, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I found that I need to simply use the local drive rather than a server, C:/EBS for example. I have created a test .prn (flat file) and I have loaded into the EBS directory Path that I created. when going to Convert EBS (tfcmg5202m000) I can now choose BNK for the Bank relation and the Pathname EBS files (C:/EBS) but it I still see nothing in the Display Batchs for EBS or the (tfcmg5500s000). What do you think I could be doing wrong here? My .prn file should match my maintain Conversion for EBS, shouldnt my prn file show up in the Display Batchs for EBS??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">7th September 2010, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Madan. Here is my Test file: <br />
<br />
TEST File (http://www.geekzee.com/Baan/test.prn)<br />
<br />
See my screenshots of EBS and Baan here.  (http://www.geekzee.com/Baan/EBSEXAMPLE.docx)<br />
<br />
I think I have everything right here. When I place the prn file into the D:/EBS directory, i put in the batch number (prn file name) and it says batch not found. Am I missing a step??<br />
<br />
Does a batch = a flat file in the directory?</div></div><hr />

I have seen your conversion data setup.  First position is used for incoming receipt.  We already reserved that position for record type.  Date format should be setup properly.  In your file as there &quot;/&quot; symbols we need to setup properly.  Like Year 1 to 4, Month 6 to 7 etc (5th position is &quot;/&quot;, exclude this).  for the incoming receipt/outgoing payment you need to enter some text like &quot;i&quot; for incoming receipt and &quot;o&quot; for outgoing payment in conversion data setup.  As per my knowledge date, amount and incoming receipt/outgoing payment are mandatory fields for one record.  Yes, you are correct one batch will be created for one file we convert.<br />

Yes you are correct that those 3 fields are mandtory. I've changed the way fields are laid out in my Matain Conversion Data for EBS to now match the file much better. I now see what you mean by the setup position, also for the first position, since Ive already used it in Maintain record Types. Do you happen to know when in the Convert EBS module, when you click on EBS Batch, it should read all the text or prn/flat files in that directory, yes?? Thats where my hold up is with, Ive got my file path listed in there correctly but EBS Batch # defaults to the #1 and always says &quot;File not present of in good condition&quot;. When I take my text file and rename it as some generic like 123456 for example, the error simply says &quot;Batch not found&quot;. See the attachment. <br />

<br />
GOOD NOTE: Batch number should be next available batch number.  As there are no batches already converted, system will default 1.</div></div><hr />
