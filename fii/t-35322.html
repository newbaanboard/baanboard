<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shriram</div><div class="date">4th May 2007, 03:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
<br />
I have been trying to implement fixed asset for a US customer. <br />
<br />
I am a little confused with the Averaging conventions. I have the basic explanation provided by Baan docs. But the exact calculation of service date and depreciation end date is not very clear. <br />
<br />
Can someone help me with what are the specific calculations for these averaging methods?<br />
<br />
In any case, I need the following implementation:<br />
We use a 10 year (120month) - Straight-Line method for all assets. On the front side, we recognize 1 full months depreciation during the month the asset is placed in service (doesnt matter if its the 1st day, the 15th day or the last day of the month).  On the back side, we take 1 full months depreciation in the month the asset is sold, disposed or taken out of service.  (Again, it doesnt matter if its the 1st day, the 15th day or the last day).  <br />
<br />
What would be the best convention to use in this case. I think the Averaging convention &quot;NONE&quot; should suffice. <br />
<br />
Any help on this will be appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
Regards<br />
