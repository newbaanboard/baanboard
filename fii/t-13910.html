<br />
I have the following situation, the company sold an item two months ago, now the customer is asking for a warranty and our technician has to travel to another city making some expenses (hotel, flight, food, car rental.... )  <br />
<br />
How can I link this expenses to the original invoice or sales order??  The main purpose is to know the exactly earn of the project, including additional expenses made after the project has been invoiced.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestion <br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
The revenues will be booked on the project.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">11th December 2003, 05:33</div></div><div class="posttext">If you just want to add this to the cost of the project, you can use Maintain General Project Cost (tipcs3140m000).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpadilla</div><div class="date">11th December 2003, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">what do you think aobut this..<br />
<br />
if I add the total expenses made by our technician like a General Cost of the project, but the integration setup debiting and crediting the sama acount.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, finance people make an journal entry invoice by invoice(purchases invoice of course...) debiting the apropiate expenses and VAT accounts, crediting Bank, Cash.....<br />
<br />
this is cause our laws ask for a final year report for  VAT payments by supplier, and most of them are once time purchase.<br />
<br />
If someone else has a better way to do it, I really appreciate..<br />
