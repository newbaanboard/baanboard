<br />
Our capital expenditure is budgetted on a case by case basis. F.i. Baan implementation budget is 2 million. when our ICT manager spends all this lovely he cash he buys: 1 server, 1 software package and a gazillion hours of consultancy hours.<br />
<br />
This makes it hard for me to follow how much of his budget he has (over)spent.<br />
<br />
Personally I thought that maybe session tffas0110m000 could be of use, but I heard somebody else mention something about using dimension codes.<br />
<br />
I want to keep track of investments, not depreciation as such in this case, so I would like to know how to set up the module.<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance,<br />
<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you think of using FAS- or FBS-Module for that kind of Budgetting?<br />
Regards, Juli  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Domburg</div><div class="date">26th March 2002, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">What I mean is that I would like to see recorded to what end an investment was made, so f.i.:<br />
<br />
1 server = 100k = Baanupgrade<br />
1 software = 50k = Baanupgrade<br />
10 laptops = 30k = Laptops for new empoyees<br />
100 hours of consultancy = 100k = Baanupgrade<br />
<br />
Now I can only see which of the first two columns were invested in any given period. But I cannot compare this to the budget I made.<br />
<br />
Therefore I would like to see how much was invested in a certain period for &quot;Baanupgrade&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you should use dimensions (tfgld0110m000) to solve your problem, and relate them to the accounts of investment. The advantage is that the amounts on the dimensions is booked with every invoice booked, and you can in parallel  maintain the budget for the same dimensions in the fbs-Module. Then you have a simple comparison of both figures, for example in tfgld3501m000 and tfgld3520m000, and tffbs1502m000. Additionally you can use the dimension in the FST-Module. <br />
<br />
If you use in IVc4 the controlling Package, you can even maintain a BAB with them. Unfortunately you didn't write in your profile which Baan Versio n you are on. <br />
<br />
If you don't know how to set up the dimensions, don't hesitate to ask for more information. <br />

<br />
Thanks for you GREAT help, Julisb, I need, however, to call on your assistance once more.<br />
<br />
started happily enter dimension 4 budgets and making them compulsory in de general ledger via tfgld0108m000.<br />
<br />
For some accounts, I get the notification &quot;Empty dimensions exist for this ledger account&quot;, when I press space it shows me the code &quot;tfglds0487&quot; (our ICT department allways wants to know this code, so I suppose it has some function)<br />
<br />
After this notification I am not allowed to make dimension 4 obligatory for that account.<br />
<br />
What to do next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Frank, <br />
<br />
this message want to explain that in the past/ history this account was already booked without dimension, so you cannot set it on mandatory, because that would mean that there are always (also in history) is a given dimension.  <br />
You have two possibilities now: <br />
1. you accept to set it only on optional, and give strict advice to the booking personal, that they should always give a dimension (e.g. cost center); if the integration scheme is set up properly those bookings shouldn't be a problem. If sometimes they forget, you can book correct this afterwards with a journal voucher, but that means double work. <br />
2. you block the old account and create a new one (e.g. only on adding a zero more) which you can set now on mandatory. With the sublevel you can sum up the old and the new accounts. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />
Bye, Juli</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is working excellently now.<br />
<br />
One more question though. It it possible to keep track of serial numbers and the likes in the FAS-module itself? I would not want to use dimension codes for this, as the field lengths are usually not big enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We put the serial number in the description field of tffas0106m000 mainatain fixed assets master data, but you can also use the business information sessions in fixed assets. We use this to record the purchase order used to buy the asset to save having to back track to find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Domburg</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Darren,<br />
<br />
What would the codes be for the business information sessions you mention?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">create a code using maintain business information codes  example 001 give it a description &quot;Machine serial no&quot;<br />
<br />
use maintain business information types create one for each fixed asset group that you want to use the serial no code with. You an set mandatory optional or not used like dimensions (set mandatory doesn't seem to work on our system IVc4 sch1 (sp9).<br />
<br />
use maintain business information definitions insert record with information code used earlier set the type as text as you are entering a serial number so maybe alphanumeric.<br />
<br />
You can insert the records for old assets  using use maintain business information details. for new assets should, I believe activate the session while inserting the new asset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The posts I place here on BaanBoard, the happier I become with the system.<br />
<br />
Too bad that after May 1st, I shall be working with Oracle Financial. ;-)<br />
<br />
Anywayz, after only a small number of posts our system is rapidly becoming VERY powerful. Thanks go out especially to you Darren and to Julisb.<br />
