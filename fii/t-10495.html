<br />
We have BaanERP 5.0b, with SP11.<br />
<br />
We have not specified any Finance Integration Mapping Scheme (tfgld4500m000). <br />
Still, we are finding that Finance Intrgation Transactions are being generated for Transaction Origin - Purchase and Fin. Transaction - Receipts/Direct Delivery.<br />
Similarly, Finance Intrgation Transactions are being generated for Sales and other types of Transactions Origins.<br />
<br />
Is there any way, we can stop these entries being generated ?<br />
<br />
In Baan IV C4, there used to be a parameter in PUR or SLS modules - Link with Finance.<br />
Is there such parameter in Baan ERP ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you very much for your prompt reply.<br />
<br />
In BaanERP 5.0b, there is no 2nd form in session tccom0500m000.<br />
(Compnay Data)<br />
<br />
tccom0500m000 invokes another sub-session tccom0100s000 (Companies). Here also, there is no 2nd form.<br />
Only field that may be of some effect is &quot;Finance Implemented&quot; - Yes/No.<br />
<br />
Obviously, we cannot set &quot;Finance Implemented&quot; to &quot;No&quot;, as it would stop working of other Finance functionality - Payables, Receivables, General Ledger etc.<br />
<br />
Is there any other way, by which we can stop the intgegration entries ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
