<br />
Currently testing a new c4 server and we have come across a difference between our current c3 server and the c4 server.<br />
<br />
At the moment on our c3 server the session tfacp1432m000 will let users approve price differences regardless of there authorisation levels. <br />
<br />
The c4 session appears to be looking at the values in tfacp0150m000 - Tolerated Price Differences by User and not letting users approve any invoices outside of their approval range.<br />
<br />
Which one of these sessions is behaving correctly ? I suspect that the c4 session is correct and the c3 contains a bug which we've lived with due to the fact that it works for us. <br />
<br />
I guess the theory is that only somebody with a higher authorisation level should approve the price differences is sound but the only problem I now have is that the ACP clerk wants the c4 session to behave like the c3 session so she can approve the price differences when they come back signed from her manager.<br />
<br />
Anybody any thoughts on this ?<br />

<br />
The session what you have given is a &quot;Open receiver report&quot;. Can you give me the correct session, so i can check it and let u know.<br />

<br />
Our process doesn't include any reports. Any invoices which can't be matched because of price difference issues are manually signed off by the Finance Manager.<br />
<br />
The clerical user then approves them using tfacp1142m000. Interesting that your c3 session works in the same way as ours.<br />
<br />
May have to talk to supoort for final clarification on whether our c3 or c4 is behaving correctly.<br />
<br />

<br />
As per the session information attached the c3 version does not have solution # 16278 for defect # 72085. This is where the check has been introduced. C4 version works correctly.<br />
