<br />
I usually make cash advance payment to my employees, to whom I have considered as Business Partner. Many a times the employee returns the left out advances after the tour is over. My worry is how to take back that remaining advance amounts given to them. I don't want to change my transaction type to allow me enter the negative amounts.<br />
Is there any other way to enter the same.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
you can try with negative amount. suppose  u received 100 pls select transaction category 'advance payment' but fill negative amount in amount field like -100 .<br />

But, when we dont select &quot;negative amounts are allowed&quot; in transaction type, we can not enter the negative amounts.  As per my opinion, when we are receiving the cash from employee, we can book that as advance receipt and link that to advance payment (what we paid to employee earlier).  In LN it is possible.  Right now I am not on LN, but as per my memory there is one session called &quot;Repay Advances&quot; which clears the advance balance by making reverse entry to it.  I am not sure whether this session is available for Advance payments or not.  <br />

If the advance is 100% then it does not allow to enter a new line with negative amount.<br />
in that case is there any solution.</div></div><hr />
