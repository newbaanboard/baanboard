Can anyone help me with this finance AP?<br />
<br />
In  tfcmg1257m000 Post Payments: the batch 198 is supposed to show payment batch status posted/selected but it is showing status paid.<br />
<br />
<br />
 (we haven't done that step yet!)<br />
<br />
So I checked the payment batch but could not figure what's the error.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
After 'Paid' only 'Posted' will come. I think you must have just printed the cheque or remittance letter. You can post the batch using session post payments after which the status will change to 'posted'. If someone has reset with 'reset payment status(tfcmg1280m000), you need to start from 'create payment order(tfcmg1256m000) in order to post.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I tried to do so.<br />
<br />
In this batch, we have payment Tele Transfer(TT) and Bank Draf(BD).<br />
<br />
Both are foreign Payment.<br />
<br />
When process to non-finalized transaction, the TT payment is not in the list.<br />
<br />
All the payments are correctly listed in advice payment but only the TT (Forex) is not in non-finalized.<br />
<br />
So, I checked the Bank Relation, Payment Method and other related tables.<br />
What is confusing me is this kind of payment was successfully done before.<br />
<br />
Can you please suggest any other way to process this payment successfully?<br />
<br />
Thanks alot.</div></div><hr />

See if you can't remove the TT payemnt from the batch and process those separately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll make sure that different batch is used to process different types of payments next time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now what can I do to process this payment?<br />
Can I delete the payment batch and non-finalized batch and redo the payment?<br />
<br />
Is that possible that the payment infomation will be redundant in the database?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. Bye.</div></div><hr />
