Sales return order generate credit notes in finance AR module. Is there a way to link the credit note automatically to another Sales invoice which was generated from a Sales order?<br />
<br />
At present the Credit note has information about the Sales return order and then we will have to check the Sales return order and then find the Original order or ask the Sales department, which is a time consuming process.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if there is a solution or work-around to this in Baan ERP LN 6.1 (FP5).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found that while creating the Sales return order, in the header details, there is a block with the heading as &quot;Returns&quot; in the session &quot;tdsls4100m000&quot;. The fields in this block needs to defined as follows;<br />
Original Document Type: Invoice<br />
Original Document Number: &lt;Company number&gt;, &lt;Original Sales Invoice number&gt;<br />
Return Reason: Select the appropriate Return Reason code.<br />
<br />
Then include Sales return order lines and process the sales order and the credit note that is generated will be automaticall set-off with the original invoice amount. If the Sales return order credit note value is less than the original Sales Invoice value, then the credit note will be fully set-off with the Sales Invoices and the remaining balance will be shown in the Sales Invoice.<br />
<br />
This could avoid the finance department from spending time on assigning Credit notes to Sales invoices where the Sales return order process can define the original Sales invoice number.<br />
<br />
I could simulate the same and hence thought of sharing the same with all Baan consultants in Baan ERP LN 6.1 (FP5).<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps.</div></div><hr />
