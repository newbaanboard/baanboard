In session tfacp1130s000 Match/Approve purchase invoice with order, and sub session tfacp1131s000 I have multiple receipts against one purchase order/supplier invoice., but the session only returns the first line of the purchase order. Any suggestions on how to match/display multiple receipts?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdbailey</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I found a  solution to this problem.  When registering an invoice to be matched, each document may only be matched to one receipt day. Multiple receipts on one day are displayed, but receipts on different days are not, requiring an additional matching process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not encountered your problem on IVc4 (or earlier versions). If the only matching criteria you enter in Maintain Purchase Invoices is the PO number, you should be able to see all receipts against the PO that are unmatched or partially matched. <br />
<br />
The receipts, of course, must have been approved in PUR. (i.e., smply received if no inspection, received &amp; approved if inspected.)<br />
<br />
Can you give us an example of the exact matching fields that are the filled out in the Maintain Purchase Invoice session? (options are PO#, Receipt Date, Project # and Packing Slip #)  <br />
<br />
Also, confirm that you are attemtping to enter/match/approve via Maintain Purchase Invoices (tfacp1110s000) in one batch, rather than registering and finalizing the invoice in one batch, then matching and approving it separately (via Match/Approve Purchase Invoices with Orders (tfacp1130m000))? <br />

<br />
When we encounter this we always leave the purchase order field blank this then calls up all orders and all approved receipts for that supplier... True, it can take a few seconds (or longer!) for the listing to come up but it does work and we have yet to find a smarter way to deal with multi lined supplier invoices. <br />
<br />
Dont forget what has been said by others above if the receipt needs approval it will not show up on the matching screen until it has been approved</div></div><hr />
