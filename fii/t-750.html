I would dearly love to see any guides, information etc about what is a very confusing area of Baan Finance. In Baan ERP there is a whole module called &quot;Cost Accounting&quot; (confusingly), which is basically for cost allocations, but I have never really found out what it is for (in all its rich functionality)<br />
An overview would be great.<br />
This is one of the areas not covered by the Baan ERP training documents (i.e. was still on the list when they ran out of money) - any beta versions out there would be a find.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a Cost Accounting manual for BaanIV.  I'm sure if you contact Baan they will be able to provide with the manual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">14th January 2002, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it's called Cost Allocations and is completely unsuitable for Baan ERP, which has changed substantially.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abennett</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 13:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume we are talking about &quot;Cost Allocations&quot; in Finance and not &quot;Cost Accounting&quot; which is to do with Item Costing.<br />
<br />
The Cost Allocation module has two main purposes. The first is to deliver some Activity Based Costing Functionality. It is limited, but does trap many of the drivers required for ABC. I played about with this for a short while, but found it quite complex to get to  work with expected results.<br />
<br />
Another function of this module is to take the cost of one department(Dimension) and allocate these across others. As an example of this would be to take the cost of non direct departments such as the &quot;Maintenance Dept&quot; and apportion these costs across other Direct departments to calculate a companies  Direct Costs. I used this part in Baan IV and it worked quite well.<br />
<br />
Hope it gives you a brief idea of what the module does, but I did find it one of the more complex modules within in Baan and little expertise out there to get help from.<br />

<br />
Yes, Baan in their in finite wisdom have called the module &quot;Cost Accounting&quot; in Baan ERP.<br />
Not Cost Accounting as I know it, Spock.</div></div><hr />
