We use standard pricing on every item.  I want to see the variance between standard price and invoiced price on an order line by line basis for the period.<br />
<br />
So far we run tfgld4410m000 for three accounts: 601010, 601020, and 601040, but summing the DRs and CRs doesn't work as the lines don't always match up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SSG2BB</div><div class="date">22nd July 2011, 02:26</div></div><div class="posttext">The other way you might look at this is to review the mapping and confirm the ledger accounts where the transaction type for PPV is posting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnbhatt</div><div class="date">25th July 2011, 13:30</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan4 purchase price variance is booked under purchase / Result transaction combination. Using tfgld4410m000 you may print the report for this combination that will be PPV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">27th July 2011, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Possible, but it is a pretty intense custom report.  PPV can come from multiple places, but will ultimately end up with a finalized transaction in your PPV account.  From there (tfgld106), you have to determine if the transction was a manual posting to PPV or via integrations.  If manual, your reference data will come from tfgld106.  If integrations, you can find the source integrations (tfgld418, tfgld410, tfgld417) to determine if the PPV came from a purchase receipt and/or result.  The integration will provide your link back to the original purchase order and receipt (tdpur041/tdpur045).</div></div><hr />
