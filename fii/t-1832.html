<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanbab</div><div class="date">26th April 2002, 00:53</div></div><div class="posttext">When I do Process Delivered Sales Orders - tdsls4223m000 ( this is in Baan IVc4 ) the Tax code is empty for the first line in tfgld410.  ( First line is where the Type of Sales is empty for the Transaction Origin Sales and Financial Trascation is sales invoice ).<br />
<br />
Since tax code is empty when I Post Integration transactions to Finanace Transaction the Tax code in sales invoice - tfacr200 is empty.<br />
<br />
When I do a sales correction for the invoice. I am not able to finalize as the ledger account for the tax line is not filled in tfgld107. <br />
<br />
I checked the DLL tfglddll4011 the following function is executed :<br />
function extern domain tfgld.sern itfgld.dll4011.write.invoice<br />
<br />
I found they are not updating the vat code in tfgld410. Is it a bug?????<br />
<br />
Please reply to this query. Thanks</div></div><hr />

I had a look on our tfgld410 and tfacr200, the vat code is always empty for those positions.I think it depends on the parameter tfacr000.vatc. Tax calculation on header or transaction line. <br />
<br />
what kind of correction do you want to do for this invoice?<br />
<br />

<br />
I am doing a sales correction for the invoice I am changing the customer name. Since the tax code is empty for the original invoice it is not filling proper tax ledger account. Do you have any idea why the tax code is empty in tfgld410. I feel if tax code is filled in tfgld410 the process will work. Please clarify me.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the tax code in sales invoice from integration is always on position level. If you have a look on how a sales order is enregistered in Logistiques, then you will find that the tax code is, if I remember right, on the second or third form of the order line. <br />
The default tax code is given in the item masterdata.<br />
Depending on the customer and his delivery adress in the header of the sales order, the system get the tax code/ country combination from the tcmcs-module where the tax account is defined. <br />
In the purchase module you have information going back from finance to purchase when the invoice is approved (purchase result) but I have never heard of something like that in the sales module. <br />
<br />
In fact, the sales users really should take care of taking the right customer and tax code in the order. <br />
<br />
At the moment, I have no idea how to correct that in Finance with the right tax account. <br />
Is it only the problem for the tax account or also for the turnover/ revenue account?<br />
<br />
Bye, Juli</div></div><hr />
