<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">28th January 2002, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">When using session tfacp1131s000 to Match Receipts the user can set a line to partially matched and input a matched quantity greater than the approved quantity. The system correctly gives the message tfacps0182 - &quot;Total linked quantity &gt; approved quantity&quot;. This message is only a warning and allows the user to continue. <br />
<br />
Is there any way without customisation of changing this functionality so that the user cannot continue in this circumstance.<br />

We are running Baan IVc3.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerebeer</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">There are businesses where it is allowed to match more quantity than ordered. You can think off the industry which deals with folders. You order a couple of thousand of them, but the order quantity is just an indication; when your supplier sends you somewhat more than that is also o.k. and you also get the invoice for the send quantity.<br />
<br />
Because of this the message is only a warning. If you want this to be blocking than you have to customize the software.<br />

<br />
But what shouldn't be possible is, that the approved quantity is higher than the delivered quantitiy in the warehouse. <br />
<br />
For the case two invoices are matched to one order position, you have to maintain it by special &quot;Maintain by matched receipts&quot;, and there are the data of tdpur046 and not of tdpur041.<br />
<br />
So me too, I think it is a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isimeon</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Jully you are right. Approved quantity cannot be greater than delivered quantity.<br />
But, approved quantity can be less than delivered quantity and when rejected quantity amount is for you expense (for some reasons) it should be possible to link invoice quantity &gt; approved quantity.</div></div><hr />
