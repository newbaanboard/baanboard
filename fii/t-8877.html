One of the users killed the finalization process &quot;since it was hanging&quot; . Now as a result , many tfgld102 records are missing . I can see all the lines in Integration Lines . How to correct this situation ?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayoobi</div><div class="date">14th February 2003, 05:08</div></div><div class="posttext">My Solution is : <br />
<br />
1. Delete all the transaction for the document from tfgld102<br />
2. Run Correction program tfcor1244m000 (This is suppose to unpost the integrations transactions for a Document Number)<br />
<br />
3. Post the transactions in a Frest Batch . <br />
<br />
Please let me know your comments .  <br />
<br />
We are using Baan Vb SP12 <br />

I used Restart Finalization Run and problem was solved</div></div><hr />

Also depending if the Integrations have been updated on the status.<br />
<br />
Restarting the finalization process in the Baan 5b and 5c versions are good and you don't typically need to delete anything at GTM before running it,, unless it stops from processing or restarting the process.</div></div><hr />
