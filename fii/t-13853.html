<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">5th December 2003, 21:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I need some feedback regarding Baan Solution 15409 for year-end processing issues on Baan IVc. The specific system is IVc2 (MCR is not installed), running on NT and Oracle.<br />
<br />
Im working with a client who has only provisionally closed the previous fiscal year. The need to begin closing process for the current year is fast approaching, so completing the close of last year is a priority.<br />
<br />
In going over their year-end procedures, I asked if patches were up to date, specifically 15409, which includes objects for rebuilding ledger and dimension history, posting transactions to history, and specific to year-end, the objects for Close Year Provisional, Automatic Balancing of P&amp;L Accounts and Close Year.<br />
<br />
I discovered that they began to review and test that solution some time ago, but it was not approved for release into production. I dont know why at this point, but I certainly respect the prudence of testing solutions before installing them. <br />
<br />
I dont want to propose closing the year without installing recommended solutions, but I sure dont want to insist on installation if there is a downside that I havent heard about.<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced problems caused by installing solution 15409? If so, what were they? <br />
<br />
If installing 15409 solved year-end close problems for you, were your issues primarily related rebuilding ledger dimension history? Or were the issues directly related to sessions for Provisional Close, Automatic Balancing and Close Year? <br />
<br />
Are there any other comments or suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info that you can provide.<br />
<br />
Scott</div></div><hr />
