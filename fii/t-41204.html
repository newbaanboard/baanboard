<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">j3ruk07</div><div class="date">31st August 2007, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear friends, colleagues &amp; gurus,<br />
<br />
Does anybody here know how to cross-check the inventory account balance in GL to Inventory Valuation?<br />
<br />
At my place, we chek the Inventory Valuation at the end of each month. We are using the value shown there as the inventory value - calculated based on each product's cost price. <br />
<br />
The value shown in Inventory Valuation, should be equal to the balance of inventory account in GL. We always make sure that the balance from GL is taken after the period is closed (so all the transactions &amp; integrations are posted to GL). We also make sure that the transactions that were inputed to inventory accounts manually (those that come from JV and not from Integration transactions) are excluded.<br />
<br />
But since January 2006, we've never been able to get the same value between the GL balance &amp; Inventory Valuation. The variance for each month is also vary. <br />
<br />
Please, tell me, how/where should I trace the difference comes from?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Justine</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you for your response. <br />
<br />
the problem is, the variance is big (between 100.000 - 100.000.000) and it always vary each month.<br />
<br />
do you have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
thank's a lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eric12</div><div class="date">3rd September 2007, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Other likely cause is errors in the integration setup. It is a bit sensitive to errors in the setup. You may have cost items going to the warehouse account for example.<br />
The inventory valuation report works differently if you print it with todays date or if you print it backdated, but the result should be the same. Check it like this: Print it on a day where there is no activity on the warehouse e.g on a sunday. Print it again on the following monday (before any movements in the warehouse) but with the sunday date. The two reports should total to the same amount. If not, you need to run some of the correction programmes in inv (e.g tdcor0252 not sure i remember the codes exactly) to fix it.<br />
<br />
Regards and good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">4th September 2007, 06:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Knowing that your variances are large then I would agree with Eric.   <br />
<br />
You mention that this has been a problem since January 2006.  Any changes to the integration scheme since then?    Anyone in logistics complaining about inventory balance issues - for example. the balance shown in warehouses not agreeing to the balance in the item master.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">j3ruk07</div><div class="date">4th September 2007, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear John &amp; Eric,<br />
<br />
<br />
I checked our integration set up &amp; so far there's nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
We do have some problems with inventory balance.<br />
<br />
We use Location Control module. Sometime we found that the inventory report by item &amp; warehouse in Location Control module gives different result from the reports in Inventory Control module.<br />
<br />
For example, in Inventory Valuation &amp; Print Inventory by Warehouse (tdinv0430m000) there is qty amount for item A. But for the same inventory date, we can't find item A in Inventory Data by Warehouse/Item/Location (tdilc1414m000).<br />
<br />
We run the Rebuild Inventory Data (ILC) (tdilc0250m000) &amp; Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions (tdinv0250m000) every weekend, when there aren't any users connect to Baan, but the problem is still exist.<br />
<br />
Baan Support told us to run a session : Check Inventory Data (tdinv0252m000) which can only be access from Run Program. The session function is to find any unbalance inventory history record in inventory tables. If there are any unbalances, we can choose to adjust it via that session. There will be no Interation transactions created to be posted to Finance because it will fix only the record in inventory tables. But not all unbalance inventory transactions can be corrected.<br />
<br />
so.....other suggestions please?<br />
<br />
thank's a lot<br />
<br />

First of all you need to work with a base. For e.g if the inventory balance is varying every month, then it is defintely issue with integration set up. You can try to create report from tfgld106 and group it by the ledge accounts that you think comprises inventory accounts (you can check from integration set up). This is a tedious excercise, but there is a systematic way of identifying the issue. For e.g. if you have drop ship (direct delivery) and if by any chance it is hitting the inventory account then that might be an issue. There can be any number of reason, but one has to to take a systematic approach. The session that Baan support said is to compare only tdilc101 with tdinv001 and tiitm001 and tdltc001. It assumes that tdilc101 is accurate. So, try running inventory valuation over tdilc101 and see the results. At my site I store daily value on inventory by item, item and warehouse and item, warehouse and location in flat file, then we have created session to get the values in history. This has solved our issue of back tracking the inventory. I am suspecting that you have a issue in integration setup. Like cost revaluation, vairances might not be set up correctly. I would suggest you to follow up an integration transaction all the way and check if it is set up correctly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cmoser</div><div class="date">12th September 2007, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We are having the same problem.  The thing is our inventory valuation and the GL have never matched.  <br />
I believe it is our Integration set-up that is incorrect.  Does anybody have examples of integrations that I could look at?  I have used the help and thought that I had them set-up correctly.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">j3ruk07</div><div class="date">17th September 2007, 09:20</div></div><div class="posttext">hi cmoser,<br />
<br />
I'm cross checking my integration set up with the guide from Baan Help menu.<br />
If you want a copy, I can send you via email. It's only 500 kb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">looric</div><div class="date">2nd March 2012, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems not easy to correct?<br />
we have similar situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mountaincloud</div><div class="date">5th March 2012, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Use the session tfgld4495m000 Print Reconciliation data to check your problem first, and modify the relevant settings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then trnsfer to excel ..check one by one of source and finance transaction  you can find where the set up is wrong..<br />
This also tedious work but once you have to find the same and correct the set up then from next time it will not come..<br />
 may be debit and credit set up is wrongly made</div></div><hr />
