<br />
I notice that there are some figure in my WIP charge of account. I've checked and confirmed that all production orders within the month are closed.<br />
<br />
Please advise me is there anywhere I can check how does the WIP contributed from since all the production orders are closed. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It will be rather tedious to cross check, but there shouldn't have been too many records to check yet in your sim 2 company. There are few things to check:<br />
 Have all integration transactions (especially the manufacturing ones, but all kinds to be safe) been posted?<br />
 Does anybody ever make any manual journal to the WIP account?<br />
 Check whether the WIP transactions are balanced out in Integration Transactions by Project/Order<br />
 Check the mapping. Could there be multiple WIP accounts referred to wrongly for different production activities? This could lead to WIP accumulation/decumulation<br />
 Last check: track each and every journal entry to the WIP account to see why there was accumulation/decumulation there<br />
