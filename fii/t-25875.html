<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alex_hu</div><div class="date">13th December 2005, 05:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear all,<br />
<br />
    I am now using BaanVsp02, and met a problem, maybe it is sample for you, but still want get any response.<br />
    In BaanV, when I created a purhcase order, and after maintain recepit, I found 3 kinds of integration transaction created:<br />
    purchase on order, transaction amount = std cost <br />
    purchase receipt, transaction amount = PO price<br />
    purchase result, transaction amount = std-po price<br />
<br />
   ( In Baan IV, integration transaction after maintain receipt should be :<br />
    purchase receipts<br />
          Dr.  R/M (STD cost)       Cr.  Invoice to be received.  <br />
    purchase result.  <br />
          Dr.  Invoice to be received(std-po)  Cr.  PPV )<br />
<br />
    My question is :<br />
    1. why purchase on order integration transaction created? is any parameter control it?<br />
    2. why po price used as purchase receipt transaction amount? it should be STD cost.<br />
    3. how to define purchase result in mapping schema? I checked help document, standard definition is : Dr.  purchase result  Cr. invoice accrual. seems it different with Baan IV logic.<br />
<br />
    I am looking forward to your quick response.<br />
    Your quick response will be appreciated!<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
<br />

<br />
1. why purchase on order integration transaction created? is any parameter control it?<br />
this integration transaction represents the goods that you ask for but, you donÂ´t receive, yet.<br />
You can contol it with this session &quot;tdpur0100s000&quot;, with field tdpur000.lpof.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. why po price used as purchase receipt transaction amount? it should be STD cost.<br />
<br />
3. how to define purchase result in mapping schema? I checked help document, standard definition is : Dr. purchase result Cr. invoice accrual. seems it different with Baan IV logic.<br />
<br />
I think that you define it in the same way that in Baan IV. The difference is that, in Baan V you have 2 &quot;results&quot;: Result (PO - std ) and Price Variance (PO - Invoice). In baan IV you mapped them in the financial transaction &quot;Result&quot;, but now you have the posibbility to dive them in 2 transaction.<br />
<br />
I hope this can help you,<br />

<br />
This is from the baan Help..<br />
<br />
<br />
Purchase result :A purchase result only occurs when a valuation method of Fixed Transfer Price (FTP) is used. A purchase result is the difference between the FTP of an item and the order price. The purchase result is posted at the time that the goods are received.<br />
<br />
Prive variance : You can change a purchase-order price after the goods are received. <br />
You must generate a financial transaction and post the variance to BaanERP Warehousing.<br />
<br />
for number 2 check this, &quot;didn't try it but it may help &quot;<br />
session tdpur0100s000 , field create financial economic stock transaction..<br />
<br />
From Baan help it says :<br />
No <br />
No link with BaanERP Finance is established.<br />
<br />
Order Price <br />
The link with BaanERP Finance is based on the purchase order price.<br />
<br />
Valuation Price <br />
The link with BaanERP Finance is based on the purchase cost price.<br />
<br />
If you selected No the transaction &quot;on order&quot; won't be generated..<br />
<br />
Hope this help</div></div><hr />
