<br />
We are running BaaN IVc4 localization is5.  We have problem in generating purchase details for the purpose of sales tax assessment.  The typical report must contain the following:<br />
<br />
1. Supplier's Name<br />
2. Tax registration Number<br />
3. State of Purchase<br />
4. Purchase Order &amp; Goods Inward note number<br />
5. Supplier Invoice Number &amp; Date<br />
6. Amount in Invoice currency as well as Home currency<br />
7. Debit A/c (i.e., Purchase A/c)<br />
8. Original Integration transaction Number, with Registered Invoice No (wherever matched and approved in Finance)<br />
<br />
And the total purchase value given in this report must tally with the GL balance of Purchase A/c, and should be supported by physical bills.<br />
<br />
Primarily, the area which I can look for a purchase register is tdind0414m000 - Print purchase register.  But this report gives only invoices REGISTERED &amp; MATCHED in Finance.  But the entry to purchase A/c would be posted even before bill matching in Finance.  That is, the report ignores the purchase already posted and sitting in Receivable invoices.  But the authorities always seek to match the total of this report to the GL Purchase account, which is impossible in this report.  Again, this report does not give the debit purchase account.<br />
<br />
The next area to look for is, integration tables.  We have created a varient of integration transaction report to get integration transactions supplier-wise, with corresponding ledger account also.  But again we can't get the supplier data like sales tax regn. number, state etc here.  Further, we won't get the supplier invoice number also.  When the authority asks to produce physical bills, we have to search for it by the registered invoice generated by baan.  But this invoice number is also not available in integration report.<br />
<br />
I can get the Receipts details from tdpur045 &amp; respective invoice details from tdpur046, pull out the other details from integration tables.  But receipt tables go by receipt DATE, not by fiscal period.  For various reasons there can be mismatch between date and Fiscal period, and the Integration posts transactions based upon Fiscal Period.  Again, the additional purchase+receipt entries passed in integration table will be missing in receipt table (but it will be posted to GL).<br />
<br />
If I try to customize report, drawing the fields from all these tables, the report goes too too slow because of the huge size of integration table and reference of so many tables.<br />
<br />
I would be very glad to know if anybody has ever faced this problem and how it is sorted out from your end.  Because I understand sales tax returns, assessment is very common for most of the companies.  Greatly obliged if you could tell me if any documentation on this is available.  Thanks in advance.<br />
