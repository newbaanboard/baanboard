<br />
Does Baan create/maintain any record of when the session Rebuild Opening Balance/History from Transactions (tfgld3203m000) was last run? If so, where would that be found? <br />
<br />
I suppose you could search for it if audits have been turned on for the ledger history tables, but Im not aware of any other log or flag. Then again, I havent been asked the question before.<br />
<br />
The specific question is for Baan IVc2 running on NT with Oracle, but I'd be interested in knowing for all versions.<br />

All it does is rebuild ledger history tfgld201-206 tables from transaction tables tfgld102/106 as per the transaction type update mode for the period selected by user. Closed periods are not allowed .<br />
<br />
So if the process is aborted for some reason , you can always restart the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't remember seeing a log but I had never looked for it or been asked. <br />
<br />
Lack of a log has usually been unimportant because the rebuild is typically run only when there are problems or as scheduled &quot;preventative&quot; maintenance, for example, during year-end. People tend to remember those dates without a system log.<br />
