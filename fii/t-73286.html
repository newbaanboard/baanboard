<br />
Currently we are on ERPLn FP2 and we have three manufacturing plants. For this three plants, we have three companies created. All these three companies are multi-logistic/multi-finance.<br />
<br />
Now we are going to upgrate to infor ln 10.7 which is released just this month. We want to simplify our setup and create only a single company in place of three company. We also want separate balance sheet for these three companies.<br />
<br />
If any one can guide us in this regard, I shall be grateful.<br />
