<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">12th September 2005, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I have setup intergroup relations between 2 companies that belong to different group companies. When running tfgld4201m000 I get an error 100 (duplicate value) and an indication that tfglddll2036 are causing problems. In tfgld104 (in the source group company) Baan tries to make an input but already finds an entry on with the same line number. Does anyone have a clue what is wrong here ?<br />

<br />
Did you check, that both companies must show in tfgld0101s000 the same base company (tfgld003.bcmp) - you can also check Baan document U7373B Table Sharing.<br />

<br />
thanks for the hint about tfgld003 but that has been setup - also the table sharing is correct. I have already reported that to SSA but would be happy to get some more ideas in the meantime.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">agoes.s</div><div class="date">30th September 2005, 05:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I already ask to baan.support.com <br />
They gave suggestion to me to install solution no 205056. The solution no to be downloaded is so much, now i'm downloaded it one by one wiuhhhhh... :(<br />
and they said that it's the same like we install service pack 17.<br />
But the problem is we have some customization in our Baan, I'm afraid that after install service pack 17 the customization will not work well. <br />
<br />
any idea for this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You could carefully try on your testsystem and see if it has any affects. As far as I know only one object was involved.<br />
