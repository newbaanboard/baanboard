<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">5th January 2004, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a difference between the G/L and the report.   I posted this question a few months ago but I beleive that some confusion occured.  The responses I received were regarding the A/P GRINYA sessions.  I actually have that under control.<br />
<br />
The A/r session tfacr1432m000 is giving me some issues.<br />
<br />
1. Orders from 2001 and 2002 appear on my report that was run for 2003 period 12.  These orders did not show up in previous months (i.e. Oct 2003, Nov 2003, etc.).<br />
<br />
Attached is Baan's help Text.  <br />
<br />
<br />
After reviewing the text I feel comfortable with what they are talking about. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any additional instructions for this session or ideas on how to go about reconciling the report to the general ledger.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />
<br />
Doug</div></div><hr />
