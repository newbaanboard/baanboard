<br />
Infor recently released a solution (and 2 superseded solutions after that) for new functionality that will (finally) allow a user to post transactions to integration accounts in LN.<br />
<br />
Has anyone used this functionality yet?  I have tested it on a basic level and it seems to work, but I was curious if anyone has done robust testing or has it working in their production environment?</div></div><hr />

I would however caution user to limit manual posting of integration ledger accounts to profit &amp; loss &quot;End Accounts&quot;.    Meaning don't allow manual postings to Inventory, WIP, Interim Accounts, Invoice Accrual, etc....</div></div><hr />

Thank you!!!!!<br />

Since the solution updates all the different areas where manual postings can be created there might be a lot of other patches pulled depending on how frequently you update your software.  Also note there are some post install solutions too</div></div><hr />
