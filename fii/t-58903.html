<br />
There was an issue on the Tax calculation in Manual sales invoices with “Gross over hundred” setup and a fix in April.  I feel, this fix is affecting with “Gross” setup also, might be a Bad fix.  So, they released another  solution.  Please check if the below new solution is available at your end.  If it is already there and issue is coming for you, then please raise an Incident with Infor and request them to reproduce and I feel it is reproducible with your clear steps.<br />
