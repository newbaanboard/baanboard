<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john crystal</div><div class="date">9th September 2020, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been asked by a client if they can set up a Baan IV company to operate using actual costing without using small projects?  all raw material and finished goods are lot controlled and they want to know the actual costs by lot from purchase or production receipt to cost of goods sold.<br />
<br />
I've never set one up that way so am wondering if that is even possible. If so does anyone have and docs on how to do the setup?<br />
<br />
What I'm remembering from early on was an issue that is you used lot pricing you could value inventory that way but when you issued raw material to a production order or finished goods to a sales order it was valued at standard cost not the lot price. I don't know if it is still that way or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
