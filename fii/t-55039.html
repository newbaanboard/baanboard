<br />
Our company is using Baan IV and we need to know from the expert views here, at which stage does Baan actually generate the sales revenue and AR recognition accountng entries?<br />
<br />
I think it is at stage 7 where the sales invoices are printed, but my friend says its at the PDSO stage after the sales invoices have been printed..<br />
<br />
We hope to be able to clarify this once and for all, so that we can then execute the appropriate system processes to recognise the COGS and sales in the same period..<br />
<br />
Hope any and all experts out here can help in our predicament...<br />
<br />
Thanks very much in advance and hope to hear from you all soon... :)</div></div><hr />
