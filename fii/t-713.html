Please Help me out of this Problem. Distribution User created a Sales Invoice and the same is posted to Accounts Receivable. For this invoice we received payment thru bank and the same is entered in Accounts Receivable. But when we go to match receipt under Assign Advance / Unallocated Receipts to Invoices for the party, the amount received comes but the invoice against which we want to knock out the amount received does not comes. <br />

<br />
Have you checked that the customer on the invoice is the same as on the receipt?  Also, does this invoice still have a balance?  Maybe it was allocated against another receipt?</div></div><hr />
