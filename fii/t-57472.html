Using LN we have wrongly printed and posted an invoice. This invoice has the wrong Transaction Type and we have to change it. Do you know whether there is session or a correction program that we can use to unlink the sales order lines from that invoice, delete the invoice and print a new one?<br />
If not, do you know any suitable procedure or workaround to fix this? <br />
Thanks in advance for the replies! :)</div></div><hr />
