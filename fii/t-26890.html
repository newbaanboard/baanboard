Since we setup a dependent currency system, we are only given one option in the EMM Company setup for Purchasing currency rates (the system is picking up the Purchasing rate for costing and receipt-to-payment processes) <br />
Has anyone else out there figured away around costing at one rate and transacting at another <br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
For monetary items like AP in foreign currency, it has to be presented in financial statement at current rate, as per FAS and IAS. The way you do it in BaanERP is by writing off unrealized currency difference in AP. When you've done this, any transaction involving those foreign currency AP will use the new currency rate, based on the latest writing off of unrealized currency difference. In effect, this will cause any transaction involving those AP to be valued at current rate, if you update your currency rate monthly (coinciding with your monthly reporting period)<br />

The issue isnt with writeoffs - which i am aware of. <br />
the issue is with costing recognition of rates <br />
we tested the system and when the item is costed against the item purchase data, it pulls the rate indicated on the EMM table (company data) from the purchasing entry <br />
however, when we cost against a lot costed item (purchased, pulled against the purchase price) it costs against the rate indicated in the internal field (again, emm tables, company data) <br />
now the issue is that GAAP requires that I cost material against a historic rate, and yet transact against a current rate.  baan doesnt allow me to split the two rate recognitions - <br />
we were hoping someone might have found a way around this,<br />
