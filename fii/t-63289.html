Since there were cases where user forgot to close other period types so problem occur since we cant finalize certain batch since there were already transactions posted in current period of period types fiscal (prior period closed  and posted on prior period in reporting (prior period open)..</div></div><hr />

But be careful to tick on the &quot;Final Closing&quot; check box, only when you are finally closing your periods..</div></div><hr />
