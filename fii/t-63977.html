<br />
We have an operational company. We created another company for some simulation and dumped that data from operational company to simulation company. Changed the company where ever required. Eveything is working fine but having problem in FAM.<br />
<br />
When we tried to calculate depreciation or capitalise which was just entered in live company, we are getting error &quot;No Home Currencies are defined for Company 1.&quot;<br />
<br />
If we enter new asset it is working fine with all respects. Problem facing only for data dumped in FAM.<br />
<br />
Can anybody please help in resolving the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Did you fill the currency in tools session 'maintain comapanies ttaad1100m000' I'm now at a b4 system, but I guess in ERP LN it's the same session.  <br />
Best Regards, Mario</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is Home Currency same for both the companies?<br />
And for the uploaded assets who are having problem, Transaction Currency in tffam100.ccur same as Home Currency or different Currency?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cyprus</div><div class="date">29th April 2013, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are using ERP LN, you may also check the company number in tffam100.comp for those uploaded assets though GTD, possibly company number not changed properly..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I identified the issue and resolved. It was tffam120 where company no. was not changed.<br />
<br />
This is for your information.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your initiatives and updates.</div></div><hr />
