<br />
Due to a business re-organisation. We need to restart our GLD,ACR and ACP ledgers again. Is this possible and which tables would need to be dropped ? My initial thought was to copy the live company (002) to a new company (004) and use this as the old company and then remove certain tables from the live company (002) to retain this as the live company.<br />
<br />
However I'm not sure if this is the safest solution. Would I be better off starting up a new Finance Company and then logically linking everything apart from the Finance tables back to my old live company ?<br />
<br />
Some assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Neal</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.Copy company to new company , repair finance company and then remove data from trx  tables like  tfgld018 , tfgld102,tfgld106 , tfacp200 , tfacp/r200/1/2.<br />
2.reset fields in tables like tfgld014 and tfgld017<br />
3. rebuild ledger history and rebuild invoice balances.<br />
<br />
Think this may help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's always good to get another opinion on these matters. As the only tables I'm going to need in the new company are transaction tables is it worth using the logical links technique for all the other tables. ? <br />
<br />
I'm just thinking that the lead time for completing this task is going to be minimal alongside the fact that the company in question has 6 years worth of data in it.<br />
