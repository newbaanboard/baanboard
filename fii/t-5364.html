<br />
We have been using these sessions for 3 + years now and have encountered a problem today with a new financial statement that I am working on.<br />
<br />
The session max's out at 99 seq #, our problem is that I have 104 seq #'s on the statement and it will continue to grow over time.<br />
<br />
My only workaround thus far is to break the one statement up into multiple statements then print them out and assemble the pages manually and distribute them.  This is not the best workaround but I was hoping that someone has come up with a better one.<br />
<br />
The major problem with this is it is a problem for users to print them out and assemble them.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help you can provide.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Doug Jefferson</div></div><hr />

These appear to be the sequence numbers in the layout.  Are you using a new sequence for each line on the layout?  You can use a sequence that will work for multiple lines.  For example if there are several lines without lines in between you can use one sequence for all of these lines.  <br />
<br />
If you'd like to discuss this further, one of my finance consultants would be happy to walk you through this - no charge. You have spoken w/ her already towards the end of last year.<br />
<br />
Please email me directly if you'd like to speak with her.<br />

<br />
Have you thought of using two or more statement accounts to fit in the number of lines you want print and then clubbing these under a parent statement account.<br />
<br />
for example <br />
<br />
if you have to print 104 lines under a particular head, you can divide the list into two components.  Part 1 and part 2 .  Under each you can fit in a max of 99 parts.  These two can then be grouped under a separate head to get the final value in the same financial statement.<br />
<br />
cheers.<br />

The statement that I have is very detailed for our owners in Germany and they need to see the data.  I had even thought about using th annexure but it will not work either.<br />

<br />
you wrote that you need 104 sequences in your report. <br />
Do you mean that you have 104 different line/ account layouts or you have 104 lines/ accounts in your report?<br />
<br />
If it is the second one you can use the field sublevel to group accounts of similar hierarchie position. For example you have one kind of layout for all Titles in your statement (the layout is for example, before you have a blank line and behind the graphic line. <br />
To all title accounts you give the same sublevel in the &quot;Maintain Statement Account Session&quot; tffst1103m000. In the layout session then you select all accounts in the field &quot;statement account&quot; but only one sublevel. In that case you only need one sequence number for a lot of lines. <br />
Did I explain clearly?<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. <br />

<br />
for your example you need 2, maximum 3, sequence numbers. <br />
