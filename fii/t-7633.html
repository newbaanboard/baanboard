<br />
A1 You can do this:<br />
<br />
1)	You must use the same Transaction Type that you used in the supplier payment.If you donÂ´t remenber  please look at session tfcmg0110m000 Field Transaction Type<br />
2)	You must create a batch with TT (step 1); then you insert a new record using the invoice munber that you paid wrongly;  you must change the sign (Negative)<br />
 In this case you reverse the wrong payment and get an open entry, after that you can paid again this invoice with the normal procedure <br />
<br />
<br />
A2  You can do this:<br />
<br />
1)	You must use the same TT  that you used when you created the paid advance, but in this case you create a negative advance, in this way you have an efect null.<br />
2)	After that;  you must use a TT (tfcmg2131s000 Main Session and tfcmg2106s000 Next Session) ; with this TT you can apply the paid advance negative and paid advance positive.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have done this procedure and the accounting results were good. Please, do a test before. I hope that it works for you.</div></div><hr />
