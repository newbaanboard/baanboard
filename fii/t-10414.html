<br />
I have a question for currency transaction.<br />
<br />
1. Account payable transaction was created as $100 ;<br />
Dr) Raw materials 100,000<br />
                   Cr) Account Payable 100,000<br />
(at currency rate : $1 = 1,000 KRW(korean won)<br />
<br />
2. Currency rate is changed as $1 = 1,100 KRW, then run<br />
Write off currency differences(tfacp2240m000) ;<br />
Unrealized Currency Loss 10,000 / Account Payable 10,000<br />
<br />
3. Pay the account payable at $1 = 1,050 then;<br />
Dr) Account payable                     110,000 <br />
Dr) Realized currency loss              10,000<br />
                    Cr) Cash                                        105,000<br />
                    Cr) Unrealized currency loss            10,000 <br />
                    Cr) Realized currency profit               5,000     <br />
<br />
I think the system should create as follow the 3rd step as ;<br />
Dr) Account payable                     110,000 <br />
                    Cr) Cash                                        105,000<br />
                    Cr) Realized currency profit               5,000    <br />
<br />
I don't know why the baan system create the accounts<br />
&quot;Realized currency loss&quot; &amp; &quot;Unrealized currency loss&quot; at<br />
the 3rd step. <br />
<br />
Please explain me the reason.<br />
<br />
thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is Ok that unrealized accounts appear in the document.<br />
This takes care of reversing the unrealized amounts which were only temporary untill the payment.<br />
Now that the payment rate is known it also creates the realized transactions.<br />
<br />
By the way I found and reported to BaaN on 10/2002 that there is a bug in program tfcmg2106 regarding selecting the correct realized accounts when assigning advances to invoices.<br />
I do not know if they fixed it. (I fixet it myself on our customized version)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the correct way to book this in accounting should be:<br />
<br />
Dr. AP 110,000<br />
Dr. Realized currency difference loss 5,000<br />
Cr.    Cash 105,000<br />
Cr.    Unrealized currency difference loss 10,000<br />
<br />
Because in this case, you'd have realized KRW 5,000 currency difference loss, since KRW lost value against USD between the times the AP was booked and paid.<br />

I don't know how this happens and would like to seek experts comment on that how to solve this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mtho33</div><div class="date">24th April 2007, 08:42</div></div><div class="posttext">With regard to the problem on not being able to set up unrealized profit/loss at the Business Partner or Customer/Supplier, it was standard functionality.<br />
( I do not know which Baan version you are using)<br />
<br />
The reason you are facing this problem was because in your Company Parameter configuration, you have set to use the functionality of Unrealized profit/Loss by ledger account. So, check your set up in the GL Company Parameter.<br />
If it you have set up to use this functionality, then the unrealized account must be set up at transaction Unrealized profit/loss by Ledger....(i forgot the exact wording) in the GL module.</div></div><hr />
