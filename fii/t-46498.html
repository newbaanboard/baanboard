<br />
There have been problems in the porting set. If you have a UNICODE environment and you do not want to have high ascii values, then you can set an environment variable. I believe it is HIGH_ASCII_TOLERANCE. However the runtime tools did not use this information and commands like, set.fmax(variable, domainof(variable)), will still give you the highest ASCII value for the character set (LOCALE) you are using. You are referring to the y with double dots I guess, which is a common ASCII set used in Germany etc. <br />
<br />
So if you are creating a ledger account, then always the dimenion ranges for the applicable dimension codes are created with empty to the maximum value of the domain, taking the LOCALE you are using into account. <br />
However when this record is inserted in the database, then this value yyyyyy with double dots is not allowed and you get the 205 error. This error indicates that the value is not according to its domain.<br />
<br />
I know that this problem has been solved with the lastest porting sets, so you are probably using an old one. I guess by asking support for the latest porting set will solve your problem.<br />
<br />

<br />
Before doing any below steps you show backup your company Dump in a Dump file.<br />
you should maintain this two steps:<br />
(1) go to the Enterprise Manager You should increase The DF &quot;Datafile&quot; Size for your main DB and be sure resonable cache space is free, after doing this go to the ERPLNDB and choose your required table then open all rows, show whether if there is existing rows.<br />
(2) Software Collasion &quot; Depending on your regional setting and SQL Server setup what type of collasion you select 'UNICODE - BINARY - Chinese .. etc' &quot; try to change the Collasion of your software and regional settings language <br />
<br />
This steps may help you, try identify ur problem more accurate ..<br />
