<br />
Is it possible to link a specific line in a purchase Approval document (Type: Purchase Correction) in tfgld106 to an order line/position number/seq in tdpur045 or tdpur046? <br />
<br />
I know the invoice number is present in tfgld106 (in the approval document transaction - ctyp/cinv) but I can have several lines in approvals with the same invoice number...<br />
<br />
I understand how to link a certain receipt transaction to an order nr/pos number/seq using tfgld418 and tfgld410 but I cannot find an one on one link between an approval document line and it's receipt...<br />
<br />
Note: I know the GRINYA sessions are able to find this link (I see the link in tfacp135) but I need to understand how for a custom report we need.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for your help,</div></div><hr />
