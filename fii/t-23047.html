<br />
Check also if the actual document is allready posted and finalized. Sometimes the errors are left in tfgld432, but they may well have been posted allready.<br />
<br />
I think that there is a correction programme for obsolte gld432 records, or you can delete them by hand, if you have checked first.</div></div><hr />
