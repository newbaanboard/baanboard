<br />
Can anybody tell me exactly what session tfacp1433m000 (Print Registered Invoice Specifications) is supposed to ouput. Our Finance department are attempting to use it to show Purchase Invoices which are still waiting to be approved.<br />
<br />
However despite the latest patches I am getting Purchase Invoices appearing on the report with blank approved in dates when I know that they have been approved. <br />
<br />
Which tables is it getting this information from ?<br />
<br />

<br />
It should be looking at all invoices where the  'Match with Orders' field &lt;&gt; 'no'.  <br />
<br />
It also seems like the report will show orders which were approved in the period you're running it for but the invoice was created before the period you ran it for.  I'm not sure what the reasoning behind this is, but that may account for the invoices you are seeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again for the info Maria,<br />
<br />
I think if may have a problem with my output on this one as the report is definately printing out records where tfacp200.appr = 2 Purchase Orders.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can get some more info from support.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

&quot;The Report is showing :                                                    <br />
Registered or matched invoices within the requested period that are not yet <br />
approved in the requested period OR Approved invoices within the requested <br />
period that are not yet Registered or Matched in the requested period.          <br />
           <br />
I had tried this on your system for period 2002-01 to 2002-01 and it gave me <br />
invoices :<br />
-	registered before periode 2002-01 and not approved yet<br />
-	invoices approved in 2002-01 and registered in another periode then 2002-01 !&quot;<br />
<br />
After a lot of digging around I found that the invoices for which I had blank approval dates had been approved in the incorrect company when we originally had our tfacp200 table shared for some reason. So the root cause of my problem was corrupt data.<br />
<br />
