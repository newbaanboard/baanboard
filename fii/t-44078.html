<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">j3ruk07</div><div class="date">7th November 2007, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear gurus &amp; friends,<br />
<br />
There is a problem with one of our items' cost price.<br />
<br />
The problem occured because there was a mistake in purchase price in one Purchase Order.<br />
To correct the mistake, we created a Purchase Return Order.<br />
<br />
Here's the problem detailed:<br />
<br />
PO 400511 -&gt; is the errorneous PO because the price was too high.<br />
Maintain Receipt for this PO was on Oct 1st <br />
PO was matched &amp; approved (in AP module) on Oct 9th.<br />
Cost price was revalued on this date (Oct 9th).<br />
<br />
PO 440046 -&gt; is the correction PO - it's a purchase return order (Qty &amp; price is exactly the same as in PO 4500511)<br />
Maintain Receipt for this PO was on Oct 1st <br />
PO was matched &amp; approved (in AP module) on Oct 11th.<br />
<br />
But, the cost price didn't change on Oct 11th.<br />
<br />
Based on the data, I have several questions:<br />
1. When is the exact time that BAAN will consider the cost price for purchase item is changed? Is it at purchase receipt? or at mathcing? or after the AP is approved?<br />
2. Does Baan really only take account the purchase price in Purchase Order and it doesn't consider purchase price in purchase return order as a component to calculate the cost price?<br />
3. If there is a mistake in purchase price which in the end will affect the cost price, as the one that I mentioned above, how should we correct them to make sure that the cost price will be calculated as it should be?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your kind attention.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
J.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just the answer to your first question: &quot;1. When is the exact time that BAAN will consider the cost price for purchase item is changed? Is it at purchase receipt? or at mathcing? or after the AP is approved?&quot;<br />
The Standard cost price is updated, when you run the update session ticpr2210m000with the field &quot;update&quot; on YES.<br />
<br />
Additional: The PO price is just an interim price it does not influence the price on item master data. The final price is the invoice price, when approval is done. The approval updates the price in the item master data. For the SCP update the purchase price in the item master data is taken.<br />

Please note:<br />
1. Purchase Return Orders are not considered for Purchase Prices calculation.<br />
2. Purchase Prices (Lp &amp; Ap) are updated in Form 3 of Item Master afer Invoice Match &amp; Approval.<br />
3. If you feel the PO price is wrong, then before matching use Change Price session and change it.<br />
<br />
