Can any one explain the purpose of print purchase Invoice step in the Purchase Orders. Is it a required session for updating some tables in the backend of the database.<br />
Does it make any impact in the finance.<br />
I assume that its not a mandatory step and it has to be run before running the Process Delivered Purchase Order (PDPO)<br />
Any suggestion would be highly appreciate<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
It is a control step for freezing PO qty and amount after receipts. Once PI is printed system does not allow any change in PO even with using Change Price and Discount after Receipts session. Therefore it is suggested that if Print PI is difined in Order type the same should be executed only after prices and PO values are freezed. PI can be used as a system invoice for manual varification and actual supplier invoice certification purpose.<br />
