<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JET-user</div><div class="date">13th January 2014, 12:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that our report with creditor-posts (from ledger) did not match with the collective account of the liabilities. Since I have found the difference and know the contra account, I wanted to make a &quot;hard&quot; transfer among the general ledger accounts to ensure that the collection account coincide with the report again. The collection account is however locked for such bookings. How can I unlock it for an adjustment posting and lock it again afterwards?</div></div><hr />
