We have generated the actual costs by production order.  We also generated the &quot;Financial Inventory and WIP Transaction&quot;.  Both match for the variances generated against the standards.  The financial transactions generated by the production orders are showing up in the integrations transactions financial data reports.  The transactions are not hitting the GL.  What needs to be setup to make the transactions hit the GL.<br />

<br />
have a look in tfgld4510m000, search your production order and see on form 4 if all bookings are posted. <br />
If not then you have to set up the integration scheme for it, tfgld4126m000, tdinv8150m000 and if necessary tfgld4121m000.<br />
<br />
These session codes are all for Baan IV, in BaanERP it is a little bit different. But follows the same logic. <br />
<br />
If you need more help, don't hesitate to write. <br />
Bye, Juli  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 06:06</div></div><div class="posttext">To be certain I understand the issue: you can see that the transactions are logged in tfgld410 but they are not posted in tfgld102/tfgld106? <br />
<br />
Go back to Juli's suggestion and review Display Integration Transactions by Project/Order (tfgld4510m000). For the transactions in question, what is the transaction status? (Transaction Status in IV will be on form 4 or 5, depending on version &amp; extensions.)<br />
<br />
If the transaction status is &quot;erroneous&quot;, what Message Description is displayed in Display Integration Transactions Log (tfgld4532m000)?<br />
