The exchanges rates we introduce them monthly but at the end of the trimester from the HEADQUARTER they indicate to us as it is the change that there are to use for the already LAST trimester...... <br />
The problem is that there is to recalculate all the one of the last trimester and to leave in accounts already defined the existing differences. <br />
It is possible to be done? Some idea? <br />
I had activated the analisis of currency for the accounts in question and had defined the countable accounts by currency difference for each one of currencies but soon when going to the sessi√≥n &quot;To calculate differences of change by currency difference&quot; to try to recalculate these differences to all past. <br />
<br />
this session does not do what I think?<br />
That I can do? <br />
<br />
