We are installing a new LN FP3 server and we already have a functional test server under FP2. We have to declare an integration scheme on the new one. as i'm a logistic admin, it would be easier to me to import the scheme from our FP2 than to create a new one. is it possible to do that ? <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Thank you as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using your mapping scheme from FP2 should be possible, because you can also install on your FP2 environment the FP3 environment and use the service pack transaction scripts to upgrade. So if you would make a copy of your existing FP2 enviroment, install FP3 and follow the service pack transaction procedure, then all your data should have been converted and ready to use in the FP3 enviroment. There are already customers who have upgraded from FP2 to FP3 without any serious problems, so this should be possible.<br />
Please note that regarding the financial mapping scheme, that after a service pack transition on LN 6.1 you should also initialize from tcfin the mapping scheme again. You should then copy your current active mapping scheme to a new version, check it and make that one active. Only after this procedure you will have a good working FP3 mapping scheme.<br />
