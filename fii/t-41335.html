Can any1 help me out???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mvohra</div><div class="date">6th September 2007, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are an infor customer request for training material from your Infor sales rep. There is enough material on trade notes on ERp Ln. We cannot give this every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanInd</div><div class="date">10th September 2007, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all thanks for the doc.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if u really find it difficult to reply and pass on doc everytime, then plz avoid helping. Coz this forum is here i suppose to help each other out, and if Infor had provided me eveything i sure wudnt have asked here. moreover i didnt find ne vault or links where the link for this document has been posted nor ne thread with Trade Note as problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks neways!</div></div><hr />

But documents are somethings which you must ask your infor reps for. If you see the application help the help does explain the set ups. In case you have problems with this tehn the forum can help you. But, just blatant requirement of documents cannot be supported as training docs are supposed to be given only to customers.</div></div><hr />
