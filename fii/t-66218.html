<br />
normally the balance of Ledger account of interim transit 1 is zero but in March, the balance was is quite a big amount, can anyone tell me what kind situation will cause this problem? and how and where to find the missing process?<br />
interim transit 1 is the interim account for 10001074 PO/Receipt, 10061074 warehouse receipt/receipt, 10014052 WO/Issue, 10002052 SO/Issue and 10060052 WHS Issue/issue etc..., the balance of this interim account no. should be always zero as all the transactions are trigged/processed at the same time.</div></div><hr />
