<br />
We have several financial supplier groups established, with most of the account definitions (advanced payments, etc...) pointing to the &quot;control account&quot; as the ledger account for posting.<br />
<br />
On our 'inter-company&quot; group we have not defined the &quot;unallocated payments&quot; account.  We would like to input the &quot;control account&quot; as the ledger account, which is the way we have all our other supplier groups defined.<br />
<br />
We orignally got a message saying the account we were trying to input already had a debit/credit balance and was given a choice to continue or cancel. (we cancelled)  This was understandable because the system thinks we are setting up a new &quot;control&quot; account and any existing balances would not be &quot;clearable&quot;.  I discounted this message since the account I was trying to establish is already a control account and clearing existing balances will not be an issue.<br />
<br />
Baan however has come back and said they recommend not using the same account number for reconciliation purposes / simplicity.<br />
<br />
My question is: AM I GOING TO CAUSE MYSELF IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE BY USING THE &quot;CONTROL ACCOUNT&quot; AS THE LEDGER ACCOUNT FOR THE UNALLOCATED PAYMENTS?  ie not be able to reconcile / clear / etc... ??<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

You don't have the possibility anymore to run the control account checklist to check if your subledger is in line with the trial balance. Make a sublevel in your trialbalance and you have the same effect. In case everything is running smooth you don't have a problem, in case of troubles you don't have the possibility to sort it out anymore.</div></div><hr />
