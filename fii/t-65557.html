Currently, our accounting department enters the necessary supplier invoice data using Maintain Transactions. When it is time for the invoice to be paid, the paperwork is sent to our treasury department and they then go through and release wire transfers for those invoices. The paperwork then goes back to accounting so they can process payment through BaaN. The check# that is assigned to that invoice is considered the wire number. Our problem is that the treasury department wants this wire number available immediately after they have released the wire because they are reviewing reports to make decisions off of and they don't want to see items appearing on their reports when the invoice has been paid already (in their minds). Right now, sometimes accounting doesn't have the time to process the check right away so we were trying to discover if there is some other way in BaaN to issue wire numbers right away????<br />
Is there some way we can maybe change this process to work better?????</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We don't use check process of doing wire transfer. But in our case we have to pay before the receipt of goods as we are importing from overseas suppliers. When we create the Purchase invoice we pay it using transaction type as cash. We manually create transaction type. In this process there is no reconciliation. The document generated by system s used as reference for Wire transfer. I am not sure if this will work in your case<br />
