<br />
Our situation is - we had ABB itm groups and now we have to change them to Alstom groups.<br />
<br />
Groups are very very different so we can't join them ...<br />
<br />
We entered new item groups beside old ones, and in item table <br />
tiitm001 we chang groups for items on every used item in time of making order.<br />
<br />
We didn't do archiving of purchase orders, and also we didn't work with purchase statistic so we didn't close any purcase order for now which can help in this situation.<br />
<br />
Can we do samo coding for changing groups for items on printed purchase orders?<br />
Or maybe dump of tables?<br />
Or exchange?<br />
<br />
What is the easyest and what will not make problems in the future (integrity of database)?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure I fully understand your dillema, but I know for sure that changing item group of certain items wouldn't result in database integrity problem.<br />
<br />
Item groups are mainly used in financial integration mapping scheme, and that is only if you want to do such (for example, record inventory value of FG in separate ledger account). So, I think unless you actually map ABB and Alstom items to different ledger account there should be no problem in changing as such.<br />

<br />
I'm having to make a guess of what's actually required in your site<br />
<br />
- You have assigned several items in the past to item group ABB<br />
- Now the items belong to item group Alstom<br />
- When you print purchase order by item group, you'd like to see all POs done in the past for those item to come under category ABB, while the new POs after switch for those items be classified under Alstom<br />
<br />
Is that what you require? If my guess is wrong, could you please explain your management requirements? Thanks<br />

My management want to see purchase quantities by item groups<br />
but - new item groups (Alstom)<br />
<br />
So, in purchase orders there is old groups (ABB) connected with items.<br />
<br />
There is problem<br />
