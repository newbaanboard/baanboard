<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">26th July 2002, 21:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem:    We have some receivers that we know we will never get a matching invoice for. They are for partials, really old information, the information was combined, or some other unique information. These receivers display when we are matching and<br />
it causes delays in finding the right receiver.<br />
<br />
We tried to run an exchange scheme to code these receivers as<br />
delivery status of 'all approved'  (tdpur045.stsd). But this did not work as the records still appear and the code was even changed<br />
back to free status.  We then coded the deleivery status as 'all approved' and also coded the matched field as 'complete' (tdsls045.matc).  This still did not work, but at least the delivery<br />
status code did not get changed back to free.  About the only way we found for these records to not display, was to change the<br />
invoice quantity to equal the approved quantity.  We do not really<br />
want to do this.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else run accros this?  and what did you do to get around this?  I guess we could customize the session to not display receivers coded as above, but we was hoping to see if<br />
there was another 'BaaN' way to take care of this.<br />
<br />
Thanks to anyone who may respond</div></div><hr />

I am a He.<br />
Some of these are partials, never to be received lines and others<br />
are of some unexplained reasons?  Don't realy know much more except that the invoice quantity will never equal he aprroved quantity.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">29th July 2002, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason that these records are still showing as not approved is that the field tfacp200.stap is still sitting as 'matched'.<br />
You changed the status on tdpur045 but not on tfacp200, is that right?<br />
<br />
Also, the problem I can see with using GTM like this is that you will struggle with your GRINYA reconciliation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssbaan</div><div class="date">29th July 2002, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">you are correct, we only changed the tdpur045 table.   However,<br />
we can ge the tdpur045 table records to stay as 'all approved',<br />
if we code them as 'completely' (matched field), but they still keep<br />
appearing on the manual match. <br />
<br />
Even though this may not be the corrcect way to go about it, we are trying to find a way to get these records from not appearing on the manual match seesion and  would eventually like to remove them from the sytem<br />
<br />
Not being that experienced with the TF package, what is GRINYA?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
GRINYA=Goods Received Invoice Not Yet Arrived. This is maintained as an Intermediary Account which enables to Print Receivable Invoices Specifications.<br />
Generally this is used in Purchase- Receipt and Purchase Result Combination as Invoices to be Received Account.<br />
<br />
As Maria also has pointed out this difference could be the problem with your Invoice quantity in the physical Supplier Invoice.  The system cannot go wrong in matching and approving the receipt quantity and invoice quantity. <br />
<br />
dont ever resort to GTM for any alterations as it might reference many other tables which might cause irrepairable loss of data or junk data.<br />
<br />
