Advise please :)<br />
I do not know the finance module too well - we are unable to close the company - getting an error message &quot;Unposted Transactions&quot; <br />
I went through the transactions on the error report and they have all been finalized successfully already.  I even went as far as to Print Finalised Transactions for the transactions concerned.  The errors do not appear on the Integration Transaction Log display session, but they do however appear on the Integration Transaction Log report printout. (tfgld4432m000)<br />
The errors appearing here are &quot;Batch being used; try again&quot; and &quot;Cannot open batch for posting to Finance&quot;<br />
Where to from here please?<br />
Kind regards<br />

You may need to query to determine if any batches in these tables are showing up as not finalized and not deleted for the year you're trying to close.  If there are, you need to verify that they are an incorrect status and update them via GTM.<br />

All the statuses on table tfgld100 &amp; tfgld101 are correct - however I see that the status on tfgld418 is erroneous - can I update this and delete the log - will this correct my problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">6th June 2011, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You should be able to delete the log then try to repost integrations for the year you're trying to close.  As long as the log does not regenerate, you should be good to go.  If the log does regenerate, you most likely do have an unposted integration that you will need to address.<br />
