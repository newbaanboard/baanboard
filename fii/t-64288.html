<br />
I urgently need some help in troubleshooting this error.(Refer attachment). Previous to this error was also &quot;unposted document 50050003, Transaction Date 30/06/2013&quot; which I can easily track because it is giving me the Doc Type and Date. But this is my recent error which I totally lost direction where to check. I had checked tfgld100 and tfgld101 but so far all period 6 batch status seem to be ok. Where else can I go? Printed the Non-finalized batch status too. :confused:<br />
 Really appreciate prompt reply as we can't close period 6.<br />
<br />
*We using Infor LN 6.1 FP6 on SQL DB*<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Judy</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jstachy</div><div class="date">13th July 2013, 08:33</div></div><div class="posttext">That is why I am feeling like walking in the dark, trying to find the unposted transaction. The error message is too general(refer attachment). I had been looking in the Non-finalized Transaction but none for period 6. Same for Integration Transaction for period 6. We are not using sales or production modules. We are using only WH, Procurement and Finance(AP,AR,GL and CM). Neither Intercompany. I had extracted the data from all possible related tables - tfgld101,tfgld102,tfgld482,tfgld487,tfgld109,tfgld100- and yet none is unposted or non-finalized for period 6.:confused:<br />
<br />
<br />
One more question, are there any background processes or calculation perform by the system when we close the Period Status or it JUST merely closing the Status?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Maybe using print session tfgld4482m000 could show you the unposted integration transaction.<br />
<br />
There are no background processes or calculations done by the system when closing a period, only BOD publishing actions for ION.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks again, esp on confirming the background processes.<br />
