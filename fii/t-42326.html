<br />
Our Accounting department has mistakenly made a payment to a supplier twice, so they would like to create a credit to offset the second payment.  They were thinking of doing a negative non purchase order, but during composing of the paymenst they receive an audit erro that &quot;negative ppaymenst not allowed.  WHen I check the trasaction type in &quot;maintain transaction types&quot; the Transactino type NPO is set 'Yes' for 'Negative amounts allowed'.  Nay suggestions on how to resolve this or how to best credit the supplier?  Any help is apprecciated!<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

I think from LN there is one option in the payment method to allow negative payments.  In Baan IV audit will block the negative payments.  One work around could be to settle that with some positive payment you will be making to the same supplier if there is any.  Means if you want to make negative payment for 100 to resolve the issue, this payment should be done in combination with any other positive payment which is more than 100.  The total composed amount for that supplier should be positive.  Then only system will allow you to process the payments.  <br />
