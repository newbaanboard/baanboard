<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonian</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">We are setting up a multi finance / single logistic scenario where one &quot;Finance Only&quot; company (710) is located in the UK with reference currency EUR and local currency GBP.  The other (group) company  (700) is located in Holland and is a &quot;Both&quot; (FIn/Log) company with a reference currency of EUR and local currency of EUR.  We need to do bilateral invoicing between the companies if an item is trasnferred between the two warehouses (one linked to Enterprise Unit of 700 and one linked to enterprise unit of 710).  We have set up the goods transfer relationship and entity-entity relationships and are trying to transfer an item from 700 warehouse to 710 warehouse.  Upon confirm shipment we are getting error message &quot;Transaction Type not allowed&quot;.  We are sure that this must be related to either the financial integration setup or the intercompany transactions setup. ....or possibly some table sharing in Central Invoicing.  We have not shared any tables in Central Invoicing.  Does anyone have any recommendations on the following:<br />
<br />
1) Table sharing in MUltiFinance/Single Logistic . We have looked through most of the standard Baan multisite documentation but would like some input from real-lifers.<br />
2) EU tax handling in this scenario (across country borders between two EU companies).<br />
3) Intercompany Transactions setup<br />
4) Financial integrations setup....when you set a company to FInance only you do not need to setup any integrations ...correct??because the transactions are stored by logistic company now???<br />
<br />
Sorry.....before you ask....this is Baan Vc sp8<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated...<br />
<br />
Thankyou in advance</div></div><hr />
