We end up killing the process before it finishes.  At other times the report runs OK in just 25-35 sec with the same Selection Criteria (Form 1:  1 GL Account; 1 Dimension; all other GL and Dim set From-To 0-0 - Form 2:  1 period in the fiscal year.  Has anyone else had similar problems?  We are on SQL2000 database with Level 2 Drivers (OS is Win)</div></div><hr />

If you have a similar problem, call Baan Support.  Tim Bosch is the best person to talk with.  He worked on this solution extensively and is very helpful.</div></div><hr />

The answer is the settings that you run the report with. By default it will select all dimensions and all accounts, when in normal operation you are only interested in a small subset. You have to go to the selections that you are 'not' interested in and make sure they are excluded from the report (crazy interface - really helpful to the user ... grrrr) by setting them to go from ZZZZZZ - ZZZZZZ.</div></div><hr />
