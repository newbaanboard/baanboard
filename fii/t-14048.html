<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">24th December 2003, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a few ledger accounts originally designed for use within project with opening balances on them.<br />
<br />
We never went fully live with project and these balances were never used.<br />
<br />
What's the best way to remove these opening balances ?<br />
<br />
We did try a journal but when attempting to enter the ledger account we received a message &quot;integration transactions not allowed here&quot;.<br />
<br />
All help appreciated.<br />

If there is no blocinkg from manual posting it should allow passing a JV. In case t is a control account remove it from Accounts by FSG/FCG.<br />
<br />
Anyways experiment with COA MAster and make JV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Happy New Year and thanks for the feedback.<br />
<br />
Trying to use the Opening Balance transaction type the session tfgld1105s000 will not allow me to input transactions for the year 2003. Am I correct in thinking that only transactions can be input into the session for the current fiscal year ?<br />
<br />
For the company where I am trying to amend the opening balances the current fiscal year is 2002. Do I therefore need to post a transcation in period 12 of year 2002 to amend the opening balances and then let the year procedure pass these balances to later years.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">6th January 2004, 08:31</div></div><div class="posttext">1. U can input the opening balance for the current year . It is required and allowed in Baan. For previous years , definitely it should not be allowed and Baan does not allow this.  Functionally for next year this should be possible , but I think it's not possible in Baan due to technical reasons (Baan re-writes opening balance history when year close is performed ) .<br />
<br />
2. U need to post the opening balance to see the opening balance reflected in trial balance forever. And subsequent year close will take care of it  by carrying it over to next years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">6th January 2004, 09:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any reason why the session tfgld1105s000 - Maintain Opening Balances wouldn't let me enter transactions for the current year ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">6th January 2004, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">When we say current year  , we mean the year specified in tfgld004 .  The year you enter in tfgld1105s000 has to be equal to this year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">6th January 2004, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Now attempting to finalise my JOB batch I have the problem of some of my ledger codes Integration Indicator being set to Project Costing. This means that the session tpppc2111m000 - Maintain Material Costs is being called from tfgld1105s000<br />
<br />
As we longer use project I have tried to ignore this but when finalising I am getting the error;<br />
<br />
Baan Project Amount Not Split Up Completely.<br />
<br />
Is there any way around this problem without having to Maintain Project Costs. The obvious thing to do would be to change the Integration Indicator via GTM but are there any potential pitfalls in doing this ?<br />
<br />

So the right person for giving u the node to go ahead is the functional owner (i.e. Finance person) in the organization. If  he/she is ok with that then  go ahead with GTM.</div></div><hr />
