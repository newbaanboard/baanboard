<br />
Has anyone had experience with the handling the receiving and payment of goods under a FOB agreement. (Free on board).<br />
<br />
My client wants to receive the goods into a FOB location and subsequently pay the AP invoice in advance of the goods being delivered to the business location.<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be welcomed.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
U can have a transit warehouse where U make the receipt for the FOB location and make payment on the basis of that receipt. U can transfer to the actual location / warehouse using inventory transfer.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />
<br />

Thanks for your suggestion we have decided to create a FOB receiving location within an existing warehouse.<br />
<br />
The user wants the Purchase Receipt transaction to be allocated directly to stock rather than a transit area.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
