<br />
This issue is related with the Composed Payment.<br />
User has done the composed payment for the period 8 and maintained the entries in period 12 (by mistake) &amp; finalized the batch.<br />
Now the Invoices generated in the Preiod 8 are open but actually they have been fully paid in the period 12.<br />
Now user wanted to rectify this problem.<br />
I have suggested the best possible solution according to me was <br />
1&gt; To reverse the payment already processed in P12:<br />
    Prepare a cash transaction using the transaction type X (for the cash)  and transaction type journal. Here, Debit cash and credit any &quot;intermediate&quot; account. This will mean that the wrong credit to cash in P12 is reversed.<br />
 <br />
2&gt; To make the payment in P8:<br />
    Prepare a purchase invoice using the transaction type Y (miscellaneous purchase invoice). Debit the &quot;intermediate&quot; account and credit accounts payable (automatically done by baan). <br />
<br />
Process the payment of this invoice like the user has done the original invoice. Process the invoice in P8. This will ensure that the cash balance is shown correctly<br />
 <br />
Implications:<br />
 <br />
The implications of these entries is as follows:<br />
 <br />
1) Accounts payable will show an incorrect balance from P8 to P12.<br />
2)Intermediate account will have a balance from P8 to P12.<br />
3)The invoice will also be shown in the ageing reports from P8 to P12<br />
<br />
Kindly give your suggestions ASAP.<br />
Thanks in advance...........</div></div><hr />
