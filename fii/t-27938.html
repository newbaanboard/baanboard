Is it possible to create a negative amount of sales credit note?  Or create a sales invoice and apply it to another sales invoice, so that the total invoice balance of 1 invoice is increased?<br />
<br />
We have a problem with the sales invoice created from sales order, that we always require to adjust the sales invoice amount by 0.01, sometimes less 0.01, sometimes more 0.01..  But we would like to apply this adjustment entry to the original invoice, so that we can keep track of only 1 open entry.<br />
<br />
Because the invoice is created in central invoicing from sales, we cannot directly use &quot;sales correction&quot; transaction type.  We have to create another open entries, there's not too much problem also if we want to reduce the balance amount.  As we can create a sales credit note of 0.01, then apply it to the original invoice.  But it is not possible to create a negative 0.01.  And if we create an invoice, the link to original invoice field is disabled, and I cannot link 2 open entries together.  Does anyone have any suggestion?  Any input is very much appreciated. :confused:</div></div><hr />
