<br />
Some observations:<br />
1) I can only see in the picture that the invoice has the status matched. Was it matched using the match to order procedure, so through tfacp2541m000?<br />
2) Is this the error message appearing when you hit the approve button in session tfacp1110s000?<br />
<br />
Suppose the answer to 1) and 2) is yes, then this error comes because you have matched, but the actual receipt is not there (you can check in tfacp245 on index2 to see if there are any receipts done). Only if you have received more than or equal to the matched quantity of the invoice you will be able to approve (or if you use inspections, when the inspections are finished).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">30th July 2008, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah and one more thing. Normally the matching and approving is done after finalization of the invoice. You can use session tfacp2507m000 -&gt; tfacp2107s000 to match, add costs and approve after you have finalized the invoice, which means that you do not have to do this all from tfacp1110s000. Also note that you can use the batch session, i.e. tfacp2280m000 every night, so that only errors coming out of that process needs to be handled.<br />
