<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Man</div><div class="date">26th June 2007, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">When I Process Hours Accounting I get an error about missing Cost Accounting Parameters. When I go to Cost Accounting Parameters (tfcat0100s000) I'm not sure if to choose Variable Cost Accounting or Full Cost Accounting and in any case it is asking for a Transaction Type when I try to Save anything in this session.<br />
<br />
This seems to be different in Baan 5 compared to Baan 4 so I'm a bit unsure about what to do next! <br />
<br />
I just want to be able to run a very simple process to Process Hours Accounting for about 6 directs who have booked hours against production orders. The Process Hours Accounting should give me integration transactions for Production / Operating Costs but until I can set this parameter I cant do anything.<br />
<br />
Not using Cost Categories<br />
<br />
Is there anyone who can help with a simple set up procedure for me to follow in Baan 5?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you tell the exact error message or if possible, the message code in ttadv4551m000. As far as I know, the HRA module is more or less the same as in Baan IV. We have not set-up the parameter in CAT module and no transaction type is mentioned over there but are able to process hours accounting in Baan Vc. <br />
