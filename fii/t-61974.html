<br />
We are going to use service module for spare parts issues to machine(repair &amp; maintenance) . Our finance team wants spare parts consumption reports to machine wise.<br />
Let suppose we have one plant under that plant we have 70 to 80 machines. <br />
We want spare parts consumption report according to each machine wise.<br />
Is this kind of report we can get through service module , or we need to map each machine in dimension in order to get the repair &amp; maintenance expenses detail machine wise.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
Chitaranjan Singh Bhandari</div></div><hr />

If you really need anlysis there is work around<br />
<br />
create cost type for each machine and set integration as per cost type <br />
any time you get the details by cost type<br />
<br />
Best of Luck</div></div><hr />

Based on my experience using service order will be more easier to controll instead of modifying on any modules (common,finance or manufacturing).<br />
<br />

Yes using service order issue /cost is more easy than any modification<br />
there you can have set up with cost type,location etc..<br />
that can give you clear picture where the spares been issued<br />
<br />
all the best</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know there are no Standard report as per your requirement in service module. All the data is there in the system. A report can be developed that will fulfill your requirement.</div></div><hr />
