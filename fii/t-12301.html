<br />
I would like to know if it is possible to define a transaction type that will not be included in the tax analysis report. I'm working in baan 4c2. In the tax analysis lines the country code and VAT  codes are maintained. also the empty vat code.<br />
One of my customers has the situation that they receive a payment (load in Baan with Maintain Bank Transactions session) from his customers and afterwards decide to sent it back (with maintain unallocated receipts). His problem is that this movements creates entries in tfgld110 tax analysis table. He doesn't want this entries to affect his tax analysis report.<br />
I tried in Baan to see how I can define a transaction type that is not logged in tax analysis but I couldn't. Also in the tax analysis relations they need all transactions category. Is it possible to do this without a customisation?<br />
<br />
Sorry if my explanations are not very consistent. I'm just a programmer...<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance for your time.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />
