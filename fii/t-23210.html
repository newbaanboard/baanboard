 ;) <br />
Can anyone tell me how to change the payment date in a payment advice?<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After Maintain Payment Advice, when we want to process the payment,<br />
it's prompting &quot;error message negative&quot; and showing two groups of suppliers.<br />
<br />
When I check, I noticed the similarily between the two suppliers are the payment date is &quot;wrongly-key in&quot; compared to others.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can I still change the payment date or delete the two payment from the payment advice and proceed?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks alot.<br />
<br />
I deleted the document from the batch and finalized the batch successfully.<br />
And then I put the document with corrected date into another batch.<br />
<br />
I think its ok already.<br />
<br />
Before that I tried to user the otfcor0302 program but it never changed the date in the compose payment table (tdcmg109).<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain to me what is this otfcor0302 program and how t use it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you again guys. Have a nice day.<br />

<br />
Baan Support site says it is for changing dates in document, not only for single document, but for range as well.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I have never used this correction Program before.</div></div><hr />
