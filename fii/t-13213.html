<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">6th October 2003, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We have several purchase oders with back order lines where the part deliveries took part in period 12.2003 (our fiscal year is form 01.10. - 30.09.) and now we need to make the back orders with back order date new fiscal year (e.g. 06.10.2004). The integration paramter is set to allow postings to the next open period (tfgld450.pnop = Yes)and the integration period status for period 12 in 2003 is closed. We get the error message &quot;fiscal and reporting period are incosistent&quot; when trying to confirm the backorder. Has anyone encountered that problem yet ?<br />
