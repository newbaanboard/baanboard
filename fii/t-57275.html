Assinged The Supplier And Ledger Code;po;amount. Now The Tfacp200 Status Displays As  Registered. And I Try To Match &amp; Approve The Same ,status Now As Approved.<br />
<br />
Now I Am Trying To Link To The Bank Payment To The Supplier The Status Again Shows As &quot;registered&quot; And Balance Amount Is 0.<br />
<br />
I Am Trying To Create Sql Query /crystal Reports For Purchase Order Paid Or Not Paid Based On The Status. The Result Is Not Correctly Displaying.<br />
I Can Track With Balance Amount? But There Could Be Some Time We Make Partial Amount To The Supplier And Balance Will Be There And Status Will Appear As Registered.<br />
