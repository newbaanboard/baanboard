<br />
We are working on Baan 4c4.<br />
<br />
Under Baan Service, under contract control if we want to offload the work to subcontractors, it's not allowing us to raise work order / purchase order.<br />
<br />
If we raise the WO/PO through Distribution Module then we can't attach service contract number in purchase order, so we can't link the cost of such WO to correct contract.<br />
<br />
How we can accomodate contract number in WO/PO ?<br />
<br />
Pl. help.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way to directly connect data from BAAN IV Service to a purchase order is via the session tssma3170m000 (Maintain Service Order Cost Estimate).<br />
By running the &lt;Generate Planned Purchase Order for Service Order&gt; in the Special feature in tssma3170m000 the system will automatically create a Planned INV Purchase Order in tdinv3120m000. You can confirm and transfer this Planned INV Purchase order to a real purchase order, receive the goods in and get the costs back to the service order.<br />
<br />
As you can see there is no link in BAAN IV between a Service Contract and Distribution/Manufacturing.<br />
The only way is as described above and a few things are important to understand:<br />
<br />
- when you create a Service Contract you will link this to an Installation<br />
- the same Installation (that has been covered by the Service Contract) will be put on a Service Order<br />
- once the Service Order has been defined you can run the procedure through tssma3170m000 as mentioned above<br />
- as soon as you generate a Planned INV Purchase Order the system will make a hard allocation of the inventory in the warehouse.<br />
<br />
This means that you will have an indirect charge of material costs to the Service Contract through a Service Order.<br />
One of the things you can do is the following: as soon as you cut the PO for the subcontractor make sure one of the reference fields in tdpur4101m000 is used to enter the Service Contract number. This will not give you a hard link between the PO and the Service Contract but there will at least be a &quot;soft&quot; reference.<br />
For sure the Service Order will have a link to both the PO and the Service Contract.<br />
<br />
A way to handle work orders in combination to a Service Contract is through creating a PCS Project in tipcs and linking that to a Service Order as well.<br />
However, it has been more than 4 years since I have worked with this but have seen BAAN customers using it this way.<br />
<br />
Well, hopefully this will help you. If you have more questions please let us know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
