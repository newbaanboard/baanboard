<br />
Wish someone can advise on this.<br />
<br />
We have a single logistics multi finance setup on BaaN V.<br />
<br />
We use transfer(manual) to transfer goods between warehouses in different finance company.<br />
<br />
Scenario 1<br />
Transferred of 10 pc of  item A from warehouse ABC (finance comp 500) to warehouse XYZ (Finance comp 501). All 10 pc received in warehouse XYZ.<br />
<br />
This results an invoice created in Finance comp 500 for item A for 10 pc.<br />
<br />
This is OK.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2<br />
Transferred of 10 pc of  item A from warehouse ABC (finance comp 500) to warehouse XYZ (Finance comp 501). Only 8 pc received in warehouse XYZ.<br />
<br />
This results an invoice created in Finance comp 500 for item A for 10 pc and an credit note of 2 pc.<br />
<br />
This is OK.<br />
<br />
Scenario 3<br />
Transferred of 10 pc of  item A and 10 pc of item B from warehouse ABC (finance comp 500) to warehouse XYZ (Finance comp 501). Only 8 pc for each item are received in warehouse XYZ.<br />
<br />
I tested this. These results in 2 invoices created in Finance comp 500. One for 10 pc of item A and another one for 10 pc of item B.<br />
<br />
Also created is one credit note of 2 pc of item A. <br />
<br />
I am not getting the credit note of item B. <br />
<br />
Similarly, I am not getting the credit note for item B and C if I am going to transfer item A, B and C.<br />
<br />
Question : why only the credit note  for first item is created ?</div></div><hr />
