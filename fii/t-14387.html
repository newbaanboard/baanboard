<br />
We have come across a Purchase Invoice within our system which has errorneous payment records against it.<br />
<br />
Normally we would expect an anticipated payment record CPY to have a negative value but in this instance it is a positive value for the incorrect amount.<br />
<br />
This has caused a the remittance advice for the supplier in question to contain a negative amount for the value in question.<br />
<br />
Can anybody advise the best way to correct this problem so that we can pay the supplier the amount from the original invoice as well as the errorneous amount appearing on the CPY.<br />
<br />
I have attached screen dump showing the purchase invoice payments.  <br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pfsilva</div><div class="date">2nd March 2004, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
First u have to look in tfgld106 to check if  the bookings for the &quot;incorrect payments&quot; are incorrect too.<br />
Because if they are u have to correct both in tfgld106 and tfacp200. <br />
If bookings are correct in tfgld106 then u have only to go to tfacp200 and change the sign of the incorrect payments and then run session tfacp2245m000 for that supplier.<br />
If bookings are also wrong in tfgld106 u have to change credits into debits or viceversa and then run tfgld3203m000 por that period, provided that u have not closed that year.<br />
Hope this will help.<br />
Cheers,<br />

You've just confirmed what we did do. tfgld106 was ok just we just amended tfacp200 and then ran tfacp2245m000.<br />
