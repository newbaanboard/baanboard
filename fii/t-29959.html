<br />
we do want to implement a single log./multi fin. enviroment which lead to a problem on the valuation part. We are going to use FTP for all inventory and do have sites throughout Europe and the US. Since we are changing currency rates once a month and the reference currency is EURO that will lead to a revaluation on all inventory. Secondly it may happen quite often that the FTP value is changed during the year which will also change the valuation price at all other locations (warehouses) where surcharges are setup. <br />
<br />
Could you please share your ideas on that how you would cope with the mentioned implications ?<br />
<br />
Thanks - Jochen</div></div><hr />
