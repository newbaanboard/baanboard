We have an account which was used for booking expenses through cost invoice, later some user used it as control account.<br />
Now the mistake has been identified and we want to use it as normal account.<br />
But when we are trying to use this account for booking expense through cost invoice, it gives a message that &quot;Ledger account not allowed, being used as control account&quot;.<br />
Can anyone explain the way how to use the same ledger for invoice booking.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hope you want to use the same account as  control account but you should be able to use the same in manual entry.<br />
<br />
In Erp LN there is a facility to use the account as control as well as allow user to have same account while doing manual transactions.<br />
<br />
check the account maintainace screen where you will find the option to allow user entry.<br />
<br />
I do not have access to system else I could have send you the screen shots.<br />
<br />
You have to manage extracting the details for this account since you are using the same as control as well as normal because some details will come from int transactions and some from normal transactions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If an account is entered in a financial BP group, and that account is used as a &quot;control account&quot;, then a record in tfgld037 is created. For each control account it keeps track how many times it has been added in ACP or ACR.<br />
<br />
The idea of this is, that if an account is used as &quot;a control&quot; account, that no manual postings can be done to that.<br />
<br />
If there is a balance on a control account, then this account can not be removed from the FIN BP groups it is used in. <br />
<br />
You are saying now that somebody has entered that account in a BP group which represents a control account. What have you done to correct that, did you remove with table maintenace that account from the table? I guess you must have, because the message you are getting indicates that that account is still present in tfgld037.<br />
<br />
The previous post is talking about the fact that in LN you are able to use an account as control account and still post manually to that, which is not true. I guess some fucntionality is mixed up here. In LN it was not possible to use an account which was used in the mapping scheme to post manually to. With a recent solution you are able to do that, but that has nothing to do with your problem.<br />

The problem was there in tfgld037, I removed the record and now it's allowing me to select the account for booking the expenses. Thanks for your response.<br />

Thanks for your post.I have identified the problem, which got resolved by removing the data from tfgld037. Now it's working. I wanted to use the account for manual entry only. I have removed it from Supplier group.<br />
I really doubt that we can use the account as control as well as for Manual entering the transaction.  Can you please explain a bit further.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

What Miechel said is correct. There was mis understanding from my side. But as Michel said if you install a patch 224592 you will be able to do Manual transactions for the accounts defined in int Transactions. This patch is available for LN FP3. Please verify if this is useful to you.<br />

Solution Description <br />
It is now possible to enter manual postings on integration accounts via the 'Manual Posting Exceptions' session (tfgld0148m000).</div></div><hr />
