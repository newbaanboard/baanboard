<br />
We are using Baan IV and are facing a strange type of problem in CMG Supplier Payments. The payment advice is made with Purchase invoices as selection and all documents for that type are being taken and then the batch is being processed. The batch gets posted but the cheque that is being taken up here in processing has value as that of first invoice selected and also in bank reconcilliation the amount is not getting equalized.<br />
<br />
Other information might be of help to you:<br />
We are making Payment Advice Manually<br />
<br />
For anyother information please let me know will be provided at the earliest.<br />
<br />
Please respond urgently<br />
<br />
