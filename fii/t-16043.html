You would have to setup a billing request set attaching the 4 billing requests and add that to a job. Baan will create 4 new billing requests.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">21st July 2004, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not possible to prevent the departments using any transaction type that is available - unless you make a customisation. But if you do create the requests automatically and remove the option to setup manual requests than there will be no problems.<br />
