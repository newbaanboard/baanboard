<br />
Can anybody help me?<br />
<br />
I do not understand why in session tfcmg2130s000 I see all invoices with balance 0 that were closed some time ago and also invoices that have some balance and are opened?<br />
<br />
I want that session by default shows only invoices that have some balance.<br />
<br />
I've already checked latest SOL but this does'nt help or I can not find the appropriate one for the Form.<br />
<br />
Can You help me? <br />

<br />
Take some of the invoices numbers and check in the table tfacr200 and see if the balance field is actually zero.  Maybe this will give you and indication of what is wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've already did. Balance of invoice is really zero, also there is no anticipated balance.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">30th July 2003, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the balance field showing 0 or 0.0000?  That could also make a difference.</div></div><hr />

Balance is shown correct with 0,0000.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
I have to agree that this is almost certainly a data issue as the program should not show paid invoices.<br />
<br />
You will probably need either someone from Baan or a consultant to dial in to look at this for you.<br />
<br />
If you need help and are prepared to 'cross my palm with silver' I would happily assit.<br />

<br />
<br />
Thank You for help. I found out that session tfacr/acp2245m000 didn't work O.K. by our customer.<br />
<br />
Since thy installed latest SOL update in tfacr/acp200 was O.K. and session now shows only records with some balance.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Monika</div></div><hr />
