<br />
I am attempting to close year 2000 via session tfgld6203m000 - Close Year and I am receiving the message tfglds0364 &quot;Total debit / credit not in balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can anybody with the source tell me which figures in which tables are causing this problem.<br />
<br />
I have closed the year provisionally tfgld6201m000 and I have also ran the session tfgld6202m000 to Balance Profit and Loss Accounts.<br />
<br />
All periods in 2000 are also finally closed expect the last period. <br />
<br />
I am running on Baan IV c3.<br />

<br />
The for each ledger account the system the values from tfgld203 and the transactions from  tfgld201.  It creates a debit and credit balance for each account and adds these together.  If the total is not  = 0 then you get the error message.  Did you run a rebuild on your ledger before trying to run the close?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Maria,<br />
<br />
I haven't run a rebuild as yet but I suspect this may be the best way to correct the inbalance in tables 201 and 203.<br />
<br />
Can I run a rebuild on periods which are finally closed or do I need to speak to support ?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
I'm not 100% sure on that point but I doubt that anything will stop you from running the rebuild for finally closed periods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">6th February 2002, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We are still having problems closing year 2000 in company 002 but I believe that we may have a problem with our multicompany structure as our system has been set up with the following tables shared;<br />
<br />
tfgld004 - Financial Companies<br />
tfgld007 - Periods<br />
<br />
Company 005 also required their opening balances for 2002 and here we managed to follow the year end process with a little more success and we actually managed to close year 2000 for company 005. This had the effect of closing all the periods and moving on the fiscal year for company 002 and now the current <br />
fiscal year for the whole system is 2001 despite 2000 not being closed for all the companies apart from company 5.<br />
<br />
I would suspect that the above tables shouldn't be shared.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any procedures closing year end in a multicompany setup.<br />

you are correct... tfgld007 Period Status and tfgld004 Financial Comapnies should not be shared.  In our multi-company environ.  the tfgld005 Periods table is shared but, not the two you mention.  The typical set up for multi-finance/ multi-company is to share only key financial tables and no more. For a set of companies that have the same Chart of accounts / fiscal year-period structure These are: <br />
tfgld002 Dimension descriptions  <br />
tfgld005 periods <br />
tfgld006 end dates by year <br />
tfgld008 Chart of Accounts <br />
tfgld009 Demension ranges by ledger <br />
tfgld010 Demensions <br />
and tfgld450 Inetgration paramenters.<br />
The rest of the finance tables are resident for EACH company.  It is part of standard procedure to run the rebuild dimension/ledger history before you close a year.  This is a session to correct any problems that may have occurred in the ledger over the year.  Sometimes this is not apparent to your Finance community so....  Run the session for all periods in the year before closing.  This can not be done once a period is finally closed!  Which means if your periods are finally closed, you ought to call support and see if they have a  workaround.<br />
Once you get to that point, run a provisional close to see what the opening balances would be provisionally, do the rebuilds, run the provisional again and check to see if some Opening bals are different (ie, corrected). Run the autobalancing of P/L. The autobalance creates a batch that you must finalize.  See if the batch exits, is balanced,  and finalize it.  THEN, run the close year session. This also creates a batch that you need to finalize.  Always have someone in finance looking over the batch totals and balances if you are not intimately aquainted with the books and where the $$$ should be.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
One small question on the batches that are created by the P/L balance and the close year. <br />
<br />
I would presume that the P/L balance batch is generated in the current fiscal year (the year you are closing), finalised and then the close year procedure creates another batch in the next fiscal year (the one you are moving into).<br />
<br />
I will certainly be talking to support on this issue and also reviewing the logical table setup.<br />
