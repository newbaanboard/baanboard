<br />
I would appreciate if anyone can give me an advice for the below scenario.<br />
<br />
We had a situation whereby user had accidentally backdated the invoice date for a range of SO to March.  Invoice should be posted in April.  SO status are already at deleting line.  Besides doing a credit note, is there an alternate way of doing this.  If there is, what are the details &amp; impact of doing so.<br />
<br />
Btw, this is for B4c4</div></div><hr />

Firstly, How many are you talking about. If the number is not very large is raising credit note very difficult? Depending on the  order type it may be possible to use the copy function when entering the credit order. <br />
<br />
Secondly have the invoices actually been raised? It is the date of invoice rather tha nthe date of the order / delivery that determines the invoice date.<br />
<br />
If Invcoices have been raised have they been posted to finance ?<br />
<br />
Please post the order steps so that we can be more specific with suggestions.<br />

<br />
Please refer to answer below:<br />
<br />
Firstly, How many are you talking about. If the number is not very large is raising credit note very difficult? Depending on the order type it may be possible to use the copy function when entering the credit order. <br />
&gt;&gt; There are about more than 20 invoices.  User find it pain to raise credit note,  and re-create the SO. Yes, they can copy back to the old SO to save the time.<br />
Secondly have the invoices actually been raised? It is the date of invoice rather tha nthe date of the order / delivery that determines the invoice date.<br />
&gt;&gt; Yes, invoice has been raised.<br />
If Invcoices have been raised have they been posted to finance ?<br />
&gt;&gt; Not yet posted in finance.</div></div><hr />

1) Print Order Ack<br />
2) Print Picking List<br />
3) Maintain delivery<br />
4) Print delivery Order<br />
5) Print Sales Invoices<br />
6) PDSO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 01:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I can't give you an easy fix.  Had the last step not been run (process delivered sales orders) then it would have been fairly easy to change the invoice date in table tdsls045 and the financial transactions would have been posted correctly.<br />
<br />
20 credit notes and reinvoice is not a lot of work (1/2 hour) and to my mind is the correct prcess.  If you were to correct this error batch I think you would spend the rest of your career correcting (careless) mistakes.<br />

<br />

If you have not posted the invoices... just change the period in tfgld410 for all the invoices, and transaction date (= invoice date). And then post the integration transaction for Sales and Sales invoice.<br />
<br />
If you have posted, but not finalized, then you need to change tfgld102, tfgld018, tfgld100 also will need to be changed for fiscal period and document date.<br />
<br />
If you have finalized then tfgld106, tfgld018, tfgld100 will need to be changed for fiscal period and document date. Then rebuild ledger histroy will have to be run for March and April.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
