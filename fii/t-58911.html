<br />
The issue we are facing is. Suppose if a tax is of line 10 lines, some times [FONT=&quot;Verdana&quot;]taxware does not return tax amount for some line of the invoice. We have tax exemption at business partner level. As product catagory level exemption is not there, why the taxware is not returning the tax some times.<br />
<br />
If you check the history for the business partner-Product combination. you can find that only on some instances TAXWARE did not returned tax amount the table cisli245 is having taxamount as zero.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if any one had had similar issue.<br />
<br />

See if the tax code in the sales order line is empty on the orders where tax is missing? I have seen that if the tax code is empty then vertex doesnt calculate tax. <br />
Also i am sure you would have checked the tax flag is set to yes on the sales order header</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for the updates.<br />
<br />
I have checked in table tdsls400 the tax is set to 'Yes' and allthe lines in table tdsls401 does have tax code populated. Still the table cisli245 does have tax amount as zero for one line of the order.<br />
<br />
When I tried to create the same orde on DEV system, means keep same combination of Business partner- products- address- prices-qty. The system calculates tax for all lines correctly.<br />
<br />
Not able to understand why on production tax is not calculated correctly for some order lines.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">3rd August 2010, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">1) In VERTEX there are exemption setup, which could be set up at product category level (ie you could exclude certain products from TAX). Do you have anything like that set up in TAXWARE? May be the DEV setting is different from PROD<br />
<br />
2) Is it reproducible in production (ie if you add another order for the same stuff) and print order acknowledgement you could see if it shows tax or not.. If this calculates fine, then its something specific to that order</div></div><hr />
