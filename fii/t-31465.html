<br />
In one row (statement account) a year to date column is not showing the correct value.<br />
<br />
The row has a month column (set up for 2007 period 3) which does have the correct values. But the year to date column (set up for 2007, periods 1-3) has the wrong total.<br />
<br />
I did an extract of the accounts used by this statement account from tfgld201 (Ledger History), which is I think where this statement gets its data (it is not consolidated and does not have annexures). The data there is correct. <br />
<br />
The YTD column is out by the amount of one of the ledger accounts in this group, but not all of them. For example:<br />
<br />
Account        Period     Amount<br />
Prior Periods   1-2        $10,000<br />
Account1       3           $1,000<br />
Account2:      3           $1,000<br />
Account3:      3           $500<br />
<br />
Financial Statement:<br />
Current Month (3): $2,500   Correct!<br />
YTD (1-3):  $12,000  Not Correct. Should be $12,500. Missing Account3.<br />
<br />
Account3 is not new, but it had not been used for some time. The period 3 transactions were the first this year. It is a P/L account, so has no opening balances. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

It has to be the same in the financial statement, if  itÂ’s different run the session tfgld3203m000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but I should have posted this solution I found sooner. The problem I found was that the range of accounts used in this statement account included both the child accounts and their parents. When I changed the range to include only the child accounts, the statement worked fine.<br />
