<br />
I have a questions on the interim account in the integration mapping setting which I really cannot understand the logic, can you give me some advise?? <br />
<br />
Let look at interim warehouse transfer, please let me know if I am correct or wrong, my understanding of the interim warehouse transfer in the integration mapping scheme should work like this:<br />
<br />
During generate inbound:<br />
<br />
Purchase/Receipt:<br />
Dr Interim warehouse transfer<br />
Cr Accrual - Trade <br />
<br />
Warehouse Transfer/Receipt:<br />
Dr stock<br />
Cr Interim warehouse transfer<br />
<br />
Is it correct?? <br />
<br />
<br />
But this is what I found from my integration mapping scheme and found that the entries were as below:<br />
<br />
Purchase/Receipt:<br />
Dr stock<br />
Cr Accrual <br />
<br />
Warehouse Transfer/Receipt:<br />
Dr stock<br />
Cr Interim warehouse transfer<br />
<br />
The setting debit stock 2 times for a purchase receipt transaction, and the interim warehouse transfer is only credit and never debit.  Is this setting wrong? because now my interim warehouse transfer has a credit balance and I do not know how to check how to reconcile it against.<br />
<br />
