The contention of the IT team is that, by mistake, the receipts may have been entered in December, 2005.  In that case, it should turn up as an opening balance of receipts not matched with invoices - is my assumption correct?   Where could these receipts have gone?<br />

I would assume you trying to do the match in AP. It shouldnt matter when it is received, it should always show up as long as they are not paid.<br />
