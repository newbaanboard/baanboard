<br />
We have a situation where we want a single logistic multi finance solution for procedural reasons. The problem we have is that all intercompany transactions are posted with values equal to standard cost price. And it must be at a commercial price to comply with the transfer pricing rules.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have experience with commercial prices between companies in a multisite structure, or does anybody have a workaround??<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
Eric</div></div><hr />
