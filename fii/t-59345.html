<br />
A consignment payment order is generated for the consignment not owned inventory. At the invoicing stage the tax amounts are not included though the excisable tax code is given in the consignment replenishment order and the same tax code is present in the payment order also. <br />
How can we book the invoice for this kind of orders? If anyone know about this issue please mention the process.<br />
