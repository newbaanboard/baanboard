<br />
PROBLEM:<br />
<br />
I have two types of items for sale, 1 is manufactured and the other is a purchased item which is just resold with a surcharge added on.<br />
<br />
The problem being that integrations were mixed up!<br />
<br />
The original plan was for the Manufactured item to flow through the Raw, WIP, Finished goods accounts, &amp; the Purchased item to flow into a separate inventory called Resale Items<br />
<br />
What has happened in realty is that under the purchase receipt integration it was actually mapped to the Raw inventory account, but under the Sales Issue integration it is correctly mapped to the Resale Items Inventory account.<br />
<br />
Thus, I have a Raw Inventory account which is extremely overvalued and a Resale Items inventory account that is extremely undervalued.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how I may be able to reconcile the 2 accounts such that I make a journal entery adjustment to properly adjust my balances.<br />
<br />
I thought I might be able to find a unique identifier, dump data into excel, then manipulate it somehow.  <br />
<br />
So far no avail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do your purchased items carry different cost price components than your manufactured items?  If so, you could print your purchase/receipt integrations for your raw inventory account into excel, then sort on the cost price component. <br />
<br />

<br />
This is the one I am most concerned about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jwlebec</div><div class="date">26th July 2002, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">When cost items are received they appear in gld410 without warehouse. This is logic beacuase they are not kept in stock.<br />
So if on one stock ledger account you want to filter out the cost items amount, do the following query on gld410<br />
select amth<br />
from baantfgld410<br />
where tror = 1,<br />
fitr = 2,<br />
leac = the stock GL account you analyse,<br />
cwar is empty.<br />
<br />
Use dbcr to find out debited or credited amount with a decode function in an oracle SQL statement for instance.<br />
<br />
You can also create an export scheme.<br />
<br />
I think this will help you to retrieve the wrongly booked amount.<br />
