<br />
We are facing major speed issues in finance. A database review was done suggestions given:<br />
<br />
H/W upgradation<br />
Session specific changes<br />
<br />
The third issue was that in Finance no of records in certain tables are two high ... namely tfgld106 and tfgld410. I know for reducing no. of records in tfgld106 aproper archiving needs to be done....<br />
<br />
But for tfgld410there is session to Purge ntegration transaction. we have never done it here in our organization.. Would any one plz tell what is the loss of information that may occur if we do the same...<br />
<br />
<br />
any other experiances which help in speed issues??<br />
<br />

<br />
I would really advise that you implement a full archiving strategy to assist with your performance problems.<br />
<br />
Please be aware that in a lot of cases data is actually moved into the archiving company and not lost ie. you can archive integration transactions as opposed to purging them.<br />
<br />
The attached document should be a good starting point.<br />

<br />
I assume u r getting performance problems in most of your sessions. If this is the case then i have some tips..if this is not the case and performance is only with a few sessions then archiving and fine tunning your scripts with correct select and indexes is needed.<br />
<br />
To improve overall performance u need to concentrate more on the D/B and your networking again assuming your Servers have been sized adequately. <br />
<br />
- Recalculation of initial and subsequent extents of hot tables/indexes <br />
- Recreation of sysmaster tables is also necessary for the same reason, but   it requires reinstallation of the D/B server.<br />
-Separate dbspaces to be created for hot tables so as to speed up   the server database actions.<br />
- Fragmentation <br />
- database logging mode buffered one gives very good response.<br />
<br />
Pls discuss these issues with a good and confident D/B administrator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As advised we have done a proper Db review and the suggestions given by you were one of the major considerations during the same. <br />
<br />
Extents have been reduced from &gt;140 to around 1, hot tables in seperate dbsapce as well as discs,buffers checked.<br />
<br />
End result was limitation of RAM as present RAM is 4GB but advised is atleast 5 for the data..<br />
<br />
We are looking for new server setup and upgradation...<br />
<br />
<br />
But alongwith , voluminous tables like tfgld410,418 have to be reduced. So we need to Archive the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx for the Info...<br />
