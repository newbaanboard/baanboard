<br />
Our company is a manf co. producing different kind of products and does sales. We have categorized the products and grouped them in different divisions (say div A, B and C) using PCS Project series and then integrating it to Dimension Type1.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, to produce an item from div A requires a subcomponent (or an operation) from division B. But here we create Sales Order and invoicing for division A only. If we create a diff PCS project and prod order to produce the subcomponent from div B, there will be only cost affect in div B without any revenue.<br />
<br />
Our requirements are as below:<br />
<br />
 Revenue and cost of the actual sales order (for div A) to be accurate including cost of the subcomponent showing in div A itself.<br />
 Div B also req to show their revenue and cost, which could be knocked off periodically for showing the overall company financials.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are now planning to do it by maintaining internal customer and supplier and creating Purch Order, Sales Order, invoicing, matching, approving, etc., and then knocking off related AR and AP, which will be very lengthy and cumbersome. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have better idea to do this?<br />
<br />
(We are using Single-Fin/Single-Logistic company structure. We do not want to use subcontracting process in BaaN).<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

We are also a single logistic and finance. Did you find a solution?</div></div><hr />
