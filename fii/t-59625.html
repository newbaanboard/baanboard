<br />
I was approached with a question from one of our users today regarding Purchase Orders &amp; Vendor Invoices and performing a &quot;2-way-match&quot; to pay a vendor.<br />
<br />
Basically from what I understood from the conversation was that the key is if the PO is &quot;confirmed&quot; or not.<br />
  <br />
The PO is initially issued to the vendor &quot;Unconfirmed&quot;, when the vendor performs their service and the business agrees that the service has been done satisfactorily the PO is moved from &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; to &quot;Confirmed&quot; status.<br />
<br />
When this PO is then matched to a vendor invoice, the system will set the invoice up to be paid in the next check run.<br />
<br />
If this information is correct?<br />
How is this controlled?  Is it by the Purchase Order type?</div></div><hr />
