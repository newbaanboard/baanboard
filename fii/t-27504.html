I have the following problem, each month the accountants compares the extract account (tfgld1406m000) vs trial balance. Often times, there is wrong values on the trial balance report. Usually this is fixed runing the sesion tfgld3203m000 (rebuild from finalized transactions).<br />
<br />
My question is, what are the possibles causes that the trial balance are wrong? what does the session tfgld3203m000?<br />
<br />
I have the latest upgrades for the trial balance and the problem persist...<br />
<br />
Anyone have an idea?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

The ledger totals tables (eg. tfgld202) are updated during the finalisation process.<br />
<br />
tfgld3203m000 rebuilds the ledger total tables from tfgld106.  The TB uses the ledger totals tables to print it's data.</div></div><hr />
