<br />
We want to know departments wise expenses report(like actual , budget, YTD actual , budget, last year actual, CY annual budget, LY annual budget) .See attached report format for reference.<br />
<br />
We are using FST module for this report. I would like to know it is possible to have one Financial Statement with one similar Statement Account for all departments or we need to create separate Financial Statement according to departments wise and in Specifications by Statement Account we need to use department code also with ledger account.<br />
<br />
If in a single Financial statement I give the full range of departments then it is possible to select the particular department in Redefine Ranges option at the time of Process Value in order to know that particular department expenses. If it is possible then I think no need to create multiple financial statements according to dimension wise.<br />
<br />
We are using departments in dimension.<br />
<br />
Please suggest your solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
For each department you will have to create a separate Financial Statements. If you want to use it as the other way that is have only one report and input the department when you want to generate a report, than i suggest that you develop a report from tools or used some reporting tool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am unable to find your attached file. But still i can understood your problem as per my knowledge. Since you are following the departments as dimensions. So please convert dimensions into statement accounts by copying in one shot in the statement account structure. After that by using the specification you can assign the ledger accounts and the dimensions will be automatically assigned since you have copied from the dimensions.<br />
<br />
And from the LN only you can generate a report for multiple periods as you mentioned like actual budget and last year etc. by using the period shifts.<br />
<br />
I think you need not go different statements or any other reporting tool. If you can send me the file of your format then i can explain to you the procedure.<br />
