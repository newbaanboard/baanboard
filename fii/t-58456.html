<br />
A particular batch generated through CMG module is not appearing for finalization in the session -tfgld1111s000. <br />
When I checked the details of this batch I found that document number was generated but there was no value in that. Could that be the reason ??<br />
Due to this problem I am unable to close the period.<br />
<br />
The same batch having similar details was appearing in my Test environment where I was able to finalize that easily. <br />
I am baffled why it's not happening in the Live environment.<br />
<br />
Any comments ??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

If no data found in document, then you can change Batch status in gld100  to deleted then it will allows you  to close the period.<br />
