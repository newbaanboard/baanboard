<br />
I am seeking a simple solution for my following problem: <br />
1. We make sales invoices in USD but our home currency is INR. At the time of making sales invoice there is one specific exchange rate applicable for all the invoices made during that month. <br />
2. We received money from our customer in USD in next month than invoice month. And at the time of receiving money from customer a different exchange rate is applicable. In baan we book this receipt amount at Unallocated Receipt or Advance receipt if we received money in adance before generation of sales invoice. But in both the cases, exchane rate differ with sales invoice exchange rate.<br />
3. Now in another month we need to allocate these invoices with unallocated receipt / advance receipt. At the time of doing this, system calculate and book entry for &quot;Gain/Loss on exchange rate&quot; in proper account as defined it in Financial Customer group. <br />
4. Now problem is system is debiting or crediting one more entry in customer account with the amount ( in INR currency) which is equal to Currency Gain/loss on exchange rate. Which we belive is not correct. Because its mean, either we have received more money from customer or is due to customer based on the situation of Currency gain/loss on exchange. <br />
We have also finalized some batches where we have done allocation of receipt with invoices and it has unbalanced our customers accounts. <br />
5. Please suggest how can we overcome with this problem. There are many tranactions and customers are there.</div></div><hr />

I  have encountered this problem before and even now in our version (IVb4). What happens is that when you are allocating multiple USd invoices to a single cheque or ccustomer Receipt document, it behave this way. I did lot of research to find this out. Now I have used my user to assign one invoice at a time to the customer receipt (CR) document.<br />
<br />
Meaning that once the user selects the CR document and goes to allocate the invoices, all the open items will be shown. At this point the user will assign one invoice and come out of the allocation by saving it.<br />
<br />
He will then go to select the CR document again and then select the next invoice and do the same process. This will continue until the CR document residual value becomes zero.<br />
<br />
Hope I am able to explain.<br />
<br />
One thing I don't understand is that, in my case the batch in which this is done becomes unbalanced and cannot be finalised. But in yr case how does the batch get finalised ? Do you do some GTM before finalising the batch ?<br />

I don't understand why customer account will go imbalanced. Any excess or less money due to exchnage rate fluctution comes under currency loss account. Your cusotmer account should be though balanced.</div></div><hr />
