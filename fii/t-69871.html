<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CSBbaan</div><div class="date">20th March 2017, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">How do I reverse posting integration transactions to finance transactions (tfgld4201m000)? Normally a current month date is used for the transaction and log date, but in this case the post occurred for a default date of 01-01-0001. And transactions were posted from years ago for periods that were already closed. Now the current period can't be closed because of these old transactions. Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I believe I have Transactions that posted as well as ones that did not find a GL account and are showing up on the Integrated Transactions Log. Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

i noticed that you're using baan4, in baan4 there is a tf correction session that reverses posted integration if you can find that session it will helps you. go to ttadv2100m000 and look for tfcor sessions. if you found the session try first in your test server.<br />
