<br />
When a receipt is approved for the received quantity (rejection = 0) does it trigger any transaction in finance integration.<br />
<br />
I was told of a scenario where on maitain approval the original receipt transactions are reversed and a new transaction is passed for the receipt even though the rejection quantity is 0.<br />
<br />
Is this standard functionality ???<br />

When a purchase invoice is approved after beeing matched with a receipt a transaction is generated, the credit account indicated in tdinv850 for purchase/receipt is debited and the invoice receipt account defined in the ledger accounts by financial supplier group is credited.<br />
Hope this will help.<br />

<br />
Let me make by query more specific:<br />
<br />
If I make a purchase receipt for quantity 10  of an item and approve the 10 items, what will be the transactions that will be passed on receipt and on approval.<br />
<br />
One entry is passed on receipt:<br />
<br />
Stock Dr<br />
To ITBR<br />
<br />
On approval will this entry be reversed and a new entry be passed ??<br />

That's in Baan IV, not sure about V though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Baan IV the bookings for receipts and approvals are as follows:<br />
<br />
Purchase/ Receipt (Goods are received)<br />
<br />
Debit: Stock<br />
Credit: Items received pending Invoice from Supplier (this account is defined in tdinv850)<br />
<br />
When the invoice is received:<br />
Debit: Invoices Pending Approval (Invoice Receipt Account in Financial Supplier Group)<br />
Credit: Supplier Control Account<br />
<br />
When the invoice is approved:<br />
<br />
Debit: Items Pending Invoice from Supplier<br />
Credit: Invoices Pending Approval.<br />

<br />
Two things:<br />
<br />
Firstly, my query is about approval of receipts (distribution) and not about approval of invoices (finance)<br />
<br />
Secondly, BaaN passes an entry on receipt of goods in BaaN iv. The entry is<br />
<br />
Goods Dr<br />
To Invoice Accruals<br />
<br />
The question whether this entry is reversed and an other entry passed when approvals are maintained and there is no rejectionof items.<br />
<br />

<br />
But I have seen sites wherein this doesnt happen. In other words the original receipt is not reversed if there is no rejection. Is this dependent on any parameter ?<br />

<br />
The session that creates the receipt will vary, depending on whether Location Control is turned on, and/or whether <br />
the goods must be inspected.  Here's the breakdown:<br />
<br />
No ILC or inspection:  session tdpur4120m000 (Maintain Receipts) will cause the Purchase Receipt transaction to occur.<br />
<br />
No ILC, but inspection required:  session tdpur4121m000 (Maintain Approvals) will cause the Purchase Receipt transaction to occur.<br />
<br />
ILC on, no inspection:  session tdilc4113s000 (Maintain Receipts) will cause the Purchase Receipt transaction to occur.<br />
<br />
ILC on, inspection required:  session tdilc4123s000 (Maintain Approvals) will cause the Purchase receipt transaction to occur.<br />
<br />
I have seen the original receipt transaction be reversed and re-entered only when the Change Prices/Discounts after &quot;Maintain Receipts&quot; session has been run (tdpur4122m000)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

<br />
I had a feedback frm the site where the transactions are duplicated i.e original receipt transactions are reversed and fresh receipt transactions are posted on approval (even though complete quantity received is approved). <br />
<br />
The feedback is that this is due to the compression parameter in the integration parameters (tfgld4150m000).  I am still trying to find out the effect of this parameters on receipt entries in integration.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure if I can add to the previous informative answers. So before I do, can you explain what you are trying to resolve, or objective you are wanting to acheive, as this may have a bearing on what answer you need.<br />
<br />
P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sai_krishna</div><div class="date">12th July 2003, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
The objective is to find out the parameter / setting that triggers reversal of purchase receipt and posting of fresh receipt transactions on approval even though ther is no rejection of material.<br />
<br />
This has an impact on the size of tfgld410 and other integration tables since for each purchase receipt line four additional records are added to this table.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Sai Krishna</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">14th July 2003, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
The trigger point will vary depending on how the parameters are set up for the business type etc. Also wether you have a cost item or purchase item etc.<br />
<br />
In our system for example purchase items are put into stock and consumed by warehouse issue. <br />
<br />
On receipt<br />
Debit: Stock<br />
Credit: GRNI a/c<br />
On stock issue<br />
Debit: Cost of sales<br />
Credit: Stock<br />
<br />
Registering the invoice posts the transactions onto the balance sheet Approving the invoice moves the postings on the balance sheet but also completes the transactions <br />
<br />
 On registering<br />
Debit: Invoices registered<br />
Credit:Creditor a/c<br />
 On approval<br />
Credit: Invoices registered<br />
Debit: GRNI a/c<br />
<br />
As you can see in our set-up there are only three integration transactions (although multi posting within that)<br />
<br />
Cost items are expensed at receipt and reversal only happens  on approving.<br />
<br />
Try following a couple of examples from order to approval you should be able to pin point the triggers for the reversals etc.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps or at least points you in the right direction.<br />
<br />
