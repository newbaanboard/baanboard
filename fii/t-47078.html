Also maintain posting data depending on your payment method configuration.</div></div><hr />

To rectify the error, you need to maintain a record in 'Data by Ban/Payment Methods' session for the bank and payment method combination. Also maintain posting data depending on your payment method configuration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sk28756</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 02:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Maintain a record for the bank and payment method in the session tfcmg0145m000. Payment Method is where you set different payment options such as cheque, report type, etc. This can be used for one or several banks, which you will do in tfcmg0145m000. This combination can then be used for automatic payments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sk28756</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 07:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Pl note that I am trying to rectify your error message - &quot;Combination of bank relation and payment method not found&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sk28756</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 08:13</div></div><div class="posttext">After that, in tfcmg2115m000, for the same combination of bank and payment method, define a range of cheques. Default status is 'Not used'. Then, create a transaction in tfcmg1120m000. Execute tfcmg1240m000 for that payment batch number. Once you reach tfcmg1260m000, there is a button 'Test Print'. Click on this and you may see the output. Cheque status is now changed to 'Test Print'. You may use another cheque for Real print, when you are satisfied.<br />
<br />
You may use a dummy bank and payment method also to create test cheques.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sometimes back I had the same problem so I generated a session to reprint checks as many times as I liked. I attach the script for this session. All you have to do is:<br />
<br />
 Generate a Print Session in package tf.<br />
 Put only one input field &quot;Supplier&quot; on the form.<br />
 Replace session script with the one here.<br />
 Add your check report to the session<br />
 Change the script as needed.<br />
 Press continue.  :)</div></div><hr />
