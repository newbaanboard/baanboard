<br />
Our company is dealing with Consumable food items<br />
we are getting small amounts from various out let on daily basis and that we are putting as advance/unallocate <br />
Then the invoice is made may be equal ,less ,or more also<br />
to allocate individually is becoming big task and is any solution that we can<br />
allocate the same automatic by last invoice fist payment (lifo)<br />
either AFS or any other standard method<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

In such scenario, AFS is the only thing that would be of use to you.</div></div><hr />

It is not single invoice per day ,there are many small invoices for cash customers and payment also many..same in some case <br />
The user is allocating invoice by  receipt...</div></div><hr />

<br />
if there are multiple invoices and multiple reciepts, the best possible solution will be the AFS from staging table where there is already a link of receipt and the invoice.</div></div><hr />
