The answers to the questions you are asking are very long and detailed.  Where are you located?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cps123</div><div class="date">8th September 2006, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm located in Malaysia and familiar with MK (Manufacturing Knowledge) before which heard that it is similar to Baan 4. <br />
<br />
I have go through the documents briefly before but it is totally new to me as i have no idea at all about what are all the element group and reconciliation group. I can see the integration documents but based on the integration documents, i can't visualise how can i setup for the following scenario:-<br />
<br />
i.e.) For item group 1 (Purchase) - Dr RawMat 1     Cr Clearing 2<br />
       For item group xx2 (Purchase) - Dr RawMat 2         Cr Clearing 3<br />
<br />
i.e)  For FG group 1  (SALES)       Dr COS-FG1      Cr Sales<br />
      For FG group 2  (SALES)       Dr COS-FG2      Cr Sales<br />
<br />
But the main critical question over here is that can i configure the system so that logistic don't need to link to finance but i can print and generate the sales invoice in Central Invoicing?</div></div><hr />
