<br />
When we do enter a supplier invoice (thru session Maintain Transactions) and &quot;match &amp; approve&quot; with Purchase receipt, does the system store the linking (invoice document no. with purchase receipt no.) in any of the tables? If yes, what is/are the table(s)? Is there any display/print session which can give me the receipt nos. which an invoice document has linked? We have checked in tdpur045, tfacp200, tfgld106, tfgld102. Could not find in any of them.<br />
We are on Baan IV c4, IN5.<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Warm Regards<br />
Manu</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, tdpur046 has the invoice number line to a purchase order line.  You will have to take this info to look at tdpur045 if you want the actual reciept number</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanfin</div><div class="date">17th July 2002, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The receipt link to invoice is stored in tdpur046, tdpur045 also has the receipt links and the flag which shows if the receipt line has been matched with the invoice.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps !</div></div><hr />

You can also try the Baan GRINYA solution.  This is an additional solution that may or may not be loaded on your system (depending on how up to date you are with patches, etc.).  The nice thing about this solution is that it allows you to see the transactional flow of a purchase receipt from logistics to finance.  It also allows you to see where you have differences in orders, creating an imbalance between finance and logistics.<br />
<br />
Baan really listened to their customers on this solution.  Moreover, they keep improving with the suggestions they get from the customers using the GRINYA solution.<br />

<br />
Also can see the links in standard (non-GRINYA) Baan under AP reports. <br />
<br />
I'm not in front of a menu browser but I believe it's Accounts Payable / Transaction Processing / Reports / Print Purchase Invoices (tfacp2421m000). <br />
<br />
The report has an option to include paid invoices (Yes/No). Like lots of older Baan it's not exactly what it promises. &quot;Yes&quot; just adds the approval invoice number(s) below each purchase receipt line. The standard report has PO# and Line # but does not have the PUR receipt number. Since the report already draws data from pur045 and pur046, however, I remember that Receipt # was quite easy to add.<br />

Oops! My error. I think the report name is Print Purchase Receipts. It is an acp report and I think the menu path I gave is correct but I don't think it's acp2421m000. (I'm still not on line so I won't try to requote the correct session #.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">28th August 2002, 07:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is &quot;Print Purchase Receipts&quot; (tfacp1430m000) and you can get the related invoice nos by specifying &quot;Print Matched Invoices&quot; as &quot;Yes&quot; on the form.<br />
BTW, thanks a lot for all your help. I just needed the info about table tdpur046.<br />
