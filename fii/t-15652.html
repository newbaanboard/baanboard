<br />
We have a two Business Partners.  One set up as a customer and the other<br />
as a supplier.  In reality this is one and the same Business Partner.<br />
<br />
The Business Partner now wants us to offset their sales invoices against the<br />
purchase invoices when we issue payment.  The payment is raised through the Cash Management module under Supplier Payments.<br />
<br />
Is there a way that we can do this?</div></div><hr />

In Baan V I'm not sure if the procedures are the same...but in Baan IV in session tfcmg1220m000 you should choose &quot;Yes&quot; in the field &quot;settle sales invoices&quot; and the system would select a net amount to be paid deducting from all purchase invoices amounts selected the amounts of the sales invoices dued...<br />
Hope this will help.<br />
