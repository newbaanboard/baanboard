<br />
I have a problem where the reciept document for a sales invoice is showing the wrong Euro Rate(should be 1 as HC is Euro) this only applies a discount amount is entered on the cash receipt document<br />
<br />
<br />
let me give you an example :<br />
<br />
sales invoice = 1,850.88 Eur<br />
Normal Receipt = 1813.90 Eur<br />
Discount = 36.98 Eur<br />
<br />
However when you look in gld106 for the receipt document the discount line is showing a Euro rate of 2.58 making the the HC amount 95.41 which is wrong. One of the main problems is replicating this problem so far I am unable to do so. baan solution 77459 has already been installed some time ago and these problems still occur on the odd occasion. Has anyone come across this one before??<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
