The object or intentions of external references in tables is to do at least two things.<br />
<br />
a) To prove that the field value that you provided exists in the referred to table, ensuring that the field is known (validation). For example, a reference to warehouse table (cwar).  <br />
<br />
The reference has to be to a unique key in the external table.  But your reference may be part of a combined key, where the individual items may be duplicates, but the combination is unique, and the referred to table may accept the combined field for synchronization.<br />
<br />
b) The second reason for a reference field is that information that is not pertenant to the initial intent can be stored im this referred to table . For Cwar, it's contains it's description and some other properties.<br />
<br />
I do hope that I have reponded to your question appropriately. If I answered the wrong question (perhaps I didn't understand your question), send me an email.<br />

<br />
Sessions Mainatain Sales Invoices tfacr1110s000 and Maintain Bank Transactions tfcmg2100s000 have a reference field in the session so the user can input it manually. It is then stored in tables tfcmg204.refr and tfacr200.refr respectively before being transferred to tfgld106.<br />
<br />
In other areas of our system it is blank for Supply Chain Sales Invoices generated by Print Sales Invoices tdsls4404m000 and for our Purchase Invoices entered by tfacp1110s000 the refr field is set to the name of the supplier but I can't quite work out why.<br />

<br />
The reference field you were referring to is the one in finance, and from a business situation, it is a business reference code that you may put in.<br />
<br />
The one I was referring to was that as defined in the definition of Baan tables.<br />
<br />
I was right, wasn't I, I answered the right question about the wrong &quot;referrence&quot;!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">4th March 2002, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you are right - but thanks for trying.<br />
<br />
In Baan 5c, the ACP200 field for  P.O. Number is not populated (from Baan support - yes this is really true), so I was wondering if we could automatically populate this value in the reference field.<br />
I was hoping there was some way to configure this.<br />
In the G/L you get quite a good reference generated for integration transactions - I don't know if this is changeable either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the problem Baan faced with populating PO # in ACP200 is that a supplier invoice can legitimately be matched, approved, paid against more than one Purchase Order.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">5th March 2002, 00:00</div></div><div class="posttext">another reason why it probably shouldn't have the PO number automatically populate is that this table also contains records for cost invoices, credits etc. that are not related to PO's, so this is more of a user defined field, which is probably better so that you can enter a reference as needed. For example, if it is a credit invoice, perhaps you want to enter in a reference such as &quot;credit for returned goods&quot; or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">5th March 2002, 00:28</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not quite it.<br />
I agree that the reference field should be free-form, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to default an entry. I was wondering how to default something (looks like I can't).<br />
In terms of things like P.O. number and Project, the frustrating thing is that Baan provides the fields in the tables (ACR200, ACP200) and also allows you to choose them for statements - but they don't work.<br />
I also understand the reasons that might give you more than one P.O. per invoice etc - the logic should be to populate the field if there is only one, otherwise it is &quot;various&quot;.</div></div><hr />
