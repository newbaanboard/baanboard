<br />
We have a problem after activation of &quot;Receipt Schedule&quot;, the Receipt schedule was not activated at the initial setup and its just activated in last days. Every thing is going well and no problem as such except one. As soon as we try to edit the transaction from the session transaction (tfgld1101m000) for the transaction type AR0 (Doubtful debouters), we got the message &quot;The paramter receipt schedule is activate, so cannot start the session&quot;.<br />
<br />
I checked the program script found that this session can only be run if the receipt schedule paramter is not active and there should be some other session should be used for schedule lines, the comments is wrriten in the program scripts as follows:<br />
<br />
If the requirement Receipt Schedule is activated then this session is<br />
not accessible. Instead a new session Set as doubtful schedule lines is used.<br />
<br />
How we can fix this problem and which session should be used? please mention the session number.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
