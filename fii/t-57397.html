<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">10th December 2009, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">We have some problem like,   Producion (INV)  issues  transactions  are not getting posted to Finance integration tables (Not exist in tfgld410, 416, 418 etc).   All other transactions  related to inventory trasactions are getting  posted except   Production(INV)  issues  which are entered  through  &quot;Enter inventory transaction by item&quot;.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly the same type transactions are not having any problem with test company which is copy of original company.  Also we have compared all the integration parameters of both the company and found no difference.  <br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnbhatt</div><div class="date">11th December 2009, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Is tfgld415 having the said integration transaction combination?<br />
<br />
It seems to be a technical issue. This could be due to problem with table defination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">12th December 2009, 07:05</div></div><div class="posttext">tfgld415 is empty..<br />
<br />
It could not be problem with table definition as there is a test company with the same package combination working fine without any problem and also all other trasactions are getting posted to finance  except  &quot;Production (INV) Issues&quot;  Entry.<br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ks_ks_</div><div class="date">12th December 2009, 08:05</div></div><div class="posttext">can you check the maping schene for finance integration; you can try and compare the table values of test company and production company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">12th December 2009, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Following are the steps<br />
<br />
1. Took sequential dump of  tfgld410<br />
2. Delete tfgld410 table<br />
3. Create tfgld410 table again<br />
4. Create tables from seq. dump (saved earlier)<br />
5. Production (INV) Issues transactions are getting posted to finance.<br />
6. Old entries are not in finance as we put JV's to adjust in finance level.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
