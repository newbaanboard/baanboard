Is there any workaround for use of check master without going thru CMG module? I wish to assign Check no. in the session tfcmg2100s000(Maintain Bank Transactions).<br />
<br />
Q.2. Again without going thru CMG how can I set off same Supplier and customer balances? I know the settings to be done in supplier/customer master data and the CMG parameters while using CMG.<br />

Thanks<br />

I do not want to avoid CMG. I am using it and I have no problem. But still would like to know if it is possible and if so how???<br />

<br />
Any bank/cash transaction invariably goes through CMG sessions.  But I suppose your question was whether it is possible to make cheque payments without going through payment advise route.  It is possible.<br />
<br />
You can do it in session &quot;maintain trasaction&quot;, using the anticipated transaction type (the same transaction type which you have specified for the payment method in the CMG setup).<br />
<br />
When you use this transaction type in the session &quot;maintain transactions&quot;, it will take you to session maintain anticipated payments, where you need to give the same details as you give in payment advice.  With this, the system will generate an anticipated transaction as usual, and the check master will also get updated to this effect.  You can subsequently reconcile the payment also.<br />
<br />
But, the system does not generate the payment advice or a payment batch number.  Hence, you will not be able to get various CMG reports/displays which are based upon these.  Again, you won't get cheque printing, remittance letter etc., which if you use &quot;maintain transaction&quot; route.  That's why, it is better to use payment advise route only.<br />
