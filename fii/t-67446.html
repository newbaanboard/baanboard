First you will book the invoice of Rs.6,000 and match it to PO. Later when you book the second invoice of Rs.4,000 in the same batch, it should show PO amount of Rs.4,000 available for matching.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katiekelley</div><div class="date">31st March 2015, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you do the first one as a partial or complete match.  If it was complete then that is why since it put the balance to a variance account thinking you would not be getting it.  As long as you didn't approve any of these lines you can go back in and unmatch the first one and then do it again.<br />
