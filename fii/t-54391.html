<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czrdyx</div><div class="date">27th November 2008, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
  Please help me out for below confusion.<br />
  Error &quot;Cannot define ledger account (tdinv850)&quot; appears when I posted integration. After I check it by &quot;Display Integration Transactions by Project/Order &quot;,I find that there's a new warehouse used which is for WIP of one of our project. Based on the information showed in the error shot such as transaction origin-warehouse order &amp; financial transaction-inventory adjustment, I insert new one setting Dr as WIP and Cr as scrap cost in “Maintain Inventory and WIP Transaction Accounts”, then the problem is fixed. But while I check the finalized JV, I find the entry is not inventory adjustment to scrap yet other kind of inventory adjustment.<br />
  As far as I am concerned, the session “Maintain Inventory and WIP Transaction Accounts” should be the bridge to map the transaction event and financial result, so, why the integration can be posted although I set other ledger accounts? What role on earth it play in the integration process? What kind of account for Dr/Cr should be if the transaction is inventory transfer? Should we consider it is inventory issue or inventory receipt?<br />
  Many thanks!<br />
