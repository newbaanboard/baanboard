Normally people run this at the month end . Also if people want to know impact of all that is being entered by users on his/her trial balance (ie non-finalized trx) , u should have update mode set to realtime or end of session in tflgd0111m000 .  For knowing the impact of integration trx immediately the real time posting in tfgld4150m000 should be set to yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your feedback, the session which you have mentioned are actually used for re-building the ledger accounts balances w.r.t. opening balance and subsequent transactions.<br />
But my main question is , to understand the Trial balance, and how to make trial balance more authentic.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Hi Deepak,<br />
<br />
If understanding trial balance means showing in differrent ways , thats more reporting than functional . U need to use tfgld201-6 tables to present it in a manners they wish . If it means understanding it literally , they must need finance knowledge!<br />
<br />
The rebuild sessions are in fact there to make trial balance authentic only . They correct wrong TB figures . So u may use those rebuild sessions to make it authentic .</div></div><hr />
