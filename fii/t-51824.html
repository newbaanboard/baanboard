<br />
We have booked the purchase bill against 0 purchase order (as we have match the differnt receipts) and simultaneously we have approved the invoice though difference of 1000 was still to be entered.<br />
<br />
Now we are trying to reverse that document the system show &quot;Still transanctions are to be entered. Approval not allowed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell us how we can reverse this document to that we can enter the difference amount in the same bill no.<br />
<br />
BY GTM or front end<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
