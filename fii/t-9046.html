I wanna change the A/R control a/c for a particluar business patrner group. <br />
It has some balance so the field is disabled. I have tried nullifying the a/c balance by posting a sales credit note but still the a/c is disabled ... <br />
There are not any non finalised transactions either ..<br />
Can any body help ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may also want/need to remove fully paid sales invoices. I don't know if this is a requirement in V.<br />
<br />
Also not sure whether you'll have problems if there are any open backorders or any orders that have been processed through the Maintain Deliveries step but have not yet been invoiced. &quot;Logic&quot; says that those should not prevent you from changing the control account, but perhaps someone who has done this (or has looked at the script) can comment.<br />
