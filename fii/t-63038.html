WE have one sales order but added a line after the first line of the sales order had been invoiced <br />
(e.g. on inv# 12345) and now we realise that there should have been a second line on that order, so it was added but of course it leads to a new invoice#. (e.g. on inv# 12346) Can I change the tables to get both lines on one invoice after the two invoices have been printed?<br />

If the invoice is only printed and PDSO is not done. May be you can Check tables tdsls41, tdsls045 &amp; PDSO tables. Make sure the invoice date and times match for both order lines. Change the document status of 2nd invoice to deleted. Try this in a test environment first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Printed : baanravi has already advised<br />
If Posted : you ll need to make changes to a lot of tables like tfgld106, tfacr200 etc and then run Rebuild History in GL, Rebuild Opening Balance for Customer, etc<br />
<br />
Better would be, to create a return sales order, generate a Credit Note to nullify the existing two invoices, and then later create correct sales order lines and invoice to get a single Invoice.. :)<br />
<br />
Hope it helps..<br />
