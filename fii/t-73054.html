<br />
Payment difference writeoff entry Transaction type category is a purchase correction. <br />
<br />
The Transaction type which you used to write-off payment you can use the same Transaction type to reverse the entry from Maintain transactions - tfgld1101m000.<br />
Find the invoice and see if you can modify the amount, if you are able to change the amount system will ask you to enter the GL account use the Same payment difference GL which was triggered in the previous document.<br />
<br />
If there are are any other linked documents such as assignments, payments present against the invoice this procedure will not work.</div></div><hr />
