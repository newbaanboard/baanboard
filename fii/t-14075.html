<br />
I have a problem with a cost revaluation.<br />
<br />
I sold a product whose cost was $100, I ran a cost update and it turned out a new cost of $120. After the invoiced was issued, the cost of goods sold integration was for $120.<br />
<br />
This means there is a difference between the integrations of CGS and the outbound. There should be an additional integration for the revaluation. <br />
<br />
According to Baan's Help, the revaluation integrations are generated automatically only when you maintain the outbound or when you actually generate the outbound.<br />
<br />
If this holds true, it would mean that all invoices should be printed before the cost is updated.<br />
<br />
any comments?</div></div><hr />

Sales/revaluation is generated at the time sales delivery if the last update cost price is different from the cost price at the delivery level.<br />
<br />
The reason is warehouse / revaluation is already passed for all inventory in warehouse at the time the cost price is changed.</div></div><hr />
