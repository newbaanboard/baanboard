<br />
unfortunately NOT.<br />
That's an old requirement of mine on Baan/SSA/Infor.<br />
Original Quote Support:<br />
'The implications on reversing the release to invoice step are too complex!'<br />
<br />
So only chance is to place a return order and match the original Invoice with the credit note.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

What about Cancel in Central Invoicing which have &quot;on Hold status&quot;?<br />
Can we do it, how ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andreas</div><div class="date">10th July 2008, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
afaik there is no way to cancel the Invoice(cisli205) or Invoice Position(s)(cisli245) in a regular way.<br />
If you leave the status 'on hold' then these positions were never composed, but there is a high risk that they were confirmed 'by accident'. (and afterwards composed, printed and posted).<br />
As internally there is a status cancelled you can try to set it via GTM.<br />
But i don't know the implications about that. There is a field 'open Billing Request amount' in tccom113 which relies on the stati in cisli !!!<br />
<br />
So i would advise you to take the above mentioned steps.<br />
