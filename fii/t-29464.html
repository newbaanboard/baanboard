<br />
France has additional requirements for Finance (ex: a third financial option in addition to Debit and Credit, etc...) and many companies need to use external packages for Finance.<br />
<br />
Are these finance functionalities included in SSA ERP-Ln or another version of Baan (Baan IV or Baan-ERP)?</div></div><hr />
