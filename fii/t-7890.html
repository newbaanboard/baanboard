<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kotharu Narayan</div><div class="date">1st December 2002, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have about 40 Item groups for which I need to record Inventory Adjustment transactions. To do so I need to enter in tdinv8150m000 for the TT Warehouse Order &amp; FT Inventory Adjustments, Item groups wise which is time consuming &amp; cumbersome. Also the Item Groups may increase in future. Is this the only way to do so?<br />
<br />
I tried to create a work around where in I grouped these Item Groups as CPC(Cost Price Component) like RM, FG, Consumables etc... and linked them in tittm0101m000 for the respective items falling under each Item Groups. In tdinv8150m000 I linked the CPC to the ledger accounts. When I post the integration transactions the system is not posting as per the setting made in tdinv8150m000. There is no error log created.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something or the work around is not workable this way? Any other way to record the above transactions without entering Item group wise in tdinv8150m000?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">1st December 2002, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you will have to use item groups, since the integrations transactions for standard items are created for each cost price component in the structure if e.g. a finished goods item. Therefore the postings will not be done with the CPC of the finished goods, but with all the CPC of the purchase items in the BOM structure of that finished good. <br />
<br />
If possible, try to reduce the number of item groups. As a rule of thumb, item groups should be set up according to the integration requirements.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a bit <br />

<br />
I agree with Uli - you need to integrate by item group.  Also, he is correct regarding the integrations looking at the all of the CPC's that make up the item (BOM and route), not the one that is carried on the item in session tiitm0101m000.  Please note that this also holds true for other integration transaction types.<br />
