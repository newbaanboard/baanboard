<br />
I am thinking about a concept to migrate open production orders from an old system to Infor LN.<br />
<br />
In fact the production process is started in the old system. So material is issued and operation costs are posted - maybe some subcontracting also.<br />
<br />
So there is a financial WIP posted in the old system where there is typically a debit balance.<br />
<br />
These open production orders must be migrated to Infor LN. Does anybody know how this is typically done and how must the WIP value be considered? <br />
<br />
My focus is not on the technical handling but goes more into the direction of closing the production order in Infor LN and the impact in the accounting.<br />
<br />
Is there a good strategy?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />
