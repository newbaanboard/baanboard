<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">M_Kotb</div><div class="date">25th June 2010, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">in my company we are using standard costing system, all costs of our products are based on Bill of Material and routing.<br />
<br />
the industry we are working in is rapidly changing so our engineers are always changing the bill of material, and as a result for that our inventory valuation is changing and we get revaluation amount in our ledgers which is equal to (old inventory value - new inventory value)<br />
<br />
is there any solution for this? when i re calculate the cost after production pepole changes the bill of material there is one option to actualize the inventory, what will happen if i didn't select this opption.<br />
<br />
please if any one knows or has any documents for this please help me.</div></div><hr />

In finance and as business required it is nothing worng to account difference in inventory value. <br />
<br />
To give effects of such valuation chnage and generate financial transaction for the same it is required to actualize inventory valuation.</div></div><hr />
