At the conclusion of running this session I received a report showing the expected financial transaction.<br />
<br />
However, when I go to finalize the batch that was created it does not appear in &quot;Maintain Transactions&quot;.  After looking at the batch status within General Table Maintenance I noticed the batch status was &quot;Non-Modifiable&quot;.  <br />
<br />
If I understand the process correctly I need to finalize this batch before I  (1) Finally Close Period 12 and (2)  Execute the &quot;Close Year&quot; process.<br />
<br />
Can someone shed some light as to what I am missing and / or doing incorrectly?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Automatic balancing entry is a system generated entry and you can not modify it.  Thatz why the status 'non-modifiable'  and thatz why it is not available in session &quot;Maintain transaction&quot;  If your process of automatic balancing is thru. and there is no error on this, all you have to do is just finalize the batch thru. the session &quot;select batches for finalization&quot;  This will allow you to finally close the period and subsequently the year also<br />
<br />
Hope this throws light on the issue.<br />
