<br />
<br />
How I can post project cogs to finance with the periods the actual cost occurs?<br />
<br />
With more detail description:<br />
<br />
Project  (PSC module)<br />
<br />
Period 1.<br />
Hours are registered<br />
Materials A are registered<br />
<br />
Period 2<br />
Invoice is registered (with fiscal period 1)<br />
Materials B are registered<br />
<br />
I need to post all these cost to cogs but with different fiscal periods.<br />
<br />
Hours and materials A to period 1, invoice to period 1, materials B to period 2.<br />
Project is our &quot;cost&quot; project - no sales order will be recorded on it.<br />
Is it possible to do this in a simple way? Maybe some combination of Project settings?<br />
Any help will be appreciated<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Anna</div></div><hr />

<br />
BaaN provides a way to create projects that are not for sales, by setting the Internal Project field on form 2 in the Maintain Projects session set to Yes.  <br />
<br />
We use this fuction to handle our &quot;cost&quot; projects.  By setting this field to Yes, the system knows that no sales invoice is to be generated, and also, no PCS Cost integrations will occur when the project closes.  You will need to set up integrations specifically for the project number, debiting the appropriate ledger account that you wish to charge instead of WIP.  The charges will then post to your designated ledger account in the periods as they occur. Once the project closes, you can delete the integration setup.  It is a bit of work, but it functions well.  <br />
<br />
If your cost project already exists (set to No) and has transactions posted to it, you may not be able to change the setting, but this should help you with any new &quot;cost&quot; projects that you may have in the future.<br />
