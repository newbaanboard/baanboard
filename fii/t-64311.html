If you have previous backups of $BSE i.e. Application Backup, you can restore the object files and report files. If this report is customized, you can ask the developer to check it because without the exact identification of the problem, it will be difficult for anyone to help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">20th July 2013, 09:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to have a downtime for that. Just copy $BSE folder and store it at a safe place. Also, take the Database backup at regular interval. <br />
<br />
We have set a scheduler, which runs every night and copies the $BSE folder as well as takes the database backups and stores it at different locations.<br />
<br />
To restore it, just replace the $BSE folder with the folder you backed up and database restoring comes with the standard Database Packages like we have SQL Server 2008 which provides a restore option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The BSE folder is located on the installation directory. In our case, we have a path like:-<br />
<br />
D:\Infor\FP7LN\BSE. If you use worktop, you can find the path in the configuration file.<br />
<br />
If you have access to the Server, just try to find BSE using standard search.</div></div><hr />
