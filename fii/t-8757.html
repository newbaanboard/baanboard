<br />
Can anyone tell me how the Customer Control Checklist works? which tables is it comparing? is it gld106 to acr200?<br />
<br />
The problem I have is when this is run I am getting several invoices on the report which show finalised amount 0.01- and closing balance of 0.01- while the open item bal. is 0<br />
<br />
Having checked the the sales invoice the 0 balance is correct yet the control account is showing 0.01- why????<br />
<br />
thanks for any help you can give me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">the checklist looks at tfgld106 and tfgld102 and compares the data in these tables to tfacr200.  If there are any differences it will show the transaction which is causing the problem.  a 1c difference could be a rounding problem.  You will have to check the transactions carefully to find this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can be that this account shows one cent left,<br />
maybe you can try to run write off payment difference of<br />
write off currency differences. You can run both sessions with print only. The output can be checked, in order if the same documents appear<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you<br />

<br />
One cent is probably due to rounding differences which were not done exactly the same in GLD as in ACR.<br />
I think that they should not bother you and you can leave them as is.<br />
<br />
If you ensist on fixing them you should find the problematic document and fix it either in ACR or GLD.<br />
<br />
You should really know what you are doing !!!!<br />
<br />
The fix in GLD will usually be in a line with the account that is not ballanced in the report against a line for rounding difference account.<br />
If the fixed document is allready finalized, it means you have to fix table tfgld106 and thanyou will have to run rebuild balances from transactions.<br />
Than you have a problem if the period is already closed and used for reporting purposes.<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend not to bother with 1 cent diff.<br />
<br />
If it happens many times you may check with BaaN and get a basic fix for the program that causes the problem.<br />
