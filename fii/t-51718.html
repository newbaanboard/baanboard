<br />
I am planning to set up EBS in CMG, the only confusion is about making the master set up.<br />
I think I am commiting some mistake in the set up, because When I am trying to run the session &quot;tfcmg5202m000 - Convert Electronic Bank Statements&quot; system is giving error &quot;File is not in Good Format&quot; and &quot;No Proper data found for Conversion&quot;<br />
<br />
My Query is how we are defining the master in session &quot;Record types for electronic bank Statements&quot; What is the exact meaning of &quot;Record type Value&quot; in this session. <br />
<br />
Thanking you in Advance<br />
Jagdish</div></div><hr />

You need to make sure that you have defined the records and that they are in the correct format.  Look at the attachment and see if it helps.</div></div><hr />

The EBS does not work on a CSV file.  It works on a space delimited prn file.  Each record in the file must be a specific number of characters.  Every field must be in the exact same place.  I create the file we use in Excel.  Each column is a specific width equal to the characters in the field.  All numeric fields must be left filled with zeros.  When I save the file I save it as a space delimited prn, which saves it exactly as formated.<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

As record delimiter.. you might have specified in first column something like 'x' and in last column 'y'. Between these two columns your data will be there.<br />
Hence, with this biferacation system knows a new record.<br />
