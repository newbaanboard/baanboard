<br />
User is attempting to tidy up CRE (12- Unallocated Antcipated) records from customer account M013. <br />
<br />
Customer statement reads CRE 50000003 Amount open 2020-<br />
                         CRE 50000005 Amount open 2020<br />
                         CRE 50000006 Amount open 130644.83-<br />
                         CRE 50000012 Amount open 130644.83<br />
<br />
User has created a CBR transaction type which calls session tfcmg2121s000 - Reconcillation of Anticipated Payments / Receipts and selected Customer Reconciallation. User then chooses Automatic Reconcillation option which calls session tfcmg2121s000 - Select for Automatic Customer Reconcialltion range of documents is selected and user continues.Session tfcmg2123s000 - Selection for Automatic Reconcillation is called and the user selects the records shown above and continues.<br />
<br />
Batch is then finalised and the customer statements then reads<br />
CBR 50000096 Amount open 130644.83-<br />
CBR 50000096 Amount open 130644.83<br />
CBR 50000097 Amount open 2020-<br />
<br />
So instead of tidying up the account we now have a different set of open items but more worringly the account is now out of balance as a value of 2020 has gone missing during the process.<br />
<br />
So in summary we need to make the account balance again and also finalise a procedure whereby we can remove balanced cash transactions from customer statements which is what the user has unsuccessfully attempted.<br />
<br />
I have attached journal report.<br />
<br />
Can anybody out there assist.<br />

<br />
You'll have to look at the ledger to see where the other amount of 2020 has gone.   If the batch balanced then I'm not sure where the problem can be.  Maybe reprint your Journal Report and print the one which shows all transactions and not just the totals.  Also check in tfacr200 to see if there are any transactions against the CRE and what the anticapated status of that document is.<br />
<br />
As for the clearing........you're saying that these are unnallocated/anticipated receipts.  As far as I know the recon will not remove these values from the statement, it only changes the status of the anticipated document to paid.   To clear the douments from your statement completely you'll have to actually allocate these documents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking at the journal report and the records in tfgld106 everything appears to be OK as the number of transactions and their types match up for the 130644.83 and 2020 amounts.<br />
<br />
The problem appears to in the tfacr200 table where there is no record for the +2020 transaction.<br />
<br />
I suspect I may have to be add this via GTM but I'll wait for the support to tell me this.<br />
<br />
As the documents balance can we allocate these without any effect on the accounts in question ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
