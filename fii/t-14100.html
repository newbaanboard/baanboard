<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tap268</div><div class="date">5th January 2004, 23:56</div></div><div class="posttext">On the Customer Aging - the original invoice is 703.40.  Someone has continued to post credits against this invoice for a total of 1406.80.  How do we write this payment difference off?<br />
<br />
We have already tried using session tfacr2240m000, but it will not let us.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">6th January 2004, 08:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Just recalculate balances (tfacr2245m000)  for this customer . It will do nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
If the sales corrections / credit notes are not finalized , find the batch number from tfgld1504m0000 and delete the non-filized document in tfgld1101m000 if possible.<br />
<br />
Sales corrections may not be deleted . It can only be reversed. So in case of sales correction pass another sales correction to reverse the wrong debit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tap268</div><div class="date">6th January 2004, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The balance is correct.  They were posted to this customer and invoice in error.  We want to write off the difference.  Because tfacr2240m000 - &quot;Write Off Payment Difference&quot; will not let you exceed the original invoice amount, we can not do it through this session.  Any ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isabouri</div><div class="date">6th January 2004, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">What I usually do with this is use a couple of bank transactions.<br />
<br />
1- Do a negative cash entry to bring the invoice balance back to zero (that will create an inbalance in your cash account)<br />
<br />
2- Do a cash entry of type &quot;Journal&quot; to your payment difference account (that will restate your cash to its correct amount)<br />
<br />
You should all be squared now<br />
<br />
I hope this helps<br />
