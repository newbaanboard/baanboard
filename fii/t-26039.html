<br />
I am new in Finance area of Baan and want to know &amp; discuss about the concept of multiple finance companies in Baan. I went through the document &quot;Multisite concept&quot; but not get much more what I need. <br />
<br />
Actually, our requirement is to establish multiple finance companies which have the same acounting model, one handles the transaction at the lower level of the chart-of-account and the other get the result of transactions at the summery level. The second company should not have the detail of transactions which are made at the lower level in the first company.<br />
<br />
For example expense head, the second company should display only the total expese amount at higher level, and the first comapny display the detail of transactions in expense head at the lower level.<br />
<br />
I will appeciate all ideas and discussion.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Are you dealing with different legal entities, or are you thinking about different (Baan) Finance-Companies within 1 legal entity?<br />
<br />
Usually, in a Finance Multisite Environment every Finance-Company represent a different legal entity. Therefore, in principle it is possible, to book transactions from one company to another within the same &quot;Group of Companies&quot;. But there is no standard functionality to &quot;condense&quot; and transfer transactions to another  company. Also, if you have different legal entities, usually you are not allowed to book the same issue twice, even the second booking is a &quot;condensed&quot; one.<br />
<br />
best regards</div></div><hr />

Think multi-site is not the right solution for this purpose . Probably in the same company using sublevels u should be able to accomplish the objective.</div></div><hr />

We are interested to take the transaction information from one company to other as summary. Is there any possibilty that we can take only the sum of the transactions amount at the higher level of chart of account and not the actual transaction information at lower level of chart of account?<br />

<br />
in a multi fin. enviroment you can quite easyly achieve what you describe. Since tfgld106 is not shared the details can only be seen in the respective legal entity but once you do share tfgld201ff and all companies do use the same group company you can have the summary on the consolidation company.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eric12</div><div class="date">13th January 2006, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you should describe in details how you want the transactions to be booked in the respective companies.<br />
That would reduce the amount of guessing what you might want.<br />
Baan V has a number of different ways of handling your issue.<br />
<br />
Apart from that:<br />
If your only problem is expense handling, maybe switching to multisite is overkill. If you have common logisitic needs, multisite is very relevant, but it is not something you just turn on after having read the mulitsite manual.<br />
<br />
Q: Do you allready have a multisite environment?<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

Hi MRF,<br />
<br />
To make a really long story short: Not in Standard!  <br />
<br />
But, this doesnÂ´t mean, that there is no solution, but probably it would be helpfull to go one step back: <br />
<br />
What target is to achieve, which legal requirements are there, do we talk about different legal entities or is it a &quot;internal&quot; problem in one legal company, etc. etc. <br />
If you want anyone from us to give you a helpfull hint, than we first have to understand the problem. For example: It is standard functionality in Baan to have intercompany transactions. What exactly is the reason for being unsatiesfied with this functionality? Number of (automatic)transactions? Need to hide informations?, anything else? <br />
<br />
