<br />
Currently I am trying to reconcile A/P control Balance (from Control Account Checklist, tfacp2415) with Supplier aging summary, tfacp3425) and the two are significantly off.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">venkat500</div><div class="date">13th August 2002, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">you are looking at the right sessions for the reconciliation.<br />
<br />
from my experience i can say that the gld figures should be taken as the base for corrections.<br />
<br />
the errors are generally in the assignment type of transactions in the tfacp / acr 200 tables.<br />
<br />
also the checklist report may show some errors even if everthing is alright. for ex. changing the FSG, FCG and hence the discrepancy in the report.<br />
<br />
try to mirror the gld entries in tfacp / acr 200 tables.<br />
<br />
then you can run rebuild supplier / customer balances session to correct the open amounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I reran my earlier reports and nothing changed.<br />
<br />
What do you mean by &quot;the errors are generally in the assignment type of transactions in the tfacp / acr 200 tables.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
What is FSG, FCG, and how do I change them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FSG is Financial Supplier Group - it is the one that would pertain to your AP balancing.<br />
<br />
FCG is Financial Customer Group - it would apply to AR balancing.<br />
<br />
These provide the ability to drive your transactions to different control accounts.<br />
<br />
What version of Baan are you running?<br />
<br />

<br />
The implementors of customers and venders never informed me of FSG or FCG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">13th August 2002, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jack - <br />
<br />
We are on version 4c2, but no Supply Chain.  <br />
<br />
To view your financial customer group setup, go to Accounts Payable - Master Data - Inquiries - Display Financial Supplier Groups.  If you then select one, go to Application, and then select Display Ledger Accounts by Supplier Groups, you can see what the control account is for each, if you have more than one.<br />
<br />
The financial supplier group is on each supplier,  I believe near the bottom of form 3.<br />
<br />
Hope this gives you some insight!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you suggest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">venkat500</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">i hope you meant report tfacp2415m000. This report lists difference between gld102, 106 v/s acp200 data. This report can identify transactions which have not been updated correctly in these tables.<br />
<br />
Based on the output of the report you can start verfiying the tables and take corrective action. <br />
<br />
One of the major reasons of differences between supplier balances as reflected by ledger accounts in the trial balance and the balances as reported by the acp reports are assignment type of transactions. These transaction type (tfacp200.tpay) refer to assigning open advances / unallocated sums to open invoices.<br />
<br />
Nextly one should also take care of FSG / FCG changes because the tfacp2415m000 report may show differences which actually may not exist. So first tally the total difference shown by the tfacp2415m000 report v/s trial balance figures and then decide the course of action</div></div><hr />
