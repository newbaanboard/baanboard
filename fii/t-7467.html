<br />
I am running Baan 4c3 which was originally set up with two active dimensions. I have had a request to make use of the third dimension in one company.<br />
<br />
Does somebody have a procedure for the addition of an additional dimension which regards to what needs setting up and in which sessions and are there any other issues I need to be aware of.<br />
<br />
We do still have a few shared tables across the companies such as tfgld003 and I do not want the addition of the one dimension in one company to cause any complications in the other companies.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

If the companies are not sharing the chart of accounts then the only problems you might have is if finance want to make the new dimension mandatory on existing accounts but this is not possible because of history in tables like tfgld202 so unless you resort to GTM the new dimension can only be made mandatory on new accounts. There is a way round it using parent child accounts which as been posted on the board before.<br />
<br />
Also when we wanted to add a third dimension after the initial setup I couldn't set the third dimension  to yes in the maintain group comany parameter session I had to use gtm to do it</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was hoping you'd be out there.<br />
<br />
The new dimension is to be optional and tfgld008 is not shared so that issue should be ok.<br />
<br />
I've manged to add the dimension description into the group company parameters OK.<br />
<br />
Which sessions do I need to access to set the new dimension up, Is it simply a case of setting the dimension used fields up on the chart of accounts session ?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
once your enabled the dimension in the chart of accounts session as you said. Then create the dimensions that you want use in mainatain dimensions tfgld0110m000</div></div><hr />

<br />
Had a minor problem with changing the ledger codes due to tfgld002 not being shared and the Group Parameters session insisting on calling session for Group Company.<br />
<br />
This gave me a 606 error but added dimension description into tfgld002 and everything now ok.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the weekend.<br />
