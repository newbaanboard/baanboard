<br />
we´ve got a single-finance/ multi-logistic environment in Baan IVc4. <br />
<br />
Now, we want to separate one logistic-company [600], because it becomes a own legal-entity.<br />
<br />
Result should be, that there is <br />
a) still a single-finance/ multi-logistic environment - but then without company [600] and<br />
b) a single/ single company [600]<br />
<br />
Has someone a kind of process-plan how to separate this company from the old single-fin/ multi-log environment? Perhaps some documentation or just a list of &quot;avoiding typical mistakes&quot; or any other experiences?<br />
<br />
The project will start in current year, there will be probably the need to separate gains and losses of this year, yet. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
ath</div></div><hr />

<br />
The history of old financial transactions would lie in the old finance company.<br />
You will have to transfer all open transactions to new set-up.<br />
<br />
I would sincerely advise, close company 600, open a new company and enter opening balances/inventory/invoices etc in a proper manner.<br />
<br />
Dont look for converting 600 to MFML.<br />
<br />

<br />
thank you very much for your advise.<br />
<br />
&gt; close company 600, open a new company and enter opening <br />
&gt; balances/inventory/invoices etc in a proper manner.<br />
&gt; Dont look for converting 600 to MFML.<br />
<br />
That would be surely the best way regarding the company, that has to be separated from the Multisite-Environment into a single/ single.<br />
<br />
But the problem remains, that there will still be left a Multisite-environment for the other companies, that are involved in the actual Multisite-concept.<br />
<br />
I´m looking for a way to separate all data/ invoices/ history data ... of the company 600, setting up a new 600 single finance/single logistic, but also still having a multisite-environment with the other remaining companies.<br />
<br />
It´s not only building a new single/ single 600, but it´s also the &quot;reducing&quot; of the remaining ms in current year. <br />
Probably we can´t avoid a intermediate year-end-processing? a new setting up of all involved companies necessary???<br />
<br />

<br />
As said, by closing company 600 which means:<br />
<br />
1. Closing all invoices using a Control A/C<br />
2. Removing comlete inventory(inv adj) with same control a/c<br />
3. Calculating P/L and passing into Balance Sheet.<br />
4. Removing all b/S balance to Control account.<br />
<br />
This way both financially and logistically the company will be sepeated from Multicompany Structure.<br />
<br />
The in the new company:<br />
<br />
Revere the above transactions using the same control account.<br />
<br />
Be sure about the Group Company... do you want same as that of Finance compnay of 600 or something else.<br />
<br />
Mail me in case of further clarificatrions...<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Multi-Site means inter-company processing which will continue to happen with the new company.<br />
<br />
Financial consolidation is dependent on group company structure which you can make as you desire with the new companyu..<br />
<br />
Hope this clarifies...</div></div><hr />

I think we need some discussion for defining the target of that project more concret. <br />
so I´ll close this thread.</div></div><hr />
