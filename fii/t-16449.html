Our in-house Baan Finance person is currently away and I've been asked how to delete batches that are awaiting finalisation. I presume that these batches do not want to be be processed at this current time. Is there a Baan session available for this process?<br />

I did go to this session intially but couldn't see any records but was then told you will only see batches that 'you've' created.<br />
<br />
I think I'll stick to the Tools side, Finance always has me confused! :o <br />

<br />
just run the above mentioned session &quot;Print non finalized transactions&quot; for the batches that shall be deleted - if there are not entries than you can put the status in tfgld100 + 101 to &quot;deleted&quot;.<br />

<br />
Sometimes records that do exist in tfgld102 do not show up in print non finalised transactions, and if there are any records present then you don't want to set the batch status to deleted. The main reason for this is the use of recurring/reversing journals. After the original batch in which these were created has been finalised, the transactions still stay behind in tfgld102 as the template for future reversal/recurrence.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't delete any records from tfgld102 unless you are familiar with finance; depending on the transaction type this could cause serious problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">6th September 2004, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not say that records should be deleted from tfgld102 if you read my answer properly. Also, since it is only tfgld102 nothing realy exiting has happened and it is not realy likely that someone has created recurring batches but not finalized them. <br />

I know you didn't say anything about records being deleted from tfgld102, and basically I said don't do it. I'm working from memory here, but I don't think tfgld101 records have a status field so these may have to be deleted.<br />
<br />
All I said, or meant to say, is check the presence of records in tfgld102. I'm not sure what you mean by 'it is only tfgld102 nothing realy exiting has happened', plenty of exiting things happen when you enter purchase invoices matched to purchase orders, in a whole bunch of other tables so I'd never delete these records from tfgld102. Also, if the termination mode of the transaction type has been set to real time (unlikely and unrecommended, but possible) again loads of exiting things happen in the background. Granted, it all depends on your views on what is exiting.</div></div><hr />

I suggested to run &quot;non-finalized postings&quot; which would show you all tfgld102 transactions for the batch that should be deleted. We were not talking about deleting all entries in that table but deleting a certain batch. Also I recommended to change the status in tfgld100 and 101 which implies that it can be changed back once it is necessary. PJ clearly mentioned that the consulatant was not available the day he made the post here at Baanboard. I guess the solution I provided was good enough to clarify it with the finance person once he was available again.<br />
