<br />
I have a problem with sales invoices (linked with sales orders). Somebody make a mistake entering currency rate in tcmcs008. With this wrong rate sales invoices have been posted (integration).<br />
At these time we corrected rate in currency rates, but all the invoices are posted and finalized in finance.<br />
Does anybody know any way to correct those invoices?<br />
I try to use Write off currency difference session, but it doesn't change integration transactions. All reports making from integration will show not corrected values.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.<br />
Best regards<br />
Anna</div></div><hr />

You should possible pass credit through the distibution module using the same currency rates as the invoices that were incorrect.  Then do the sales invoices again.</div></div><hr />

Marias solution is the best one from a finance perspective (especially if you can still post the credits and new invoices to the original period).<br />
<br />
You may want to issue the returns/credits into (and the new shipments/invoices from) a non-nettable warehouse so that the Finance corrections don't mess up inventory or planning (MRP/MPS) functions.<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for suggestions. It seems to be the best way to correct invoices. But on the other hand will be nice to have a correction session for the future.  People can make mistakes, it's normal.  Maybe send this suggestion to Baan-support?<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

I think most finance users would agree that one of Baan's shortcomings is its failure to provide an easy, accurate way to reverse (or &quot;undo&quot;) transactions. <br />
<br />
Sometimes seems as though it simply never crossed the minds of anyone in Baan development that: (1) people sometimes make mistakes; (2) people enter data in Baan; and (3) the fact that Baan code may process the data correctly does not necessarily mean the results are correct. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Im not sure that other ERP systems offer better ways to change or reverse posted transactions that have been integrated from logistics into finance. What this points out is how much discipline an ERP system requires of the organization. <br />
<br />
It never hurts to let Baan know where improvements are possible, but your best option is to develop sound, easy-to-follow procedures based on your specific business environment. <br />

<br />
I agree with Scott. <br />
I prefere where the system forces the users to a certain discipline, instead of facilating the way of error handling. <br />
My opinion is that this kind of discipline will force the implementation team to work out business  procedures which are as simple as possible. As we say in our team: KISS - keep it simple stupid. <br />
<br />
In addition it forces the implememtation team to create a detailed documentation, which is a lack of a lot of projects. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">7th June 2002, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Julisb (by the way, what does that stands for? Julia? Just curious...) that a good procedure will prevent errors. However, the mentioned problem (correct rates) is really an annoying one, epecially if use other currencies than your come currency only rarely. Because the you will not enter daily rates into Baan, probably you will use fixed rates. So it's up to the sales users to enter the rate, and probably that rate just changes again when they have to do the delivery. If they forget about changing the rate (and they will sometimes, because it's not part of their &quot;standard&quot; procedure - see above), you don't have a way in Baan to correct the stuff both in Finance and Logistics (sales history) without a return order and a new delivery. Than the order number on the invoice is another as the order number on the acknowledement, you start typing the invoice with MSWord, and so on...<br />
<br />
It would really be nice if Baan was somewhat more error tolerant.<br />
<br />
However, Anna, perhaps this is a solution for you, if you don't need the correct rate in the distribution module: Temporarily switch the parameters so that you can write off unrealized currency differences, enter the correct rate in the rate table, write of the difference just for that invoice, enter the correct rate again and switch the parameters back. (But make sure no one else needs the currecy rate during that procedure.) Then post the amount from the currency differences account to your turnover account.<br />

Thanks again for suggestions, I think, that we write off currency differences, like Uli suggest. Will be nice to correct also distribution and integration side, but we can accept correction on Open Entries too. <br />
We have very detailed procedures concerning Baan. But sometimes it's not enough.<br />
Problem I it's not a result of passing over the procedure. Somebody have to enter currency rate in a session &quot;Currency rates&quot;.  He made this, but instead of 3.6215 he entered 3,6251. It's a petty detail, but.. When we found it, there were posted a lot of invoices - this become important.  <br />
 So, I try to ask Baan about correction sessions. I think it takes a lot of time, but I will inform you.<br />
<br />
