<br />
Hello. I just want to inquire about the possibility of changing the supplier code in an outstanding PO to continue the process to PDPO? Old code was blocked due to some important reasons and a new code was created. This was done to exclude the existing PO from the old supplier's balance. Is this possible? What is the effect on the supplier's balance? on Trial Balance? on the Financial Statement? <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for any idea or solutions that will be given.<br />
