<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">txarmel</div><div class="date">22nd March 2010, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
we have this case in our company (in UK).<br />
we have raised an invoice last year which needs to be credited. The invoice was raised with 15% VAT but the rate has now changed to 17.5% and we need to raise the credit with the 15% VAT<br />
<br />
If I generate a Manual sales Invoice, BaaN does not allow me to modify the VAT amount. If I generate the credit note using Maintain Transactions, I can modify the invoice amount but I can not print the credit note to send it to our customer.<br />
I guess i can always temporarily update the VAT percentage, but I was wondering if there was a standard option to do this.<br />
<br />
any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">txarmel</div><div class="date">22nd March 2010, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, i thought of that too, but I wanted to avoid having to set up that new VAT code for all the different kinds of VAT Declarations and VAT types that we have in the system, specially thinking that we are probably going to change the VAT % in Spain from July and this case is very likely to come up again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">22nd March 2010, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have thought that you should raise the credit note with the current VAT rate.  After all VAT applies at Tax date - date of invoice or credit note and you just claim the amount on your inputs/outputs as usual.  If there is a cash difference then that should simply be written off if there are no other transactions on the account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">txarmel</div><div class="date">22nd March 2010, 20:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, yes, I would have thougth so, too. But after checking with the finance department,  they told me it had to be raised with the former VAT rate ...</div></div><hr />
