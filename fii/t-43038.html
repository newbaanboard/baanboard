<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">16th October 2007, 21:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We are multi-finance / single-logistic.<br />
<br />
At 9PM I have a job that issues invoices and executes process delivered sales orders.<br />
<br />
At 12:30 AM, I have a job that runs correction programs on the order balance and the AR balance.  This is done Monday - Friday.  Lately, I have become aware of an account that is not in balance.  This is related to some unposted transactions which are stored in tfgld416 table.<br />
<br />
In this specific example, we issued 8 invoices.  Five of the invoices were posted to AR and three were not posted to AR.  My accounting person has instructed me to run session tfgld4201m000 to post the unposted transactions stored in tfgld416 table.  In my job that runs the correction programs, I have inserted session tfgld4201m000 so this will run first.<br />
<br />
My question is why?  In this example, 5 invoices posted and 3 did not.  When tfgld4102m000 was run, no errors were received so why did these 3 invoices not post with the other 5.<br />
<br />
Is this behavior normal?  Or is there an explanation for this?<br />
<br />
Is my solution appropriate?:confused:</div></div><hr />

Check the selection criteria given in your posting session job.  Probably those three invoices were out of range given in the posting session, so they might not hav been posted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">18th October 2007, 23:41</div></div><div class="posttext">The parameters are set as follows:<br />
<br />
cuno.f = &quot;      &quot;<br />
cuno.t = ZZZZZZ<br />
orno.f = 0<br />
orno.t = 999999<br />
copt.f = &quot;   &quot;<br />
cotp.t = ZZZ<br />
upto.date = date()+0<br />
<br />
All the invoices have the same date.</div></div><hr />

when there some transactions left in the 416... are the integration settings complete?<br />
I assume that you already have checked tfgld4532m000 Display Integration Transactions Log?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">19th October 2007, 22:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The integration log was checked.  Nothing there but records did exist in tfgld416 table.</div></div><hr />

Then, while running tfgld4201m000 for those invoices the date doesnt match? This is just a guess, can u try giving date()+1 or date()+2</div></div><hr />
