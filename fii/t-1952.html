<br />
I've got a Ledger account of type &quot;Balance Sheet&quot; with a Blocking status of 'Free'.<br />
This account is part of the Financial Supplier Group and is associated with &quot;Advance Payments&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anytime I pass a JV against this ledger account.. it comes up with a message &quot;Ledger Account is a Supplier Control Account&quot;.<br />
<br />
This account has some balance in it and I would like to transfer this amount to some other account and zero out this 'problematic' account.<br />
<br />
Will there be a problem since there are transactions in the history... and this control account has some opening balance...<br />
<br />
This is on Baan IV c2.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help me out with this...<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maalpoel</div><div class="date">8th May 2002, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">The standard way to modify a control account. like advance payments is via a supplier of customer transaction. Every manual<br />
transaction is blocked, because the sub will not be equal any more to the gen.ledger.  This will be on every control list visible.<br />
<br />
If you still want to do it there are 2 options. Remove account from acp/acr fin. groups or put the sign 'number of times used in acr' of number of times used in acp' in tfgld008 for the specific account<br />
to 0 via ttaad4100. The last option is of course not supported by Baan. <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
and will be visible on the control account list as difference when you book without supplier relation . <br />

<br />
Hmm... <br />
<br />
How can I transfer the amount from this control account to a new account and then close this old ledger account<br />
<br />
(I'll be doing a Final close of last fiscal year and there are no transactions on this ledger account for this year). Would there be any problems if I were to change this account now ? (if allowed) :)<br />
<br />
Please advice<br />
<br />

<br />
The balance in this account should tie to checks written by your accounts payable for which there was not yet a receipt on a PO (for example, a downpayment on a piece of machinery).  When the item is received, and an AP invoice is matched, you then link the advance payments against it so that you don't overpay.  When this is done, the advance payment account will be relieved of the costs.  <br />
<br />
If you found a way to move the amounts to another account, you'll lose your traceability of any downpayments you've made.  The only time I would ever suggest changing the control account number is if it had a zero balance.<br />
