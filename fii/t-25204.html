<br />
The lot result is generated at the time of price change (in tdpur4122m000 / tfacp1140s000) for already issued quantity or  at the time of issue of lot item for production or sales for quantity issued and for difference standard price and actual price.</div></div><hr />

(Although there is a difference between Standard Cost and Lot price there will be no financial transaction for the variance at the time of receipt. The variance transaction will be generated only when this lot item is issued to production or sales (via the combination Production and Lot Result or Sales and Lot Result)<br />

In addition to the Issue entry you will get Lot Result also.<br />

The purchase price of the item sold is different than the standard cost price. At this time the difference between the purchase price and the standard cost is calculated as lot result for sales.)<br />
