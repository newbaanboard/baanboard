<br />
 I have the problem, that there is an amount on the account &quot;goods received invoice not yet arrived&quot; (credit in integration &quot;purchase/ receipt&quot;), but the account &quot;invoice receipt&quot; is balanced (so the invoice approvals are done).<br />
<br />
Is there anyone who can give me a simple procedure what I have to check and to do to balance the account?<br />
<br />
I searched in the FAQ, but obviously my keywords were not correct (got no result).<br />
We have Baan IVc4 with servicepack 7.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

Check if all integrations have been posted and try to find the orders for these. For the orders you need to check in tdpur045 and tdpur046 tables.<br />
