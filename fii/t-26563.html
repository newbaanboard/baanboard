<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason Patte</div><div class="date">6th March 2006, 20:13</div></div><div class="posttext">We have just tried to close Period 2 in a new company (325), however we are getting errors when trying to finalize a few batches. Looks like the credits hit company (320).<br />
<br />
Transaction Orgin: Production (SFC)<br />
Financial Transaction: Operation Costs<br />
<br />
&quot;Finalization&quot; not executed, group company not same as current company. <br />
<br />
We believe the set up has been corrected (not really sure how, but batches in Mar (Period 3) are working correctly. Somebody fixed it without knowing they fixed it?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated as we have lost our finance lead.. and I'm lost when it comes to the finance modules.<br />
<br />
How to correct the costs so that the batches can be closed would be what we're looking for.</div></div><hr />
