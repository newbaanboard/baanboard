<br />
I would like to seek your opinion on how for us to generate invoice for services deliver to the customer.<br />
<br />
We has setup project department for installation and maintaining the job which has delivered to the customer.<br />
<br />
Now we have an issues on how to create invoices for job done by our staff.  We have no issues if the invoices is regarding the inventory but not for services delivered to the customer.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

1. Create a manual sales invoice in Central Invoicing<br />
2. Add one or more Cost Item lines to the Sales Order. When the services are complete, update the prices/amounts and then release the lines to invoicing.<br />
<br />
Cost item lines have the advantage of relating the service revenue to the sales order but unless the types of services that you inovice are fairly standard, easy to describe and easy to price at time of order entry, the Manual Sales Invoice may be easier to manage.<br />
<br />
(I just saw your post today and you may have already resolved this.)</div></div><hr />
