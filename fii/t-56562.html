<br />
I have encountered an error on approving a purchase invoice in Accounts Payable module in session tfgld1101m000<br />
<br />
When i try to approve the invoice after matching to respective receipts in session tfacp1110s000, it shows this error message &quot; The amount of bookings transactions has not been split up completely in session ' Matched Purchase Invoice Transactions' &quot;<br />
<br />
Please help. I have no idea what went wrong.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">19th August 2009, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">One of your selected receipt lines is for a cost item which is in a cost-to-be-specified group. In that scenario you can split up the costs through the specific command for cost items. With a recent functional change you do not have to do that, so this is only a warning message, because you can also post the amount booked on cost to be specified order lines in one shot in tfacp1133s000 from tfacp1110s000.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your advice. just have to fill up the debit ledger account for the cost items.<br />
We also change the ledger mapping for PO/cost to be specified debit - to supplier interim account instead of final purchase end account.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks</div></div><hr />
