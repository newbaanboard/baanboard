<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arch14</div><div class="date">23rd September 2003, 01:01</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a situation where we have three different names our company does business as. This situation is commonly known as &quot;DBA&quot; or &quot;Do Business As.&quot;  This is really used for a sales or brand management purpose, not for financial purposes.  We do not have to maintain financial statements for these businesses.  We don't want to create Baan companies for these because they are just marketing names.  The problem we have with this is that in Baan5.0c (sp10), the invoice name and address of our company comes from the company information in the common data.  Has anyone out there had experience with this? How did you do it? I was hoping to avoid a customization, but that doesn't seem very likely.<br />

<br />
In mho the easiest option is to redefine the reports (invoices) to be printed without company data in the header.<br />
<br />
Then, based on the sales invoice print to 1 out of 3 printers each filled with logo printing paper (the 3 different brands).<br />
<br />
This may sound too easy, but I think the only other option is programming (which you don't want as you stated).<br />

<br />
Thanks for the response. We really want the DBA to print automatically, so I think it has to be a customization. I just wanted to see if there were any other ideas out there. Pre-printing it is a good one, so if they don't like the idea of a customization, then I will present this one.<br />
