Baan 5.0c<br />
Note that am not a Baan-finance expert (hope my question is not too basic..)..<br />
<br />
After sending the invoice to our client we agree with him that the payment can be done 30 days later.<br />
So am trying to set this new due date and print again the invoice with the updated information.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to do this or there is no way to change the invoices??<br />
Thanks in advance for the help!<br />
<br />

If you want change sales invoice due date, you can modify it in session tfacr2100m000 (maintain sales invoice detail).<br />
<br />
you can see the result in print sales invoice or aging analysis report.<br />
<br />
Hope it is helpful for you.<br />

<br />
I think alex is using Baan IV not Baan 5.0c, as there is no such session as this in Baan 5.0c..<br />
<br />
Anyway Ale, you can change the due data from the open entries tfacr2520m000, select your invoice and double click and you can change the due date...<br />
<br />
This will affect your aging analysis and your reports but you can't reprint the sales invoice with the new data...<br />
<br />
Actually in Baan5.0c you can't reprint a sales invoice &quot;with a new data &quot;once it is composed, it will always be printed with the old data.</div></div><hr />
