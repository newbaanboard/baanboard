I tried the following:<br />

b. Approve from the Match Purchase Invoices by Rnage session<br />
<br />
I checked:<br />

After checking that it is not a customization bug, contact your support center.</div></div><hr />

In order to approve the invoice, I've changed the value to 'YES'.</div></div><hr />

If your problem still exists.  System not allowing you approving in Finance before the distribution approval receipts, is a functionality.  That is why tfacp240.ppvp will be having the value NO till such time the same is approved at distribution.  When you set it to YES manually, the sytem tries to approve it in Finance based upon this field status, but it can't really approve since it is not yet approved in distribution, hence you are getting this problem<br />
<br />
Solution:  Set the field back to NO.  Get the receipt approved in distribution, and then try approving in Finance.  (By now, if the distribution approval is already over, ensure that the above field has got the value YES, before trying a Finance approval)<br />
<br />
Tell me if this helped you.<br />
