I am using BaanERP 5.0c and had been trying to use write off currency difference (tfacp2240m000) session,but it does not working as well i expected even i already obey the rule on system. For example Ledger account by currency on Company parameter (tfgld0103s000) session already checked and  the ledger account for this currency difference already made on Currency-Difference Ledger Account by currency for unrealized currencies profit/loss kind of transaction.<br />

<br />
Check the following issues:<br />
- Have you defined the appropriate currency codes and rates, beforehand?<br />
- in the ledger acccount form 2, check currency difference setting.<br />
  should be Required, Calculated.<br />
- Check for setup in Fin Supplier Groups, Customer Groups, as there are currency difference setups req<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trisulo</div><div class="date">22nd December 2003, 04:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks dude for your info.. <br />
but allow me to explain and asking a few things.<br />
-Currency code and rate, of course already made on my Baan and rate determinator based on document date.<br />
-On financial group for suppler and customer,the ledger account had been set up too for currencies differences.<br />
-But on Ledger Account session, i choose Required for all of them for currencies difference analysis. <br />
<br />
May i asked you..which one of ledger account should be swicth to Required,calculated diff.curr option? because when i change A/P controll account ,the system give the message that controll account can not modified to Required,calculated diff.curr.<br />
Hopefully got an answer soonest.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding control account setup, it can be either Required, or Not used.  The diff is that in former case, system will store data in both system currency, and transaction currency.  <br />
<br />
Thus, the only setting not allowed for Control A/c is Required / Curr. Diff Calculated (3).<br />
<br />

In some occasions is usefully to run the &quot;hide&quot; session tfcor0260m000 before run the write off currency ..<br />
I have problems in this session as well, but when I try to get the invoices posted in a latest year (different from the cut off year)<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
