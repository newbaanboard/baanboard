<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">runr24</div><div class="date">1st October 2015, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to create a Business Partner hierarchy, or associate many business partners to a top level BP, in LN?  The company I am working for is already using the partner field on the BP for other purposes that wouldn't be compatible with what we need.<br />
<br />
The example of what I need is:  there are 10 Sold-Tos that we need to link to a single Sold-to for reporting purposes.  The 10 are distributors of the one BP.  This is solely a reporting relationship but we want the data available so we don't have to manually link data later.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
