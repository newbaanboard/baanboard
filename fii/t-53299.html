<br />
My company as a frequent problem relating to debit notes issued by clients for rework/price difference, etc. The problem is the client usually clears those debit notes against some or parts of our invoices payment before we actually get the original document.<br />
So what happens is the A/R clerk does not clear some of the invoices that should be matched against a debit note. This causes a lot of false positives in credit alerts and also a wrong list of overdue invoices.<br />
<br />
What I would like is to be able to clear the invoices before the debit note arrives using the payment document or transaction but preserving the correct bank balance.<br />
<br />
Does anyone face this problem? Any idea to solve it?<br />
I have googled for solutions and found the attached 3897 document about SAP. Probably what I'm looking for are the &quot;residual items&quot;<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

Would that solve the purpose. since in the system there is no Debit note yet booked. Or a dummy Debit note can be booked to the extent of difference in reciept. and then the interim account can be reconciled, when actual debit notes are received from the customers.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help you somehow.<br />
