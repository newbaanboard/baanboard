<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">14th July 2005, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw a brief posting from October 2001 about this issue with no responses and thought I would repost it.  Florida has a tax law where there is one tax rate up to a certain amount on the sales order then once that amount is reached the rest of the order should be at another tax rate.  Baan calculates tax on invoice not sales order.  If the entire sales order is invoiced at once then the taxes are calculated correctly - if there is more than one invoice per sales order then it doesn't know once that base amount is met and then to apply the excess rate.  <br />

Has anyone else run into this problem and have any suggestions for fixing or workarounds?<br />

Thanks,<br />
