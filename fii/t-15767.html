<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nicolas</div><div class="date">25th June 2004, 10:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Our company has recently been acquired by a group and we must henceforth periodically reconcile our accounts with other affiliates for consolidation purposes. We are finding it quite difficult so far to obtain the relevant data company by company out of standard Baan reports. We have not set specific ledger accounts for intercompany business. The data we are looking for are income and expense, accounts receivable (invoices + receipts) and accounts payable (GRINYA + invoices + payments) as of balance sheet date for every single group company. Can anyone give us some clue as to what is the best way to get this info out of Baan?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I understand correctly there are two things here a) reconciliation and b) consolidation<br />
<br />
For both U can use multi company setup of Baan. U can obtain notes on multi company setup from Baan website.  U can setup inter company / inter group relations which will eliminate the need for reconciliation. U can get consolidated trial balance and ledger reports at the group company level. U can also use Financial Statements to obtain other information / reports<br />
<br />
Hope the information is useful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nicolas</div><div class="date">5th July 2004, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue is not to set up multicompany within Baan. We are just an affiliate, and our group is not running Baan software, so Baan's multicompany features won't help. What we are looking for is the easiest way to print out the financial statements showing transactions with other group companies as of a certain date. So it is just reconciliation. Consolidation is performed by the general HQ, and itÂ´s a problem of their own.<br />
<br />
Can anybody assist? Thanks, :confused:</div></div><hr />
