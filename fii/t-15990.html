<br />
At our site we do this reconciliation of inventory valuation with concerned GL accounts every quarterly. It works fine if the integration GL accounts are set-up properly and the manual entries to these GL accouts are identified through a customized report. It is a must for annual reporting for Statutory auditors. The standard cost of the items are used for inventory valuation.<br />
<br />
If stock is to be valued at actual cost the only option is to have all items as lot controlled and in item master the cost price calculation is to be selected as &quot;Lot price&quot; and not as &quot;Fixed Standard cost&quot;. In such cases the Inventory valuation report that is available in Lot control module will give the stock value at actual price. However, when the items are issued it will be at standard cost and variance with actual cost will be trigerred in the system. <br />
<br />
Hope this information is of help.</div></div><hr />
