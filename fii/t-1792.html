<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 11:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it a bug?<br />
Is it a feature?<br />
No. Not Superman. But heeeeeelp, please:<br />
<br />
Version is IVc4 SP 8<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what I'am doing wrong here:<br />
<br />
- tfacp1110s000: I maintain a purchase invoice with EUR 1000,- (forget about VAT right now)<br />
- tfacp1131s000: I match this invoice against a receipt of 900,- (partially, with 900,-)<br />
- So, 100,- EUR of the invoice amount are not matched.<br />
<br />
If I remember right from my finance training long ago, during approval I should be able to post this balance amount of 100,- to some ledger account.<br />
<br />
However, &quot;Session Maintain Purchase Invoice transactions&quot; (tfacp1120s000) always pops up with a remaining amount of ZERO. So I am not able to post anything here: If I do, the remaing amount get's &lt;&gt; zero and when I close tfacp1120s000 I get the message (&quot;Still transactions to be entered&quot;). <br />
<br />
<br />
Am I missing something, or is this a bug or a silly change in functionality?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you have to define in tdinv8150m000 the ledgers for combination Purchase+Result<br />
<br />
If you aprove partially, the difference will be posted to those integration ledgers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Alejandro, the integration is defined here. I also match exactly to the amount of the receipt (I could do a total match also). There is no price difference (invoice line against purchase order line), but an invoice difference (invoice total against order total). Example are additional freight costs that you never ordered, but which are invoiced. I cannot deal with that kind of difference right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">If quantity in order (OQ)= quantity invoiced (IQ) and amount in order (OA) &lt;&gt; amount invoiced (IA), there is a difference and I am sure your problem is a bug. What BaaN checks in our system is:<br />
<br />
if ((IA)/(OA))&lt;&gt;((IQ)/(OQ)) then there is a price difference and if the aprobal is partial (in order to put amounts in the form), then ther is a price difference to post.<br />
<br />
Because you say order and invoice currency is EUR there is not the possibility of an rate change.<br />
<br />
We are working BaaN IV C4 SP 7a5 (That is what Version Scan Tool says), and difference are posted right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When You approve purchase invoice can You see 100 still as an open amount?<br />
<br />
If so, the session for entering 'rest amount' opens automaticcaly. Then You enter amount and accout. Result of this session is updated field 'entered transactions' in session where You can see 'net amount' 'connected  with orders' and 'entered transactions'.<br />
<br />
If not so, try to install the very latest SOL for sessions: Maintain purchase invoices, maintain receipts and session foe approval.<br />
<br />
That helped me in similar sitation.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">26th April 2002, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally found the solution: The transaction type for approval had the wrong sessions. So session &quot;Approve purchase invoice (tfacp1140s000)&quot; always zoom to tfacp1120s000 (maintain transactions for purchase invoices) instead of tfacp1133s000 (maintain transactions for MATCHED purchase invoices. And of course, that session doesn't do it in this situation.<br />
