<br />
user has matched invoice and finalized it without approving. Then in other period used the session tfacp1130m000 Match/Approve Purchase Invoices with Orders  to approve the invoice that generated approval documents, but it also asked to book some amount to account that I don't understand as the invoice total amount is the same as matched with orders, but the session now states that matched with orders is smaller and there is amount in transactions entered.<br />
But if I print out the invoice matching the amount is same as invoice total??<br />
now there is additional sum booked to ledger account and the document is therefore not balanced and can't be finalized. <br />
I can't reverse it either.<br />
<br />
How should this be corrected?:confused: <br />
