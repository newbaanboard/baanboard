<br />
Fixed asset master data entered from legacy individual asset wise. Initial set up also executed for all the assets. Assets being depreciated at asset level.<br />
When report tffas2400m000 and tffas1420m000 are run, purchase value field does not have any value though the same is given in the master data creation. Table tffas007 is updated with the purchase value. The book value is in -ve as purchase value shows 0 amount. The -ve balance represents the acc.dep amt. How come????</div></div><hr />

<br />
In session tffas0103m000 the field Investment project was by mistake set to &quot;Yes&quot;. Now it is set to &quot;No&quot;.<br />
<br />
Further in tffas020 there are no logged transactions for the transaction type 1 (Investment) which represents the purchse value when initial vlaues were loaded from legacy.<br />

<br />
Investment records are logged for all depreciation code present at the time purchase values is entered in tffas0106m000 (in tffas020) .<br />
<br />
In order that FAS reports show correct picture , the table tffas020 must have investment records in tffas020.</div></div><hr />

Tks for the reply. It looks like I have to reload the data from legacy again.<br />

<br />
Uploading of data will not help in any way. Instead punch in datas manually after dropping all the existing records in FAS including the parameters.<br />
<br />
the main problem i m seeing is that logged transactions is not updated either by ur upload or entry which normally gets done when u enter your FAS master.<br />
<br />
I had faced similar problems earlier and the best method I could adopt to built my FAS register is to  re-enter the data!!!!<br />
A painful job indeed!!!<br />

<br />
Tks for the reply. As a test case I inserted one record in tffas020 table and the field purchase value is reflected in the reports. This seems to be a more workable solution rather than clearing all the fas tables and uploading again.<br />
