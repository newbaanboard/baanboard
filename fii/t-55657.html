<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">21st April 2009, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">With bilateral invoicing, Warehousing is generating processing data in tables tfacp240 and tfacp245. The tax country and code should be present in tfacp240 for your order. If it is present, then during the self-billing process the internal purchase invoice should be calculated including the tax associated with that tax country/code.<br />

The receipt at the other warehouse should trigger the generation of the receipt record in tfacp245. <br />
