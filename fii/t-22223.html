<br />
We need your help to solve integration problems.<br />
<br />
1. We create Purchase Order for non stock item (tdpur45m000).<br />
When we create order lines , we forget to fill in Ledger account <br />
&amp; Dimension at Tab Finance<br />
<br />
2. After that we receive material from session tdpur4501m300 (Purchase Order Receipt)<br />
<br />
3. We run session tfgld4201m000 (Post Integration Trx. to Finance)<br />
<br />
4. The result of posting, error dimension 1 of Ledger account must be fill in Debit account<br />
<br />
5. We go back to Purchase Order line, but all fields already dim (we can't do adjustment Ledger account &amp; Dimension)<br />
<br />
Our questions :<br />
1. How to adjust this integration transaction ?<br />
2. Why system didn't give us any error messages when we forget to fill in Ledger account and dimension at Purchase Order Line ???<br />
<br />
We have many transactions with the same error messages, so we can't do the closing processing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Rini</div></div><hr />

i think your problem is in integration setup for combination purchase/general Costs. Here you have defined a ledger account based on ?? criteria, which has dimension 1 as mandatory in chart of accounts. Have you?<br />
Normally account should automaticly be filled in tdpur4101s000 based on your integration setup. We do it this way with item group as criteria.<br />
So once the account is filled and dim 1 is mandatory you are asked to fill the dim 1 field.<br />
For your prob now, the easiest way is to maintain an integration element with the required dimensions(tfgld4120m000/tfgld4121m000/tfgld4122s000) and link it to the mapping scheme purchase/general Costs in tfgld4500m000. Then you should be able to post transactions to finance.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

It is a problem in BaaN that you are not forced to fill up the account number when you order a cost item. (I remeber it from many years ago !!)<br />
<br />
For fixing I used to use ttaad4100 (GTM) to put the desired account an dimenssions values in the errored integration transaction lines in relevant tables tfgld4xx.<br />
<br />
If not all receipts were done (still backorders) you must also fix and put the values in the PO lines and PO line history tables so that you will not get the error again in future receipts.<br />

<br />
Baan support suggest me to put cost component as a basic for this integrations. So we input special integration mapping scheme for it and we post integration special for this order (based on date).<br />
After we success to post it, we delete again this mapping scheme.</div></div><hr />
