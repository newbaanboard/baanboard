<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmmm31</div><div class="date">11th August 2009, 22:13</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using LN (Baan ERP 6.0) and discovered that we cannot delete Purchase Orders that still have lines with the status &quot;Process Delivered Purchase Orders/Schedules.&quot;  When you run the &quot;Process Delivered&quot; session &quot;tdpur4223m000&quot;, the line status does not change.  The Purchase Orders you can delete contain lines that all have a status of &quot;Deleting Lines&quot;.  <br />
<br />
This seems to be happening on lines where either the initial receipt was changed, or the Initial Receipt was not the Final Receipt.  The Invoice status on the PO Lines Monitor is &quot;Approved&quot;.  The ones you can delete say &quot;All Approved&quot;.<br />
<br />
Is there a process we are missing on the AP side that does not allow the PO Line to be deleted?  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- All inspection orders are clsoed for the PO<br />
- All Back order quantities are confirmed for PO<br />
- All invoices are matched and approved in Finance<br />

Please check as above.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmmm31</div><div class="date">20th August 2009, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for your reply.  I have checked all of these things and still have the problem.  I should also mention that the PO Status on these orders is &quot;Closed&quot; in tdpur4100m000, even though when you view &quot;Orders for Processing&quot;, they show up.<br />
<br />
This is happening on Cost Purchase Orders as well as Normal Purchase Orders.  The only thing that all these Purchase Orders have in common, was the initial receipt was changed in some way, or the initial receipt was not the final receipt.  The final receipt was done at a later date.<br />
<br />
I attached a Word file with some screen prints for an example.  In this case we received 261 lbs out of 300 lbs ordered on 10/07/08.  The person doing the receipt did not mark it final so in January of 2009, someone went in and did a zero receipt and marked the final receipt checkbox.  Then they confirmed the 0 backorder in &quot;Potential Purchase Backorders.&quot;  At this point, the Invoice had already been long paid.<br />
<br />
Same thing on the Cost PO.  We ordered 7,000 pcs of something.  We received in 1690 on 6/19/08, paid the Invoice.  Then in July of 2009, we went in and did a zero receipt and checked the Final Receipt Box.  Then we go into &quot;Potential Purchase Backorders&quot; and change qty to zero and confirm.  Again, the Invoice for 1,690 pcs was already paid for back in 2008.<br />
<br />
Is the process we are using to cancel backorders incorrect?  Can it be a timing issue?  Any input is appreciated.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
