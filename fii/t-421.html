invoices? We are looking into using that and wanted to see if anyone had<br />
been using it and what they were able to build in with it. Does it<br />
simply bring in the invoice and then manually a user matches/approves or<br />
can you build in the ability to do matching?<br />
We are looking at this in IVc3 for now and may look at it for our<br />
companies on 5.0c</div></div><hr />
