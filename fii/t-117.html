We are adding the service module as well.  My question is this.  Does anyone have any procedures/guides on what needs to be done on the financial side to make sure that everything is posted to the correct ledger accounts?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.<br />

The way we have done it its quite simple. You have to define in first place you cost analisys codes tssma3212m000 and then in session tssma6102m000 you will define ( per cost type ) the ledger accounts you want, if you use dimensions you will have to do something more. Please let me know if these ideas helped you !<br />

Bye</div></div><hr />
