<br />
in erpln fp2 we have three companies where each company acts as finance as well as logistic company. while migrating to erpln 10.4, we want to combine the data of all these companies in single company such that each company acts as manufacturing plant and we should be able to generate financial report of each company separately as well as combined (all three companies).<br />
<br />
every company is having it's own open purchase orders / sales orders / open acp / acr invoices and production orders.<br />
<br />
can anybody guide how these can be done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th December 2019, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">What we did 20 years ago in 4c4 was use project groups and ranges for manufacturing.  Actually on the project groups we had multiples for one plant since they wanting planning separate for certain program lines.  The we kind of like one plant all PO's were like 4's, all SFC orders were 4's - then another plant would have 5's, another plant 3's.  Something like that - we did the same for like warehouses and work centers.  So in theory each could plan and report individually.  I can't speak much about the financial side - we did that a few years later and by then we were pretty much one financial company.   <br />
<br />
I would think a LN has much better capabilities that baan 4 from 20 years ago. There are probably much better ways to do things now a days.  We were using A&amp;D 4c3 at the time.  It worked for us all the way up to we converted to Oracle EBS. :)</div></div><hr />
