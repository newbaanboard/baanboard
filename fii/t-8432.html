<br />
An example can clarify:<br />
receive 10 pcs for 100 EUR each<br />
MAUC = 10 * 100 / 10 = 100 EUR<br />
<br />
receive 10 pcs for 200 EUR each<br />
MAUC = (10 * 100 + 10 * 200 ) / 20 = 150<br />
<br />
issue 5 pcs<br />
MAUC remains 150 EUR<br />
<br />
receive 5 pcs for 50 EUR<br />
MAUC = (15 * 150 + 5 *50 ) / 20 = 115.25 EUR</div></div><hr />

thanks for your reply.<br />
i wanna know more detail about the MAUC, including:<br />
1. can we setup cost componets in MAUC? for instance, freights are common cost components for purchased item and of coz labor cost and over head are usually used for manufactured items.... so is cost componets supported by MAUC and how does it work?<br />
<br />
2. for a special case, like frieghts and custom duty for purchased item. since sometimes freights cost are not  ensured when goods receipt, since freights invoice usually arriaved later than invoice material.<br />
and custom duty, since custom duty are not paid to vendor. and  somtimes custom duty are not so fixed by rate. then how to adjust the actual cost later?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />
