<br />
A user in the finance team created a DB entry using the transactions. This transaction was not finalized and was left as is.<br />
<br />
However, the other user created a payment advise with the correct amount and linked this DB there. A bank transaction was also created for the same.<br />
<br />
Now, the original transaction (which was incomplete) is showing as `used` and cannot be edited. Nor are we getting any options to finalize it and since it is not finalized we cannot reverse it.<br />
<br />
I want to avoid GTM - so what is the correct procedure to handle this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just start session tfgld1116s000 and look for the batch with the DP entry. Do set the status from &quot;used&quot; to &quot;free&quot; and then you will be able to access the batch.<br />

<br />
Session tfgld1116s000 - Change Interrupted Batch Status. No batch is showing up there as this batch was not interrupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">2nd January 2020, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You were refering to the fact that the batch is &quot;used&quot;. Tfgld1116s000 clears off all those batches.<br />
<br />
Anyway, did you check if  there are still non-finalized transactions (tfgld102) and/or finanlized trasnactions (tfgld106) for this batch ? It might be that just the batch header (tfgld100 &amp; tfgld101) needs to be updated. Please do provide  a screen copy of both tables mentioned to help.</div></div><hr />

Attaching Screenshots - <br />
<br />
1. tfgld102 - No rows<br />
2. tfgld106 - Many Rows - 2 screenshots attached.<br />
3. Document Status - SHowing as `used`<br />
<br />
Also, all lines are showing up undr &quot;Non Finalized and none in Finalized under Document History.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">3rd January 2020, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">If there are no rows in tfgld102 but all of them are in tfgld106 then the batch has been finalized hence cannot be changed anymore. The status &quot;used&quot; only indicates that a document no. has been used (tfgld018). I am puzzled since you mentioned the original document was incomplete as it is not possible to finalize a batch. Did you check if debit/credit tally ? Last but not least it is worth running tfgld1118s000 and tfgld1119s000 which is meant for interrupted finalization runs where one part of the document is already in tfgld106 whereas one part is still in tfgld102.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The batch is not finalized as the debit/credits do not match. Complete document screenshot attached.<br />
<br />
There are now rows in tfgld1118s000 and tfgld1119s000 for the desired period.<br />
<br />
What we require is to edit the document and finalize the batch.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">4th January 2020, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if the batch is not finalize then how is it possible you have all entries in tfgld106 rather then tfgld102 ? The batch header status may be corrupt but means realy nothing. You will not be able to edit the batch again ! It would be worth looking into tfgld107 and 110 to see where the VAT transactions (if there were any) can be found. There is no way back from tfgld106 to tfgld102 unless you do all the editing via ttaad4100.</div></div><hr />
