<br />
Is it possible to unassign allocation of unallocated/advance receipt to invoices after the batch is finalised in GL?<br />
<br />
Before the batch is finalised in GL, it is possible to unassign the receipts to invoices. But once the receipt batch is finalised in GL, there are no options to reverse this. If user wrongly assigns the receipt to incorrect invoices, how this can be reversed?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

But, as a work around, you can use Debit note and Credit note (posting to same account) to bring the balance again.</div></div><hr />

The net result is zero, but you can move the unallocated receipt from one business partner to another. This is similar to the method you would use to post a returned check.</div></div><hr />
