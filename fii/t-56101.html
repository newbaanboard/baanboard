<br />
We have created purchase order with qty=1, price = 20,000 and total amount will be 20,000.<br />
<br />
We have an issue when we want to match only 30% of the po total to supplier invoice as a deposit. ( Supplier will sent invoice twice with amounting of 30% and 70% of po total)<br />
<br />
This is because when we match the invoice with the order line the will assume the payment is final payment because the qty is 1.  So we will have a problem to match the balance of the purchase total to the new invoice.<br />
<br />
Because of that our invoice receipts report will produce incorrect figure for the purchase order.<br />
<br />
Please advise us, what is the best steps or solutions for us to do a matching for the balance of the po with newly receive invoice from supplier.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">12th June 2009, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">You should match the first invoice for a quantity of 1 and subsequent invoices for a quantity of zero. Indeed the first invoice will then create a price difference, but the matching of the subsequent invoice(s) for a quantity of zero will correct that again.<br />

That's is the step which i did before but when i manually input the qty of matching is one and adjust the amount with the invoice receipts amount. I will facing a problem to match the balance of amount because the system will generate no more balance to be matched with the purchase order line.<br />
<br />
So what i did as a temporary solution is i  manually input the qty by percentage by example for 30% of payment the qty is (0.3) and the amount is invoice receipt amount.<br />
<br />
Please advise me whether the temporary step is workable or not.  Or as you suggest please clarify further and how for me to avoid issues with matching the balance of invoices.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">15th June 2009, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">If you match the first invoice for a quantity of one, then indeed the system assumes that the involved order line sequence is totally matched.<br />
This means that initially in the matching screens (tfacp2544/tfacp2541) the system will not show this order line any more.<br />
However with the specific option &quot;Show Only not complete Matched Orders&quot;, you are able to show also order lines which are already totally matched. <br />
After this option you can find and select the order line and then with specific &quot;Match Invoice to Order line&quot;, you can match the invoice amount for a quantity of zero. I hope this helps. If not, then please elaborate more on the problems you had while executing this procedure.<br />

<br />
Could you not do Leerkes suggestion in reverse? the first iinvoice is entered as zero qty with the invoice value. The order will always be un-matched until the final invoice is received. However, assuming you use last approved price in the standard price calculation would this make the cost price roll up wrong ??<br />
