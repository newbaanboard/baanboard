What changes have you made recently to your system?  Are you up to date on the solutions for that report?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anthony_wang</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 12:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't use that report before. So don't know if it was ok.<br />
the SP we installed is SP6 for BAAN IV c4, and i just intalled all related solution for the session.<br />
but still get the same result: nothing would be printed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you checked that the order receipt account that you used there is the correct one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anthony_wang</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">order receipt account?<br />
did you mean the session &quot;maintain inventory and WIP transaction account&quot;?<br />
and i just wondered is this report printed to check the difference between sales order issues and sales invoice?<br />
moreover, when this report can be printed? Between &quot;maintain delivery&quot; and &quot;sales invoice finalization&quot;?<br />
<br />
Many thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know it uses the integration table and checks orders where the issue has been done but there is no invoice transactions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sai_krishna</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">This will print details of all the orders that have been delivered but for which Process Delivered Sales Orders (PDSO) is not yet run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anthony_wang</div><div class="date">25th October 2002, 05:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your kind help! I think i might get it:<br />
Since we use a multi-fin/single-log structure. the order is booked in a finance company, the report can only be printed in the base company (the logistic company).<br />
<br />
And is there any such report for purchase side?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">7th November 2002, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the others have covered most aspects of un-invoiced sales deliveries. It is a useful report and we do use it but it can be a sloooww report to generate.<br />
<br />
If you want a similar report for purchases.Try the following:-<br />
<br />
Finance/accounts payable/transaction processing/reports.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of reports that may suit your needs. For starters try  &quot;Print purchase receipts&quot;. In essence this list shows qty received and qty invoiced. You can select by order and/or supplier and you can also choose whether to list the matched purchase invoice or not.<br />
