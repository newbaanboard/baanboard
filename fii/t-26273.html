I have a srange situation:<br />
The wharehouse have recieved 5 pices of a stock. Then acp have concilliated the purchase order against the invoice. When I run the Integration process, it appears the integration: Purchase- stock correction.<br />
<br />
I never heard about that correction, and I don´t know what it means or how to &quot;read it&quot;. I suspect is an integration that comes from acp. Also in the WIP, I don´t have that integration defined.<br />
<br />
Anybody have faced with this situation before?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />
