<br />
Question:<br />
<br />
We set DIRECT SETTLEMENT and we don't set GUARANTEE SETTLEMENT.<br />
<br />
CAN THIS SETTLEMENT BE SETTLED (SUBSTRACTED FROM THE WHOLE  AMOUNT IN FINANCIAL PACKAGE) without REAL DELIVERY) this is our real situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think - the answer is NO, but is there some WORKAROUND or ...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">10th February 2004, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">We have done this, but it may depend on parameters and integration settings.<br />
<br />
We routinely use installment invoicing and as a general rule we have the last instalment set as guarantee &quot;yes&quot; but occassionaly, if the goods have to be paid before delivery for example, we set this to &quot;no&quot; <br />
<br />
Our experience is that, regardless of wether the setting is yes or no, all installment invoice postings are reversed and transfered to turnover when you close the project. <br />
<br />
NB:<br />
In our order type steps we still have to make a &quot;delivery&quot; in baan at some point.<br />
<br />
and issue a zero value invoice to complete the order steps. (obviously the customer does not need this invoice)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karlovac</div><div class="date">11th February 2004, 08:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks,<br />
it is OK.<br />
<br />
But, the problem for us is that we are working on our final product very long time.<br />
<br />
We have only one sales order line - customised item which customer ordered.<br />
<br />
In most cases, our customers pay in installments, before product is finished.<br />
<br />
All that time we are working, and making costs on our project (material, working hours, ...) <br />
but<br />
in Baan we CAN'T have revenues until we make delivery of our customised item.<br />
<br />
Help please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">11th February 2004, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand it<br />
- you are not running project module<br />
- Costs are being expensed as they occur<br />
- Your sales invoice only becomes revenue when delivered.<br />
- You want to generate revenue in line with costs incurred.<br />
<br />
One work around, although not particularly tidy, might be to manually raise instalment invoices (3 sessions tfacr4100m000 + 4410m000 + 4220m000) These you can post direct to revenue. When the delivery is made and the project revenue becomes realisied you credit off the instalment invoices and scrap the delivery invoice.<br />
<br />
It's also untidy because although you and the customer will have the same value of invoices, in your records you will have the sale twice and credited once.<br />
<br />
It is possible that you may be able to change your parameter settings to acheive what you want but it may cause problems if you do - I will check.<br />
<br />

<br />
It will be more easier if we ignore direct / indirect settlement and make it work thrue more sales order lines with different date on it.<br />
<br />
We have revenues in finance dept. and we will call our lines; situation 1, situation 2 ....<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
you helped me a lot<br />
<br />
