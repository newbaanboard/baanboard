<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">7th November 2003, 09:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We are looking at sending payment instructions to our bank in the form of CSV files using a format as defined by the bank.<br />
<br />
We currently make payment file through the CMG module, which outputs to the German dtaus file format. <br />
<br />
I have looked at the report types associated with tfcmg1260s000 but cannot see one which outputs to a csv format.<br />
<br />
What are my options in successfully outputting a csv file for payment instructions.<br />
<br />
If I cannot use the CMG module then my only other option is to create an Exchange scheme to export the data but I am unsure as to what Baan tables I will get the information from.<br />
<br />
Any pointers will be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

In the reportscript, you will have to open a file (probably in a before.field or in before.program), and write the details to it manually (in the detail.x section).  Lastly, close the file (footer section).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">7th November 2003, 11:36</div></div><div class="posttext">As u also know, there are number of reports attached to session tfcmg1260s000. Though the report names may not have CSV format specifically,it could be possible that other country report layout may be in CSV format . So if u can check/test or else   view those layouts at least, it's possible u get CSV format.<br />
<br />
Or else as Nico said, add / modify a report which creates the file the way bank asks for.</div></div><hr />
