<br />
Wonder if anyone know how to clear the small rounding difference 0.01/0.02 etc in Sales interim account?<br />
<br />
E.g.<br />
In AR voucher:<br />
Dr AR               Foreign curr 51,721.29       HC 394,240.36<br />
    Cr  Sales Interim account    Foreign curr 51,721.29       HC 394,240.36<br />
<br />
In Revenue Analysis integration, the sales interim account may be due to many sales order lines: etc<br />
<br />
Revenue Analysis - Sales Order Lines		<br />
SR7000003	10	22,517.79<br />
SR7000003	20	6,328.12<br />
SR7000003	30	9,026.75<br />
SR7000003	40	23,634.01<br />
SR7000003	40	17,725.51<br />
SR7000005	10	45,166.53<br />
SR7000005	20	7,220.24<br />
SR7000007	20	1,931.29<br />
SR7000007	40	8,914.70<br />
SR7000008	10	7,864.03<br />
SR7000008	30	2,911.68<br />
SR7000008	40	22,086.89<br />
SR7000010	10	95,712.95<br />
SR7000012	20	10,210.20<br />
SR7000013	10	107,590.18<br />
SR7000014	30	3,600.59<br />
SR7000018	10	1,798.89<br />
                         Total:  394,240.35<br />
<br />
Giving rise the entries as follows:<br />
Dr Sales Interim 394,240.35<br />
    Cr  Sales Revenue 394,240.35<br />
<br />
Thus Sales interim has a balance of Dr 0.01 remain in the account.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what's the way to clear it off?<br />
<br />
Are we suppose to post many journal entry at the end of each month to zerolise this interim account??<br />
<br />
Very welcome and appreciate any comment anyone may have.  Please kindly help!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gregoryx</div><div class="date">13th August 2007, 02:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
At the moment I raise an Invoice or a credit note and adjust these .01's and .02's.(Baan4)<br />
<br />
I wonder whether we have any integration set up in Finance and AR module to wipe this off every month end?<br />
<br />
I agree with you it is a pain, but am sure it is solvable. Can any one elso throw some light on this please.<br />
Cheers<br />
Gregory</div></div><hr />

For rounding of your sales invoice, please check with session &quot;Write off payment difference&quot; tfacr2240m000 and write off currency difference tfacr2250m000.<br />
I hope, these session will solve your problem.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Baan IV you'll just do a manual entry to clear this amount.  But you should log a case with Infor support as the rounding you are getting should not occur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gregoryx</div><div class="date">15th August 2007, 02:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
I am migrating from Baan 4 to LN6.1.<br />
<br />
How does it work? while setting up the parameteres in LN6.1 should we need to take care of this issue separtely?<br />
<br />
Projects <br />
How good Projects set up in LN compared to 4? Do we have provisons to make monthly cost of sales entry within the system? -Presently in B4 I am doing it outside the system and bring it in .<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">15th August 2007, 05:58</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest difference in LN over Baan IV is that integration accounts like interim sales can be reconcilied using specific functionality in financial integrations.   If you are familar with how the Goods Received Not Invoiced reconciliation functionality works in Baan 4 or 5 then it is a little bit like that but much better.   Basically this tool pulls all the transactions and points you to things that might be wrong.  <br />
<br />
There should have been a documentation CD with a reconciliation reference guide with the LN install CD or you can search for it at the Infor Support website.<br />
<br />
Projects in LN are different from Baan IV - much more robust functionality.  You can post interim results if that is your question.  I'm not too familar with the details.</div></div><hr />
