<br />
This is relating to table sharing for Baan IV.<br />
<br />
I want to define Multi-Finance Multi-Logistics in the new company.<br />
<br />
Currently, i have only one finance &amp; logistics company.<br />
<br />
In future, if new finance or logistics company needs to be created, can i do table sharing later on?<br />
<br />
Would appreciate, if any one can give some advice on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you define txxxx999 in company 101 as logical, and its phisical is in company 100, what you say to BaaN is than all table records read-written will point to company 100, relating that table. <br />
<br />
If now you define txxxx999 as phisical both in 100 and 101 companies today, and in the future you change 101 from phisical to logical, all data in 101 will be lost. Table it is not dropped, that data is never again accessed.<br />
<br />
If yo change it again to phisical, you will recover lost data.<br />
<br />
So, you can begin sharing in any moment, but, very important, data and consistency etcc will change radical.<br />
<br />
Better define your table sharing when defining new company.</div></div><hr />
