   We have started a new division.  With this comes changing existing customers over to the new division.  We went through this once before and had to create new customer account #'s in order to change the FCG.  This causes confusion within our company as well as the customer.  My question is:<br />
<br />
Is there a way to change the Financial Customer Group on a customer without using GTM or creating a new acct.#?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
there may be a way rather than changing FCG also, for instance, how have you defined your dimensions, if it is by product line or dept, then simply add the new dept to the dimensions table.<br />
<br />
Kindly provide more details of the finance / corp. layout., as i believe you may not have to remap the FCGs for the new division.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frenchj</div><div class="date">7th November 2003, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">We are set up as Multi-Finance/Single Logistic.  Each Finance Division uses different Ledger Accounts for A/R, Sales, etc.  We use the FCG to map these accounts.  That is why we need to change the FCG on a customer.  The A/R is the most important. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th November 2003, 08:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Following is my understanding . Correct me if wrong.<br />
<br />
1.Table tccom010 is shared among all finance companies.<br />
2.tfacr001 is shared .<br />
3. tfacr005 is not shared between the finance companies.<br />
4. tipcs850, tdinv850,tdsls070,tdsls071 and tcmcs036 are not shared .<br />
<br />
If this be the case,  there should be no  need for u to change the customer financial groups because this setup will take care of differences with each division.<br />
<br />
If ur setup is different , I recommend u to make it in conformity with what I described. This will allow u the flexibility u need in the long run. <br />
<br />
It's not difficult to unshare tables which are shared . Take export , unshare it (ttaad4120m000), convert to run time , logout &amp; login , import data in each company and it's done .</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you are setup as Multi Finance, I would advise you to start thinking of cases where you would need to add another division, after the current one.  In such cases, Baan Finance config should be as straight forward as possible.<br />
<br />
Yes, I also belive that tfacr005 is tied to the finance company, and tccom010 can be shared, however, there  are fields in there for the Finance customer / or parent business partner for Finance, if you need to consolidate sales to a large customer.<br />
<br />
Thus,  best option is to revise the setup, where the AR control accounts in each Fin co, are consolidating to a parent AR account in the parent company, if you<br />
<br />
Think of it this way, if you need further segmentation, I have advised clients to use dimensions like FCG, or product line, or division, to add the needed details in financial reporting.<br />
<br />

I would talk to baan support about this further.<br />
<br />
The control accounts can be viewed from Maintain FCG, and then zoom out from there.<br />
<br />
After exensive discussions with Baan support, I wrote a session that allows users to make this change, it validates the control accounts to ensure that they are the same between groups.<br />
<br />
This is in a single finance - single logisitcs environment.<br />

     We do change the G/L Accts.  That is where our problem arises.  Thanks</div></div><hr />
