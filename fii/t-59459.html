<br />
<br />
I entered purchase invoice in company 116, but when I'm about to finalize the batch, the system outputs a message &quot;This session can only be activated using financial company 115&quot;. So I change to company 115, the batch was there but cannot be finalize because the debit entry was missing. I tried to add another debit entry but the document was not balance. I don't know If the company setup and the sharing of tables are correct or I just missed some parameters. Anyway, our setup is single logistics with different enterprise units and multifinance company. <br />

Please help. <br />
