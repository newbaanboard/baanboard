<br />
- tfgld1210m000: Global Selection of Integration Transactions<br />
- tpppc4200m000: Global Confirming<br />
- tpppc4802m000: Process Transactions<br />
- tfgld4201m000: Post Integration Transactions to Finance Transactions<br />
<br />
Am I missing any sessions relevant to the processing of Integration Transactions?<br />
<br />
The environment is BAAN IVc3 with A&amp;D2.2b localizations.</div></div><hr />

It is pure functional one in the area of Finance and Project. The sequence is right. I do not know whether other sessions are required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">4th December 2007, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan98</div><div class="date">12th December 2007, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">the sequence is ok.  it is all depends on modules you use. hope in tpppc4802m000 you must have set  update cost control = yes  then ok.<br />
other wise you may have to use tpppc4803m000 (build actual cost control)<br />
<br />
good luck...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">1st April 2008, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I will continue in here to keep things together.<br />
<br />
The background is:<br />
<br />
I have set up a 'once a day' job to run the sessions described, and broken up the session tfgld4201m000 into several steps (twenty actually!) based on Transaction Origin and Financial Transaction.<br />
<br />
Even after that, the job sometimes does not complete.<br />
<br />
SO, my question is:<br />
<br />
Is there any harm in running this sequence of sessions say every 30 minutes? I mean, is there a risk of interference with other transactions like Release Outbound, Complete Operations, Complete Production Orders etc. and locking them up or slowing THOSE down.</div></div><hr />
