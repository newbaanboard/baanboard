<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thaykhov</div><div class="date">25th June 2008, 04:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All<br />
<br />
I am in ERP LN 6.1<br />
<br />
I have done some digging around the forum and found the session <br />
<br />
tfacr2140m000 - Doubtful Sales Invoice<br />
<br />
When I process a invoice as doubtful the journal result is<br />
<br />
Dr Trade Debtors <br />
Cr Provision for Doubtful debt in Balance Sheet.<br />
<br />
Is this correct?<br />
<br />
Also When writing off a invoice<br />
<br />
eg:Sales Invoice is $110<br />
<br />
Journal is :<br />
<br />
Dr 110 Trade Debtors<br />
Cr 100 Revenue<br />
Cr 10 GST payable<br />
<br />
When I run the session tfacr2240m000 -Write off Payment Difference<br />
<br />
The Journal entry I get is:<br />
<br />
Cr Trade Debtors 110<br />
Dr Expense 110<br />
<br />
My question is what happens to the GST component? why doesn't that get reversed as well?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Thay</div></div><hr />

It should be <br />
Cr Trade Debtors <br />
Dr Provision for Doubtful debt in Balance Sheet<br />
<br />
The second one is correct : I supose GST is like VAT so if you write off the customer position you can not collect back VAT or TAX.<br />

Write off payment different will not write off the whole invoice amount ??- how else are we suppose to write off a entire invoice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TebbyTan</div><div class="date">5th July 2008, 06:47</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to write off the CN without leaving any balance, you can use the Credit Note.<br />
<br />
Dr. XXX<br />
Cr. AR<br />
<br />
Doubtful Debt session is for your to provide for only, you can still set the invoice to undoubtful again.<br />
<br />
if the invoice already being paid and the balance is less than $1, you can use the write off payment difference to clear the balance.<br />
<br />
Good day,<br />
