<br />
We received bank statement in hard-copy from bank. In LN, how do we do bank reconciliation? Must we use the Electronic Bank Statements features to do the reconciliation?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ERPBAAN</div><div class="date">4th June 2008, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two ways for reconciliation, one is manual in which based on the bank statement you have to select the anticipated payment's cheque no. and change the status manually as complete, the other method is automatic in which the file(mail) we are getting from the bank is to be used for Electronic Bank statement reconciliation.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the advice.<br />
<br />
We don't have electronic bank statement, so i guess the second method is not applicable.<br />
<br />
As for the first method, what about the receipt side? How do we do the recon?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
