<br />
Can we use dimension with cash &amp; bank ledgers a/c at the time of doing transaction. Since we put cash &amp; bank ledgers a/c within transaction type, in that case if we put any default dimension code also , then system will allow us to change the dimension code at the time of transaction?<br />
<br />
We want to use dimension for cash &amp; bank ledgers a/c, how can we do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards <br />

In all probablity in later versions also the same functionality prevails.<br />
It however does not mean that one should not have dynamic dimensions for cash /bank ledger .  But if you elaborate / illustrate your requirement there can be many more workarounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is always better to use Cash flow reason for analyzing cash transactions well. System do not allow you to put dimensions in certain cash/bank type of transactions. So it is always better to use cash flow reason for cash/bank type of transactions.</div></div><hr />

The bank ledger account and dimensions, as specified on the Transaction Type, is not maintainable in the Transactions session.<br />
<br />
As noted in the previous replies, please review your requirements and see if they can be met by dimension accounting on the BP control accounts, cash flow reasons or a combination of these. <br />
<br />
If you can provide an example of what you wish to achieve, there might be other suggestions.<br />
