Can I delete this data to create some space in the hard disk.<br />
I was told about this table by a visiting consultant but before going ahead with this job, I need to get the things confirmed.<br />
<br />
We have implemented finanace only to the extent that Inventory transactions get recorded. Payments are not being made through Baan.<br />
<br />
Kindly let me know what all data can be purged from the system so as to create some space in the hard disk.<br />
<br />
Thanking you in advance.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 19:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Following you will see what can be purged.  I do not suggest purging transactions in the current year or until the year has been closed in finance just in cast they may need some of this for auditors.  Use session Archive and Purge Integration Transactions -tfgld4210m000.<br />
<br />
  The following transactions can be purged at any time:<br />
Inventory Transfers   These can be purged through current as they simply wash the same GL account.<br />
Inventory Adjustments  These can be purged through current if accounting has no need to see these.  <br />
Production/Inventory Transfers  These can be purged through current if accounting has no need to see these.<br />
Inventory Cycle Counts  These can be purged through current if accounting has no need to see these.<br />
Inventory Revaluations  These can be purged through current if accounting has no need to see these.  <br />
You can do a count of these records in tfgld410 using General Table Maintenance and option 4 at the choice field.  This will take some time but should give you an accurate count of just what will be deleted.	You can count Inventory Transfers, Inventory Adjustments, Inventory Cycle Counts, Inventory Revaluations and Production Inventory Transfers.  Tables that will be reduced are tfglf410, tfgld415, tfgld417 and tfgld418.<br />
<br />
Sales orders, purchase orders, replenishment orders, production orders, service orders and project transactions (including the not for finance transactions) cannot be purged until the corresponding data is either purged or archived.  Since you are using estimated cost in your projects the only not for finance transactions are the act cost of goods and any cost entries that are entered in AP.</div></div><hr />
