I am not understanding why Baan is creating this line item when there are two invoices entered against the receipt.  In total the receipt matches the invoices, but Baan is not adding the two invoices which are applied against receipts done on the same PO position but different sequences.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had this issue?</div></div><hr />
