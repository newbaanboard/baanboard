<br />
We have multi-logistic / single-finance setup. We shared purchase and sales tables with<br />
<br />
If we take a report from session tfacp9470m000 - Print ITC details by Purchase invoice, It is giving proper data for the company from which we are running that session, but it also gives second logistic company data containing 0 value in some of fields like VAT%, serial Part II etc. which is not correct. <br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me how we can get perfect data for both of the companies by running session only once?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
