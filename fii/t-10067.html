I've success importing quatities, but not amounts.<br />
The worst is that I don't know how to make the activity estructure..., it's only related with manufacturing????<br />
Could I consider quantities received in purchasing as an activity?..<br />
<br />
I've got some manuals, but only theory. Does someone has any documentation with exemples????.<br />
<br />
I'm completely lost. I'll be gratefull if s.o. could give me some information about that.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />

in order to be able to import amounts in Cost allocation you must define cost category in maintain cost category(tfccal0103m000).<br />
Ex:Cost category:&quot;cat1&quot;<br />
     Description:&quot;Category 1&quot;<br />
Then,from Special go to Maintain Cost category Accounts.You must insert here the accounts from wich you want to import amounts.<br />
Then,you can import amounts also.<br />

 <br />

<br />
I have a problem with allocation of additional costs to purchase lines and calculation of cost price. When i receive a invoice/s after delivery of materials usually there are two lines in invoice/s:<br />
<br />
1. costs for material<br />
2. additional costs<br />
<br />
I want to allocate additional costs to P/O lines and calculate cost price of materials. For this purpose I use cost items in purchase order lines. I execute correctly every step of Purchase Procedure to &quot;Close Received Purchase Orders&quot;. Then i am entering invoice in system and connecting with purchase.<br />
<br />
I try also with additional cost (tdpur4128m000).<br />
<br />
With mentioned operation i can not allocate additional costs to PO lines!<br />
<br />
Can someone help me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esantisteban</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 10:35</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to registrer first all the amounts in finance.<br />
Through the accounts you can allocate amounts in dimensions and, once there, the distribution or allocation into item cost is easy.<br />
<br />
If you want I can send you a manual that describes the possibilities of that module. But it's in Spanish!. If you want it send me your mail to esantisteban@steria.es<br />

costs to purchase order lines and calculate cost price. The cost price will be <br />
different with and without additional costs like freight, packing... When i <br />
have a two lines in with supplier invoice the total amount in invoice can not <br />
be match with amount of PO, because compared it is more. In FINANCE/Accounts <br />
Payable/Transaction Processing/Maintenance/Maintain Transactions i try to match <br />
invoice with purchase order, but matching is by PO line! The PO <br />
have a one order line while invoice two lines. The total amount of PO is <br />
different from total amount of invoice. For the rest amount i have to select <br />
ledger account where additional costs accumulate. In this case i can not <br />
include this additional cost to item cost price. The sessions are:<br />
tfgld1101m000 -&gt; tfacp1110s000 -&gt; tfacp1131s000 -&gt; tfacp1130s000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esantisteban</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that your question is not related to ABC costing.<br />
<br />
In my experience, when you match an invoice with a PO (at line level or at header level) you can exceed the amount, but registering the &quot;price difference&quot; in an account.<br />
<br />
If you have the costing method &quot;average&quot; the system updates the cost price in master items just when you APPROVES the invoice matched.<br />
<br />
There is another costing method that is &quot;lot price&quot;, in this case, you can include the additional costs or surchages since de PO into de item cost, but you need to activate Lot parameters.<br />
<br />
Try approving the invoice and check the item cost.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amyumyun</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a purchase order with a few lines (including DIFFERENT items with <br />
DIFFERENT purchase price).<br />
When i receive supplier invoice with additional cost/s line/s i have to <br />
allocate manually this cost/s (proportionately or like percentage for amount of <br />
line) to every PO lines apart. After allocation i've to put them into field <br />
&quot;Invoiced amount (tfacp1131s000)&quot; summarized with item price, again manualy . <br />
After this operation the system will calculate correctly average purchase price <br />
and last purchase price for every items.<br />
I want the system automaticly to allocate additional costs to PO lines!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esantisteban</div><div class="date">23rd August 2004, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I see the problem.<br />
Desafortunately I think that is not possible in BaaN.<br />
Automatically is too much!!.<br />
<br />
BaaN needs that you put the allocation criteria, by percentages using ABC allocation or manually from matching as you have said.<br />
<br />
I were several months looking for any solution to this requeriment and I didn't find any. If sth comes up to up, please, let me know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Luck!.<br />
