<br />
We are facing a problem in Channel utilization, any help on this is appreciated. Thank you.<br />
<br />
We have IBM Web Sphere v6 on AIX, we have one active channel wich is used by 40 req-res queue, usually it is observed that when channel connections reached 100 then it is not allowing for any new connections and throwing the below error at the client <br />
<br />
&quot;The channel program ended because the channel 'CHANNEL1' is not currently available on the remote system. This could be because the channel is disabled or that the remote system does not have sufficient resources to run a further channel. <br />
MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE, Details: MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE&quot; <br />
<br />
1. Is there any solution for avoiding this problem? <br />
2. Can we configure to handle more than 100 connections per channel?<br />
3. Can we identify the unused / garbage connection if any and close them? <br />
<br />
4. Currently we handle this by restarting the MQ server(Queue Manager), but we would want to avoid this as the data posted would be lost and need to be reposted manually.</div></div><hr />
