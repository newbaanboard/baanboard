How does a payment to customer entered in Baan IV finance? Say, if we have to refund money to customer, how this transaction can be entered. In Maintain Bank Transactions if we select &quot;Customer transaction&quot; Customer account is always credited. In all payment transactions we cannot enter a customer account. Please explain.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

You may have Sales Credit Note for that customer and you can select that document and make payment.<br />

Even if you enter a sales credit note and try to settle that credit note in session tfcmg2100s000 (Customer Transactions) it will still credit customer account, which is not correct. We should be able to debit customer account as money is being paid to customer and credit bank account or cash account.<br />

1) If the amt being paid is towards refund of a sales invoice amount.....<br />
a) Select the same bank/cash transaction type through which u have received the amount. <br />
b)Select type of transaction as customer transaction. <br />
c)Select the same invoice against which u have received earlier the payment.<br />
d)Put a negative sign and enter the exact amount.<br />
e) Process the transaction.<br />
<br />
The system will dr customer and cr bank/cash a/c.<br />
<br />
2) If the amt is refund of advance received same procedure may be followed by selecting type of transactions as advance receipt.<br />
