<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">7th August 2007, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a problem in Baan V. We want to pay to few suppliers before we receive the material i.e based on the Faxed ASN (advanced shipping notice). So what is the besy way ???<br />
I thought that in AP parametere,set 'Match to Order' and then match to order basd on ASN and create the AP transactions and pay it. BUT after a week,IF the physical receipt of quantity is more or less than in ASN then how to handle the situation because we will enter the actual receipt in the system now. How will the ITBR / GRINYA account will be balanced ?? Waiting ...</div></div><hr />

The way we di it here is we treat this as advance to the supplier. When actual receipt comes at that time we record Purchase Invoice and match and approve. Till that time We show amount advance payment or prepaid inventory. Then we offset the Invoice to advance payment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">9th August 2007, 05:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Aravind.I also use the method Advance payment or Expense invoice BUT the problem is there is no where to put the PO number against which we have paid. So later when we try to link the Advance payment with Matched invoice then very difficult to find the correct one. Then sometimes the Invoice comes with higher / lower amount than paid in Advance payment. Is there best way to handle all these things??? Is there any good Baan V standard report which gives all the Advance report details.<br />
<br />
Then what is the meaning of fields 'Match to Order', 'Approve before receipt' in AP parameter. Waiting ...</div></div><hr />

Regarding a report on advance Payment :<br />
You can use the Report Print Invoice from Business Partner Open entriestfacp2421m000 with the flag ON Unallocated/ Advance payment. Keep other flags OFF. You can use TEXT flag on in case if you put your PO number at the time of making payment as text. You can put flag ON  Fully Paid Invoice if you want to see all advance / unallocated Payment already linked to Invoices. You can use the option Anticipated payment if this suits you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">15th August 2007, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Biplab, there is NO field or flag called Unallocated/ Advance payment in Print Invoice from Business Partner Open entries - tfacp2421m000. Is there any other session available. Let me know.Thanks.</div></div><hr />

================================<br />
Aravind, thank you for all the answer but is there any report just to segregate only Advance payments.<br />
Yes, the aging report does not include the Standing order advance payments BUT is there any report available to print these. I could not find one. Let me know.<br />
There is still big problem that even though we create advance payment and then later LINK with the matched invoices BUT we can ONLY Link after the advance payment is RECONCILED which takes around 3 to 4 weeks. So till that time there will not be any link and there will be too many Matched invoices (liability) available in the system. Any thought on this. Waiting ...</div></div><hr />
