<br />
you can use &quot;Credit &amp; Rebill&quot; option in Invoices session (cisli3105m000) to cancel Posted Invoice but system is checking some conditions or prerequisites to cancel posted Invoice. Those Conditions are:-<br />
•Source document (order / contract ...) should still allow changes (the step “Process and Delivered Sales orders” (tdsls4223m000) has not been executed)<br />
•Financial periods of original invoice should be open<br />
•Original invoice is still fully open, so no payments or credit notes linked to it<br />
•Restriction on some types of invoices<br />
•Invoice is not already replaced earlier or is result of replacement<br />
•User is authorized<br />
<br />
I think above information will be helpful to you.</div></div><hr />
