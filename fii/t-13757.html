<br />
When attempting to use balance sheet account &quot;0200&quot; in session Maintain Purchase Invoice Transactions we are getting a message &quot;Account should not be a customer / supplier control account&quot;. <br />
<br />
We did briefly have another 0200 account setup as a control account in one of our other companies (now deleted) but tfgld008 is not shared and neither is tfacp001.<br />
<br />
Can anyone with the code tell me where this session is looking when it validates the ledger account and why it would think that it is a control account.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
Somehow the field tfgls008.nosu Number of times used as a control account had been updated.<br />
<br />
Set to zero and session then allowed us to use 0200.<br />
<br />
Still like to know how this happened though.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

It can lead to control account checklist difference.<br />
<br />
It (nosu) is reset to zero  when all such references are eliminated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">28th November 2003, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Fair point but in company 002 account 0200 is a balance sheet account so I'm not entirely sure how the field was updated.<br />
<br />
When we need to set up 0200 in company 005 again I will try to find out how the table in company 002 is being updated.<br />

<br />
When u make an account a control account / advance payment / unallocated payment / anticipated payment account in tfacp0111s000 , this field is incremented and vice versa when u remove this account.</div></div><hr />
