<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">12th August 2009, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">The standard currency system is replacing the previous ones. It covers the feature of the all the previous ones.<br />
<br />
from the help:<br />
Standard currency system<br />
To meet the financial and tax reporting requirements of multinational companies with subsidiaries in many countries, the standard currency system in ERP LN  offers:<br />
<br />
Direct translation of foreign currency transactions<br />
Foreign currency transactions are translated straight from the transaction  currency to the local currency, without  triangulation  through the  reference  currency. By default, reporting currencies are directly translated from the transaction currency into the reporting currency. However, reporting currencies can also be translated from the local currency.<br />
<br />
Integrations and multiple reporting currencies<br />
Transactions can be recorded in one local currency and up to two reporting  currencies. Only the local currency amounts are logged in the integration transactions, fixed assets, and reconciliation data. Before reporting in one of the reporting currencies, reconciliation of subledgers in the companyâ€™s local currency must take place. Adjustment of reporting currency balances for  currency differences  is supported by the  Calculate Currency Differences (tfgld5201m000)  session, which can be run for the local and the reporting currencies independently. For each of the home currencies the differences will be posted in separate transactions. Reconciliation of integration transactions on business object level is only possible in the local currency.<br />
<br />
Multiple home currencies<br />
A home currency is the local  currency, or a reporting currency used by a company for preparing the financial statement. Amounts in foreign currency are translated into amounts in any of the home currencies by using direct currency rates for the local currency and, depending on the  Translation Method  setting in the  Companies (tcemm1170m000)  session, either the transaction, or the local currency amount for the translation into the reporting currency amounts.<br />
<br />
Currency rotation<br />
Rotate Currency functionality is available:<br />
In General Ledger, ledger history and dimension history sessions.<br />
In Accounts Payable  and  Accounts Receivable, sessions that display information on open items.<br />
In these sessions, within a single company, Rotate Currency is available for every implemented home currency. Within a multicompany selection, Rotate Currency is available for every common currency, using reporting currency groups.<br />
Because reporting currencies are translated according to predefined rules and rate types, currency rates for the reporting currencies cannot be modified during transaction entry.<br />
<br />
Calculation and posting of currency differences<br />
The Calculate Currency Differences (tfgld5201m000)  session can be run for each home currency separately and independently. The currency differences calculation process also considers the exchange rate type, specified on the ledger account, for the local and the reporting currencies independently.<br />
Currency difference transactions are always created for each home currency separately.<br />
The method of calculating currency differences depends on the Translation Method  setting in the  Companies (tcemm1170m000)  session.<br />
<br />
Intercompany transactions<br />
Intercompany transactions are reconciled in the transaction currency. For calculating the local and reporting currency amounts in intercompany transactions, only the transaction amount is used.<br />
If required, in the standard currency system, intercompany accounts can be defined by transaction currency, meaning that the transaction currency determines to which intercompany account the transaction is posted.<br />
<br />
Reference currency<br />
In the standard currency system, the reference currency:<br />
Can be defined independently of the local and reporting currencies.<br />
Can be, but does not  have to be, one of the  home currencies.<br />
Can be used to express amounts that represent amounts across multiple companies, for example, lot prices in Warehouse Management.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
