<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RamSundar</div><div class="date">5th March 2004, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I have setup the Indirect Tasks to capture the Actual Indirect Labor and I can report &amp; process the hours through the Indirect Hours transaction type in the Hours Accounting module.    But, I don't see any Integration Transactions coming through in Finance, when I processed these Indirect hours.    So, I would like to know, how to setup the Integration for this kind of transaction.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">5th March 2004, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">If I remember correctly, Baan does not integrate indirect labor transactions to finance.  We use ADP payroll provider and have to do a file dump up and back during the payroll process.  We have written our own scripts that takes the hours accounting data for indirect labor and assign accounts/dimensions to the transactions based on the task number and employee's home workcenter.  These are then imported into the GL.<br />
<br />
We use a similar process to read hours accounting records to create a payroll accrual for the end of the month (we only accrue indirect labor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">6th March 2004, 00:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, we have done the same.   I work for a consulting firm, we developed a full Time and Attendance system to go on top of Hours Accounting &amp; Interface to payroll.  We wrote JV posting for indirects (among other things).  <br />
If that's not something you would be able to code, we could provide just the indirect posting portion.  It is not freeware, as mentioned we do consulting, but that part alone would be pretty inexpensive, and supported by our firm through upgrades and service packs, etc.<br />
If you have the coding ability, you can fill the JV Import table tfgld213, tfgld214, tfgld215 and then run the standard Baan session to Import as a JV Transaction.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">6th March 2004, 01:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I should also mention a decent non-conventional solution that we found at one of our client sites.  To get the integrations to go through, they just set up a couple production orders that they never closed, and assigned them to post as needed.  They entered production order transactions instead of indirects then.<br />
<br />
It worked well for them for a long  time.  (Until they went with our system that posted indirects).</div></div><hr />
