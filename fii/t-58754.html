<br />
we would like to add a cost for each printed invoice. is it possible on LN ?<br />
<br />
Of course, it's possible to add a cost for each customer order. But it doesn't satisfy us. <br />
<br />
Because for each customer order, we can have many invoices.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks. Regards.</div></div><hr />

This is the answer of infor support.<br />
<br />
In FP6, There is new functionality whereby additional costs can be generated for each shipment and these are released to invoicing together with the delivered sales lines, and can be invoiced together.<br />
<br />
In FP5 and previous versions only possibility is to manage such costs manually. So, when you need to add a cost to an invoice, BEFOREHAND you need to enter a cost line in the sales order, and release that to invoicing. Then invoice the deliveries and cost line together.<br />
There is no possibility of adding cost lines to printed invoices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you please explain the procedure to release the generated cost order along with the delivered sales order to invoicing &amp; also invoicing together? It would be a great help for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

i could not test adding a cost for a shipment since we aren't on FP6. <br />
But we are using additional cost on sales orders.<br />
it quite easy to setup. i don't remember exactly the steps we have done since it's been a long time we did it. But we just used LN help.<br />
You only have to create an additionnal cost. each time you confirm the sales order, the systems asks you if you would like to add the cost item.</div></div><hr />
