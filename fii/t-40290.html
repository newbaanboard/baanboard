<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdirkson</div><div class="date">8th August 2007, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I am running into a significant problem with two of my European locations.  We have an account for Goods Received not Vouchered.  In other words, it is a hold place to match-up inventory receipts prior to receiving the invoice or vice versa.  Once we have both an invoice receipt and an inventory receipt, the account should clear.  It is my understanding that BAAN should be able to manage this process.  However, I am seeing this account balance grow and my finance people cannot seem to reconcile the account.<br />
<br />
Has anyone ran into this problem and has a good process to address this issue.<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP......</div></div><hr />

1.Post all purchase related integration till a particular period.<br />
2.finalize all purchase batches till that period.<br />
3.Run session &quot;Select values for GRNI Reconciliation(Interim Table) tfacp1235m000. Put the ledger as you told. It seems these sites are new, so put the period /year well covering all transactions pooibly took place. Use &quot;Only Finalized Transactions&quot; and also put flag on for &quot;Print error report&quot;<br />
4. Run session Global Acceptance of GRNI Reconciliaton tfacp1237m000. put  year/period covering from the beginning. use order type=purchase. select &quot;all posting&quot; and also put on the flag &quot;only orders with debit and Credit balanced&quot;. Put very minimal tolerance, if u think.<br />
then &quot;Accept&quot;.<br />
5. Run Report  &quot;Print GRNI Reconciliation-Balances tfacp1435m000. this will show u the details of reconciliation with the Interim GL and you will be able to identify the orders which are participating in the reconciliation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdirkson</div><div class="date">10th August 2007, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">both sites recently upgraded their systems.  With this let me go back in history and review older transactions?  If not, are there tables / queries I can get access to that will show me material receipts and invoice receipts and then let me match up the transactions.  If I can get access to the data, I can manipulate the information as necessary.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">11th August 2007, 03:09</div></div><div class="posttext">What version were these companies on?   What are they on now?    If they migrated everything thing to the new version then you should be able to get all of the receipt and matching information provided it wasn't deleted.<br />
<br />
A balance that continues to grow often signifies that the integration mapping scheme was incorrectly setup.  Are there any other accounts with reconciliation issues?</div></div><hr />
