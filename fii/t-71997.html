Please see my attachment. In detail layout vertical lines are not completely printing. There are two detail layouts, one for printing invoice lines and other for showing &quot;to be continued&quot; text when the lines exceed the limit of line number 46 and go to next page for printing remaining invoice lines. In this attached case there is only two invoice lines, in-which for the remaining lines (till 46 line no) i want to print the vertical lines.</div></div><hr />
