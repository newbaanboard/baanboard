<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">8th October 2009, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">We use MCR on 4c4 (Service Pack 14).<br />
We have 1 company using Â£GB and 3 others using Euros.<br />
<br />
We perhaps don't use it in a completely standard way but if you have any questions, I may be able to answer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pablin</div><div class="date">8th October 2009, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Ed, let me explain a case of an implementation we have.<br />
<br />
There is a company that has the headquarter in USA, but has several subsidiaries all over the world.<br />
<br />
One of them is in Argentina, where we have the implementation of this particular subsidiary with the multycurrency VRC package and with two currencies foe the accounting process, that are the local currency and US Dollars.<br />
<br />
The company in Argentina is one fiscal entity, so the normal currency for the accounting process is the local one, but we have the USD currency activated so at the end of the month the report to the headqueartes is automatically done in this second currency that is the same as the headquarters.<br />
<br />
This means that every transaction is posted to the accountability in the two currencies, and that we have two accountabilities at the same time.<br />
<br />
The question is if your implementations have been done is this way, because we are looking for other companies that uses this kind of model.<br />
<br />
Thanks and kind regards.<br />

<br />
Well.... we have 3 home currencies switched on - GBP, Euros &amp; US$. We actually don't report from our system in US$ (but we could if we wanted to). We chose MCR because 3 companies report locally in Euros and 1 in GBP but they share a logistical company. Our main home currency is Euro so everything is &quot;derived&quot; from that.<br />
<br />
All of our transactions are kept in all 3 currencies - we just don't take much notice of the US$ (HC3) version!<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />
