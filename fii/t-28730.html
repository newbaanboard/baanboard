I need to make cost allocation between ledger accounts from GL.<br />
Please, can somebody tell me how it is supposed to link the secondary accounts for the first time with the primary ledger accounts, because I can only use secondary accounts in CAT module?<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have the same issue with you, maybe if we can try it together the result will be better. I have manage to set the Chart of account. secondary credit for the amount to be distribute and secondary debit for distributed amount, however, I could not find the link between Primary account to secondary credit account. In the controlling document, it says that actual cost transaction where the normal account is Debit will be transfer to chart of account that is secondary credit for later be distributed to secondary debit. The relation between secondary credit and secondary debit account themselves are set in Allocation relation (tfcat4500m000).<br />
<br />
According to what I read this are the steps need to follow:<br />
1. Import the actual Cost from GLD<br />
2. Create the Allocation relation<br />
3. Process Cost Allocation<br />
4. Post cost allocation result<br />
5. Finalize the batch.<br />
<br />
however, I could not still manage because the distributed amount equals to zero...:(<br />
<br />
How about you..?any progress? thanks</div></div><hr />

Please give me your email address. I have found the way to allocate cost. The key is the setting of your Chart Of Account. This is how the sistem works.<br />
<br />
Main account cost where you use for transaction the set up is as follow, you set the Allocation type as primary. Then you make two additional COA, one as secondary credit and the other one as secondary debit. The secondary debit is the ledger account where the allocated amount. While the secondary credit is the ledger account for the total of all primary ledger accounts that you set to be allocated.    <br />
<br />
Those setting is important in order to be succed to run session &quot;Import Actual Cost from GLD&quot;<br />
<br />
The Allocation Rules you can review the controlling document.<br />
<br />
Hope it will help you.</div></div><hr />
