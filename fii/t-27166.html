<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 23:17</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have recurring periodic payments (say for leased equipment $1000 a month for a year -Jan through Dec), how do you handle this without having to remember to enter an AP invoice for that month's payment?  <br />
<br />
Other than entering a monthly document, the only way that I can see to do it is in January, enter a document for $12,000 into AP, booking it against a prepaid account.  Then set up a schedule in Maintain Payment Schedules (tfacp1103m000 or the sub-session for the document entry) for 12 payments- one a month through December). Then set up a recurring journal entry to book $1000 monthly to the lease expense from the prepaid account.  <br />
<br />
Is there an easier way to do this, or an alternative?  My AP department is asking and I haven't seen anything else in Baan to handle this.  We have tried setting up a PO with either 12 lines (one per month) or one line with a quantity of 12, but that seems to have just made more work since someone has to remember to receive that intangible service.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ran this by our finance consultant, Judy Miller.  Here's her reply:<br />
<br />
Find Finance/Cash Management/Supplier Payments/Processing/Maintain Standing Orders.  Use Posting Method Costs.  You can then set up recurring payments and these will be selected with the appropriate check run. It is a little awkward to set up because you have to do the GL Distribution for each payment but once it is set it is done.  <br />
<br />
Baan Solution number 130960 has a process flow for you.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions on the process once in, post on up.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you very much!<br />
<br />
I do agree that the assignment of the ledger account and dimensions is a bit awkward.</div></div><hr />
