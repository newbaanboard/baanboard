<br />
Also check integration mapping for Purchase receipt.<br />

<br />
Possibilty is that the GRNI A/c in integration account is not maintained, because at the time of approving the supplier invoice system reverses GRNI A/c and the registered invoices A/c. So check the integration mapping once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hpng98</div><div class="date">6th January 2007, 02:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Iam not sure is the situation below cause the error or not.First the purchasing maintain order as cost Item(code), so they keyin the <br />
department code as PM8,<br />
Sales Ledger Account Number as 11540 ,<br />
cost center as 4208.<br />
<br />
After that the Purchasing change the record from cost code to stock code,<br />
so as I know , they suppose empty the department code, ledger account no &amp; cost center column..but they didn't take out.<br />
<br />
Is this will cause the matching error ? If yes,how should I do or which backdoor I should change because the record already maintain receipt and issue out, changes is not allowed.<br />
<br />
Thanks alot.</div></div><hr />
