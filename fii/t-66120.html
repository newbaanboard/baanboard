What kind of tax-code(s) are you using, so that the base of tax-calculation is correct as well as the tax itselve.<br />
Possible solutions?:<br />
* multiple tax lines, with second line as &quot;expense purchase tax&quot;<br />
* singular tax; 1 with 21% and 1 with 10,5%<br />
* others, and perhaps easier and better solutions?<br />

You may answer in Dutch.</div></div><hr />

thx for your reply.<br />
<br />
As you have done an implementation in Belgium, I am also curious how treated in CMG the non-SEPA payments.<br />
<br />
For SEPA payments it is possible to use the XML-file; I already sent a file to the bank and it was correct, but what are the values in CMG-Master data- payment/receipt methods to create a correct non-SEPA-file?<br />
<br />
best regards,<br />
