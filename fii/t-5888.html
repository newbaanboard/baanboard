With the movement towards integrating Crystal Reports with Baan for the Financial Statements functionality, we thought that this would be a timely topic. What we are planning to do is provide a brief overview of the Crystal functionality for handling FST, as well as information on the templates available from Baan. Then we would like to go over some real-life examples from customers who either have implemented or are implementing Crystal for financial statements. In order to make the presentation/discussion most effective, we would like to get some feedback/input from other users on what types of questions you might have regarding Crystal, what types of issues you have run into when working with Financial statements, and if you are using Crystal, would you have any examples of reports that you have created that you would be willing to share with the group. We are also looking into the availability of someone from Seagate as well to be able to answer questions.</div></div><hr />
