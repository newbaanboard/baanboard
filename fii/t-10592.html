<br />
We are having a muli-finance/multi-logistics set up.  In this set up the value of the field &quot;Payments by company group&quot; in the CMG Parameters (tfcmg0100m000) is set to &quot;NO&quot; for all companies in the group except the group company.  <br />
<br />
My problem is like this, When maintaining a payment advice in the group company I can manually select the invoice pertaining to any of the other companies, however when maintaining payment advice in the other companies I am not able to select invoices for any other company.<br />
<br />
My requirement is that I should be able to pay the invoices of any company in the group from any other company in the group.  How can I do this?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
sharing tfcmg000 does not work.  This in effect makes the parameter for the other companies the same as that of the group company and since the group company has select by company group as yes, this does not allow any processing in the supplier payment bus. obj.<br />
<br />
Also, I am not very sure about the effects of sharing a parameter table.  <br />

Can you not set payment by group company to yes and give selected people limited access to the group company to do payment runs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The scenario is like this.<br />
<br />
The client has three units at multiple locations.  Each of these units has its own bank account.  Now any one of these units may make payments for invoices in any of the other units.  With this kind of selection requirement, I would need to select invoices for other companies from all companies and hence the requirement.<br />
<br />
The entries in the ledger accounts can be tracked.  It would not be a major problem.  So is there a solution?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Standard Baan , only Group Co can make payments for invoices of other companies .  I would suggest that you better go for customization .  <br />

<br />
When the parameter for payments by Gr Company is yes then payments can be made only frm Gr Company. <br />
<br />
However the help for this field in CMG Parameters has the following sentence for the value NO : <br />
<br />
&quot;In case of Manual Payments Via Maintain Payment Advice it is always possible to pay the invoices within the group Company&quot;.<br />
<br />
The help for the field original Company in the session Maintain payment advice says similar things. However both sessions do not give the conditions under which payments can be made for invoices within the group company.<br />
