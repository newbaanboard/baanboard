We just started this and NatWest is rejecting the file we are trying to upload which is standard baan output.<br />
You can contact me through PM if you don't want to provide info here directly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">22nd February 2019, 22:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I ended up replacing most logic in the report script with my own code in Baan4 and LN since the standard version wasn't exactly what we needed.  <br />
<br />
Biggest issue that we encountered for HSBC was that the record lengths needed to be variable for the header (80) and standard/contra lines (100) so used a custom device and 3gl program to post process the file to remove invalid characters for BACS and to write the line with a fixed length based on line type.  The same script can handle archiving created files and movement to a different location on the server.  <br />
<br />
Another issue was that we could only post on a  BACS working day.  We created a calendar for BACS with the valid days identified as working days.  The report script read this calendar and posted on the next valid working day.<br />
<br />
We also replaced the separate fields in the standard BACS report with a single field for each line with the separate fields concatenated in the report script.  Made it easier to format based on the requirements.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another option is to create the file using seq* statements in the report script with the location and name that you need and ignore the layout fields completely.  This way, you can manage the record length from within the report script (fixed strings at 80 and 100  characters) and optionally send the file to a client or FTP location.  You still need a BACS device and script to remove the file (probably empty) that's created by default from the report to allow for reposting if needed.</div></div><hr />

We found the same issue with the std report being 100 characters long for each layout. We modified the layouts by removing the 20 character filler field Infor added to each.<br />
<br />
Strange thing now is that even though Natwest keeps rejecting the file, we are in the process of changing over to HSBC and they accepted a test file no problem.<br />
Guess we shall see once we switch over for real.</div></div><hr />
