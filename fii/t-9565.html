Do we really need this? <br />
Are your experience positive or negative?<br />

<br />
I got the answer from Baan itself and the structure I mentioned is correct but it's for automotive (thus the ags0; the fba3 is the finance brush-up 1-3 for automotive): that I'm deleting after been installed because the application people requested the wrong installation, doh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">10th April 2003, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Thomas,<br />
<br />
not sure if you will *need* this. There are a lot of Baan users in Germany that don't have it, and some more who have it but don't use it and some more who have it but use only a part of it. There is some functionality added that some old-fashioned german bookkeepers like to see (like &quot;Journaldruck mit Gegenkonten&quot;, oder &quot;Auszifferungen&quot;) because they are used to it. But these are implemented &quot;on top&quot; of the Baan way of doing financials and those concepts don't go together nicely. Anyway, there are some helpful features for thing like &quot;Umsatzsteuerverprobung&quot; - even if badly documented. And again some other sessions for debitor/creditor analysis, but they are as unreliable as the standard sessions in some cases.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a bit<br />
Uli</div></div><hr />

<br />
for what kind of work do you need the Finance Brush Up?<br />
<br />
Uli Fuchs told you something about this helpfull sessions included in Baan Finance Brush up.<br />
<br />
Another thing is the posibility to import Bookings from external Programms. We used this for the Import of Bookings from our external asset accounting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your replies! <br />
<br />
Have a nice day!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">24th April 2003, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">The import of bookings is in the Baan IV standard, not in the Finance brushup!</div></div><hr />
