<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">15th July 2009, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I sometimes encounter a funny situation in which the balance of the customer receipt becomes opposite sign - meaning positive. Let me explain the situation in details.<br />
<br />
The Customer pays USD 10000. Our home currency is SGD. Now we have unpaid invoices for the Customer in SGd as well as USD. Based on customer's instructions, the AR staff allocates the total amount to 5 invoices totalling to USD 11000. Now what happens is that the customer receipt document gets a positive sign becasue we have allocated more than what we received. The entries are something like this (all in Home currency)<br />
<br />
               AR control      Unallocated      Bank      <br />
Receipt                           15000-         15000+<br />
Allocation     16000-         16000+<br />
<br />
So now the Receipt document has a positive balance of say SGD 1000 (USd 620). The transactions are already finalised and no corrections can be done. <br />
<br />
This Receipt document now appears in the Customer's statement as a debit. <br />
<br />
What entries do I do to correct the situation since all the accounts are control accounts ?<br />
<br />
I tried to create a manual invoice and try to match it but cannot. Any suggestions are welcome.<br />
<br />
I tried to simulate the situation but I cannot. I don't know what the user does specially to achieve this.</div></div><hr />
