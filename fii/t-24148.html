I really need some advice from you guys out there.<br />
<br />
There is a problem in finance for GL.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The opening balance for all account become 0 .<br />
They are supposed to carry forward last years balance.<br />

<br />
So, the closing period for each period and all accounts are wrong and need to be corrected.<br />

Can I use session tfgld3203m000: Rebuild Opening Balance/History from Transaction or any other way to solve the problem.<br />

<br />
If you had close the previous year through Close year(tfgld6203m000) you can do a rebuild with tfgld3203m000.<br />
Otherwise you can run Close year -provisional(tfgld6201m000) and the values for opening balance will be complete.<br />
hope this help<br />

To make mihaelagr's point more clear:  Opening balances won't come automatically.  What is the status of your previous year.  If you have not yet closed or at least provisionally closed your previous year, obviously you wont get your opening balance for current year.  So, check the previous year.  First you need to CLOSE YEAR PROVISIONALLY.  Then you will get the opening balance in the current year.<br />
<br />
Please note:  If you have already PROVISIONAL CLOSED the year, and still you are not etting the opening balance, it means somebody would have run &quot;tfgld3203m000: Rebuild Opening Balance/History from Transaction&quot;  This session resets the opening balance to zero, if the year is not yet Finally closed.  Nothing to worry, go back and PROVISIONAL CLOSE the year again, and you will get your balances right :)<br />
