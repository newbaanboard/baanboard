<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aysinerten</div><div class="date">20th October 2009, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">We want to create a new group company in Baan using mcr and pcs.<br />
We have the following problem/question described below.<br />
According to management decision, there will be three profit center. Two  of them will operate in projects which may last more than couple of years and third one will provide service to the operating units , means that it will issue invoices for their activity to the operating units internally.<br />
And also all the units expect project based accounting which includes <br />
1 Preparation of Project budget forecast<br />
2 Project Budget and actual control <br />
3 Communication of local elements (Full and complete communication of the local element of the project to the leading unit is made on due time)<br />
4 Project cost controlling (Project costs, working capital and cash including actual and forecast project cash flows are controlled and reported)<br />
And also since they consolidate accounting results in their reports each unit should receive a unique report (Trial Balance) separetely.<br />
According to the definition it seems that operation needs usage of fundemental BaaN modules such as AR , AP, GL, Cash Man. , Project, ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Our main question is about BaaN set up (Single Fin./Single Log. OR Multi Fin./Multi Log.)??<br />
Due to the technical maintenance risks and pour support resources we don't want to create useless Baan companies which will be obsolete in some years. But in single finance and single logistics case we could not find a logical solution in cash transactions for unit based reporting.<br />
And we could not find any solution (logical or not) about inter unit transactions.<br />
Could you please share your comments in order to finalise the subject properly.</div></div><hr />

Have you considered single finance with multilogistics companies?<br />
I think this will fit your need best due to if you use single finance and single logistic, you should create at least 3 companies, and a consolidate process must be done.<br />
<br />
With, single finance and multilogistic companies, you can have the following configuration:<br />
Lets say: Finance company: 100, services company: 200, logistics companies: 400, 400 and 500. All the logistics will report to the finance company (100) and in the accountability you can define in dimension1 the three different operational units that will recieve the transactions of the logistics via integrations. With this, you can have a full trial balance with all the transactions of your operational centers without done a consolidation process, or if you need a trial balance with a specific  center, you can list a trial balance with that specific dimension.<br />
<br />
The compnay 200 will serve as a service company, where their only operation will be payroll manage and invoce the service to the others.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

As far as understood from your advice the &quot;One finance One logistic&quot; solution does not help us ...<br />
But to create four companies ?? This is actually what we avoid..<br />
<br />
As the operational units do not implement ilc and/or inv...And they will only use not physical items to create sales or purchase, s pcs module would help us using one dimension as project code. But then we have the problem in cash transactions. Because in cash batches there is no opportunity to use dimensions..Are you familiar with pcs?</div></div><hr />

Yes, I´m familiar with PCS. In my opinion if you can´t use dimensions code to split your operational center´s transactions, you can chosse from tree options, if you are not considering the customization:<br />
1.- At GLD level, you can create separate accounts to manage the specific cash transactions of your operational centers. You will have, several payment or collect methods but one each asigned to a specific account for that operational center.<br />
2.- You can create separate the cash transaction for each operational center at Transaction type level: By example: you can use cash number 400 for operational center 1, 410 for operational center 2 and then.. with this, you can split the cash operations using an analysis by type transaction in GLD.<br />
3.- Same as the point above, you can define type series for the cash transactions to split it in the accountability: Let say: Cash type 400, series 10 for operational center 1, 30 for operational center 2 and then, the analysis will be also done with transaction analysis by type transaction.<br />
<br />
Of course, in the trial balance you will see all the transactions resume, if you need to analize some specific operational center, you have to done a larger analysis, and extra work. <br />
<br />
I believe that option 1 or 2 best fits to your needs.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
