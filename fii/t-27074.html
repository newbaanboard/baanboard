<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francisco Díaz</div><div class="date">10th May 2006, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello.  It is a case for BaanIVc4<br />
I would like to know how to update correctly Last Purchase Price, and Average Purchase Price of an item, supposing that I receive two or more Invoices from different Suppliers for one P.O.  By means of an example I will try to explain the case.<br />
<br />
I make a Purchase Order for a supplier in a another country: <br />
1 piece<br />
1.00<br />
 I will receive the item and the supplier´s Invoice:<br />
1 piece<br />
1.00<br />
In addition, I will reeive another invoice from a different supplier for the transport of the item<br />
Freight costs= 1.00<br />
In addition, I will receive an Invoice from a customs agent, related with this Import.<br />
Customs agency=  1.00<br />
What I want?  I need to reflect in the item, the total of the three invoices, not only the amount of the item´s supplier, so the Average Purchase price should be 3.00 and the Latest Purchase Priceb should be 3.00<br />
<br />
I have tried matching the three invoices with the same P.O., combining different ways of matching them.(with one piece, with zero pieces).  There is no way.  The two prices in the item master are updating incorrectly.  <br />
Does anyone know a way to do this correctly?<br />
Any idea or suggestion will be appreciated.<br />
Thank in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
The solution which i am give is not a correct one but a work around and it works perfectly.<br />
<br />
When u receive the invoice for the material match this invoice to the order partially even if the quantity and amount is matching and approve the invoice. When you receive the second invoice enter the invoice in Mainatin Transaction. In the PO field enter the Po number and save. The system will give you a warning saying that the order is on different supplier. AFter clicking &quot;OK&quot; it will display the Po and here u match again which was partially matched earlier. and approve the invoice. Repeat the steps of second invoice as many times as possible. see to it that when the last invoice is book the matching must be done completely. <br />

I´ll try the way you describe.  What I´ve done before is very similar.  I am able to reconciliate as many invoices as needed.  That is not a problem itself.  The problem is that the Last Purchase Price and Average Purchase Price fields in the reconciliated item are not properly updated.<br />
