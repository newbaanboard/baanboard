     I have a question about the purchase integration,that it is when does the Purchase+Revaluation is triggered.<br />
     Some reference say that &quot;This transaction is generated if the goods receipt date is earlier than the date of latest cost price update in Item Data&quot;,and I have tried it ,but failed.<br />

<br />
The warehouse/revaluation transaction you see should only pertain to items that were received and in your warehouse at the time of the revaluation.<br />
<br />
The purchase/revaluation works as follows:<br />
<br />
On June 1, you create a purchase order for 1 piece of item A, whose standard cost at the time you issue the PO is 5.<br />
<br />
On June 5, you recalculate your standard cost, and it is now 7.<br />
<br />
On June 6, you physically receive the item, but backdate the receipt date in BaaN to June 4.  You should get a Purchase/Receipt integration for 5, (Debit Goods, Credit AP Accrual) and a Purchase/Revaluation integration for 2 (Debit Goods, Credit Revaluation).<br />
<br />
This works in our system just as BaaN says it should.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda</div></div><hr />
