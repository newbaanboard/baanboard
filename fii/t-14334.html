<br />
Once you created a billing request you're stuck with it. There is no way to delete it, after composing invoices you will have to print and post them at some point. If you selected the wrong invoices: tough. If you spot errors on the draft invoices (wrong VAT, wrong discount etc): tough. You'll have to raise credit notes and start again.<br />
<br />
We have problems with this on a regular basis, and the general table maintenance required to fix the problems is tricky and time consuming. We have had cases where users intend to invoice one project (from tp, not pcs) and by accident also selected hundreds of sales orders from other logistical companies.</div></div><hr />
