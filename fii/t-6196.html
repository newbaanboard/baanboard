<br />
While finalizing Batches, Some times i am getting a message &quot;Background process Not Yet Completed&quot;. This message comes in two places. <br />
<br />
1. At the time of selecting a batch.<br />
2. At the time of Finalizing a batch.<br />
<br />
The problem is, for some batches, even after running the session &quot;invoke background process&quot;, still it is showing the message. I checked in the GTM [tfgld102] for the batch. The Background process indicator for all  the documents against the batch is &quot;Processed&quot; This problem majorly coming for Integration Batches. <br />
<br />
Can i get the reason of this with a solution.</div></div><hr />

Also check the display error log (tfgld1506m000) for those batches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">13th August 2002, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Balaji - <br />
<br />
What is the update mode of your integration transaction types? (session tfgld0111m000).<br />
<br />
When we first went live, we had ours set to End of Session.  We ran into tremendous problems with the background process, even after running the Invoke session.  Many times we had to let them set overnight in order for the status to change.<br />
<br />
We changed our update mode to Finalization, and the problem went away.  (please note that this change must be done when there are no existing transactions for the transaction type - everything must be posted.) <br />
<br />
Another thing that can cause the slow process is if you have many different types of integrations using the same transaction type.  This can cause you to get the &quot;in use&quot; error.<br />
<br />
We had also experienced the problem with missing tax/reporting periods as mentioned by venkat500.  We are on version IVc2.  The problem was caused by creating batches in the Maintain Transactions session instead of the Maintain Batch Status session.  Once we began using the Maintain Batch Status session, the problem was resolved.<br />
<br />
Hope this info helps.<br />

Hello,<br />
    I also want to change the mode to finalization, but we have go live, history transactions have existed, in this scenario, how to do? Posted or Finalization all transactions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think only if you finalized all the open transactions, you can change the finalization mode. No matter if historical data existed.<br />

<br />
Anthony is correct - the change can be made as long as all transaction are finalized.  That is what I meant when I said no existing transactions - I should have clarified and said no unposted transactions.  <br />
<br />
Sorry for the confusion, and good luck.  I hope this helps you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdixit</div><div class="date">16th September 2002, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally all system-generated transactions update mode should be Finalization <br />
i.e. All Integrations transactions, all recurring transaction, automatic balancing of P&amp;L transaction, final close year transaction, FAS transaction and ANP/ANR transaction from CMG.<br />
<br />
Background process is a Unix feature; never keep update mode other then finalization in NT for any transaction type.</div></div><hr />
