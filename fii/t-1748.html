<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">18th April 2002, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">In the process of trying to understand a little more about integration I am looking at a Purchase Order via session tfgld4510m000 and I am trying to work out what has caused the transactions in tfgld410.<br />
<br />
I believe that the second transaction has been caused by a difference between the item price and the purchase price but the figure the systrem has calculated doesn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
Knowledgebase says;<br />
<br />
&quot;If there is any difference between the purchase order amount and the fixed transfer price  in the Maintain Item Data (tiitm0101m000) session, or between the purchase order amount and the invoice amount in the Approve Purchase Invoices (tfacp1140s000) session, a transaction generated is for that difference under the combination of Purchase and Result.&quot;<br />
<br />
What is the fixed transfer price and how is this calculated ?<br />
<br />
Any assistance appreciated<br />

<br />
Any changes in cost either at reciept stage or invoice approval stage will generate a purchase result in integration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My standard cost price is 2.6147 GBP and this was last rolled up at the end of last year.<br />
<br />
My purchase price is 4.3 EUR = 4.3 * 0.620463 = 2.668 GBP<br />
<br />
Whatever numbers I put into my calculator I cannot get the amount of 2.86 shown on the second line of my screen dump.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
It's a bit difficult to advise, not being able to look at your data.  What was the quantity on your purchase order?  <br />
<br />
You also need to take into account exchange rate fluctuations which may take place from the time you placed the order to the time you reciept it, and do the match in finance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">19th April 2002, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Maria,<br />
<br />
My order quantity is 270 and I think that the 2.86 is being caused by changes in the exchange rate.<br />
<br />
Exchange rate on order = 0.610538 and the exchange rate on the receipt is 0.620463.<br />
<br />
(0.620463 - 0.610538) * 270 = 2.68<br />
<br />
So I'm getting closer.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Neal</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, the exchange rate differences could certainly account for the differences.</div></div><hr />
