I dont know how it got deleted. We can restore the data from old backup. But can anybody guide me what could be the probable reason of these getting deleted. Is there any way (other than audit) to find out whoi has done this. Or how it would have been done by mistake. The GTM acess is limited to IT department only.

for me it seems to be a question &quot;who has manipulated the database&quot; and not which Baan-User did something.<br />
Of course, a user ist able to delete data via using the application, even accounts can be deleted as long as they were not used in the past (no history, no references).<br />
But the field &quot;Financial Supplier Group&quot; in supplier data is a mandatory field, the content can not be deleted by a user in the Baan-application (a user might be able to change it which causes enough problems :-), but not to delete the content). So, whoever deleted the content of the field was able to disregard checks of references in the Baan-application.<br />
I would ask the colleagues in the IT-department, especially in the team managing the database. ttaad is possible as well, but for that the related fields/ records seem to be too selective.<br />
