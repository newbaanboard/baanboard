<br />
not sure whether I fully understood what you are looking for, but if you are interested in watching which updates have been performed in the baan tables, I would advice you to set the environment variable DBS_LOG=0000010.<br />
This makes the bshell log all DBS-actions (of this user) in the file dbs.log (in the home directory of the Baan user). As you will be using the GUI, you must enter the following in the bottom input field: <br />
-- -set DBSLOG=0000010<br />
Be careful to watch your disk space, the dbs.log may get REALLY huge fast.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. What I would like to know is there any way by some report I can find out what is the last date upto which the transaction entry are made in each modules. This will help in fixing the responsibility for not entering the transactions in the system immediately. We face problem in end user not entering the transactions immediately in the system. Hope I could make myself clear.<br />

<br />
the tfgld418 of finance should be your friend then.<br />
The key consists of:<br />
Company<br />
Transaction origin (purchase/sales .. etc)<br />
Transaction in finance<br />
Date<br />
Time<br />
<br />
It should be easy to have a report generated for this table.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />
