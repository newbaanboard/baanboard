<br />
It seems cost sales order for the same BP is not getting clubbed into one invoice with other sales order for the same BP.<br />
<br />
Clubbing of orders are working fine for other items/sales order but not for cost sales order. Can you please provide some insight on this? Please let me know your thought.<br />
<br />
We are using LN 10.4.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
