<br />
Currently we have multiple companies in Baan (100=NL, 177=Turkey, 188=China). Invoices that are created for Turkey are paid by our accounts payable (NL), but we also assign the receipt of the payment to the created invoices. We do this manually, is there a way to automate this process because now it feels pointless but above all, very slow (payment often consists of over 200 invoices).<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

you can pay the invoices with a cash run. This means that you select your invoices for payment (with session tfcmg1220m000). Thereby you get an payment advice containing all invoices you want to pay. When you process the payment advice the postings are made in the GL and a clearing file can be created for upload to the Bank.<br />

<br />
Thanks you for responding. Am I correct to say that what you describe is only the payment to our company 177?<br />
<br />
My information might be incomplete, what we want to do is use the same information in the clearing file (paid / to pay invoices) to clear our Sales invoices. All payments and receipts are done in NL so we want to assign the money we pay to ourself (177) to the invoices.<br />
<br />
I hope you understand what I mean, if not please tell me what you need to know about our situation and I will try to elaborate.<br />

<br />
Just wanted to tell you all this issue has been resolved. The key lies in using the direct debit function in Baan!<br />

Thanks for the support.</div></div><hr />
