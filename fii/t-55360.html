<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hpng98</div><div class="date">16th March 2009, 04:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
When the user print the &quot;Finalized Transactions&quot; , they notice that the &quot;Amount in FC &quot; is SAME with &quot;Amount in Home currency&quot;  (both also show in FC ).<br />
<br />
<br />
But actually Amount in FC SHOULD BE  DIFFERENT with  home curreny.<br />
<br />
So, I check the Maintain PO side,  the &quot;Currency Rate&quot; is correct.<br />
      I check Maintain Supplier side, the &quot;Currency&quot; is correct.<br />
<br />
      I notice this is 1st order for this supplier.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, can anyone please guide me, where else I need to check the problem ?<br />
<br />
Thanks ALot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">16th March 2009, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">You have not mentioned any error message so I'd guess you first need to check  the exchange rates between your home currency (HC) and the overseas currency (FC)<br />
This can be done via session maintain currency rates, program: tcmcs0108m000. If it's not that in your version you should find the session somewhere in maintain financial tables. <br />
<br />
If you have the currency and the correct rate, next place to look are the generic tables, amongst other things these tables are used to set up the availablilty of the currency across the modules. So it's possible to have a currency set up but you cant use it in a particular module. There are a number of sessions involved in this and be a little careful as the generic tables affect the system globally so can affect other users if you have a mutli company set up.  The sessions are <br />
ttaad1106m000 &quot;Maintain Generic Units&quot; <br />
ttaad1107m000 &quot;Maintain Formats by Generic Unit&quot;<br />
<br />
Also <br />
ttaad1108m000 &quot;maintain default formats by format code&quot;<br />
ttadv4185m000 &quot;maintain formats&quot;<br />
<br />
You should only need these two if the currency does not exist at all in the generic tables.<br />
<br />
Hope this is of help to you.<br />

<br />
For your info , all other records is no problem. only happend for one new supplier.<br />
Is that anything related to supplier setting  ? but I have check the maintain supplier.....it look like OK.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Kindly check the currency as attached to the Supplier.<br />
Also check the PO is being made in which currency.<br />
<br />
Other than this, I do not forsee anything else that would trigger the amounts wrongly.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">17th March 2009, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Rajasekhar, although you mentioned you had already checked these.<br />
Also the fact you are not getting any error message supports the thought that the basic set up is right.<br />
<br />
You should be looking on form 3 of the supplier<br />
and form 2 of the purchase order. Don't forget that when adding an order you can change an overseas exchage rate specific to the order but you cannot change the rate again once you have saved the order. If someone has accidently changed the rate you will need to go directly into the tables to change. NOt something to take on lightly as often there is more than one table that requires changing.<br />
