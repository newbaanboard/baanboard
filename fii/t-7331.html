<br />
Is it possible to output the CFNOB bank file format used by the French banks directly from Baan?<br />
We have looked at other countries file formats (ttadv2112s000) but France does not seem to be included.<br />
We also wish to make electronic bank payments in Italy.<br />
<br />
Baan support say that a customisation is required.<br />
Have any other users had the same problem or could offer advice?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
