The GRINYA solutions of BaaN do not really seem to be helping.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate if anybody can throw light on this.  We are not able to get a supplierwise breakup of ITBR, duly tallied with the General Ledger account in Finance<br />
<br />
Best regards.<br />

<br />
Run the session select values for Receivable Invoices Specifications (tfacp1235m000) and then print the receivable invoices specifications (finance) report. This should be giving U a breakup of the difference as to manual transactions, Unmatched purchase invoices and mismatched ledger entries.<br />
<br />
These details will be available at the bottom end of the report for balance per orderline<br />
<br />
U can get the manual transactions details from table tfacp135 by using appropriate query.<br />
<br />
However this report does not help 100% since i am unable to get the breakup for mismatched ledger entries.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
