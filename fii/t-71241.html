<br />
For STD costing for purchased items, our system is using Avg purch price based on Current Inventory parameter.<br />
<br />
*  Current Inventory			<br />
The average purchase price is based on the following:			<br />
§  The price of a new receipt.			<br />
§  The average price of the current inventory.			<br />
      			<br />
APN = ((PR * QR) + (APO * ILO)) ÷ (QR + ILO)			<br />
			<br />
APN	Average purchase price (new)		<br />
APO	Average purchase price (old)		<br />
PR	Price of the new receipt		<br />
QR	Quantity of the new receipt		<br />
CRO	Cumulative receipt quantity (old)		<br />
ILO	Inventory level (old)		<br />
<br />
I would like to figure out how to calculate ILO above to RE-CREATE this rolling APP in the LN system as we are going to do some analysis on how our inventory will be impacted based on changing.<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me in the right direction of HOW to re-create the Inventory levels in LN per item. I am not sure what tables/sessions to look.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

you can follow the MAUC by WH in Session whina1512m000 which keeps track on every single WH entry. The MAUC is more accurate than the AP you see on the Item Data in case there is a multisite environment involved. <br />

<br />
Thanks for pointing out this session. I know the MAUC is often the same as the STD (and in our case the APP), but not always the case for us. Using this session I don't think I could re-create the average. Would you have any ideas on this ? I can see when the MAUC changed from correct amount to the Avg Price, but the variables that make up the calculation and inventory levels I don't know.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
the main difference between AP and MAUC is that the AP is calculated across warehouse receipts whereas the MAUC is the average for an item per WH.<br />
Provided you do have 2 Warehouses A + B, using Item 4711 and you do have a receipt of 1 pcs. each  for both of them:<br />
<br />
Date         WH A             WH B        MAUC  A      MAUC B               Average Price<br />
01.07.       100,--             -----              100,--           ----                       100,--<br />
05.07.        -----               120,--             100,--        120,--                   110,--<br />
<br />
Since you do use Standard Costs it is not possible to log the MAUC for all Warehouses grouped to the same WH Valuation Group hence you will have to create a report for that yourself unfortunately. But formular should be clear how to do so and everything can be retrieved from whina1512m000. There is no other table hidden so that will be in my point of view the best way how to approach that issu.<br />
