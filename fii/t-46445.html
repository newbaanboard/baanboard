<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">4th January 2008, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">My user ran session tfacr5210m000 yesterday evening and today she tried to print the interest invoices and nothing printed.<br />
<br />
I have queried interest invoices by customer and see no transactions.<br />
<br />
My user has tried to rerun tfacr5210m000 and gets a message, tfacr0163, stating &quot;Selecting customer receipts for interest invoices.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what has to be done so she can rerun the session tfacr5210m000?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help - Joy</div></div><hr />

The application lock will be released after closing the session.  Due to some reason (like unexpected power failure) if the application lock is not deleted, nobody else can use that session.  <br />
<br />
Remove the application lock set using session &quot;Remove Application Locks&quot; (ttstpdellocks).  <br />
Run the selection Again.<br />
