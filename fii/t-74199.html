<br />
I'm looking for a maintain session to edit the refer field t$refr of the table tfgld106.<br />
<br />
It's a description field, so I hope that there is a session that should edit it. <br />
There is a way to do this? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
regards</div></div><hr />

Great tip, thanks mate. However I can't find a mantain session for that field, only visualizations or print :(<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

Hi Mark,<br />
I have another question for you. You showed me a session that print sessions that use a particular field, there is a reverse session that print all fields used by a session?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th February 2022, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm - not sure I seen anything specific doing that - you can try ttstpsessinfo with and without runtime to see what it gets you.  I think it is pretty close to using bic_info6.2.  So for example I can jump out to a shell and use bic_info6.2 otisfc0101.  I think I get what you are looking for, but not sure there is anything that would do that. And ttadv2401m000 also only gives table names from what I see.</div></div><hr />

Thanks again Mark, you're really precious!<br />
<br />
How can I use bic_info6.2? Where I can access the shell? Can you give me more details about this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th February 2022, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">My version of what I do - there are probably some more details on the board.  What I do is login via windows client, do run program and put in csh.  It starts me a unix c-shell, then I just cd $BSE/bin.  You should see bic_info6.2 or it might be bic_info6.1 depending how old your system is.  Then I just type in the bic_info6.2 &quot;object name&quot; and hit return.  There are lots of things you can get information on but I always just used it for libraries and session scripts.  Example - the session is tisfc0101m000 and its compiled object is otisfc0101 - so I would enter bic_info6.2 otisfc0101 and hit return.<br />
<br />
I am assuming since I just noticed you are on windows it works the same way with a cmd window.</div></div><hr />

Mark, I have another little question for you.<br />
<br />
I have a list of forms of a session. Some are like tcmsc003.dsca that indicate the table and the field name. For the others that are like qty.free, a view or something like this I suppose,  how can I see the origin table of that field?<br />
<br />
Thanks again mate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">9th March 2022, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">That indicates that the field is calculated (i.e., not a field directly from a table).  You'd need access to the script that calculates the field - or potentially run some kind of trace/debug to see if you can determine how the field is calculated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Thanks for fast reply Vince. I can't find a solution for my problem. MRP proposed order generate an allocated inventory, but neither in tiitm001 nor tdinv001 allocated inventory include the one generated from MRP proposed order. I can't find a table that store the whole allocated inventory. <br />
Only in a printed report I can find this, but this is a calculated field and I haven't the access to the script :(<br />
<br />
thanks again for the reply</div></div><hr />
