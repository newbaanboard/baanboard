The due date of a purchase invoice is taken from the field Terms of payment(form 3 in Maintain suppliers-tccom2101m000).You can change that date when you introduce the purchase datein the system.<br />
As far as I know the aging analysis can be made only based on invoice date or due date.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mahadevan</div><div class="date">5th November 2004, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.. I will look in to this.<br />
<br />
our intention is to look for the cash flow.<br />
example:<br />
1.  purcased  the item on 01-11-2004 and delivery date 10-11-2004 was entered  in the system.(PO created)tdpur040,tdpur041 table inserted.<br />
2. Receipt maintained and receipt number and date generated on (8-11-2004)<br />
3. Manual Invoice booked and match and approved. (tfacp200) on 10-11-2004. <br />
<br />
now i want to calculate the due date as per the receipt date with payment terms (tcmcs013.pper) i.e (08-11-2004 + 15days) = 22-11-2004 will be due date based on this i assume the payment to be made in the month of dec.04 <br />
like wise i will do for other po.<br />
<br />
please guide me is there any standard report is availabe in the BaaN report IVc4.</div></div><hr />
