<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">23rd June 2004, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We currently have our Financial Parameters Immediate Start of Financial Process and Transaction Real Time to Finance set to NO.  We were thinking of setting the Immediate Start of Financial Process to YES.  Along with this I have a few questions/concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Is this a parameter that can be changed (I think it is, but I want to check)?<br />
 Is this a wise decision if our integration batches are very large?<br />
 Is there any other necessary set-up?  How do you designate which printer reports output to?<br />
 <br />
<br />
Please also provide any pros and cons that I may not have addressed.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance your any information you can provide.  Your assistance is greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sai_krishna</div><div class="date">25th June 2004, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">What is Ur objective in changing this parameter. If there are any transations that are wrongly posted thru integration, U will not be able to change the same if this parameter is set to yes. Also It will create more finalisation runs. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">25th June 2004, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a person who finalizes all of the integration transactions each morning.  I thought that by changing the parameter we might be able to get away with automatically posting integrations and saving that individual some time.<br />
<br />
However, I don't quite understand your last comment.  I didn't think that you could change integrations once they were posted, and if the integrations are erroneous, I wouldn't think that they could be finalized until fixed?<br />
<br />
Are you saying that if you change that parameter, you cannot fix erroneous integrations?<br />
<br />
Please explain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sai_krishna</div><div class="date">25th June 2004, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I am talking about transactions that u might want to change from the backend (gtm). Its always better to change the transactions before finalisation than after finalisation. Ur comment is correct about erroneous batches. U can still fix erroneous transactions since erroneous transactions are not posted in the first place<br />

<br />
We have never gone into GTM to correct an integration like that.  I can't imagine that we would unless instructed to do so by Baan Support.</div></div><hr />
