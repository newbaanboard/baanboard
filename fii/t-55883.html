Look at tfgld100 or tfgld101.  tfgld101.stat and tfgld100.stat should be Finalized (6) and tfgld100.tstt should be Finalized Successfully (4).  I'll bet you have a batch with status Error.  To check for this quickly go to Select Batches for Finalization and do a tools query and look for Finalization Run status = Errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ap2203</div><div class="date">21st May 2009, 08:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont have non-finalized batches. I look at tfgld100 or tfgld101. tfgld101.stat and tfgld100.stat should be Finalized (6) and tfgld100.tstt should be Finalized Successfully (4). <br />
But i have in tfgld101.stat  = tfgld.bstt.open free and u tfggld100.stat (1) not finalized (6) for one type transaction, the second type transaction has OK tfgld101.stat , but for this tfgld101.btno in table tfgld100 fields tfgld100.stat was tfgld.bstt.term (6) and tfgld100.tstt=tfgld.tstt.terminated (4). I don't know why I have this situation, but thank you  hor help I solve my problem</div></div><hr />

Don't know what causes this but the fix is to verify first that there are no non-finalized transactions left in tfgld102 from the batch and then just use GTM to correct.  Those clients that are on current service packs seem to not have this problem any more.</div></div><hr />
