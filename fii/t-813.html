<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">17th January 2002, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We are looking at bringing up another part of our company into Baan (5.0c) for Accts Receivable. Sales/Distribution will continue to exist in legacy systems. The customer invoices will be generated outside of Baan but we want to bring the invoice/AR data into Baan so that we can process the cash application in Baan (we are already invoicing some customers directly from Baan as we have part of the company running Sales/Distribution in Baan). We are currently looking at options for bringing this data in and wondering if anyone else has done anything similar.<br />
The options we are looking at are:<br />
1 - Bring the data into Central Invoicing and process it basically as a manual sales invoice and bring in the ledger account information. This would generate an invoice that would be discarded but would create the Open Entries.<br />
2 - Bring the data into Accounts Receivable via Maintain Transactions by creating a batch that would bring in the ledger account information etc. However, this may require a bit more work to replicate the logic that occurs when manually entering a miscellaneous AR transaction. This would also create Open Entries.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions/ideas would be greatly appreciated.<br />

If so, I would suggest using the same routine (no point in reinventing the wheel).<br />
<br />
My preference would be to take it directly into A/R, as you can generate the G/L coding (credit side - debit side is obviously determined by the Financial Business Partner Group) at that point and keep the same invoice number as that generated by your source system, by using an open number series.<br />
<br />
I can't see the point of using central invoicing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">25th January 2002, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! That is probably the direction we are headed in. <br />
When we initially went live on 5.0c it was a new facility so there were no open receivables to convert over, so this is the first time we have had to address converting legacy AR as well as how to bring it in going forward, as the sales/distribution may not be brought up for awhile.</div></div><hr />
