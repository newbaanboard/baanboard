We've reached our limit for sales orders type series 22.  we have used several other series for various types.  For example, our return sales series is 23 and our sales invoice is 22 series.  When we reached our sales limit 22999999, the next number was 23000000.  We will deal with the duplicates, but need to prevent them from occuring.<br />
I'm not a finance expert, just the tools admin., the business claims they need to have unique numbers for our invoices.  Should we change the series for sales and use another range?<br />
Is there anything else we need to do in preparation for this change?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

yes - you need to change the order series or the system will block you when you will come to 23000000. Finance needs to have unique numbers per fiscal year. There is nothing else then setting the new series up on the transaction types first and then add them in Order Man.<br />
