<br />
We have significant  foreign inventory purchased. Home currency is RM (malaysia). The purchase mainly use LC (letter of credit) . I understand that using BAAN we need to maintain foreign exchange daily .  My Q is for example :<br />
<br />
<br />
PO issue  Good A (total of 5 Batch)   01/04/12          Day rate  USD 3.1<br />
<br />
Goods A   (batch 1 ) load at port of origin (bill of lading) 30/04/12    Day rate   USD 3.3 <br />
<br />
Arrive at Malaysia port      28/05/12                      Day rate USD 3.4<br />
<br />
Received  by our warehouse   3/06/12                    Day rate USD 3.2<br />
<br />
As per my understanding BAAN  ,the inventory will be value at  rate  3.2 when warehouse key in receive 3/06/12 . Am I right?<br />
<br />
However   since we using LC and the term is FOC. Auditor can argue  that the transfer of risk and rewards happend when loading at port of origin. The inventory  should be value at USD 3.3 as per Bill of lading rate. In our old system we can manually put  rate 3.3.  <br />
<br />
<br />
What is your advice ? <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

So is there something I can do with BAAN?</div></div><hr />
