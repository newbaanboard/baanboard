Hi all<br />
<br />
I am in the stage of closing the year 2001. I want to do provisional closing of 2001. I closed all the periods for the year 2001.  I took a Trial Balance [tfgld3402m000] only for Finalized and also for Non Finalized. Each Trial Balance is tallying with a value. Since I closed all the periods for year 2001, I expect both the trial Balance should tally ie., Both should have same value. But<br />
Each report giving different value.<br />
<br />
What could be the possibilities?<br />
<br />
Pls give some solution regarding this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
besides your problem I hope you didn't close really all the periods, and left the last period open for the balancing of profit and loss accounts. And in consequence you cannot do the final year end closing. <br />
<br />
Concerning your problem: Please rebuild the general ledger history with session tfgld3206m000.<br />
And then run the provisional year close. <br />
There is no harm to rebuild the general ledger history with each month end closing. <br />

<br />
<br />
I closed all the periods for the year 2001 firmly.<br />
<br />
If rebuilding is the only solution,  from which period i have to rebuild? Since the difference in the Trial Balance showing from June'2001 and its gradually increasing upto december.<br />
<br />
Is any other possibilities for the occurecne? If so, pls give me the details and solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">venkat500</div><div class="date">13th August 2002, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">run the rebuild session for the year 2001 for all periods. This should solve your problem. But as juli said, you should keep one period open for the entries to be posted by 'automatic balancing of p/l' session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will suggest to run the session tfgld3203m000 - Rebuild opening balance/history from transactions for all periods.<br />
<br />
However, I'm not sure which version of baan you are working, but there is another session tfgld0295m000 - Rebuild ledger/dimension history of period.<br />
<br />
This is a better version of tfgld3203m000 and it works faster than the original version. Try it.<br />
<br />

<br />
I agree with Javier - the tfgld0295m000 session runs much faster; however, I don't believe you can rebuild once the periods are at a status of finally closed.  I believe BaaN Support is going to have to reset the status of the periods to &quot;closed&quot;.  <br />
<br />
We are on version IVc2, and ran into this same situation the first time we attempted to perform a year-end close.<br />
<br />
You should also install the general year-end solution (15409) before beginning the year-end close.  If you print out this solution, it gives good instruction for the proper year-end closing sequence to follow.<br />
<br />
