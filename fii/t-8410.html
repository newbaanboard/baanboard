<br />
I print the report customer balance by company and give me a different amount that control account on trial balance..<br />
<br />
I check the report control account check list and I foun the differences....<br />
<br />
the problem is that somebody makes changes to GLD through GTM  and set the debit and credit to the same control account, unfortunately this change was made in 2001 and this year is closed.<br />
<br />
How can I fix it??  How can I have my control accounts with the correct information??<br />

This means some GTM level changes in ACR200 which have the same balance effect as shown in GLD. you should not make and GLD transaction for those..<br />

Dirty but necessary work ...</div></div><hr />
