<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PHPTeufel</div><div class="date">18th March 2004, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">In the last few weeks, we have the following problem:<br />
<br />
We purchase Goods and get an Invoice for them. This Invoice we match with the purchase Order.<br />
<br />
But after that our supplier has to do some additional work and we got an Invoice that we have to match also to that purchase order because of the right sales price, but that isn't possible because it is already matched and closed.<br />
<br />
Is there a possibilty to match this Invoice also to the purchase order, or how can we get the additional costs to that item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">18th March 2004, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">there is probably a better way to do it but as I am not a finance guy I would add another line to the original order create a cost item call it additional order cost  or something like that then receive the part and match against the new line. and a text to the line item explaining the reason for the additional line</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">7th April 2004, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two ways of doing this depending on the information you ultimately want.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you dont mind NOT being able to see the cost against the purchase order <br />
You can expense the invoice off directly to the P&amp;L by approving the invoice without matching. Baan may take you to the matching screen but exit this and expense the invoice.<br />
<br />
<br />
 If you want to see the costs against an order<br />
You will need to add an extra line in the purchase order and book the invoice against this. You will most likely need to use a cost item or service item. This will mean the P&amp;L will be expensed as soon as it is received, which is similar to the above but obviously you can see what the costs for that order were.<br />
<br />
<br />
A slight word of caution if you use cost price calculation: If an order situation such as you describe happens and the part ordered is used for cost price calculation your costings may be inaccurate (depending on calculation priority). You may need to consider splitting the order into two or more lines at the time of placing the order to reduce the possibility of inaccuracy.<br />
