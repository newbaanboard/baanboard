   You didnt mention as to when you were able to take this report in half an hour and when since it started taking 5 hours. Apart from that, did you check if any other processes were running simultaneously at the server side keeping it busy?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">21st February 2007, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">The main large tables used are tfgld102, tfgld106 &amp; tfacr200. I suggest to run a trace to see in which query the performance problem occurs. Then you can analyze the problem based on the result, and take actions accordingly (reorganize, rebuild indices, etc). Are there any other processes/sessions which take much longer?<br />

Dear all,<br />
Thanks a lot for the feedbacks. This occurance was noted beginning of November 2006. System is on SP6.<br />
if there are patches particular for this session, can they be installed without effecting the rest of the sessions?<br />
<br />
If u do encourage me to upgrade our Baan SP , well, that would take some time<br />
<br />
At the moment, i am doing archive but not for tfgld106 yet. Wow, thats very big<br />
<br />
<br />
Pls advice<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">22nd February 2007, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">SP6 is pretty old . I think u wont be able to install latest patches due to pmc dependencies . So the only option seems to be to copy few years data to archieve company (tfgld620?m000) and then test .</div></div><hr />
