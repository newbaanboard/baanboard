<br />
There are two conditions<br />
<br />
1) if Your cheque is reverse<br />
<br />
2) if Supplier deposit that cheque in his account and issue new cheque in favour of your orgnisation.<br />
<br />
In the First Condition, the reverse Entry passed.<br />
<br />
In the Second condition, first you create a customer code in the name of that supplier, and maintain the transaction as receipt.<br />
<br />
Another solution is also receipt as advance from supplier. <br />
<br />
this transaction will be balanced your system transaction and balance will be zero in your books.<br />

Is it by issuing an advance payment check through automatic check run? If so, do you use anticipated steps for the advance payment?<br />
<br />
Or that you use the advance payment transaction type in tfgld1101m000?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ERPBAAN</div><div class="date">9th August 2008, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you please explain the procedure for both i.e. <br />
<br />
1. if I have made the payment through Anticipate mode and the payment has been reconciled, and Supplier now is issuing me another cheque<br />
<br />
2. I have paid through tfgld1101m000. In this case I don't want to use negative allowed in Transaction type.<br />
