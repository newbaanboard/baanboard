<br />
Our buyers are getting the message &quot;The value of the Invoicing Status field must be Free&quot; when trying to add text to a PO line.  Our feeling is that we should be able to add text at any status (except possible a user lock on the record).<br />
<br />
It is possible that the problem is the result of user error in the matching process.  We can have purchase orders with lines that have free, matched, and all matched status; yet, some of those lines will have 0 qty received.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the std functionality of Baan. You can do anything on the order which has invoiced. Similarly you can add the text to a closed production order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rrankinmba</div><div class="date">16th October 2008, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">With ERP LN you cannot add text to a line of any order line once it has been shipped or partial shipped (at least in our environment).  When you hit the line text button the message is no text present and the new/select form does not come up.<br />
<br />
We had an Infor consultant tell us to use the Inbound line to add text which adds another layer to our reports.<br />
<br />
My issue is with the message &quot;Value of the Invoicing Status field must be Free&quot; and the fact that the lines are getting a status other then free when no quanities have been shipped.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
