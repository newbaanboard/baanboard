<br />
I just want to know if there is any mathing key/link between sales invoice record in tfacr200 and integration transaction table with record type Sales Order/Sales Order Revenue analysis.<br />
<br />
If there is no direct link, is there any other table providing link between these two table. Our goal is to identify the Sales Ledger being hit (credited).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">28th June 2013, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You can print Integrations tfgld4410m000 for that combination of Transaction Origin/Financial Transaction....<br />
<br />
Or possibly query the tfgld106 table to get the accounts (both debit and credit)... you can cross-reference that against the tfacr200 by the transaction type and document (invoice) number).<br />
<br />
I don't have a tfgld482 table... do you mean 418?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VishalMistry</div><div class="date">29th June 2013, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">When commercial invoice is prepared against sales order through Central Invoicing module, a sales invoice record is created in tfacr200 and the same is stored intfgld102/106. But when this is done, it credits Interim Sales account (and not the actual sales a/c). In integration transactions, Sales order/Revenue analysis entry is triggered which actually hits actual sales a/c.<br />
<br />
But we are unable to find a link between sales invoice entry in tfacr200 and entry in Integration transactions session.<br />
<br />
Can you help in this regard ?<br />
<br />

You can set a Debit/Credit account per Cost Price Component (or no CPC which will apply to all CPC's).  This can be done for a combination of Financial Customer Group, Project and/or Financial Supplier Group.<br />
<br />
Is this the information you require?</div></div><hr />
