I have faced issues with the integration lines has been split for particular Sales order. if the order quatity in sales order is 2 then integration lines are 12 and for another item in same sales order if order quantity is 10 then integration lines are five. <br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your pompt reply...<br />
<br />
Yes We are using different cost centers,but I need to know where the set up is maintained that for X cost center X % of order amount. <br />
<br />
Second issues that I am not able to recetify, that why there are even and odd entries, <br />
<br />
I mean to say that if the quantity is 2 there are 12 lines of Integ'on and why not 6,eg If at there would be order quantity of 100 then there would be 500 lines right? therefore I need to know were the setup are maintained and how they are spliting the entries.<br />
<br />
In Item Master we have one cost component group under which the cost center are maintained.but not able to view the Percentages and codes.<br />
<br />

Please note that it is cost components and not cost center. In costing module you may please check surcharges by item or item group. For some of the items more surcharges might have defined and for some items less. <br />
It is the standard design of Baan and there is no such set up that reduce the number of lines in integration.<br />
