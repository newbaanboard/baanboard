<br />
I am interested in the different philosophies of inventory valuation in Baan IV and ERP. <br />
How do you manage that the inventory valuation of session tdinv6230m000 is comparable to the financial accounts? <br />
Keywords: cost price calculation (price priority and rhythm), integration scheme ...<br />
<br />
Thanks for answering. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">9th January 2003, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Inventory valuation in Baan 5 is more complex than in Baan 4.  There has been confusion regarding the Inventory Valuation calculation and the Cost Price calculation.  The addition of Issue and Receipt Surcharges effect both calculations dependent upon the warehouses associated with the items and/or surcharges.  The variances thrown when transfering stock to production orders or other warehouses complicates the understanding of these calculation differences.  <br />
<br />
There is an excellent document detailing the concepts of cost accounting, inventory evaluation, production order costing etc...  I believe the code of the document is something like P3011.  The document is 299 pages and has been revised multiple times.  There are some minor errors in it, but overall it is very well written and 99% accurate.<br />

<br />
Can you tell me where I can download this document from.  Inventory valuation has been the biggest headache for us also.  We are running BaaN IV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">11th January 2003, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">This document was written fro Baan V, but despite that, it might give you some insight into the logic in Baan IV.  The other option is to find the Baan Education stuff for Baan IV.  Generally, the documentation for Baan IV is much better and more complete than Baan V.  My guess is that something is out there that describes exactly what you need.<br />
<br />
I was laid off from Baan in December.  I no longer have access to the documents.  I would contact your Sales Account Manager and request him/her to get it for you.</div></div><hr />

We are on Baan IVb and and had no clue what to do with the differences we had between the inventory ledger account and the amount on the inventory valuation report.  I logged it with Baan Support and they suggested that I try to run a session called tdinv0256m000, &quot;Check Inventory and Integration Transactions.&quot;  Only problem was that it was not available for Baan IVb.  Well, two months later and three solutions we are getting close to having a report that will show the orders that have differences between logistics and finance.  I wonder if anyone is using this report for Baan IVc or Baan V?  If so, has this report helped you in reconciling the differences you may have between the two sides of Baan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">22nd January 2004, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using B4c4 with lot control, all items are valued by lotprice.<br />
To check any discrepancies between distribution and finance inventory our accounting department monthly runs customized reports tdltc0408m000 and tdilc141m000 to check the total distribution value by warehouse and by itemgroup and compares this with the trial balance by respective dimensions.<br />
Any disrepancies are happily dropped on my desk to find out :-)<br />
Sorting out differences are often a nightmare, in most occassions reasons were:<br />
- crashed BaaN sessions during maintain receipts, resulting in purchase/receipt transactions posted twice to finance<br />
- errors in lotvalues (or LotPrice Structure by Cost price Component) in lots that were generated during the stock import we did when we went 'live', especially in written-off lots, generating incorrect lotresult postings to finance when these items were finally sold.<br />
- errors created by bugs in a customized session to write off lotcontrolled items<br />
So to be honest most errors were more or less our own fault, not because of BaaN standard programs :o<br />
To ease the sorting out of any of these differences I tried to build an OLAP system using the itemcode from td stock tables and the itemcode in tfgld410, but found inconsistencies in the tfgld410.item field :mad: <br />
