<br />
We are in the process of configuring Sales module in Baan IV for the first time. We have completed all the required settings and are able to process a sales order upto invoicing. <br />
However We are facing a problem while trying to post an intergration transaction,every time we try to post this transaction we get this error<br />
<br />
&quot;Cannot define ledger account (tdinv850)&quot; for Sales - Invoice transaction.<br />
<br />
Sales-Issue is getting posted. Even in the Sales - Invoice transaction the debit account is getting posted but the credit is not.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me informing, where do we define the Credit account for sales-Invoice.  My understanding is to define it in the ACR parameter. I have maintained tdsls6101m000 also.<br />
<br />
Please if anybody has encountered this problem,I will be appreciating if he provides me with advices.<br />
<br />
Please note we are not using any localization in middle east.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Hello Thanks for your post,<br />
Please note that in tdinv8150m000, for Transaction Origin - Sales, Financial transactions available are Inventory allocation, Issue, Revaluation, Inventory transfer, Lot Result and Issue (Direct Delivery).<br />
There is no financial transaction for Invoice. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">5th December 2011, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">other relevent sessions to check would be <br />
1. tdsls6100m000 - for posting country wise and details<br />
2. tdsls6102/3m000 / tcmcs0136m000. <br />
3. tfacr0110m000 for client debit posting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ERPBAAN</div><div class="date">6th December 2011, 11:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Hitesh,<br />
I checked all the sessions mentioned in your post and found that all are maintained. However I observed one anomaly in tdsls6100m000, where Invoice details are maintained as &quot;NO&quot;.<br />
Is this the reason for this problem. <br />
I tried to change it to &quot;YES&quot; but the message popped as &quot;Not processed invoices present, changing not allowed&quot; <br />
How can it be turned to &quot;YES&quot;. I even tried GTM for table tdsls600 but couldn't found any record there to change.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
the corresponding table for session tdsls6100m000 should be tdsls000 (Parameter Sales).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ERPBAAN</div><div class="date">6th December 2011, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I was able to turn the Invoice details as &quot;YES&quot; in tdsls6100m000, after processing all the unprocessed test invoices.<br />
Revenue and COGS related transactions are appearing now. But still the transactions are appearing as unposted.<br />
I have logged an incident with infor support but have not got any response from them till now.<br />
They have updated the status as Researching. <br />
Will update the outcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for their comments.</div></div><hr />
