<br />
We are using Bilateral Invoicing, But when processing the Warehousing Order its giving integration entry with financial transaction origin Warehouse Transfer Manual with IUA seriess, Type as Issue(Invoicing),<br />
<br />
But it was earlier coming type as Issue only for which mapping have been defined.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that when i am creating warehousing order, after giving reason when transferring from Unallocated warehouse to allocated warehouse, the Invoicing option gets ticked automatically after saving because of which this is happening.<br />
<br />
Pls tell me the reason why if it has been disabled (Triangular Invoicing) then why its getting ticked.<br />
<br />
