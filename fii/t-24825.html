<br />
I'm looking for a solution to a common problem we're having.  We are trying to account for the impact of exchange fluctuations  between the time we enter a sales order and the time we receive the components into inventory to the sales order assemblies.<br />
<br />
What we would like to do is post this difference as a exchange gain/loss for a a specific project.  Right now, Baan is charging this to the project and it gets obscurred as it's mixed into all the COGS for that project.  What we would like to see is what the exchange impact is on the cost of the project.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a solution?<br />
<br />
We're using Baan IV c.4.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Matt</div></div><hr />
