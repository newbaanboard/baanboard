We have implemented EBS and is operational for 5 years. However, I didn't mainatin Baan EBS set up, as it expects the information in a particular format and we also tried brining some additional logic. What we do is we wrote our own custom program and filled up the EBS tables and then let EBS proces take over it. It worked fine.<br />
