<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">12th March 2013, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably on the matched line there is a cost/service item in a so-called cost-to-be-specified group (see item group). During the receipt of such a line, the debit side is posted to an interim cost account from the mapping scheme, which will be contra posted in the approval document. The user will have to spit up those costs again, either from the specific menu in the match screens, using the option 'cost items&quot;, or if not such a detailed way of splitting up the costs is not required, the user can specify the costs on invoice level by using the same session, but then started from the invoice screen.<br />
<br />
In the end, before invoice approval can take place, the amount unassigned has to be zero. What I see in your word document is a negative invoice amount (probably a credit note), but you match it to a normal receipt (so no return order). Instead of decreasing the amount unassigned, I see an increase. There can be reasons to match a credit note to a normal receipt (you already received an earlier invoice which you have matched, but did not agree, but let the matching and approving continue).<br />
