We have concluded a down payment for a supplier and this down payment doesn't appear into the open entrys now.<br />
At the expression of the checklist collecting accounts he shows also exactly this difference.<br />
Now my question:<br />
There is a Session, which lays out these missing OP automatically or must hard one do this on the database himself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">3rd February 2005, 08:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Check in tfgld102/106 for the document, if you remember.<br />
Look for BP specific transactions and if the advance payment is present.<br />
<br />
In open entries, check also &quot;Fully Paid&quot;, in case this advance payment is assigned to any other invoice for this BP.<br />
<br />
And if you could not locate by means of above ways, it probably means, Baan never had a record of the said advance payment.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the status of the payment?  Is it in the anticipated status or reconciled?  If reconciled, are you sure if it is accepted or rejected?  If it is rejected, the payment can no more be open.  <br />
<br />
But anyway you are telling control account checklist is showing a difference (have you set the flag &quot;differences only&quot; to &quot;Yes&quot;&quot; And is it showing the amount in the last column, i.e., difference?).<br />
<br />
If you answer yes to both the questions in the above paragraph, probably due to some problem the table would not have got updated.  First identify the record (record reference, u can get from the above checklist report itself).  Please check the table tfgld102/106 for the above record.  Mostly you will find the record there.  Then, check the table tfacp200 for the same.  Mostly you will not find it there.  Or, even if you find it there, the balance must be NIL.  Insert the record or correct the record, as the case maybe.<br />
<br />
Before attempting this GTM correction,  try running otfcor0260 for this Supplier.  This recalculates the balances and usually corrects the balance.  If not, insert/correct the record as said.<br />
<br />
