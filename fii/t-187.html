Do you use also other modules than Finance? For example, if you use the Projects-module, all cost and revenue postings of the year which must be closed, must be approved and finalised yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">19th September 2001, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan has a Year End closing guide.  There are instructions with auditing and without auditing.  A CAUTION - make sure that no user is in the Finance Module when you rebuild ledger history.  This process can take a VERY long time.  This last year it took over twelve hours to rebuild all the history.  I have taken to rebuilding a range of periods at a time instead of rebuilding all the periods at once!  The instructions are in the attached file!  Good luck.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the attachments. These instructions which are described in that documents, only affect the steps taken in the Finance module. <br />
<br />
If you also use other BaaN modules, you should also control all these transactions from these modules, wether they are correctly finalized. During closing periods, you will get messages if transactions are present, which are not finalized yet (from the integrations-table). Before closing periods I should also control alle integration-transactions.:cool:</div></div><hr />
