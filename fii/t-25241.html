<br />
I'm newbie in Baan Finance, so could u guys helps me to solve it regarding the above problem.<br />
Your suggestion is very much appreciated<br />
<br />
In tfcmg1257m000 Post Payments: the batch 253 is supposed to show payment batch status posted/selected but it is showing status paid.<br />
<br />
So I checked the payment batch but could not figure what's the error.<br />
<br />
In this batch, we have payment Tele Transfer(TT) and Bank Draf(BD).<br />
<br />
Both are foreign Payment.<br />
<br />
When process to non-finalized transaction (batch: 402), the TT payment is not in the list.<br />
<br />
All the payments are correctly listed in advice payment but only the TT (Forex) is not in non-finalized.<br />
<br />
There are 15 suppliers in Payment Advice list. I checked tfcmg101-Maintain Payment Advice, only two supplierss payment are Posted (Yes). The rest are No Posted (No).<br />
<br />
So, I checked the Bank Relation, Payment Method and other related tables.<br />
For the No Posted suppliers: Bank Relation-UOB<br />
				Payment Method-TT<br />
<br />
For the Posted suppliers: Bank Relation-UOB &amp; SBB<br />
				Payment Method-BD &amp; TT<br />
<br />
I did checked tfgld100, the batch status is In Use. What is this mean?<br />
<br />
Now what can I do to process this payment?<br />
Can anyone please suggest any other way to process this payment successfully?<br />
<br />
Please advicethanks<br />
<br />

It will be difficult to provide you a solution without looking into the tables.</div></div><hr />
