<br />
Whether in ERP LN 6.1, the acquisition of assets transactions can be done through Purchase Orders and maintaining receipts alongwith integration mapping and recoriding of Fixed Assets in the FAM Module? If this possible, how this can be done and mapped in the ERP LN 6.1.<br />
<br />
Please guide and give inputs on the aforesaid matters.<br />

<br />
What you can do is order in Purchase the Fixed Asset with a cost item. Put this item in an item group which is marked as being a &quot;Costs to be specified&quot; item group. <br />
During the invoice matching in tfacp2541/tfacp2544 (match to order or match to receipt), the user can split up the costs through the specific command &quot;Cost items&quot; and then get to session tfacp1133s000. Here the user can put the costs amount on a ledger account, which is a Fixed Asset Investment account etc.<br />
If the user approves the invoice, then the FAM module will be updated.<br />
<br />
At least this is the procedure which can be followed to the best of my knowledge.<br />

<br />
Thanks for reply, i have also mapped in the similar lines, a document i am attaching in form of User Manual, kindly look into it and if any points are there of concern, kindly forward it to me. Still in this i am having issues which are as under :-<br />
 I have issues as regards Acquisition of Fixed Assets through purchase order (1) Two Accounts have to be created in Chart of Accounts 110001&quot; Interim Plant &amp; Machinery Investment Account&quot; (will show Debit Balance) for  Fixed Assets Integration  and 110001L Interim Plant &amp; Machinery Investment Account&quot;(will show credit balance) for Integration Warehouse Receipt/Receipts  through purchase order.(2) While opting Purchase Order Option, the invoice details tab is disabled while maintaining assets in the FAM Module - Assets (tffam1500m000) session, which has to be maintained manually. <br />
Further, whether the opening balances in the asset registers including accumulated depreciation has to entered manually, by supressing the entries to GLD module in FAM Parameters.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />
<br />
