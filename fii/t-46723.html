<br />
We have just taken on stock from a manual warehouse.  The manual stock (value)was represented  on our ledger.<br />
<br />
The procedure was as follows<br />
(i) Create warehouses (nettable)<br />
(ii) Create a &quot;supplier&quot; for takeon processes called TAKEON<br />
(iv) Create purchase orders with quantity on hand and manual average price<br />
(iv) receive purchase orders and generate purchase invoices<br />
<br />
May I please have your ideas on the follow up financial transactions that we need to do to clear the creditors balance against the supplier TAKEON<br />
The debit /credit entries that i need to do to clear the manual stock account. Any other financial transactions that we need to do to tidy up this process.<br />
<br />
