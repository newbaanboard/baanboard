I am setting up tax analysis in Baan 5c. While making purchase invoice, entry is made for purchase use tax. And when I print tax analysis reports, I get details of those. But those tax can be claimed back from the government only after they make an actual payment. <br />
<br />
Is there any standard functionality in baan to print only those tax amounts for which invoice is paid?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just out of curiosity, could you clarify the location: somewhere shown with your user details?<br />
Where I live (UK) and where I used to live (Netherlands) you claim tax (VAT) back based on received purchase invoices and pay tax on issued sales invoices. <br />
<br />
The actual payments have nothing to do with it (although you should make corrections if you don't pay the purchase invoice or write off the sales invoice).</div></div><hr />
