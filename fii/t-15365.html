<br />
<br />
We are importing sales invoices and credit notes using exchange, but have come across a problem regarding credit notes. Both are using unique transaction types S01 and S02, defined as sales invoices, and credit notes, respectively. <br />
<br />
Sales invoices have been setup with the original invoice number, thus no need for the baan document numbers. No problem importing sales invoices. Credit notes however, have been setup with document numbers. Upon importing they are populating tables tfacr400 and 401. <br />
<br />
When we post the invoices, am getting error message <br />
&quot;Statement Layout not found&quot;. Any clues why this could be occuring?</div></div><hr />

The problem seems to arrise from the fact that Baan is unable to generate the new number. So you must generate it yourself writing in table tfgld018 and tfgld017 besides tfacr400 and 401.<br />
Hope this will work,<br />

There is also an exchange scheme used befor this session is run.  JVIMPRT.  Look at the associated batches to see how they handle getting the transactions into temporary baan tables.  Then check the session script to see how they use baan functions to generate the transaction document numbers, fill the appropriate tables etc...<br />
