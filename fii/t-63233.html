I am trying to change it to 506 which is the current logistical and financial company.  When I change the field and attempt to save the record message ttstp0108 appears:<br />
<br />
Supplier Payment Not Allowed<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas as to why this is happening?</div></div><hr />

Check the Supplier record properly. May be some data like Payment Method or Bank or Terms of Payment etc. could have been wrongly entered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">13th December 2012, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the response!  I'm trying to test writing checks in a currency different than the 'home currency' for a new Baan company.  I get to the point where the check will print, but then the system tells me that not all payments were processed.  The check is set to 'anticipated' in the check master, but the document remains in the payment batch.  Not sure what is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">13th December 2012, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Just as an update. I have found that it is a problem with the check report itself.  The tfcmg103 table is not being properly updated.  Still working on the solution, but I at least have confirmed that it isn't our setup.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
