we have to setup a new baan company but the logistic<br />
part (sales order/history, purchace order, manufacturing, statistics<br />
an so on) must stay as it is. So my question is it posible<br />
to clean up/initialize only the finance tables and parameterize<br />
them with the new company data.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">11th June 2003, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">You may do this if you have set up your first company in session tfgld0101m000 as a multi-finance/single-logistic company.  If it's not already set to this, you must BE CAREFUL.  Read the online help in the above session, and refer to your baan docs, or call support.  You will need to define logical tables for the new financial company. (pointing at the sales/customer/etc.. data in the Original company)  There is some fairly good multi-company set up documentation available from baan.   Maybe someone here on the board has an online version of the multi-fin/single-log set up.  There are also a number of posts that refer to the sharing of tables here on BaanBoard.  Do your research.  It is possible but, only if you haven't set up your original company in the wrong way. <br />
Hope this helps<br />
