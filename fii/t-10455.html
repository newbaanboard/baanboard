<br />
As far as my knowledge goes the base company is head of the group company.To the group company belongs the normal companies.<br />
Between normal companies inside one group company you can have automatically intercompany transactions.<br />
Between group companies you can have intergroup transactions, through the base company. These transactions are not automated and are made manually.<br />
<br />
I hope this gives you any further more information to start with.<br />
