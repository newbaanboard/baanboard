<br />
Does anyone have any information on what actions create a Purchase Value Correction?<br />
<br />
The system has created this transaction in addition to a Purchase Price Variance which I know is generated from the following actions.<br />
<br />
The first one being when a purchase order line price is changed after receipt and the second when there is a difference between the order price and the invoice price which is accepted by the Accounts Payable person. <br />
<br />
Any assistance would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

My client uses Baan 5C and a FIFO costing method.</div></div><hr />

Try to run Process inventory variances session(whina1200m000) and see the result in integration trx session. If you want to updating the cost price then run the cost price calculation afterward.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
I am aware that the transaction is generated from the Process inventory variances session. What I need to understand is why and how the amount has been generated over and above any purchase price variance already calculated.<br />
<br />

Thanks again but I already have this document and it does not provide any detail on why and how this variance is calculated. It does however provide details for the Warehouse Order - Value Correction but this is different. <br />
<br />
I have also looked at the Baan Help session and it does not have any details it is completely blank in this area.<br />
<br />
Any further assistance is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Norman</div></div><hr />
