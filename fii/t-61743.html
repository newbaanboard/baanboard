<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th January 2012, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">This error means the ledger is used as control a/c in tfacr0110m000 (customer groups) session. If it is , users are not expected to enter transactions manually in this account as it can create mismatch in open item and consequently corrupt the data .<br />
<br />
You should find some other way to enter such transactions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cannot pass any transaction by using JV transaction type for customer or supplier...<br />
for which you may have to use debitnote/credit note <br />
Hope you understand</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
Why you want to use control a/c in JV transaction? It's because you are reconciling ACR with GLD ,in acr the transaction effect is correct &amp; the same you want to insert in gld, if it's then you have to change control a/c option in table tfgld037 from backend table, complete your transaction &amp; revert back the changes.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
Do not change using table ..It will create more problem<br />
the control account and gld never get matched <br />
<br />
Why control account is used to make sure that all related transaction has to appear in GLD<br />
so table level changes to be avoided using backend as far as possible if there is normal method for correction.<br />
<br />
you can use the  sales credit note ..<br />
make a transaction catagory as sales credit note that will resolve your requirement.</div></div><hr />

Hi Sir,<br />
Please clear me, sales credit note effect goes both in ACR as well as in GLD, <br />
Let suppose my ACR balance is correct because the transaction is there, but the effect of that transaction is not triggered in GLD, then how can I correct my GLD.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
That means either somebody handle by GTM other wise it will not happen<br />
<br />
The solution is check the ACR transaction doument number and try to print the journal of the same  you can find the other effect of that entry<br />
if journal is only giving one line of acr entry there is GTM involved that is sure.<br />
other wise if the balance is not tally system will not allow to finalise the batch<br />
<br />
tell your tool person to print the stperrorlog and see any changes done by GTM for this document<br />
<br />
<br />
if that line is removed then you may have to correct by adding line in GLD by GTM only..<br />
Baan cannot pass single side entry...</div></div><hr />
