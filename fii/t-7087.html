<br />
Can anyboby help me vith calculation of add. calc. office variance, because I don't get it how it is calculated.<br />
I think every time this is calculated differently.<br />
<br />
Does any body knows teh right formula for calculatin it?</div></div><hr />

   This is easier to explain in mathematical term<br />
<br />
Say<br />
a=estimated qty<br />
da=actual qty - estimated qty<br />
b=estimated price<br />
db=actual price-estimated price<br />
<br />
We can easily see that<br />
a+da=actual qty<br />
b+db=actual price<br />
<br />
Then<br />
actual qty*actual price=(a+da)(b+db)<br />
                                    = ab + a*db +b*da + da*db<br />
<br />
And<br />
ab=estimated qty*estimated price<br />
a*db=price variance<br />
b*da=efficiency variance<br />
da*db=calc office variance!!<br />

<br />
Thank yuo for reply, but I need to know what quantities do you mean. Do you mean report in production ticst0401m000?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">11th October 2002, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to be the variances not picked up anywhere else e.g. due to stnadard costs not being rolled up properly.<br />
In our testing, we got that variance also where the batch differed from the standard for set-up times.<br />
You are right that it's confusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what Baan version you're in. I'm speaking in term of BaanERP 5.0c<br />
<br />
Estimated quantity is the quantity listed in estimated material (tisfc0510m000). This is retrieved from BOM during creation of production order. These estimated material quantities will change as ordered product quantity in prod order changes. At one point in time, the estimated mat'l qty must be frozen so they can be later compared to actual qty. In BaanERP, we can choose the timing of freezing whether it'd be at creation time, at release time, or at time of first transaction.<br />
<br />
Actual quantity is the quantity of material that's actually issued to production order. You can see quantity issued so far in Material to issue for production order ticst1501m000<br />
<br />
Actually you can look up the comparison between est and actual qty in estimated vs actual material costs ticst0501m000. Pls remember that I'm talking in term of BaanERP 5.0c.<br />
Also, pls bear in mind that so far, we've been talking about the material cost side only. For operation cost side, replace all the word &quot;quantity&quot; with &quot;hours&quot; in the formula<br />
