<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nansat99</div><div class="date">6th December 2005, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a EBS file frombank with 181 lines in the file. so I got 181 (tfcmg502.bser).<br />
Eachline in the file represents and anticipated document (eg for document number BNP 60004601)<br />
When the EBS batch is run , in the middle the process was stopped, first 42 recods  were processed succesffuly and posted to finance. When post ebs session is run again , an errror message &quot;anticipated document BNP 60004722 status is already completed&quot; and hence rest of the records not posted to finance.<br />
<br />
I dont know how the field tfcmg110.stpd was updated as complete without the record (with tfcmg502.bser as 42) getting posted.<br />
<br />
so when I observed the values for the anticipated document( which can be checked in tfcmg502) in all payment tables like tfcmg111,tfcmg112,tfcmg204.in all these tables the payment documentstaus is free.  <br />
<br />
If i run the correction program otfcor9909, it will not take care of tfcmg502,tfcmg503.<br />
<br />
worst option would be delete all the values . in this case back upof all tables must be taken. If this is the only option can anybody tell me how to take back up of baan tables ?<br />
<br />
<br />
anybody has better idea to solve this ?<br />
<br />
quick response would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lakmisoftware</div><div class="date">8th December 2005, 08:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Please check the below listed points first<br />
<br />
1.	You mentioned that 42 records were posted to finance. What is the status of the batch in table 100? Is it with ready status? Are you able to finalize that batch? If its with ready status and you are able to finalize the batch then you are OK<br />
2.	For the 42 records (sample verify for the 1st and 42nd record) check whether the reconciliation document is properly updated in tfacp200, tfcmg tables. If the updates are fine then you are OK. Through session you can cross verify it in check table, aging analysis report.<br />
3.	For the rest of the records (i.e. from 43 to 181) does BaaN created any reconciliation document. You can check this in tfgld018. If the answer is NO then you are OK<br />
4.	For the rest of the records (i.e. from 43 to 181) if the status is any thing other then Posted to finance in tfcmg502, then you are OK<br />
5.	Take a sample of 43 record check number and verify that the check status is still anticipated. If its anticipated then you are OK<br />
<br />
If all the above statements are OK <br />
<br />
Then you can <br />
<br />
1.	Take a table back up of tfcmg502 and 503. Ask your BaaN admins help.<br />
2.	Delete the records 43 to 181 in tfcmg502 and 503.<br />
3.	If the record from 1 to 42 is having a status other then Posted to Finance then change the value to Posted to finance in tfcmg502.<br />
4.	Change the EBS batch in tfcmg500 change the status to Posted<br />
5.	Go to your EBS file and remove the first 42 data lines.<br />
6.	Import the file and do the processing again.<br />
<br />
If you have any issues with the above steps or if you are not familiar with BaaN tables please call a BaaN expert or BaaN Support to resolve this.</div></div><hr />
