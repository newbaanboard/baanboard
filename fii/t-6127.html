<br />
When I print Purchase invoices for a supplier using tfacp2421m000 I can see 3 invoices which show an outstanding amount, however when you go to open entries tfacp2520m000 the balance is 0 which is correct therefore why do they show on the Print invoices reports with balances?????<br />
<br />
thanks for any help<br />

Problem is fixed - was to do with the document date on the actual payment attached to the invoice, it was shown as year 2003 when it should have been 2002, changed the date and report is now correct.<br />

thanks<br />
