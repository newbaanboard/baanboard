<br />
Some of the Integration Batches are not balanced in its debit <br />
and credit. If we run Print Non Finalized Transaction for some integration batches, there is a difference between debit and credit. <br />
<br />
      How can it be posssible? <br />
      If possible, how can it be rectified? <br />
<br />
Because of this i am unable to finalize the batches. <br />
<br />
If a data posted to finance through post integration transaction, It must be balanced right? If it is right, how those mismatched data would be posted to finance.<br />
<br />
Pls clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible that you have split batches - that is where one side of a transaction goes into one batch, and the other side goes into a different batch.  It is also possible that you have a stuck batch - this can happen if your system had a &quot;hiccup&quot;.<br />
<br />
I believe there is a correction program to restart interrupted batches.   When my company has experienced split batches, we have had to have BaaN Support help us with the GTM as it can be extensive, depending on the type of transaction that split.<br />
<br />
Is there any possibility that these batches are linked to the problem you're having with the unposted documents you mention in your other thread?  Look to see if they are the same transaction type/origin (Sales/Sales Invoice).  <br />

<br />
I aggre with Linda. This situation should not exist but sometimes the system had a &quot;hiccup&quot; and You can not do anything to avoid.<br />
<br />
Linda has rigth with split the batch using the same transaction origin like sales/issue, sales/invoice, purchase/Receipt, production (sfc)/issue, etc.<br />
<br />
Be aware of how you setup your integration parameter (tfgld4150m000) compression. This setup manages how you want to write the record in finance (tfgld102).<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
