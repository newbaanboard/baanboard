<br />
Standard reports show all transactions, there's not a summarised version as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Fortunately the report is reasonably excel friendly and does not require to much work to make it a list suitable for subtotaling or using in a pivot table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">1st April 2011, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">the reason is due to Auditor request..<br />
<br />
Auditor want to see the document no with total amt and not so many similar doc no and amt.<br />
<br />
they are too lazy to calc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">1st April 2011, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah! thought I was the only one with auditors like that. :)<br />
<br />
Might be worth a design report, save all the messing around every year.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">1st April 2011, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry to say, normally report design is the domain of the system adminstrator.<br />
<br />
<br />
The excel route is an option but depends on the excel version and the export set-up but again you need to talk to your system administrator. But in general excel 2007 works well as it can cope with a million lines and the export format needs to be at something like 9999 lines output per page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">1st April 2011, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">i am system administrator but i don't have alots of experience..<br />

I doubt you'll have to do to much, so should be within your experience.</div></div><hr />

The report writer is not user friendly and there are no menu buttons or help screens. <br />
<br />
If I remember well, the report changes you seek are not overly difficult to do, but you do need to be aware of a few things such as the values being called up in the report script and how these are being handled in the background. <br />
<br />
If your experience with the report writer is limited I would suggest getting outside help, particularly if this is the only report change you are likely to make.<br />
<br />
If you think there are more report changes to come it might be worth the investment in getting some training on report writing. - It will also strengthen your skill base for future employment opportunites.<br />
