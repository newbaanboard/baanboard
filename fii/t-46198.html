<br />
WHILE ASSIGNING THE  JOB IT IS NOT ASKING THE DEVICE AND FILE DETAILS.<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
JOB:REBUIL<br />
SESSION:tfgld3203m000<br />
<br />
ADD SESSION JOB (REBUIL,1,ACTION ON ERROR=INTERUPT,0,0) IT IS NOT ALLOWING TO ENTER FILE DETAILS.<br />
<br />
JUST TRY FROM YOUR SIDE AND ADVICE please.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks ,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">26th December 2007, 07:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you are right on that. I tried it at my side and found out that at the time of assigning this particular session to the job, it doesnt go to the device field. But, strangely though it allowed me to enter a device and a location of the file in Maintain Sessions By Job {ttaad5101s000}. I seriously doubt whether assigning a device in this fashion would yield any positive outcome, but then its worth a try while you wait for something more concrete of a solution...<br />

<br />
Rebuild ledger history - whether its tfgld3203m000 or tfgld3201 or tfgld3206 do not show any report. You can try executing these in non job mode and check for yourself. No report gets printed. However on the session you can notice the progress that its making. <br />
<br />
There is no way that you can make out what has changed after rebuild.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you take print of the Trial balance before rebuild and compare it with the TB after rebuild- you will get to know the differences or what changes occured after rebuild.<br />

<br />
Yes you are correct. I use to take first TB and after that i compare after rebuild TB.<br />
However if on screen running the system will display the typ/docno ledger code ..etc where are all get correcting.<br />
<br />
Infor(BaaN) should provide some report. lets hope..(baan iv or baan 5 or baan ln)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all.<br />
