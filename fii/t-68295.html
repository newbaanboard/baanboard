We have defined a check master and the check numbers have 0 (zero) preceding the number like; 010001. However, while we upload the Bank statement file we have put the check number as 010001 but the 0 (zero) is ignored and uploaded as 10001. The field for check number in tfcmg502 is string and not sure why the preceding zero is not uploaded. If we manually check the converted record we find the check number as 10001 and we can add a 0 (zero) before the check number manually and it saves as 010001. If the preceding 0 (zer0) is not there in the converted data, matching process will not go through as the check master has the preceding 0 (zero) and the converted data does not have the preceding 0 (zero). <br />
<br />
Is there a way to upload the check number with preceding zero while converting the file in EBS. Please do let us know if there is a way out in this case.</div></div><hr />

I have run the session Convert Electronic Bank Statements (tfcmg5202m000) and the record was converted and then I can see the record in the session Converted Electronic Bank Statements (tfcmg5502m000). The file had the check number as 010001 which is the same as in the Check Master. But the record converted which can be seen and edited in session Converted Electronic Bank Statements (tfcmg5502m000) has been uploaded as 10001 although the field in the table tfcmg502 for check number is a string.<br />
Hope this information is clear.</div></div><hr />

This is being done in Baan V and not Baan IV.</div></div><hr />

We have checked the standard program for Conversion of data for EBS and find that in the program the Check number provided in the filed (010001) is taken and then the VAL of this value (10001) is used to get the value which is uploaded. Hence the &quot;0&quot; preceding the number is ignored although the data is uploaded to tfcmg502 where the check number field is a string. <br />
This is for information to all on Baan Vc.</div></div><hr />
