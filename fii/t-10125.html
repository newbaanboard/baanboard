<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">23rd May 2003, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We continue to have problems linking a misc. A/P credit from a supplier for price differences on an inventory item, which overstates our standard cost of the item.<br />
<br />
We currently have our standard cost mapped in the following priorities.<br />
Average, Latest, Current, Simulated.<br />
<br />
An example of this problem is as follows:<br />
<br />
Standard cost of item = 100.00<br />
Purchase order = 100.00<br />
Suppliers invoice = 125.00 When the agreed upon price is 100.00. <br />
<br />
Due to the terms of payment we are unable to change the suppliers invoice back to 100.00 and they do a internal credit on their books to correct the error. We are forced to input the invoice at 125.00 which creates a PPV.<br />
<br />
When the suppliers credit memo is received its for 25.00 which we then input as a misc A/P credit charged off to the PPV account to offset the amount posted to the account from the original invoice.<br />
<br />
As standard cost roll ups occur the overstated cost is incorporated into the cost of the item. The time period that this overstated cost varies depending on the number of receipts, price changes, and time.<br />
<br />
If we do GTM as a workaround, we will have to keep adjusting the standard cost of the item each time until the standard is corrected over time with actual receipts, price changes, etc.<br />
<br />
We also attempted to do a negative quantity of 1 for the full amount of the credit from the supplier which would like the credit amount to the item, and then doing a stock adjustment to add 1 ea back into stock for the one we adjusted out of inventory on the purchase order.<br />
<br />
This workaround almost worked, however, we have a solution loaded into our system from our manufacturing department (they do not recall the solution #) that prevents our return to vendor (supplier) purchase orders with negative quantities from being included into the standard cost calculation.<br />
<br />
In addition we would like to have the ability to see how standard cost is calculated, the detail of each cumulative costing history. We have found the formula that Baan uses to do this but been unable to discover where the data is stored so that we can retrieve it and analyze it. <br />
<br />
We are also aware of the Equate Balance sessions functionality of clearing history records.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions, input or workarounds would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Have u tried matching partially the invoice 125 USD with the receipt, not approving it till u book the credit note, matching it also with the same receipt.<br />
And then approve first the invoice and then the credit note.<br />
The system will not change your average purchase price and the integration transactions generated are:<br />
One for Purchase/receipt for USD 100 (debit)<br />
One Purchase/Result USD 25 (CREDIT) when approving the invoice<br />
One Purchese/Result USD 25 (Debit) when approving the credit note.<br />
This way your Standard Cost Price will not be affected by the wrong amount on the invoice.<br />
Regards,<br />

In addition the credit note may take 3 - 4 months before it's received and we can process it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pfsilva</div><div class="date">23rd May 2003, 22:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe if u book the invoice USD125 and match it  with the receipt considering it completely matched, meaning that the receipt will be booked by UDS 100 and when approving the invoice  the system will ask u for an account to book the USD25.<br />
After approving the invoice this way, look at the average purchase price in your item file, and you will see that it remains the same.<br />
3-4 months later , when you receive the credit note you will book it as a miscellaneous one, meaning that you will not match it with the receipt, but u will book it in the same account where you book the price difference on the invoice.<br />
This way the average purchase price will not be altered and therefore no changes in the standard cost price.<br />
Besides the price difference account will be balanced.</div></div><hr />
