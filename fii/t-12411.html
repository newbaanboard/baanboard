<br />
We have  a problem with our bank balances whereby the figure given when entering tfcmg2101s000 is incorrect.<br />
<br />
We believe that this figure should match our closing balance on our Bank Account in the ledger history.<br />
<br />
Can anybodyt tell me how the figure in Maintain Bank Balances is calculated ?<br />
<br />
I have tried running tfgld3203m000 to rebuild the history in the suspect period but that has no effect.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I think I'm right in saying that the Bank Balance is calculated from <br />
tfgld201 and tfgld203.<br />
<br />
The problem appears to be occuring due to the missing value being posted in another currency when the account in question should be reserved for the home currency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have observed another situation where inconsistencies in<br />
Amount roundings due to customized updates of Amount fields<br />
cause this situation.Very rare though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">29th July 2003, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">No the difference is very minor and I've tracked down the problem transactions.<br />
<br />
Finance just need to post a credit about the bank ledger code to get the bank balance correct again.<br />
<br />

<br />
The problem relates to the fact that the actual Ledger Account Balance is probably made up of different currencies whilst the Opening Bank Balance on the Cash Transaction purely relates to the currency connected to that bank account.<br />
<br />
If you print out the report Trial Balance by currency for the ledger account you should see the amounts in the different currencies and the balance being selected for the Cash Transaction.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there is not a solution to this.<br />
