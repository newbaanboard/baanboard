<br />
The quantity on the internal invoice in case of a warehouse transfer is wrong. I would like to know what can be the reasons for the same and how can that be corrected.</div></div><hr />

Does the WH-Oder differ from the quantity shown on the invoice or was a different quantity shipped thus on the invoice than expected ? Or did you ship more than was received ? <br />
