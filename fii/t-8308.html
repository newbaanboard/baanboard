I am depreciating assets group wise. For Nov 02 depreciation calculation for all groups are correctly calculated and posted to GLD also. For Dec 02 when I run depreciation calculations, system has calculated depreciation for some assets within the group and some were left out. These assets r still in use. Year 2002 is not yet closed.<br />
<br />
What could be the reason??<br />

  I had come across the same problem in one of my previous implementations.The problem was beacuse of a bug in Baan4 c4 .&quot;The system doesn't calculate depreciation for the last period,eventhough continue depreciation is on&quot;.There are two solutions for this problem and the same can be obtained from the Baan support site.We were able to solve the problem after applying the patch.Unfortunately I don't have the case numbers with me ..<br />

<br />
I could locate the problem and is now fixed.<br />
<br />
It was in the initial set up. We hve to give the acc.dep figure upto 31/12/01 for the asset in the preceding fiscal year of intial set up(i.e.2002). For the year 02 till the period of intial set up acc.dep is entered. Then the system is calculating correctly for the period 12 in the year 02. In the last period of each year, the system will look at how much should be the total dep amt for the particular asset for the year and deduct the amount that is already depreciated, which would include any accumulated depreciation data recorded in the current year. This is subtracted from the amount and the result is the depreciation for the last period.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the suggestion. Our problem is little bit different. We have started FA module from 2002 only.  Most of the assets have depreciation for the first period is different than other periods. So, our total depreciation for the whole year (ie. 2002) is exceeds the Fixed amount mentioned in Depreciation data.  We have modified the  first period depreciation and process for Period 12, It works fine.</div></div><hr />
