<br />
We cant print sales invoice in tdsls4404m000 in BAAN IV c4 with SP7.<br />
System prompted that &quot;cant define sale invoice number&quot; after &quot;no data selected&quot; when printing final invoice. But for performance invoice it's OK.<br />
And it seems the problem with only 1 special SO type. But we did define the transaction type and the default serious number in tcmcs0142m000 and the serious number in tfgld0114s000.<br />
Actually we have already printed more than 200 invoices for the sales order type and transaction type. But all of a sudden, it doesnt work anymore.<br />
Would someone please kindly help?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did find that the next invoice number ACPXXXX0238 and ACPXXXX0239 have been used. <br />
So we changed next number for the serious number to 240, but still cant get the invoice.<br />
is there any causes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">30th December 2002, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at table tfgld017 (Last Used Document Nos by Transaction Type Series) and make sure that it agrees with First Free Numbers.  There's also a correction program tfcor0274m000 which might be of use but I'm not confident of that.</div></div><hr />

Happy New Year!</div></div><hr />
