<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">9th November 2007, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">We just did a major conversion on our Baan database. We went from 2 companies to 1 by merging the data through a series of SQL scripts. Our intention was to bring over only master tables with very little transactional data.  On one of our sales order types, a couple of the steps did not get transferred.  It should have had 1 (acknowledgement), 3 (delivery), 6 (invoice) and 7 (process delivered) but somehow it only got transferred with 6 and 7.  We caught this very quickly the day after conversion and fixed it through the table however, one order made it through to deleting line status before we caught it.   This is a return type order.  We have product now that's been invoiced but never received since that step wasn't done.  We can't just do a reversal of what we originally did because now we do have steps 1 and 3 in that order type.  What we really need to do is remove the invoice completely from finance and re-issue that sales order return.  What is the best way to do that?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">14th November 2007, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">If we create a new order type, using the same steps we brought the original order in and create a reversal of the order using that order type, even though it's not the same order type as the original.  We can run that order through the entire process and it will balance out the original.  We can then do another order with the correct order type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There is a correction program available (Presently I don't have correction program number, may be I will try to provide the same within day or two OR You can contact your support center for correction program details) which will remove the transaction from tfgld106 if it is finalized and from tfgld102 if it is not finalized. <br />
<br />
Another correction program is available which will remote the transaction from integration tables and bring the data to PDSO level. Once invoice came back to PDSO level you can carry following steps:<br />
<br />
1. note the details in table tdsls049 and remove the transaction from tdsls049  specific to the invoice.<br />
2. note the invoice no and other details from tdsls045 table and initialize the details like invoice type, invoice no., invoice date, procedure mask and step. <br />
3. take the order status to the earlier step which was pending and execute the steps.<br />
4. once status reach to the invoice input the details taken during step 2 and populate the respective field.<br />
5. update the table tdsls049 with the respective data taken thru step 1.<br />
6. do the pdso <br />
7. post the integration transaction<br />
8. check and finalize the batch.<br />

<br />
The correction program to reset the sales order step is otfcor0231 - Remove integration &amp; Reset sales order status<br />
<br />
However normally this is used in a sequence of correction programs:<br />
<br />
first otfcor0223 needs to be executed <br />
next is otfcor0224 and then finally otfcor0231.<br />
<br />
If this doesnt work then you can use the GTM to reset the same.<br />
<br />
The mask in tdsls045 has to be reset (7th field in the format mask) and then if you know the invoice number a record has to be inserted in tdsls049. <br />
<br />
Execute PDSO and it will post.<br />
