<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chris Kiehl</div><div class="date">27th December 2005, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
We are on Baan IVC4.<br />
<br />
We calculate our Operational Cost by adding the following Cost Components: labor (a fixed dollar amount per unit), manufacturing overhead (percent of Material Cost), and purchasing overhead (percent of Material Cost).<br />
<br />
Recently we have changed our manufacturing process from Backflush-Yes to Backflush-No using, instead, Outbound Advice (tdilc4201m000 &amp; tdilc4202m000).<br />
<br />
As a result of this change, the Operational Cost is not calculating properly.  The labor and manufacturing overhead Cost Components are calculating properly but it appears that the system is calculating the manufacturing overhead percentage a second time and adding it to the purchasing overhead amount and including that total in the purchasing overhead cost component. We see evidence of this in the Standard Cost Price by Item (Detailed) report, ticpr3401m000.<br />
<br />
We suspect this is related to our switch from Backflush-Yes to Backflush-No.<br />
<br />
Can anyone verify this and/or give an explanation on how to fix the problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
