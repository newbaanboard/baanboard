A transaction type with a category of Opening balances will not allow import because you cannot set the import fields on form 2.<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever used a transaction category of Journal Voucher and then changed the session that is executed to be an Opening Balances (tfgld1105s000)?<br />
<br />
Is there another approach?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I've faced already that problem and I solved it importing into the previous year, as &quot;closing balances&quot;, the opening balances and then generating thru session  Close Year, that automaticly generates the opening balances for the year I intendd to.<br />
Hope this help,<br />

Thanks for the response.  That is one of the options being discussed at the moment (and the one I'm leaning toward).  I'd like your opinion on the other ones we are considering.<br />
<br />
1.  Load the journal voucher to tables tfgld213, 214 and 215 using exchange.  That way we can control the transaction type.<br />
<br />
2.  Use a transaction type with a category of Journal Voucher, but change the Main session on the TT to be tfgld1105s000 (maintain opening balances)<br />
<br />
3.  Load the journal voucher and then change the transaction type in tfgld213 to be the one we have for opening balances.  This differs slightly from number 1 in that we have a session that was developed in-house to import from a .csv file that is generated out of Excel.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your response,<br />

I would suggest that you import it thru tfgld213,214 and 215 with a transaction type associated to a normal journal voucher (not opening balance) into the last period of the previous year and then proceed normally in Baan as if you wanted to close the year. This will ensure coherence.<br />
