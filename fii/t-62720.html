<br />
currently I am working in a single logistic - multi finance environment in Europe. The currency system that was set in tcemm170 is &quot;Dependent&quot;.<br />
The reference and EUR currency is the Euro.<br />
<br />
I have inharited this setting from my predecessors. Due to the fact that all companies in this environment have to use the same currency system which is dependent it is set in all financial companies.<br />
<br />
This setting is not a problem for those entities who have the Euro as home currency but we have also financial companies that have CHF, NOK, SEK and PLN as local currency.<br />
<br />
These companies have mayor problems with the dependent currency system because they are forced to have a triangular currency conversion via the Euro. E. g. if they have an unallocated receipt in one month and a negative unallocated receipt in the other month they can not be matched without writing of the currency difference in Euro...<br />
<br />
Now my company wants to rollout Baan 5.0c in Canada, US and Mexico.<br />
<br />
In my opinion a dependent currency system is out of the question for these countries, as I consider this to be a European setting which was needed in the phases when the EUR and the old currencies like HFL, FRF; DM existed next to each other for a while.<br />
<br />
For USA I am thinking about having the independent currency system with USD as local currency and EUR and GBP as reporting currencies.<br />
<br />
Now my question: Is it necessary to set a reference and the EUR currency (for technical reasons) in that scenario?<br />
<br />
How does a propper setting look for the US with independent?<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and your answers.<br />

You could use any other reference curreny (e.g. USD) in case you do accept to have 2 group companies which means that you will have to use intergroup transactions for that.<br />
