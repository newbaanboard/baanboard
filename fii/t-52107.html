<br />
I have a really urgent problem.<br />
I have a treatment that went to then end and has a status of successfully imputed when looking in session tfgld1110m000 BUT because of insufficiant disk space during the treatment the result of this operation is false.<br />
when trying to run session tfgld1119m000 to correct the problem it fails and tells us that the treatment had not been interrupted and went fine to the end.But it did not and we have an amount error in our balance.<br />
Anyways to correct this?If we manually change the status in table tfgld100 to be able to run session tfgld1119 in order to override the wrong values.<br />
The last option is db restore and i would like to avoid this.</div></div><hr />
