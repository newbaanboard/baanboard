<br />
I am getting a strange error which I have never received before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Invalide Dimension&quot;<br />
<br />
Any Advice?<br />
<br />
Note: I am thinking that maybe the Integration Options or Method are not acceptable</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you look in tfgld4510m000 to the erroneous record, mark it and go to special to the details of this record, which account or dimension is missing?<br />
<br />
regards, Juli</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">26th June 2002, 21:58</div></div><div class="posttext">This message only appears in tfgld4200 script.<br />
If you have this script in U stnd, then:<br />
<br />
If your message is this &quot;Invalid dimension&quot;, this message only appears in these two scenarios:<br />
<br />
1.- The dimension is not defined in the range of dimensions per ledger account. You checked and it is all right.<br />
2.- The integration comes from external package, field tfgld410.tror = 21 (tctror.extern) If this is the case, BaaN checks if this dimension exists and if not writes this error.<br />
<br />
No other case for this error message in B40Ustnd</div></div><hr />

The account dimensions I am using are not new.  They are currently being used for other integrations <br />
<br />
Do you mean that the account-dimension-combination is already used? Or the dimensions are already used with other accounts?<br />

<br />
I was told that this version IVc of Baan has some quirks.<br />
<br />
What I did was delete the dimension ranges, saved and exited, then re-entered the ranges, and finally posted.<br />
<br />
It worked!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks again everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We faced a similar problem, but in a multi company environment. The same message and the solution was to share range of dimension per ledgers. Ledger accounts was previously shared in the environment. That's why I insisted in this matter. Your solution was different but worked.</div></div><hr />
