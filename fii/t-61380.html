  If the close period not Final close! that you can follow the next year but you cannot follow the 3rd year reporting with out the 1st Year End processes <br />
  when you need to follow the next fical year with out the final year end you must run the session Close Year Provisional to start the begining balance of the next fical year. <br />
welcome to LN finance Users<br />

The final close are the madatory processes to complete the year end processes. <br />

<br />
Final closing is not a mandatory process and you can very well continue with the future periods without final closing.<br />
<br />
However it is recommendatory to finally close those year whose accounts have been finalized and audited. Because audited books should not be open to be modified.<br />
<br />
Hope this will be useful.<br />

if we don't perform finally closed in the year end, will there be an impact?<br />
<br />
Ans:-<br />
Its impact because without finally closed you can not perform the year end closing.<br />
Without Year closing procedure, you can not print the correct trial balance of next comming year to the current year.<br />
becasue we can process provisional closing only for one year. i.e current year &amp; next comming year. .... Current year field in provisional closing session is updated automatically after closing year procedure.</div></div><hr />
