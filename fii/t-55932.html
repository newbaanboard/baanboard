<br />
I have one PCS Item - A in my Sales order with X value and I have 2 other cost items in the same Sales order with Y and Z value. Now when I invoice Y ,Z and X separately , is there anyway I can tell the system that revenues earned out of Y and Z are also to be attributed to my Item A , so that I can compare the Cost of Item A with revenues for Item A (X+Y+Z).<br />
<br />
Thanks A Lot in Advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">2nd June 2009, 00:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I see the issue and I’m just brainstorming here. I’m not confident that you can get the analysis without some type of customized report or by analyzing data in Excel.<br />
<br />
Can we assume that the cost items cannot be linked to PCS Item A by a common mapping characteristic (logged element) such as Item Group, Statistics Group, etc? To look at it another way, can the cost items Y and Z also be on a sales order for PCS Item – B for which you may also want to analyze revenues and costs?<br />
<br />
Are you hoping to analyze the revenues &amp; costs X, Y &amp; Z for one sales order? Or if PCS Item – A may be sold on multiple sales orders, are you trying to find a way to analyze revenues and costs for sales of PCS Item – A across all sales orders for PCS Item – A?<br />
<br />
If you can live with analysis by Sales Order, have you considered creating an Integration Document Type Group (tfgld4559m000) with the IDTs that you consider relevant to revenues/cost (margin) analysis? If analysis by sales order is OK, you could base your analysis on a fairly standard Print Integration Transactions report (perhaps a flat file version for Excel) with selection based on Business Object (sales order) and Integration Document Type Group.<br />
<br />
Let us know. This is challenging!<br />
