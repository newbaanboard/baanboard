<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jule123</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 22:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello <br />
<br />
I have joined a company using Baan 1 month ago. I am a controller and have a question regarding reporting.<br />
<br />
At the moment there are cost center reports where one report is defined with identical accounts and additions of accounts for each cost center. Totals of some cost centers have to be done by repeating the accounts.<br />
<br />
To have to define a report for each cost center can be done by copying, but when there are changes in the accounts, the structure of the subtotals or the structure of the cost centers, it is very much work, also creating easily mistakes to change all the reports.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there a possibility in Baan to create one report with accounts and subtotals which then is used by every cost center and with totals on defines cost centers.<br />
<br />
I would be very glad if someone could help me with this questions<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
<br />
Jule</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have investigated in our IT-Department<br />
<br />
we are using IVC4, but we do not have the Controlling package installed. I only have the possibilities of Finance, reports.<br />
<br />
Are you using the controlling package? What are the features?<br />
<br />
Bye<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">7th September 2001, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">:p <br />
Unfortunately there is no international controlling package in IVc4. <br />
At this moment I am implementing only subsidiaries  outside of germany. <br />
But if you have a look on the documentation CD-ROM of IVc4 you can find a manual with all the functionalities of the controlling package. <br />
<br />
Concerning your problem with the cost centers I will answer later, I have to test it before. <br />
But I have already got an idea. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abennett</div><div class="date">7th September 2001, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand what you mean. Financial Statements only work well in a company who's chart of accounts or dimensions remain fairly static.<br />
<br />
Have you tried the standard cost centre reports in general ledger. &quot;Print Trial Balance with dimensions&quot;, choose your relevent range and then choose the budget variance reports. <br />
<br />
They may not be the prettiest reports, but they are quite functional.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jule123</div><div class="date">15th September 2001, 23:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried the standard report you have recommended. It shows the variances of 1 cost center on each account to the budget quite well.<br />
<br />
But for the reporting to our mother company and also in the company itself I do not want and can not show each single account.<br />
<br />
I have to summarize certain accounts as personnel cost, travel cost, cost of premises and so on. <br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
