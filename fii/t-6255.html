<br />
I have a problem in the FST-Module. <br />
<br />
My report consists of 3 columns. <br />
First column  is current data,<br />
second is budget data,<br />
third is deviation of current data to budget data, in an excel-sheet the formula would be (current-budget)/budget .<br />
<br />
Additionaly when the current is less than budget then the deviation should be shown with a negative sign. <br />
<br />
First I tried &quot;Percentage over columns&quot; with budget as 100% column but then I get deviation calculated as current/budget, not (current-budget)/budget. <br />
<br />
When I use &quot;amount/quantity&quot; with the formula (current-budget)/budget, the deviation is correct calculated for all positions with sublevel zero but not for the summarized positions. There the system is also just summarized which leads to errors. <br />
<br />
Please give me any idea you have. <br />
Thanks, <br />
Juli  <br />

<br />
the selection of the values is done by tffst1205m000 and the printing by tffst1450m000 . <br />

<br />
I had very similar problem with tfgld3405m000 in relation to budgets so it would certainly be worth looking at the latest version of the session.<br />

<br />
it is not a bug. We have the latest objects for FST-Module on the server installed. <br />
The question was just which formula solve the problem. <br />
<br />
In fact, I solved it. Now we have an additional &quot;help&quot; column which is not printed but used for calculation. <br />
<br />
First the absolute deviation is calculation between actual and budget, and then the standard functionality Percentage over columns is used. <br />
And ...<br />
it gives the correct figures. <br />
