<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">25th March 2002, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We have many suppliers that we purchase from who give us discounts if we pay within their terms of payment.<br />
<br />
I have setup the terms of payment and played around with the number of day's settings.<br />
<br />
Ex.<br />
<br />
Purchase order is for 100 ea at 5.00 <br />
Suppliers invoice is for 5,010.00<br />
<br />
The 5,010.00 is comprised of 100 ea at 5.00, freight 5.00,and sales tax of 5.00.<br />
<br />
We do not input additional line items on our p.o for freight or sales tax.  Most of the time our purchasing dept. will not know the amounts for these two items.<br />
<br />
I call it a header vs line item problem.<br />
<br />
When we select invoices for payment Baan wants to take a discount on the full amount of 5,010.00 when it should only take it on the 5,000.00 amount.  We have to mannualy adjust every one of our invoices to reflect the correct discount and amount to be paid.<br />
<br />
Does any one encounter this same problem or have a work around for us.  As I said earlier we can't just add 2 more lines to the p.o.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
Doug</div></div><hr />

<br />
for Baan it doesn't matter which products you have to pay. For the term of payment freights are the same then the goods you buy. It is a discount because you pay early without any relation to the items bought. <br />
We have had the same problem with our subsidiaries. Now they receive a separate freight invoice per month without any discount. <br />
<br />
Sorry, no other idea. <br />
Bye, Juli</div></div><hr />
