<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tech_cheta</div><div class="date">13th June 2006, 13:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi techies, :) <br />
I am new to this forum and BaaN ERP also. <br />
My organisation is going implement BaaN Finance Module. We are studying whether Multi Finance Multi Logistic will help to our organisation or Single Finance Single Logistic or Single Finance Multi Logistic.<br />
Let me first explain how our organisation works.<br />
<br />
At HO we are having different manufacturing units. Their products and nature of business is totally different. <br />
So our Manufacturing module, marketing module etc item master structure will be totally different.<br />
MfgDept_1, MfgDept_2, ... MfgDept_m<br />
We are having different service departments. <br />
ServiceDept_1, ServiceDept_2, ... ServiceDept_s<br />
We are having different branches at different location<br />
Branch_1, Branch_2... Branch_n<br />
So, my question is, in multi finance multi logistic approach how companies we need to create?<br />
What dimensions we can use in this case? <br />
For auditing we require branch wise balance seet to prepared as well as departmentwise and consolidated also.<br />
Can any one suggest the optimistic approach for this?<br />
Your earliest reply is highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

If thsi implies different costprices for the same item, you must have multiple logistic companies, since in Baan IV an item can only have one costprice (in f.e. ERP LN one can have multipe costprices).<br />
The number of financial companies will depend on whether you must have multiple balance sheets.<br />
Sales orders, purchase orders, pcs projects, TP projects, warehouses, workcenters can all be linked to a finance company.<br />
You need to give a little more detail on the company req in order to give you the optimal advice</div></div><hr />

tech_cheta : Yes we want multiple balance sheets. <br />
that too one should be able to make combination of these<br />
e.g. Branch1 is having MfgDept_1, MfgDept_2, ... ;ServiceDept_1, ServiceDept_2, ... <br />
One should be able to prepare consolidated balance sheet for Branch1<br />
as well as different for each department as well as for one mfgDept across the branches one consolidated balance sheet.</div></div><hr />

Can you give me a little more background on yourself and it will help me pass along my experience to you.<br />
<br />
Are you in the IT staff or are you in the business? What country are you in? Do you have a consultant helping with your implementation? Are there accountants assigned the task of sorting out the ledger accounts, dimensions, and reporting?</div></div><hr />
