<br />
Solution #200326 refers to certain orders that show up on report of session tfacp1439m000 &quot;Print Receivable Invoices upto period&quot; when they should be cleared, because the invoices have been fully matched and approved to receipts.<br />
<br />
I'm experiencing a similar situation with session tfacp1435m000 &quot;Print GRNI Reconciliation - Balances&quot;, i.e., balances of orders fully matched and approved are being showed in the reports of the session (and they should not).<br />
<br />
I will appreciate any information about a solution to this problem.<br />
<br />
Best regards..</div></div><hr />

Please check whether you have archived the invoices that was matched and approved to the PO.<br />
<br />
What I mean by archived is that you have run the session to remove fully paid invoices.<br />
<br />
If you have done so then the PO will always show on the GRNI report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume that you have installed the GRINYA functionality in your system where a new table tfacp135 was created to enable you to print the tfacp1435 report.<br />
There was an archiving functionality for GRINYA where the report will not print the fiscal period that was archived. In this case, you can chose not to delete the records in acp135 table but the system will know that the records was archived. As such, the report will not show those periods that was archived.<br />
Another effect of archiving is that session tfacp1235m000 will no longer select any records to acp135 table if the finalization period falls within the archived period.</div></div><hr />

I think we haven't performed archiving, but anyway I'm gonna check it, thanks mtho33</div></div><hr />
