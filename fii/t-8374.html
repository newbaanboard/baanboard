<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rickeyy</div><div class="date">10th January 2003, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">When we run session tfacr2290m000 (Generate invoice by self billing), error message appears for purchase orders. These orders are purchase order price adjustments. <br />
<br />
The message reads &quot;No integration transaction found for logistical order company 802 and order DMCI00481 10&quot;.<br />
<br />
The purcahse order does not have a quantity or price assigned to it. The only financial amount assigned to it is entered in the amount field of the purchase order. <br />
<br />
I beleive by not entering a quantity and price results in this error message. <br />
<br />
Is this encountered with other customers and is there a solution to this ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are that far in the process I guess you have a receipt in tfacp245 for that particular orderline, i.e. you received it in Purchase (with a quantity 0, you can not receive in Warehousing)?<br />
<br />
Do you also have a receipt transaction in the integration transactions (check tfgld4510)? For all integration transactions which post on one side to invoice accrual, there should always be a record created in the integration transactions even for 0 amount/0 quantity records.<br />
This integration transaction is necessary as exact the same invoice accrual account has to be reversed during the posting of the selfbilled invoice.<br />
<br />
If you do not find a receipt integration transaction for this particular orderline then that is the error.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you for your help. <br />
<br />
I had looked in session ytfgld4510 and could not find the order number. I assume this is an error.<br />
<br />
Do you know of a solution for this. I will look at knowledge base.<br />
<br />
Again Thnaks for your help.<br />

<br />
No I do not know if this error has already been solved. Please be sure that the purchase order we are talking about was not generated by a subcontracting order, because then all financial integration data is logged with the subcontracting order number and not the purchase order number.<br />
<br />
If your order is a normal purchase selfbilled order which was received, either in Warehousing or directly in Purchase then there should exist a receipt integration record in tfgld4510 even if the transaction amount/quanity is 0.<br />
<br />
I suggest to take this up with BAAN support.<br />
<br />
