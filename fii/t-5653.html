<br />
 The problem we find is that when the intercompany journal is debited in the company receiving the charge that if there is no record in table tfgld009 then a transaction can be generated to an account with an invalid dimension ( the dimension is valid in the company receiving the charge). However, if a record exists in this table for any other dimension then we get an error message that it is an invalid account/dimension combination. <br />
 <br />
Is it necessary to have an entry in table tfgld009 for each chart of accounts record, not all accounts are used in all companies?:confused:</div></div><hr />

are you sharing the tfgld010 tables also and if so please try populating the tfgld009tables also.<br />

As each company is completely independent we are not sharing tfdgld010. There is some duplication of Dimension codes with different descriptions amongst them so this option was not available to us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the COA which were been maintained in tfgld008 and u have the dimension as Mandatory or Optional its absolutely necessary to populate the tfgld009 tables for seamless updation of dimensions and ledgers through integration and Intercompany Transactions. <br />
<br />
despite giving the full range of dimension codes in the maintain sessions its better u delete the full range and enter ur necessary range and maintain the session, this should solve ur problem.<br />
