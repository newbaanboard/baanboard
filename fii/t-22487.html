We want to introduce reporting periods from the next fiscal year. Hence I am trying to change 'reporting periods'= yes in Maintain Group Company parameters. But system is not allowing to change it. Can someone help me how to do it? We are on Baan IVc.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

when the initial set up was done, it must have been reporting periods &quot;No&quot;. Now u want to change it to yes. This you will have to do from GTM only. And then u can generate the periods. For periods before there will be no data in reporting periods.<br />

Reporting periods are useful only if the number of fiscal/reporting periods are different.<br />
<br />
Adding reporting period may have some performance impact on finalization session and background proceses.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info. I changed it through GTM and assume there won't be any problem while closing the previous years. Yes Hitesh, the same end-date is a bit of a hitch.<br />
