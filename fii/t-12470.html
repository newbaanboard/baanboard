<br />
Problem 1.<br />
<br />
Using session tfcmg1120m000 stand-alone payment created. User failed to give Debit amt and the payment batch posted using check master. System not generated any error when tfcmg1240m000 was run eventhough document is not balanced. Why??????<br />
<br />
Record present in tables tfcmg100, 101, 102(for Dr entry), 109 and 113. Payment batch status is posted. In tfgld102 no record for debit entry hence unable to finalize batch. How to rectify??<br />
<br />
Problem 2.<br />
<br />
Again in session tfcmg1120m000  stand-alone payment maintained. Session tfcmg1240m000 run. Though the ledger a/c for debit as well as the amt is given, system is not showing the debit amount after revisiting the session.  It shows 0 value in Net amount field. Remaining amount is 0 in session tfcmg1113s000.<br />
How come????<br />
Can I insert record manually in tfgld102 thru GTM???? <br />
<br />
Any suggestions highly appreciated.<br />

<br />
Problem 1 occured to me several times. It was easier for me not to add missing records in tfgld102, tfgld100, tfgld101, tfgld018 but to delete payment batch in tfcmg104,109,110, 111, 112,.... and to delete anticipated payment in tfacp200 if there was purchase invoice/unallocated payment involved.<br />
In my case user did also something wrong in procedure and it was easier for me to delete everything in tfcmg.... and than the user made procedure again. It depends on that how many records You have in tfcmg....<br />
There was also no error message in procedure that something went wrong, the user even get the message: all payments are successfully proccessed.<br />
<br />
I advise You to clear appropriate cmg tables and make the correct procedure again.<br />
<br />
I hope You'll succeed!<br />
<br />
Regards!<br />

I faced a similar problem last week - there is a solution for the same<br />
<br />
Run otfcor0111 (Baan solution 155153 - search in knowledge base) - this correction program will reverse all the entries and the payment batch will have the status 'paid' then you can create the debit line and re-post the batch.<br />
<br />
Works smoothly !!!!</div></div><hr />
