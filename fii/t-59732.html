<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KBacca</div><div class="date">21st December 2010, 01:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings - I'm trying to find a field in the LN tables and so far I'm not finding it.<br />
Can anyone offer any suggestions?<br />
<br />
When using the session:Match/Approve Purchase Invoices (tfacp2107s000)<br />
to Approve approve and Invoice that my have some Additional Costs  included.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to find if the User who actually performs the &quot;Approve Invoice&quot; is recorded along with the transaction.  <br />
<br />
I've been asked to add a column to an existing report (tfacp1431m000:Print Matched and Approved Purchase Invoices with Receipts) which will show the User Id that approved the Invoice...but so far all I find in the User who Authorized or last modified the invoice....<br />
<br />
Is this recorded in the LN Tables somewhere?</div></div><hr />
