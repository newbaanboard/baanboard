If Not yet, print integration transaction with fiscal period, transaction Origin &quot;Sales&quot; and Financial Transaction &quot;Sales Invoice&quot; for transaction status is&quot;unposted&quot; or &quot;Erroneous&quot;.<br />
<br />
You are should be check in &quot;Display Integration Transaction Log (tfgld4532m000), may be you have error when post integration transaction to Finance Trans. If have an error, clear the error first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tfgld4432m000<br />
tfgld4532m000<br />
<br />
and then get the appropriate error line and description by using the session -tfgld4510m000.<br />

Can you check in tfgld410 for these transactions where the field batch number on the last form. if this has a number. CAn you check in tfgld100 the batch status. And also check in tfgld106 if the document number is present. If yes, then please change the status in tfgld418 to posted and delete them from tfgld416<br />

I want to knoe the reason for GL code not defaulting through thr automatic process.<br />
It can be manually changed / inserted through table which i have already done. But i want to know the rootcause of this error.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajhyd</div><div class="date">25th January 2009, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess you need to check with Infor support and the standard answer would be - it is technical reason as to why it didnt get updated. The automatic process takes care of all ledger accounts to be picked for posting during integrations. However it is possible (very rare occasions) that the ledgers and dimensions got posted but the status in certain tables didnt get updated. It is possible that while such updation was on the connection with the server got lost or whatever.<br />
<br />
I hope this is a clear reason for you. Coming back to your comment that every thing can be changed through GTM - well this is possible only if the person knows about the complications in the tables and all the updations that happen.<br />
<br />
And for integrations if not posted, it is not needed to put the ledgers into it, there are different ways of doing it. Maybe you can check with support. If not then please mail me.<br />

<br />
I ahve checked as instructed by you.<br />
Out of so many records, most of them are not present in tfgld410. Few of them are present in tfgld410. But the batch is 0 (null) for these in last form.<br />
Also the Document status for these transaction is &quot;Reserved&quot; and they are not present if tfgls416. Kindly guide me further....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajhyd</div><div class="date">12th February 2009, 07:12</div></div><div class="posttext">This means that you other related issue of the non postings because of the integration errors is preventing you from month closing. Unless that is solved, this wont work please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpchheda</div><div class="date">14th March 2009, 06:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Try to give some solution , as the problem is already highlighted by me.<br />

First resolve it and then try to close the month and update if there are any more errors.<br />
