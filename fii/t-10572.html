<br />
I am facing a problem in Advances to Supllier account. It is showing me an amount for the advance given to a supllier however, that has been already adjusted.<br />
<br />
well, here is the complete details &amp; history.<br />
<br />
We have made a payment (Advance) to a supplier in Jan-2000 of appox. 3.92 lacs Rs thru bank transaction hsb-20090004.<br />
<br />
It debitted the Advance account and Credited Bank.<br />
<br />
then after receiving goods &amp; invoice from supplier, it is matched &amp; approved and a new tranaction MAP-21030168 was generated on 31-3-2001.  It credited Account Payable and Debitted Registered Invoice Account.<br />
<br />
then another tranaction (assign unallocated payments) was generated on 19-12-2002 to link previous transactions. The transaction generated was APT-22120014.<br />
<br />
This transaction deitted Account Payable and advances to Supplier.<br />
<br />
Now when i check my trial balance of 2002 it show me advance outstanding there. if i check control account checklist, there also it shows the difference as open item balance is zero.<br />
<br />
<br />
can somebody help me on this.<br />
<br />

Please see whether the field ctyp and cinv show MAP-21030168 for the document  APT-22120014<br />
<br />
It could also be a rbuild of GL issue. Please check whether the finalised trnx of you advance account tally with trial balance total</div></div><hr />
