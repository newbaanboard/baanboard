<br />
Processing monthly closing of periods. Error generated&quot; Unposted transactions present: closing period not allowed&quot; and shows table, TT and document no.<br />
<br />
When I look for the particular TT and document no. in tfgld1504m000 system shows the finalization run no. in which this document is finalized successfully. Ledger also updated correctly. Record present for this document both in tfgld102 and tfgld106. Probably the roll over did not take place from tfgld102 to tfgld106 after finalization. Quite a few documents like this for which error is generated.<br />
<br />
How to correct this????<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely to be caused by an interrupted finalisation run, these are always a bit tricky to recover from. Try restarting the finalisation run, but most of the time that doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Check if the records for the transaction(s) in tfgld106 balance and are complete. Check if the records left in tfgld102 are also present in gld106 or if they are additional lines for the same doc. <br />
<br />
If they are all in gld106 then simply delete them from gld102 (unless it's a recurring/reversing journal, these may have to stay behind in gld102!).<br />
<br />
If they are not in gld106 you'll have to finalise them. The restart finalisation run session may not work, so providing they balance you may have to create a new batch with the relevant transaction type and change the records in gld102 to link them to the new batch which you can then finalise. You may have to tidy up tfgld018 as well and the ledger history tables tfgld20x may be out of sync due to the interrupted finalisation run so you may have to rebuild these.<br />
<br />
Good luck. If anyone has a detailed document describing how to recover from these issues I'd be interested.</div></div><hr />

Tks for reply. No problem with integration transactions. The errors are generated for non-integration transactions only.<br />
<br />
Tried restarting the finalisation run, but as u said rightly it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Records for the transaction(s) in tfgld106 balance and are complete. Records left in tfgld102 are also present in gld106 and no additional lines for the same doc. <br />
<br />
I deleted them from tfgld102 and when I run tfgld1206m000 again system throws up some more docs which again are finalized.  I wvd like to rollover all of them frm tfgld102 to tfgld106 instead of resorting to deletion every time.<br />
<br />
Any further suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Not really, you need to check them all anyway. If they are all in the same batch then ttaad4100 will allow you to delete the whole range of docs in one go, but deleting ranges always makes me a bit nervous (not that ttaad4100 will get it wrong, but I might), so I always make a sequential dump of the table before doing that.</div></div><hr />
