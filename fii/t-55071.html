I have an issue in finance.<br />
The system has taken two cheques for single payment and hence the system has generated same ANP number for both the cheques. We can correct ourselves by canceling the ANP, then the whole transaction incl. the cheque gets cancelled but the problem is since it has taken two cheques, even after canceling the ANP only one cheque gets cancelled while the other cheque remains with ANP cancelled and we cannot use the un-cancelled cheque.   Pls. resolve it.<br />

Please check the terms of payment and due date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnbhatt</div><div class="date">12th July 2011, 09:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The cheques which are already generated can not be re-use now. Either you reject the documents in reconciliation process if it is must for you to make onle cheque only else can be given 2 cheques to suppliers.<br />
<br />
As a solution please check payment method used to generate these cheques. Composing action field in payment method may be changed to &quot;Remittance&quot; and Planed Payment date = Due date field should be unchecked to generate one cheque in future.<br />
