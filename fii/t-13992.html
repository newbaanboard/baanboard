I want to know when is the &quot;Invoice Balance&quot; of a customer is updated in tccom011. Does this get updated after transactions are booked/posted in ACR. Like for e.g. if a sales-cum-excise  invoice is made from distribution module does the customer balance get updated automatically or does it get updated when Sales-sales Invoice integration transactions are posted. <br />
Also, what is the situation for supplier balances in tccom021. Does the Invoice balance get updated after transactions in ACP module?.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sales invoices from distribution are updated in tccom011 in the session 'Process Delivered Sales Orders' (tdsls4223m000). Therefore the invoice balance in tccom011 can be different from the sum of tfacr200 (tfacr200 is created in the session 'Post Integration Transactions to Finance Transactions' (tfgld4201m000)).  <br />
I think supplier balances in tccom021 are updated in the session 'Maintain Purchase Invoices' (tfacp1110s000).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">18th December 2003, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I think customer balances are updated when transactions are entered into open entries either by manual entry through maintain transactions or by posting from logistics.  I'm just not sure if the invoice balance is updated when the Invoice is printed or when the post is run.<br />
<br />
I know that when you enter purchase invoices in finance the balance is automatically updated.</div></div><hr />
