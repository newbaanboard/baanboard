<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">2nd August 2002, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Our system was originally set up with a number of shared finance tables and a group payments company.<br />
<br />
We no longer have a group payments company and make payments from two individual companies after unsharing the payment tables.<br />
<br />
As the two companies are becoming totally seperate entities they have asked the question about having seperate tfgld008 (chart of accounts) tables.<br />
<br />
Is this as simple as creating another copy of the table and breaking the shared link or are there other tables I need to seperate at this point.<br />
<br />
Has anybody done this sort of exercise before with gld008 ?<br />

My answer is based on a recollection is that you're on Baan IV.<br />
<br />
I haven't actually made that change but I think it should be one of the easier decentralizing tasks, assuming that you start by simply copying the existing table before deleting the logical link. <br />
<br />
Beyond tfgld008, look at all of your logical tables. I think it is safe to say that any table that references a ledger account -- whether in tf or another package -- will also need to be unique by company unless the table row also includes the company number. For example I'm sure you will also need to &quot;separate&quot;  tfgld009 (Dimension Ranges by Ledger Account),  tfacp005 (Ledger Accounts by Supplier Group), tdinv850, tdsls070/71, etc. in a similar manner, if those are currently shared.<br />
<br />
Since the request for separate ledgers was driven by business decision, you should probably question whether the actual dimension codes should also be unique, but that's from a business  -- not a Baan -- functional perspective.<br />
<br />
Obviously, you should try the change in your test environment before breaking the logical links in production. Hopefully someone else who has made the actual change can advise further.<br />

<br />
Many thanks for the feedback.<br />
<br />
You are correct in remembering that we are on IVc3 (I should really have put this in my post).<br />
<br />
I have been reviewing my logical table setup and agree with the tables you have picked out. Your answer was certainly more comprehensive than the one that I got back from support.<br />
<br />
I will now go back to support with this list before proceeding with the split exercise in my test environment.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<br />
1. create sequential dump of file<br />
<br />
2. unshare table <br />
<br />
3. load dump to new company<br />
<br />
I did this in a high volume company in the UK and have had heard of no problems to date.</div></div><hr />
