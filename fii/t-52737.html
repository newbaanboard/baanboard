The Czech localisation includes functionalities from automotive and supply chain. We do not need both, so we would prefer to use Baan IVc4 standard without the localisation.<br />
But I am not able to valuate the impacts when we disclaim the Czech localisation, especially regarding the part finance.<br />
Has anyone experiences to run Baan in the Czech Republic?<br />
Is it absolutely necessary to use the localisation? Which are the additional functionalities in comparison to the standard?<br />
Perhaps, has anyone a documentation (I didn´t find any yet.) and would send it to me?<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

I have experience with czech localization and some of changes in czech localization are needed by the law. The rest of it was made because most users wanted to.<br />
As far as I know there are some customers running on standard but in this case you have to customize the system. (changes in intrastat, taxes - reporting, mandatory reports, gld, reports in GLD,SLS,PUR)<br />
It depends what version of Baan you want to use. It seems to me localization on Baan IVc4 was bigger than on LN 6.1.<br />
<br />
And dont forget the translation to czech language. I can hardly imagine the system running in Czech rep. without proper translation into native language.<br />

thank you for the reply.<br />
In fact, we want to use Baan IVc4. The problem is, that we know that there is a localisation, but we do not know what are the included topics and which impact or problems it would be to say &quot;we do not install the localisation, but use the standard and customize ourself only the parts that we need&quot;.<br />
Do you have a description/ documentation of the localisation? if &quot;yes&quot; could you send it to me? language doesn´t matter, english would be great but if it would be in czech language I engage a translator.<br />
Thank you very much in advance.<br />

Is it new implementation ? Send me PM if you want to discuss some more details about it.<br />
