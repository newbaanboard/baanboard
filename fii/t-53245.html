<br />
Then user already maintain receipt .<br />
<br />
first time the supplier collect the payment $15000.<br />
so last month finance already make partially payment $15000.<br />

And the balance $15000 , finance will make the payment by this month.<br />

The problem is when user go to Match receipt side , the record is showing &quot;partially&quot;  and the amount is $15000.<br />

user are not able to click on it...so cannot do payment (link).<br />
<br />
so what is the solution ? <br />
Is that the record should under status &quot;NO&quot; instead of &quot;partially&quot; ??<br />
Do I need to change from backdoor ? if yea, what record I need to modify?<br />

I think that your problem is not to match payments with receipts but to match 2 purchase invoices with 1 receipt?<br />
(Afterwards a payment for the invoice can be done.)<br />
<br />
transaction batch, transaction type &quot;purchase invoice&quot; with signal &quot;match with purchase orders&quot;. -&gt; enter information of second invoice in tfacp1110s000 Maintain Purchse Invoices -&gt; &quot;Continue&quot; opens tfacp1131s000 Match Receipts, the receipt for the purchase order is listed with (in example) already 1 invoice matched &quot;partially&quot; -&gt; mark the order-position -&gt; special -&gt; <br />
Maintain/ Add Invoice to selected Order -&gt; in following program enter the second (or third or whatever) invoice -&gt; close -&gt; matched -&gt; approve -&gt; pay later.<br />

Sorry, but I am not so clear what you meant.<br />
<br />
Is that what I see from screen (the record is under partially status ) is not wrong ??<br />
<br />
The user already do payment for the 1st time and the record already finalized , so whatever done is done..<br />
so may I know how am I going to help the user to do the 2nd payment ??<br />
<br />
Thanks alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ath999</div><div class="date">7th August 2008, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
perhaps it is my mistake and I do not understand the problem correctly.<br />
<br />
What I thought the problem would be is:<br />
You have 1 purchase order, value 30.000.<br />
You have 1 receipt for this purchase order, value 30.000.<br />
You have 1 invoice, amount only 15.000. This invoice was matched partially with the receipt. This invoice was paid. Remark: you pay the invoice, not the receipt of the items.<br />
<br />
Now, you want to pay the rest of the purchase order (still 15.000 to be paid to the supplier).<br />
For paying something, you need an invoice. Here: a second invoice for the purchase order, because in the first invoice only the amount of 15.000 was invoiced.<br />
For booking this second invoice, matching this 2nd invoice to the receipt for the purchase order and paying it afterwards please see my first reply.<br />
<br />
If this scenario doesnÂ´t fit to your problem please describe in other words what you want to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
