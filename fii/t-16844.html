<br />
I have a situation in my company where some customers are paying the anticipated receipts in a partial basis.<br />
<br />
We don't send it to the bank but keep it at office and when the customer finishes the payment of all the amounts we give him back the documents.<br />
<br />
The problem is that we need to find a way to assign these payments to these documents without decreasing the amount of it.<br />
<br />
The other problem some of our anticipated documents exists with some employees and we need to trace this documents on daily basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any idea is appreciated?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kikokiko</div><div class="date">1st November 2004, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sorry, may be I wasn't clear about the situation..<br />
We have a bad economy in our country, and people can't affored liqued money any time they want...<br />
To solve this problem they gave a cheq or bill of exchange ( both are the same in here ) this cheq is due in six monthes or a year.<br />
The client may pay a sum of the money each month, and when he pays the whole amount we give him back his cheq, so how can we assign this payment to this cheq.<br />
<br />
According to the second problem this cheq or bills is given to employees to be responsible for collecting this cheq, now we need to assign an employee to this document on the system.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
