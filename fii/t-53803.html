   From your attachment its clear that there are some settings missing from the session Maintain Inventory and WIP Transaction Accounts {tdinv8150m000}.<br />
To trouble shoot this further, you would need to go to Display Integration Transactions by Project/Order {tfgld4510m000} and then go to the specific combination (for instance Purchase-Receipt of 26092008) and then go to the particular order that shows erroneous in Form4. Check out the order and see whats missing in the session tdinv8150m000. Do the same for combination Purchase-Result dated 08092008, Production (Inv)-Receipt dated 12092008 and Production (Inv)-Issue dated 19092008.<br />
