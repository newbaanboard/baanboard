We do following<br />
1. Create a payment advice of type advance payment<br />
2. MAke the payment via check<br />
<br />
If we are doing wire transfers then<br />
1. Use a transaction type of Cash and link it to session tfcmg2100s000 and tfcmg2120s000<br />
2. Do the wire<br />
<br />
When the goods are actually received, create purchase invoice and link them.<br />
<br />
When we do advance payment we affect say Cash and Pre-paid inventory. When we link it with Advance payment we affect Pre-paid and AP.<br />

   How're you? Thank you very much for your help. In creating advance payments, and linking advance payments with open purchase invoice there's no problem.<br />
<br />
The problem where I'm having is, making check or wire payments. I'm not very clear about this part, since it's not payment against open invoice. Can you explain in detail how to make payments?<br />
<br />
Thanks agian for your help!<br />

I think I have explained it above with the assumption that you don;t have a Purchase Invoice. If you are making a check payment, you will need to maintain in Payment advice with the type- Advance payment. If you are doing a Wire transaction then you will need to use a transaction type called- Cash as explained. In my scneario, we always pay without creating Purchase invoice.<br />

as far as I understand you have no problem with advanced payments and to assign the payments to invoices afterwards, but you want to add electronic advance payments or cheques to a payment run?<br />
But for this you can simply use the &quot;Maintain Payment Advice&quot; tfcmg1120m000, either creating a new payment batch or adding some advance payments to a existing payment batch.<br />
Then choose in this program on the first form in field &quot;Type of advice&quot; = &quot;Advance Payment&quot;. On the second form enter the suitable payment method (e.g. cheques) and if necessary the bank relation of the supplier.<br />
Then run the normal payment procedure with this payment batch.<br />
Afterwards reconsiliation bank statement and assigning advance payment to invoice (follow your normal procedure).</div></div><hr />
