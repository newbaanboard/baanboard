     Now I have a question about  intergration of purchase and Finance:<br />
     There is a purchase order,and it is purchasing now,but the goods have not been received,perhaps it is on road,and the invoice have received from supplier.how to do this business in baan Ivc4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK this is fairly straight forward. You have two options depending on how you run the purchase accounting.<br />
<br />
Option 1:<br />
Book the invoice to the supplier account as normal (maintain transactions) However do not match (you have no goods) and do not approve (as you don't have the goods you don't know if they are acceptable).<br />
<br />
The invoice will show on the supplier account as registered also  any taxation if applicable, will be accounted for.<br />
<br />
When the goods arrive you can use the session match/approve purchase invoices (tfacp1130m000).<br />
<br />
Option 2:<br />
You can book the invoice as received through session tfacp1100m00. At a latter stage when the goods arrive you can use the copy option in maintain transactions. (This copies the information from the received tables into the transaction).<br />
<br />
The received tables are outside of the financial tables so this method does not have any effect on the finance tables until the invoice is copied in maintain transactions. This means that it will not show on the suppliers account, it will not be shown as a liability in the balance sheet and there will be no taxation postings until the received invoice has been copied into a purchase invoice transaction.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, Penfold.</div></div><hr />

But I think option II is better, since it's march GAAP! Usually we cant confirm the AP(liabilities) until the transfer of the ownership (the goods).<br />
But of course in this case AP cant be showed under the vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">22nd November 2002, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Anthony Wang make a good comment regarding option 2.<br />
<br />
Either option will resolve the problem of a purchase invoice without a delivery.<br />
<br />
However which one you use depends on your own companys procedures which in turn will be influenced by local laws and rules. There may be some requirement that tends towards one option or the other.<br />
<br />
In the UK, liability for VAT (a tax on goods bought and sold) usually occurs on receipt/issue of an invoice therfore option 1 is more appropriate. However if liabilty occurs only on receipt then maybe option 2 is more applicable.<br />
<br />
I think the most important aspect of this is to decide which is the most appropraite option for your circumstances and then to be consistent with that method.</div></div><hr />
