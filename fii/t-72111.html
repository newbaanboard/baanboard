<br />
I have query regarding a GTM correction.<br />
<br />
From invoicing module an invoice is posted. integration transactions were posted fine and I can see the invoice in tfacr200 as well,however the credit line is missing in the invoice document. <br />
<br />
Which is interim revenue 5.<br />
<br />
If it is a normal entry I would have updated credit line in tfgld102 and tax line in tfgld107.<br />
<br />
Here the problem is, there is a field called reconciliation identification number which is similar to GUID. I have tried to find it in tfgld495 tables but I can only see the reference link for reconciliation. There's no identification number.<br />
<br />
How does this identification number generates in LN? Is there any specific session to refer?<br />
<br />
If I update the record without identification number In tfgld102 does it become a problem in year end procedure? <br />
<br />
If this identifier is not there interim revenue 5 shoes any difference in integration reconciliation?<br />
<br />
Kindly advise.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Raghava.</div></div><hr />

Solution description:<br />
<br />
* credit line was missing in two tables tfgld495- reconciliation data and tfgld102.<br />
* Generally when we post an invoice from invoicing module it generates revenue analysis entry in integration transactions(tfgld482), at the same time it generate a reconciliation reference line in tfgld495 which was not generated.<br />
<br />
* To insert the reconciliation unique identifier, I have done a simulation in test system it's generated a unique identifier.<br />
With the same unique identifier I have inserted a line in tfgld495 tables in production for which the invoice reference also linked manually.<br />
<br />
* in tfgld102 also I have inserted one credit line and for which unique identifier link entered manually(the same unique identifier which is mentioned in tfgld495)<br />
<br />
* the bath was able to finalize<br />
<br />
* after batch is finalized the reconciliation performed for interim revenue 5 there was no difference found.<br />
<br />
It's happened for only one record therefore the correction done manually. If there is bulk transactions it's always advisable to approach infor for correction program.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
