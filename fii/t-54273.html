<br />
You need to go to the session tfgld4510m000 and find out the same order which is in error, it would show you the erroroneous transaction.<br />
<br />
Then you need to go to integration mapping scheme, here you need to find out the same transaction origin and fincnce trans. then you need to check the all mapping scheme available and compare it with the order in error.<br />
<br />
After comparing you will come to know what is missing which is not defined in maping scheme.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this would help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ks_ks_</div><div class="date">16th November 2008, 07:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay.. Now check what did you define in mapping scheme details and check the order in error, and see if the creteria you gave in mapping scheme details matches with order. Like if you have defined w/h then the order has the same w/h. if you defined the item or item group, then the order has the same item/item group. And finally make sure that you defined the ledger account on the second form(which is mandatory actually).<br />
<br />
Check that everything is there in place and post the transaction, it should work.</div></div><hr />
