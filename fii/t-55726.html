<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">golitsyn</div><div class="date">25th April 2009, 22:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all:<br />
<br />
I´ve chose  to use market prices to valuate stocks of manufactured items. We don´t have any BOM or routings at our older systems, so the manufactured costs were inputed manually. To start the stocks valuation in LN we decided to use market prices, that went well.<br />
I chose to use &quot;mauc&quot; as valuation method because was the only one that allowed me to use market prices for manufactured items. <br />
<br />
But when we started to create and post some production orders to warehouse the system began to assume :<br />
- or the real cost of the production order <br />
-. or the FTP cost of the item<br />
(sfc parameters)<br />
<br />
There´s any way to keep the market price as cost price for manufacturing items?<br />
<br />
I am running &quot;correct real prices&quot; (whina1230m000) twice a day to avoid changing the inventory prices, but there´s another way?<br />
<br />
I tested only one way that worked: changed the item for purchase type. FTP method and running the cost prices update with market price.<br />
After that I have to changed it back to  manufactured type but I have to avoid any other cost price calculation...<br />
If I keep  the item as purchased, I can´t use MRP planning correctly.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Thanks.<br />
<br />
There's a fairly decent explanation of 'market price' in the Help session for ... Calculate Cost and Valuation Prices (ticpr2210m000).</div></div><hr />
