Then we found it out there is worng entry due Baan problem. We applied patch and its working now.<br />
But how to delete all the non-finalized Write Off transactions.<br />
We are using Baan IVb4.<br />
I think we need to GTM deletion in tfgld100, 101, 102, 018 and also in tfacr200.<br />
<br />
Could somebody help.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot...<br />

<br />
You may need to do following additional things.<br />
1. run tfacr2245m000 after GTM is over . In the absence of tfacr2245m000 u may run tfcor0260/1m000 whichever is applicable for customers.<br />
2. If the update mode is realtime/end of session for payment difference trx type , then rebuild ledger history(tfgld3202m000) is necessary.<br />
3. In gld018 make the document deleted instead of actually deleting the record .  In this case also keep the tfgld100 &amp; tfgld101 data as it is . It's acceptable to auditors . If u choose to delete everything u may need tfgld017 also.</div></div><hr />
