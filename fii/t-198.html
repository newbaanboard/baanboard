<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Woeste</div><div class="date">21st September 2001, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We are a multi-multi site running 4C4. At the moment we have a single finance company. I'd like to find some resources to research what is involved in setting up a second finance only company. The company would be used to import information from a subsidiary operation. There will be no logistic activity. <br />
<br />
My concerns are:<br />
<br />
Can we have a separate chart of accounts (same accounts but different dimension requirements)?<br />
<br />
What do I need to do to set up a group company and perhaps intergroup transactions?<br />
<br />
Can Baan create TB, Financial Statements across the 2 finance companies?  Do I need a group company to do this?<br />
<br />
What are some of the table considerations (what to share, what not to share, etc.)?<br />
<br />
Can I maintain a separate receivables activity and still have a consolidated collection efforts?<br />
<br />
I appreciate any sugestions and or resources to turn to in order to gain a basic understanding of what's involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">You can have a seperate chart of accounts (created within company).<br />
If you share the table, you share the area which says whether dimensions are mandatary/optional/not used. An option is to have the same chart of accounts - just create it twice.<br />
If you are going to do intercompany/group transactions you probably need to share the chart of accounts. This is probably a good idea in principle anyway.<br />
You can report for a range of companies in standard Baan reports.<br />
You do need a group company.<br />
The sharing is horrendously complicated (depends on very detailed requirements) - start with the Baan recommendations - if you have any multisite training material this should be included.<br />
You can keep receivables seperate and consolidate collection activity - but you need to share the group company.<br />
<br />
Good luck. I hope this has helped, multisite expertise seems a bit hard to find. If you want some references within the Baan company, I can give you contacts (They come at a price of course)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can share what static data you deem fit. ie chart of accounts, dimensions etc. I would share chart of accounts and transaction types if you intend to carry out inter-co transactions and obviously the inter-co tables.<br />
<br />
Point this new company to the group company of your current financial company and ensure both company details appear in table tccom000 as to ensure consolidated is possible. As long as a record appears in this table, they in fact do not have to be in the same group for reporting, but obviously do for inter-co journals. <br />
<br />
The only problem I forsee is the accounts receivable function which you want to do centrally.<br />
<br />
Before you go down the seperate company route, cannot it not be done in a single company environment with the use of dimensions.</div></div><hr />
