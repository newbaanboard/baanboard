Different departments get these items from the stores and consume them. They are not used for production of any item. What are the various ways the consumption of these items can be handled?

These maybe not be used in the production of an item but they sure plays a role in production and a percentage of it could be added to the cost of production of an item as an indirect rawmaterial surcharge.<br />
