Scenario 1. We have a customer invoice for 100. Discounted amount for early payment is 95. Amount tolerance for discount 0.05 So expected paid amount is 95. If we receive a payment for 95.01 and check Payment Difference Tolerance in tfcmg5212m000 Match EBS, this line will get matched successfully and 95.01 payment will be applied against the invoice changing its balance to (0.01)<br />
Scenario 2. The payment received after due date so the discount is no longer applicable. The payment is for 100.01. In this case EBS can't match it and this line needs to be handled manually in EBS session. <br />
Are you aware of any workaround/parameter that will allow us to auto match those invoices overpaid by 0.01?</div></div><hr />
