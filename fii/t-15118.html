<br />
I am trying to reconcile the GRNI account.  What I am seeing in the &quot;Accept Value of GRNI Reconciliation&quot; session (tfacpfor1535m000) is only half of the reconciliation data.<br />
<br />
We are using transaction type Z04 for purchase receipts, PO2 for Invoices matched to Purchase Orders and AP1 for the matching.<br />
<br />
The result that I am getting is for the Z04 and one side of the AP1 are debited and credited to the &quot;Invoice Receipts&quot; account.  The PO2 and the approval, AP1 are going into the &quot;Non-order&quot; related report for this account as manual postings.<br />
<br />
Integrations are mapped correctly and the Invoice Receipts account is matched in the ACP Parameters.<br />
<br />
Has anyone run into this situation?  <br />
<br />
Does anyone have a resolution?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

the GRINYA-functionality.<br />
The latest known version is documentation-nr. U7517D US at Solution 119228, but the sessions had a lot of updates last year (Baan IVc4), e.g. sol. 135051 for &quot;acp1235&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onnoboer</div><div class="date">14th May 2004, 09:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Take a look in tfacp135 for the AP1 document and check the order and orderposition. I think it's on 0/20. That means that the system could not retrieve the right purchase order, maybe because of the fact that there is corruption in the integrationtable or in tdpur046/tfacp200.</div></div><hr />
