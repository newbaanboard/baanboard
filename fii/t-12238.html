<br />
We have a number of queries of our system relating to historical problems on the tfacp200 table.<br />
<br />
Is there any defined procedure for removing these ?<br />
<br />
For example we have two CBR's against one supplier. The two CBR's one negative and one positive have the same value and as a result cancel each other out but they both have balance figures. <br />
<br />
                           Amount                                  Balance<br />
CBR 20                719.11-                                  719.11-<br />
CBR 117              719.11                                    719.11<br />
<br />
Is there any way of removing the balances ?<br />
<br />

<br />
Please check, if correction program &quot;Recalculate Supplier Balances&quot; (tfacp2245m000/tfcor0260) can solve your problem.<br />
Make sure that you get the latest solution of this program from your local Baan Support.<br />
First run this session in your test system and then only decide whether to run it on your Production system.<br />
Please take backup of table tfacp200, before running this session.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">18th July 2003, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello and thanks for the input.<br />
<br />
tfacp2245m000 does throw up a problem with the balance on the first record but I'm still stuck with the two CBR records with balances.<br />
<br />
As these records crop up various reports Finance seem to be more worried about getting the balances on the tfacp200 records to zero for the sake of tidying up each suppliers accounts. In this example is there any way this can be done legitimately through the system.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
Is it happening specifically for the supplier in concern ?<br />
I am sure, you must have specified Supplier - From and To as the supplier of the two CBR records only. Still, ...<br />
<br />
Just let us know, what error does tfacp2245 throw ?<br />
<br />
Otherwise, there is a session &quot;Write off Payment Differences&quot; (tfacp2230m000). Not really sure whether it will solve the problem.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, tfacp2245 would be the correct session.<br />
<br />
Let's wait, for what the other people say ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">18th July 2003, 12:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Amount Balance<br />
CBR 20 719.11- 719.11-<br />
CBR 117 719.11 719.11<br />
<br />
tfacp2245 throws up an error on the first record saying that the balance on CBR 20 is zero but should be -719.11.<br />
<br />
The overall supplier balance on the report before and after is zero though.<br />
<br />
There is obviously an inconsistency somewhere but even by correcting it I will still have the two records with balance amounts present on the account.<br />
<br />

<br />
Can you not match the two entries when allocating a payment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">21st July 2003, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jayant,<br />
<br />
I'm afraid I'm not a Finance person.<br />
<br />
Which sessions would you use to do this ?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Neal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayant Keskar</div><div class="date">21st July 2003, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Neal<br />
<br />
When entering a payment to a supplier, you can either allocate it to one or more specific invoices or leave it as an on account payment. Any on account payment can subsequently be allocated to specific invoices. This is done by creating a 'Transaction Type' in BaaN Finance.  Such a transaction type must have following sessions tfcmg2131s000 and tfcmg2106s000. The seeions are to be defined on the second form of the session Maintain Transaction Types<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
