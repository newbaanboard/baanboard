 ITBR a/cs are showing Credit balance,now we want the break up of these ITBR a/c's for reconciliation of it.,<br />
can we do the same thru Reconciliation module-GL a/c matching manually(tfgil1516m000) in GL.<br />
or some other functionality is there for it.<br />

<br />
To see the breakdown of the ITBR account you have to use the session Print Reconciliation Data (tfgld4495m000) with Reconciliation Area = Invoice Accrual, Reconciliation Sub Area = 3, print for full specification and suppress zero balance.<br />
<br />
The report will show you a breakdown of the Purchase Order.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
