<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">almira</div><div class="date">7th January 2013, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, is there anyone from the group who knows how to use budget system but instead of a per ledger account (expense) what we need is per BP.. we have a budget expense per BP (customer) and we want to see the budger vs actual.. thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">7th January 2013, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">What you could do - and that is the only Option that I can think of - use one Dimension for the BP and do the budgeting like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">almira</div><div class="date">8th January 2013, 08:12</div></div><div class="posttext">that's what i also thinkin of but that would be tedious in our part since we have to maintain thousands of customers in dimension and for every AP transaction we have to choose 2 BP (customer) - 1 in a purchase invoice header and next in detail per expense.. wheew.. <br />
<br />
anyway, thanks for your time. atleast i know there is no other work around..thank you.</div></div><hr />
