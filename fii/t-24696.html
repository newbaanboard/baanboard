<br />
Is it possible to setup a purchase order line entry, receipt the item into stock but prevent any subsequent matching and approval of an invoice with Accounts payable.<br />
<br />
We have a situation where we want to receive items but not make payment to the Supplier. The Supplier is not supposed to send an invoice but if they do we do not want it processed.<br />
<br />
I am aware that you can block invoices for payment once the invoice has been registered but this requires someone in Finance doing this and we do not want to rely on this.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of another solution?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

But hey, if you really need to rip off your supplier, probably you can set up a PO with zero price. Beside, you guys did get that thing for &quot;free&quot;, although some legal action from the supplier may ensue later on.<br />
<br />
How's Melbourne, by the way? I miss that city. Spent my uni time there few years back, and still want to go back there for holiday in autumn preferably some time in the future<br />

Thanks for your reply I suppose I had better provide an explanation as to why we need to do this.<br />
<br />
A Supplier provides us with spare parts that need to be reflected in the logistical system with a value because the parts are issued to Production orders.<br />
<br />
The complication is that no normal financial transactions are required. For example normal postings would be Debit Inventory Credit GRNI. In integration we process both Debit and Credit transactions against the same ledger account.<br />
<br />
The Supplier will not be paid imediately for the items received but will be paid a sum determined by contract on a monthly basis.<br />
<br />
This is similar to the processing of Consignment stock only the trigger for payment is not the usage but is based on a formula. This formulae is quite complicated and depends on a Trains kilometres travelled.<br />
<br />
The problem we are trying to resolve is that because we have legitimate receipts recorded in the system it is possible that the Supplier can send an invoice in error, it could be matched and approved and subsequently paid.<br />
<br />
To complicate matters further the Supplier provides normal parts that are not subject to this Contract process and therefore requires normal payment.<br />
<br />
I hope this explains the situation.<br />
<br />
As for Melbourne we are in the middle of Winter at present but you wouldnÂ’t know it as it is 18 degrees today and the snow is melting in the hills.<br />
<br />
By the way what UNI did you attend?<br />

From your previous posts, I think your requirements are as below:<br />
1. You get some parts from some suppliers for which invoicing and payments are made according to a Contract on monthly basis. And there is some formula involved in calculating invoice amount.<br />
2. There are other parts supplied by the same suppliers which should have invoice as normal.<br />
<br />
I think for the first type of items you can use Self Billed Invoice feature. You need to select the check-box 'self-billed' in Item Supplier Information session. <br />
<br />
With this, Baan will not allow entering invoice for first type of items using tfgld1101m000. You will need to generate invoices using session 'Generate Invoices by self billing tfacp2290m000'<br />
<br />
I assume you are on release 5 onwards,<br />
<br />
Though this not a perfect match solution, it will meet your requirements. Do explore it further<br />
<br />

Thankyou for your information. I am of the opinion that this will provide us with a solution to our problem.<br />
After performing some test scenarios I will post my findings.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Norman</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 07:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Uday<br />
<br />
To perform this test I setup the Item Supplier Information and Purchase Order header to use self billed invoice.<br />
<br />
Findings<br />
<br />
I have tested the process and found that the system does not prevent the normal matching and approval of invoices and after the financial batch had been processed and finalised the system allowed the payment of the invoice to be processed without generating any warnings.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this solution does not resolve my problem.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
have you allready try to use the transaction type &quot;stock correction &quot; to received your goods. In thoses condition no invoice, no matching needed and a correct transaction in finance for the stock valuation.<br />
<br />
Best regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Norman</div><div class="date">4th August 2005, 02:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Tiber01<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response I had thought of using the Inventory Correction process but the Supplier requires a purchase order in order to provide the necessary quantities.<br />
<br />
The quantitities are not a standard figure they change depending on usage.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<br />
How your accounting dept would like these transactions booked may affect in a big way on how they are recorded into BaanERP. Do they want to see the inventory value of those nuts &amp; bolts as assets in their balance sheet? If yes, at what value? How would they like to calculate the cost contribution of nuts &amp; bolts to the production order? Would they be fine to simply consider the monthly amount you pay to the supplier as factory overhead?<br />
<br />
I attended Monash Uni, part of class of 99. I still get the alumni mag every quarter and seems like many things are going on there. Heard that Chaddy got bigger and the dome in Melb Central's gone. Man, driving in Melbourne would be nice. Driving here in Jakarta is the worst experience of my everyday work<br />

<br />
I will summarise what Finance, Logistics and the Supplier requires.<br />
<br />
Finance<br />
<br />
On receipt of the parts the integration transaction Purchase Receipt directs both the debit and credit postings to the same account. (No financial affect)<br />
After the issue of the part to a Production order the same debit and credit transactions are generated.<br />
<br />
The driver being a special Warehouse.<br />
<br />
Logistics<br />
<br />
The parts are ordered based on replenishment and the cost used is the item master purchase price. On receipt of the goods the Supply Manager they requires visibility of the parts and to a value must be included in their inventory reports.<br />
<br />
Supplier<br />
<br />
The Supplier is not paid for each delivery but is paid on a Contract basis which is calculated by using a formulae.<br />
In addition the Supplier provides other parts that are processed in the normal way and they require payments under the terms agreed.<br />
<br />
I hope this clarifies the situation and any assistance you can give is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
By the way<br />
<br />
I also attended Monash Uni and graduated in 1993. Yes lots of building going on here and the roads are getting busy. From the sounds of things not as busy as Jakarta so we should'nt complain to much.<br />
<br />

<br />
The way I see it, the fact that your supply manager wants an unnecessary value assigned to the nuts/bolts is the one causing all the headache. He/she can still track part visibility without any value assigned to the nuts/bolts. <br />
<br />
Effectively, by creating journals with same dr &amp; cr accounts upon purchase receipt and production issue, your accounting department is trying to say that they'll just treat the nuts/bolts costs as factory overhead. In my opinion, in such case, setting the unit price of these nuts/bolts to zero would be harmless to accounting. In fact, doing otherwise might result in inconsistent entries in accouting, except you do the same accounting trick (same dr &amp; cr account) with all other possible transactions involving these nuts/bolts; including e.g. inventory adjustments<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm attaching picture of Jakarta peak time traffic. Be glad you're in Melbourne :)<br />

<br />
I haven't worked in Baan V but in Baan IV we have a session for integration in Financial for Purchase to Results where we can integrate wrt Financial Supplier Group / Warehouse / Itemgroup / Item and post to finance. <br />
Now with what so ever relation we want to post we post the transactions based on that to finance.<br />
If we remove here the linkage the same wouldn't be posted / reflected in Finance Module.<br />
<br />
So you can try that out for same sessions in Baan V.<br />
<br />
We haven't worked on such a problem but i believe it shud resolve urs.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
I understand what you are trying to tell me but the problem gets more confusing because the parts are not nuts and bolts. They are major components that make up a significant liability.<br />
<br />
Presently Finance has not raised this liability in the books but eventually will need to do this in order to track the schedule of monthly payments.<br />
<br />
The problem is we are trying to find a solution to how can we prevent a payment of an Accounts Payable invoice without the Accounts Payable staff being physically involved. We do not want to rely on staff but would prefer the system to highlight the event. <br />
<br />
I hope this clarifies the situation.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">9th August 2005, 06:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, Norman,<br />
<br />
Sorry I mixed up your parts with nuts &amp; bolts discussion on another discussion thread. Hmm, so it is a major part, huh? Then I see the need to actually put price on the inventory and even allocate certain value when it is issued to production. I might sound too much like a consultant, but if you're currently in the middle of implementation (again, this is my assumption, and it can be totally wrong), would you think it'd possible for you guys to have management meeting and perform some BPR (Business Process Re-engineering, a fancy term for changing the way people work) in this matter? Again, as I said, this is a very consultant-ish idea. I don't know your exact manufacturing environment, and what actual part you're talking about, so my suggestion may be way off<br />
<br />
Have a great winter day there! I know it gets wet and really cold when it rains during winter there, but in Jakarta, when it rains, the whole city get flooded and you can't go home :)<br />

Thanks for the photo we certainly have nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
I have had many meetings on this subject with the respective department managers and there is no way they will change how they want to proceed because of contract requirements.<br />
<br />
Local Management where not involved in the contract discussions it was merely presented to them with the expectation that they can handle it.<br />
<br />
It is looking like we may need to develop a Seagate report to highlight instances of processing invoices against this type of purchase order. We could probably use the self billed invoice and warehouse field as a trigger.<br />
It could be treated as an exception report and e-mailed directly to Finance to provide them with the details they will need to recover any overpayment or adjust a current payment.<br />
<br />
Unless there is another solution we may need to go with this.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
