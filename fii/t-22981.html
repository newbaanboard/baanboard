<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">26th January 2005, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you first run Rebuild Opening Balance/History from Transactions?  If not try this and see if you balance.  You might look at solutions 1893 and 2225 on the Baan Support Site.  I believe that Baan support has a way of doing a onesided journal entry.  I am not to keen on table maintenance but if that is the only way out then the following tables must be updated for the penny.<br />
<br />
tfgld106 - finalized transactions<br />
tfgld201 - GL history</div></div><hr />

Can you give me solution 1893 and 2225 for me ? I tried rebuild opening balance/history from transaction but the result is same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have to run the year end procedure with the latest objects.<br />
<br />
Did you run the session tfgld3410m000? In most situations you can identify the document and handle it via ttaad, if you have no connect to the support. Support is having a correction program to handle the difference automatically. I believe there is a problem on a 3/4 decimal position after the &quot;,&quot;. 0,001 or so. You can find this positions within the database.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">27th January 2005, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, dont assume anything is wrong for the minute. <br />
Just double check that everything is as it should be e.g no open periods all transactions are finalised etc.<br />
rebuild the ledger balances.<br />
Run the provisional close year - tfgld6201m000<br />
Run Automatic balancing of profit and loss account - tfgld6202m000<br />
Run actual close year - tfgld6203m000<br />
<br />
Still not closing?<br />
I'm not sure if this exists on b2 as it is some time since I moved on to c4 but session tfgld6403m000 prints unbalanced ledger accounts at year end. This may help you track down your problem, even if you have to access the tables at the end of the day. <br />
<br />
However what ever the solution, once you have found the problem try to work out why it happened. It could be a changed/wrong parameter setting causing the problem which, if not corrected will give you this problem every year end.<br />
<br />

<br />
thanks for all which have assisted to give me suggestion<br />
In fact the problem is diference of currency between Europe and rupiah (0.01). I changed table direct through GTM for tfacr200 and tfgld106 and then I did / run session tfgld3203m000, tfgld6201m000, tfgld6202 and tfgld6203. The result is year 2004 could be closed</div></div><hr />
