<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khalleck</div><div class="date">23rd February 2008, 00:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone please explain the relationship between the SALES LEDGER account from tdsls6103m000 MAINTAIN INVOICE ANALYSIS ACCOUNTS BY TAX CODE and the TURNOVER debit &amp; credit accounts from tdsls6102m000 MAINTAIN INVOICE DETAILS ACCOUNTS?<br />
<br />
We have always used tdsls6103m000 to map our sales account credit, but now we need to record sales to multiple sales general ledger accounts for the same country.  We could do this by creating additional tax codes for each country with different SALE LEDGER accounts, but this seems clumsy.<br />
<br />
I have some thoughts for alternative methods, but I would appreciate anyone else's thoughts as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help!</div></div><hr />
