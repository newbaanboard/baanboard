<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">staugner</div><div class="date">4th October 2006, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Our Mexican location has a couple customers which have a special dispensation from the IVA tax.  The invoice must show the tax, but then deduct the tax from the final amount due.  Presently, they are manually typing in the plus and minus lines for these customers after printing the invoices.  <br />
<br />
How should this be handled?  What kind of changes need I make to have this be an automatic adjustment?  Any help would be appreciated.:confused:</div></div><hr />

Maybe you are talking about the PITEX program that in the Mexican law, the customers or suppliers that achieved some requirements, can deduct the tax form their invoices.<br />
<br />
We have a customization that do that. Unfortunatelly, Baan can be configured to do it by standard.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was the customization done for you by Baan or another source?  We really need to investigate this.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
