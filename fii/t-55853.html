An 'Unallocated Receipt' was registered and it was assigned against multiple invoices. Assignment document and the Unallocated Receipt both has been Finalized. Now it was found that the unallocated receipt was assigned to wrong invoices; Is there a way to reverse the assignment and also have the balance back in unallocated receipt. This is in Baan 5c <br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
