<br />
We have finally upgraded our Baan 5B system from SP12 to SP19.<br />
One of the many changes concerns the way the GRNI Reconciliation is processed.<br />
<br />
I have checked the INFOR site and cannot find documentation relating to this.<br />
<br />
I am looking for the latest documentation with regards to the GRNI processing. In particular I need information on the following sessions.<br />
tfacp1240m000 Create GRNI Ciorrection Batch, tfacp1239m000 Finalise Accepted GRNI Entries and tfacp1238m000 Archive and/or delete GRNI.<br />
<br />
I am aware of how the GRNI Reconcilation works to the point of accepting each of the transactions but these 3 sessions are not clear to me.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any assistance you can give.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Norman<br />

<br />
Hope the following information helps:<br />
<br />
tfacp1240m000 - Create GRNI correction batch --&gt; <br />
This session is used to create the batch in financials when corrections are inserted with the insert correction option from the Special menu in the Accept Values for GRNI Reconciliation (tfacp1535m000) session. If a range of orders is selected, only the orders are picked up for the specified fiscal year and period.<br />
<br />
Contra Account -- In this field, the user can choose the account to which the correction transactions must be posted. For all purchase orders selected at the same time that have corrections, the contra account specified in this field will be used.<br />
Transaction Type -- The transactiontype specified in this field must preferably be specificly created for posting the GRNI corrections. This transaction type can only be of the category Journal Voucher.<br />
Series<br />
Fiscal Period<br />
Reporting Period<br />
Tax Period<br />
<br />
tfacp1239m000 - Finalize Accepted GRNI Entries --&gt;<br />
To make the acceptance of entries in the interim (tfacp135) table final and<br />
irreversible, the Finalize Accepted GRNI Entries (tfacp1239m000) session<br />
enables the user to finalize entries from the interim (tfacp135) table. After this step, entries are ready to be archived and/or deleted.<br />
The finalization process is irreversible.<br />
<br />
tfacp1238m000 - Archive/Delete GRNI reconciliation --&gt;<br />
Use the Archive and/or Delete GRNI Reconciliation (tfacp1238m000) session to<br />
archive and/or delete all entries from the interim (tfacp135) table up to the fiscal year/period specified on the form. This process does not archive or clear the data from any other tables.<br />
The archive company is taken from the company parameters as defined in the<br />
Company Parameters (tfgld0103m000) session. If no archive company is filled in the company parameters, for example, when the archive company is 000, this session will only delete. For more information on how to set up an archive<br />
company, refer to the applicable user documentation.<br />
After the user runs the Archive and/or Delete GRNI Reconciliaton<br />
(tfacp1238m000) session, the purchase orders that were fully accepted and<br />
finalized in the Finalize Accepted GRNI Entries (tfacp1239m000) session, will<br />
no longer appear on the Print Receivable Invoice Specifications - Financial<br />
(tfacp1435m000) session reports. The other reports will not show the financial<br />
information for the purchase orders anymore, but will continue to show the<br />
logistic information.<br />
This archive session can be used like any other Baan archive session. This should be the last part of the GRNI reconciliation. For best results, the user must only archive after users have fully reconciled and closed their periods.<br />
This session will only archive transactions that have been accepted and finalized.<br />
Entries that are being picked up for archiving which have not yet been accepted and finalized will not be cleared from the (tfacp135) table. Because all transactions are picked up from the interim (tfacp135) table up to the specified period on the form every time the session is run, these entries will be archived the next time the session is run.<br />
The archiving and delete process is irreversible.<br />
<br />
In the last step of the archiving process, a time stamp is set in the common<br />
parameters to indicate that archiving took place up to a certain period/year for a financial company. When the Select Values for GRNI Reconciliation<br />
(tfacp1235m000) session is run again for a period that lies before the one up to where archiving took place, an error message will be sent to the error report and records from before the archiving period will not be selected.<br />
Because the selection process cannot be executed anymore after archiving, you must make sure that all ledger accounts that are used or have been used in the past as a GRNI account have been selected with the Select Values for GRNI Reconciliation (tfacp1235m000) session prior to archiving.<br />
<br />
In case you need any more information, please feel free to contact me.<br />

It is very much appreciated.<br />
