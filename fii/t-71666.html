<br />
Accounting department finds some incorrect production order receipts and issues, sometimes they have wrong amounts, sometimes dates are wrong. So they don't want to see these transactions on integration transactions and finance.<br />
<br />
We closed production document types in the mapping scheme but we can not close inventory transaction document types for these production transactions. Because if we close them, other packages can not create these integration transactions.<br />
<br />
So they want to delete these integration transactions (inventory) which were created from production orders.<br />
<br />
Should we delete them before posting, after posting?</div></div><hr />
