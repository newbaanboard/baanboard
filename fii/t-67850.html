Since this week we have Flexible reporting, but Infor has no manual about this item.<br />
According to Infor we also need this flexible reporting to comply to the French regulations of &quot;electronic submission of the accounting entry journal&quot; which is now compulsory (starting 1-1-2014). Article L 47 A I of the French tax procedural code.<br />
<br />
Does anyone of you written a manual (even a very short one is welcome); the HELP in Infor is not that clear for me.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />
