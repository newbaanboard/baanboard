<br />
A control ledger account was wrongly updated during a BANK transaction for ANR reconciliation. We have booked a case with the INFOR team to find out why.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, can anyone suggest as to how we can correct the wrong booking on a control account. I believe a manual update is not possible for the same. Please let me know with your replies.<br />
This is a very urgent issue and I hope someone can provide a solution to this. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

This kind of error can be very tricky. First of all you must determine where is the root cause of the problem.<br />
By your summary, apparently you finalized a wrong transaction in a control account. If this is the case, maybe whith the help of Infor support you can correct it with a journal entry, but is not a common practice.<br />
The other approach to do this is to create a complementary account where you account staff can register the journal entry.<br />
<br />
By the other way, if you have a different balance on the control account versus the finalized transactions for that account, the first approach to solve this is to rebuild the account history. This is a standard process in Baan.<br />
<br />
If you provide more detail the other members of the board can help you more.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Hello , <br />
<br />
As per the Infor team rebuilding the history seemed to be the best option. As such we are proceeding to do the same. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />
