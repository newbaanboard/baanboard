 <br />
<br />
we are making LN implementation in one ofour German customers.<br />
<br />
I was told that when they make payments to USA through Cotel ( It's commerzbank software) instead of swift number they have to use routing number, example: //FW026009593.<br />
<br />
I have following quetsions: don't all US banks have SWIFT number?<br />
<br />
Second, where in LN can I save this routing number, that while creation of payment file, this information is automatically red by the Bank system.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for support,<br />

They are used as unique identifiers for the bank. Routing numbers are used for transactions within the US while the SWIFT numbers are used for international wire transfers.<br />
<br />
In LN, the session 'Bank Branches', allows you to maintain both International Bank ID (which can be used for SWIFT Code) and Domestic Bank ID (which can be used for Routing Number).<br />
<br />
You will need to check how Cotel software integrates with LN and if it uses the Domestic Bank ID field of Bank Branches to capture routing number.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for the prompt response.<br />
<br />
You wrote that SWIFT is necessary when we make an international payment, in this case when we pay from Germany to USA, swift should be ok, or?<br />
<br />
Second thig, I have checked and in domestic bank id I'm allowed to use only 12 characters, routing number which I got from my customers looks following: //FW026009593.. I'm not sure if // is necessary but with it it has 13 characters :(<br />
The last point, I will try to receive from Cotel-Commerzbank a file structure with all mandatory fields.<br />

<br />
If you want to transfer money to US bank then you need routing (or 'ABA') number If you want to transfer money to European bank then you need SWIFT number.<br />
