<br />
Could you please provide some additional information to clarify your problem?  <br />
<br />
Is the batch that you're having problems finalizing for the Sales integrations, or is it for cash that you have received?  I'm assuming that it is the integration batch since you reference that it is coming from the Logistic side, but I want to be sure.<br />
<br />
If it is the integration batch, I would question why you are using a Cash transaction type, and not a Sales Invoice transaction type.  They look to different sessions for their posting criteria in the Maintain Transaction Types session.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayoobi</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 04:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Please Check your CMG Parameter. Probably the Parameter , Adjust tax for deductions is on . In that case if u have any deductions like LPS , Discounts , Payment Difference then system will try to reduce the tax for that amount . And it Will try to post the deductions depending on another related CMG Parameter(Ledger Account for Tax Deductions ) . This Paramter has two values : Customer/Supplier Group or by Tax Code . In Case of Customer Group then check if u have maintain the account or else<br />
in Posting Data  by Tax Code . <br />

<br />
also please check the Sale Order Header for the Tax Field,it should be set to 'YES' and in the sale order line a dummy tax code.<br />
<br />
and in the Tax code by country session an interim sales ledger in the form 2 should also be specified. <br />
<br />
cheers<br />
