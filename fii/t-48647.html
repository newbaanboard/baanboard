<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindar</div><div class="date">25th February 2008, 23:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We have just started balancing the inventory on order account to a report that was created, and I am finding missing intergration transactions, seems to be last year purchase orders that we are still receiving goods on.<br />
<br />
When purchase orders are entered the intergration transactions are db to goods on order account and credit to purchase order expense, then when received the transactions is reversed. I am finding sometimes the system reverses the transaction and sometimes it does not. <br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
