<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsrini</div><div class="date">25th October 2007, 01:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using a 10% off 10 days, net 30 payment terms. When I invoice my sales orders, Baan calcualtes the Payment Discount based on the Payment Terms. However it uses the Invoice Net Amount to determine the discount. For example if the invoice is made up of $100 for Goods and $10 for Charges (Freight, Cancelation charges etc), Baan calcualtes the early pay discount for the net ie ($110) assuming TAX does not apply on the SO.<br />
Is there a way to set-up the Payment Terms to just look at Goods and not Cost on the invoice?<br />

<br />
If you dont want to calculate tax on certain transactions, change the level of tax calculation from Invoice header to Transaction line (either in ACP/ACR parameters or manually on each invoice).<br />
<br />
Then, choose the tax code you want to use for each transaction line.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

My question was more being able to calculate my early payment discount based on the Goods Amount rather than the Net Amount (Goods+Cost). <br />
Can you think of some way we can calculate the early payment discount considering just the Goods Amount?<br />

You are not alone in wanting that functionality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sk28756</div><div class="date">29th October 2007, 02:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you recording this amount separately in different ledger accs or in a single acc? If single, then your requirement is difficult to achieve. If different, then you may clear the tax code/amount for additional amount for which you dont want to calculate tax.<br />

Do you know if there is a place where we can record these 'wish lists'? Is there a forum that Baan monitors to see what the required functionalities are - for its future releases?</div></div><hr />

At the time of posting we can adjsut it correct it.<br />
