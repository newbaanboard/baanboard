I created a purchase invoice in tfacp1110s000 and then I matched the receipt with only 1 piece insteed of 10. But the whole amount was invoiced.<br />
So, now the invoice is paid, but I have only 1 piece recieved and 9 are still open. Is a good practice to create another invoice with amount = 0 and match it against the rest 9 pieces.<br />
Thank you for your replies.<br />

<br />
For the mistake you have made is correct what you asked  to do, you should match a new purchase invoice with amount = 0, because the first match has created a price variation in the order and with a second purchase invoice you can regulate that, please check  tfgld4510m000  variation transactions for that order.<br />
