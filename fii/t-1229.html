<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonian</div><div class="date">5th March 2002, 05:17</div></div><div class="posttext">We are planning to implement electronic bank statements but are not happy with the available matching rules which Baan uses during the Match Electronic Bank Statements process.  We feel that too many of the transactions require manual matching and would like to know if anyone has developed an external program that would for example select all invoices for a customer and apply the cash based on aging and then create a remittance advice for the incoming receipt.  This is only one example of the additional rules we would like to develop.  Has anyone developed a program to support this?</div></div><hr />

I have developed  a program that takes daily lock box from our Bank and imprt into Baan. We also get invoice number from our bank in some cases. I have some rules set up- matching based on invoice, customer name, amount and other checks. It is working well for us.<br />

Basically, you have to transform the EBS file by getting a program to cross-reference the Baan data base, and use any rules you like to allocate, then you use the EBS process as normal.<br />
I too would be interested if any users out there do the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeyaseelan</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I developed the samething by using Business Objects(BOI). U can build a BOI for getting all invoices for a customer, and another BOI for applying cash based on aging etc., On top of these BOI's u can write your own rules and also its very easy to integrate with any other heterogeneous systems . iBaan is totally moving to the concept of Business Objects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 13:50</div></div><div class="posttext">These BOI's presumably use the Open world product. Is your development commercially available?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeyaseelan</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hai Phil,<br />
Yes its commercially available. There are two approaches in the case of building BOI's. First approach is using Open World adapter. Its quite simple and easy to use. But if u still use BaaN IV u need to buy OW from BaaN. <br />
<br />
The second approach is using BaaN Connect Kit(BCK1.3). Its freely available from BaaN but requires lots of programming. I have used both of these approaches.If u need any help suit me a mail.<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen two external packages in the past. One of them uses an export from BaanIV and reads that into it's own tables. The match is done in that (MS-DOS) package and the result is sent to Baan on a daily batch.<br />
<br />
The other one is a Windows package that uses an ODBC link to the (Oracle) database. The database is updated instantly, including GL postings.<br />
<br />
Both packages don't use the Baan functionality to get things done in Baan. That should be done by using BOI's as described earlier in this threat.<br />
<br />
Be aware that also these external packages do not always work properly for your business situation; creating your own program for it should be considered!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">BCK1.3 (BAAN Connector Kit) was BAAN's first attempt to integrate external applications with BAAN. The programming involved is terrible and it basically only works with b50_b. At Dictaphone we tried to use it but decided not to. Too time consuming.<br />
Now with b50_c and Open World things have improved dramatically so programming time and costs are much less. Also the performance of BCK is very bad and in Open World this has been improved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">20th March 2002, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">One of them is called &quot;EB-Plus&quot;, a Windows based package. But not really one I would recommend. <br />
It hardly cooperates with the Telebanking packages (in the Netherlands) in an automated way.<br />
The link with baan is done through a Baan Development. That part works fine, also automatically started from EB-Plus.<br />
The results so far: between 50% and 60% is linked automatically; something that could also be realized through BaanIV EBS ...</div></div><hr />
