<br />
There are actually two integration transactions that occur simultaneously, utilizing an interim project delivery account:<br />
<br />
PRP Warehouse/Inventory Transfer is set up in the tdinv8150m000 session.  The suggested ledger accounts for this are to Debit the project interim account, and Credit your goods account(s).  PLEASE NOTE:  if you are on BaaN version IVc2, this transaction may function backwards, and may need to be set up as such.  Therefore, you may need to Debit your goods account and Credit the Project interim account.  This was the situation when we went live in 1998. If there is a patch to correct this, I am not aware of it.<br />
<br />
PRP Warehouse/Material Costs is set up in the tipcs8150m000 session.  The suggested account for this are to Debit you Work in Process account, and Credit your Project interim account. This one functions correctly.<br />
<br />
What additional criteria you use will depend on how your inventories and warehouses function.  We have a separate warehouse for each type of material at each of our divisions; therefore, on the PRP Warehouse/Inventory Transfer side, I set up a separate integration for each warehouse/item group combination.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you have ILC turned on will determine the session that initiates the integration.<br />
<br />
Other factors may create addional related transactions, such as whether you are on an estimated or actual cost basis, and/or your method for valuation of inventory (Fixed Transfer Price or Lot Price).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps - let me know if I can provide you with any additional info.   <br />

I notice that there is no ledger account information for Inventory transfer/ transfer result, but it's ok in material costs . How is that ? The bug of version?<br />

<br />
If your parameters are set for Actual Costing, the transfer result integration will be of the &quot;Not for Finance&quot; nature, and will not link to any general ledger account numbers.  If you do not have access to the parameters in Manufacturing, you can see the transaction status in the tfgld4510m000 session (Display Integration Transactions by Project/Order).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
