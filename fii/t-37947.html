Thanks a lot.<br />

<br />
I read those documents but those doesn't tell clearly about the pros and cons of a Multi Company Structure. Actually we have a multisite structure and now one more company is migrating to Baan V c. In this case if I have to decide whether to add the new company in the existing structure or not, I need some kind of deciding factor. As for example, if I add the new company in the existing structure, it has to have the same reference currency, same currency system etc. and if I don't then I may not get few things. So, if I could get a document which lists out all such things, it would have been really helpful to me. Hope you understood what I am trying to say.<br />
