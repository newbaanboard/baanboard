if PCS is used, you may not delete the integration records that are project specific, unless the project is closed (They are needed for project cost calculation).<br />
<br />
I could imagine the same holds true for unclosed standard production orders - there are some postings (surcharge results) that probably are generated during closing of the order by looking into the integration table. But I'm not sure about this, you should test that out.<br />
Last point: I don't know how archiving reacts if there are no integration records, but I do not think there is a problem with it. Archiving should be able to handle eg. sales orders without integration records.<br />
<br />
Keeping these points in mind, deleting<br />
integration records is possible.</div></div><hr />
