I need to design a P&amp;L report and Balance Sheet Report.<br />
It is seems hard to design in LN.<br />
Therefore, there are few options came to my mind on the selection of reporting tool.<br />
They are Crystal Report (to be purchased), Excel and Access.<br />
<br />
So, if anybody has experienced, kindly share with me. Just would like to know your opinion.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance for the info.</div></div><hr />

If you have SQL server, I would recommend SSRS with LN. It comes free with SQL server and is easy to use.</div></div><hr />
