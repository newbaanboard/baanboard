<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RamSundar</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a &quot;Start Date&quot; defined in the Period Master for each Fiscal Period.   Are there any risks in changing this date for the current Fiscal Year?    Is it just an information field only?   What if we change the Start Date for a Fiscal Period with Closed status (with or without transactions in it)?<br />

Appreciate your feedback.<br />

The end date of a period is calculated by taking the start date of the next period minus 1.  If you change the start date, a number of the finalized transactions that were processed for the period before the change will be wrong.  As well as other transactions that rely on period.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing here since I've never tried it, but I don't think there is much of a problem in changing them. The date range for a period is used to calculate the default period whenever a date is entered, but once the finance transaction is created the period is stored as well as the transaction date, and there is no requirement in Baan that the two should be in sync. You can manually create a journal where the period and date do not match and this works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">That's true.  But, if you want your financial reports that are based on period to be accurate, you will want to consider changing the period on the transactions that are impacted.  Either that or you can always choose to run the reports based on 'due date', or transaction date, or 'other' choices within the reports.<br />
<br />
  Then, you may want to consider how Baan calculates closing balances for a peroid. Since the closing balances are calculated, not stored, this may not look so nice on your trial balance reports.  There's a lot to consider and none of it may be important enough to cause you to not change the start date.  Especially if it's a future peroid that has very little or no transactions entered.  These are just the things that would concern me if I were to do this.<br />
<br />
hope it works out well!<br />

Just to be on the safer side, I have changed the start date for the future periods only where there is no transaction exist.:)</div></div><hr />
