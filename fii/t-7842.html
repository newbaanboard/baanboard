trying to define a transaction to handle customer deposits<br />
the credit invoice may not be created for months<br />
it is possible that a customer aging or a statement would then not age the deposit, which contravenes GAAP<br />
<br />
is there a transaction type that I can use for deposits that standard Baan will not age ?<br />
<br />
if not, does anyone know if I can spool a Baan report to a device that allow me to create the final report using Oracle Reports<br />
<br />
this would allow me to change the appearance of the aging / statement without the original source, which I don't have</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible to customise a report in Baan which will not 'age' unallocated credits. If you create a separate transaction type for customer deposits, then it will be possible to ensure that only such unallocated credits will not be aged. This will be slightly more tricky report but if you have any report writing software this can be easily managed<br />

<br />
I think you are looking for a report where transactions of a particular transaction type are not aged.  <br />
<br />
You can create a aging analysis code with the first bucket being the maximum.  If it is enough you can set 999 days or even 999 months!<br />
<br />
Then you can print the standard report for only that transaction type and aging code and you will have a report that is not aged.<br />
