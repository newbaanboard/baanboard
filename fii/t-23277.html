<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
On Baan IV, has anyone removed the print purchase invoice from the AP processing. What effect does this have on the match process? How do you handle price and quantity discrepancy issues?<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Is it after matching or before that?<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
There  are a few steps.<br />
<br />
1.Maintain Payment Advice<br />
2.Print Payment Advice<br />
3.Process Payment<br />
4.Print Non-Finalized Transaction and so on...........<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
If you want to remove the purchase invoice from the AP in a payment batch before matching it is possible by deleting the document (purchase invoice) <br />
in table tfcmg001:Maintain Payment Advice.<br />
<br />
There in no effect to other document in the batch.<br />
If you can explain which step the process now , I'm sure there are many experts to help you.<br />
<br />
Good Luck. Have a nice day. :) <br />

<br />
This is because, it is not a document to be given to anyone. Hence no necessity to print. It is just an internal document for finance to create liability and to match with order/receipt and to make payment.<br />
<br />
Hope this answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">28th February 2005, 11:25</div></div><div class="posttext">oops. I forgot the rest of question. - Price and quantity discrepancy<br />
<br />
There is a price and quantity in Purchase Order issued to Supplier. While receipt, the quantity received against the order is recorded (even if packng slip shows more, the actual received can differ). Then there can be rejects after inspection, if inspection is a step. <br />
<br />
Supplier sends invoice to Finance. Also, the Finance can receive Goods received note from Warehouse. When Finance creates a Purchase invoice, they can match with Order (if they want to pay full), packing slip (if finance wants to match with packing slip) . They can also match to Receipt (actual quantity received). If any price discrepancy, it is at this stage that added price is included.<br />
<br />
Guess you got answers. Get back, should you need more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can anyone tell what is the significance of printing Purchase INvoice? Self-billing functionality?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">2nd March 2005, 12:09</div></div><div class="posttext">The session Print Purchase Invoice (tdpur4404m000) is not a mandatory step and so can be left out of the order steps for an order type.  As far I am aware it is an internal document which can be used as back-up documentation when processing transactions in finance.</div></div><hr />
