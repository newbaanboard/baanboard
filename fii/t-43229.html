<br />
currently one of our subsidaries is running on an other ERP system where we do have the MAUC applied. Now we would like to bring in the MAUC into LN but I wonder what would be the best approach to get the item data into the system - but divided into the different cost components. Of course we will create Adjustment orders to get the quantities into LN but which way should be chosen to get in the MAUC before running cost price calculation based on the MAUC.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on that would be much appreciated.<br />

If the item is purchase it is easy, just set the purchase price to the present MAUC value, move the inventory into the warehouse using f.e. adjustment orders and the MAUC value will be set correctly.</div></div><hr />
