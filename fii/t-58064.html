<br />
Actually the problem was with form display. I had released the outbound and it was showing in tdilc401. <br />
The display was not showing record more that 10, i.e. upto position 100.<br />
If give find option (Cntl -F) by sales order and line- 110, then it was seen. So the main problem is resolved, but the display problem still exists.<br />
