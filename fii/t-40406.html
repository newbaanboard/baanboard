It would be best if you could approach Infor on this...If not then you would have to go through the SP documentation on what are the changes that are brought forth. From the documentation you would be able to find out how much its going to affect your financial setup. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">13th August 2007, 05:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Each Service Pack has release notes that should be reviewed.  You can find the documents on the Infor Global Support site - Once logged in go to Tools then Support Guide &amp; Tools and look for 'Infor Software Updates for Baan Users' and you see a link for the service packs and the documentation.<br />
<br />
You'll want to have a test plan to make sure that everything is working as expected - so a list of scenarios to test and reports to run to compare SP3 and SP18<br />
<br />
Without knowing any specifics about your company setup I would suggest the following prior to loading any SP:  Invoice everything that is ready, post integrations, post any intercompany/intergroup entries, post fixed asset depreciation, etc.... just like wanting a good cutoff for a period close....   None of this may absolutely be necessary but it would not hurt to play it safe.   <br />
<br />
But you really need to read the release notes as there may be correction programs necessary for introduction of new functionality or changes from the service packs.<br />
<br />
As far as engaging Infor Professional Services as suggested in the prior post - not a bad idea.  SP3 to SP18 is pretty big jump (note: SP21 is current level)</div></div><hr />
