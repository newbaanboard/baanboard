<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">8th February 2002, 15:16</div></div><div class="posttext">When you manually enter budget information into a budget that is set to be 'bottom-up', the system calculates any 'parent' account values that get rolled-up from the sub-level accounts.  When you use Exchange to import budget details from Excel does the system still automatically calculate this roll-up?  Is there a session to generate it?  Or did you have to provide this in the Excel file to be imported?</div></div><hr />

That thread was already closed and since your question is really referring to a different matter, it can stay as a separate thread. I have changed the thread title to be a little more descriptive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">8th February 2002, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I have solved my problem and answered my question.  There is a session Rebuild Sub-levels (tffbs1204m000) that will rebuild the parent account balances.  The session does not show up on the Baan menu.  I was deleting a test budget I imported in Exchange and the Delete Budget session called the related Rebuild Sub-level sub-session.</div></div><hr />
