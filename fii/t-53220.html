This error is very frequent in our company and the solution suggested every time is to make a counter entry in table tfgld102 though GTM to match debit / Credit.<br />
<br />
I dont think this is the correct way. <br />
First of all i want to understand where to look if a debit/credit entry is comming &quot;0' for a line. Are the chart of acocunt set properly for sales invoice.<br />
<br />
Request to all Finance guru..to look in the matter and give me advice in detail. As i am not finance consultant , i make require the procedure in brief to understand. Please dont mind.. as we have no finance consultant in our company at the moment.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

   First thing is if its an integration transaction (as per your last post), how come you are finalizing it by session Select Batches for Finalization instead of Post Integration Transactions to Finance Transactions?<br />
<br />
Secondly, again since you said its an integration transaction, did you try looking into Display Integration Transactions Log {tfgld4532m000} and subsequently Display Integration Transactions by Project/Order {tfgld4510m000}?<br />
<br />

<br />
Sukesh &gt;&gt; i assume the finance parameters &quot;start of finalization process&quot; after posting must be &quot;NO&quot; .<br />
<br />
Manish &gt;&gt;  as said above by sukesh - kindly check the session logs -&gt; and post screen dump of tfgld4510m000 (all tabs) for the problem.<br />
<br />
and Is their any script updating sales orders directly (i.e sales made from any other anciliary apps).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpchheda</div><div class="date">26th August 2008, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sushil<br />
Checked the log. Also posted screen dump of tfgld4510m000 all 7 tabs. Info on one form is 2 big hence breaked up in 2.<br />
Dont get confused with old sales order. Look only for Year2008.<br />
<br />
Yes we are importing sales order from exchange scheme.<br />
<br />

<br />
1.I suppose their might be some issue with &quot;Exchange&quot; -&gt; may be some other members can throw some light on the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes we are importing sales order from exchange scheme.<br />
<br />
Else you could log a call with Infor for &quot;Exchange&quot; issues.<br />
<br />
2.Is the problem entry is for a specify Item / item group -&gt; please check with your previous counter entry.<br />
<br />

I dont think there should be any issue with Exchange scheme. Because this is a routine procedure and we are doing it quiet often. And sales ordere has gone through other steps like GEnerate OUtbound, Maintain Deliveries etc upto Deleting lines....<br />

<br />
Please Monitor weather the Problem you reported exists in<br />
<br />
1.Manually created SO ?<br />
Or<br />
2.Exchange Generated SO ?<br />
<br />
Note :<br />
Years ago i had similar issue due to SO created using AFS .i had debugged and resolved.<br />
hence i suggest you on similar lines.<br />
<br />
The AFS only used to create SO .<br />
steps like Generate , release outbound are done manually with out issues -&gt; then after posting i had problems .<br />
<br />

I noticed that your Sales Issue transaction on 26/07/2008 is unposted.  Why?  Does the integration log tell you what did not work (example-Could not create account...)?  Do the Inventory and WIP Transaction Accounts properly handle all the elements you are feeding it?  I noticed that the warehouse is different for those lines?  If the integration mapping was set-up very specifically and the process has changed it is possible that the transactions are not being handled correctly.</div></div><hr />
