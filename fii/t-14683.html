<br />
Just thinking about which documents can be E mailed directly out of Baan. We were planning to E mail Sales Invoices but we believe that as we are based in the UK this is not possible unless we  find a more secure method of E mailing the invoices as opposed to just firing them out through a SMTP server.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know if documents such as Remittance Advices would be OK to E mail directly from Baan from the UK or are there similar restrictions on all finance documents.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know of a decent web link that may explain all this.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
