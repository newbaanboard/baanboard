<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets say that you have a supplier that has an address of:<br />
<br />
123 Anywhere Street<br />
Anywhere, US 12345<br />
<br />
And you need to remit a check payment to a different address of:<br />
<br />
456 Somewhere Street<br />
Anywhere, US 12345<br />
<br />
The only work around that I know of are:<br />
1. Input a new supplier with the 456 Somewhere Street <br />
2. Modify the original suppliers address from 123 Anywhere to 456 Somewhere, make the payment, then switch the address back.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see where you can maintain Postal addresses and then utilize them when issuing a purchase order but I do not see where you can reference the postal address when registering the invoice or in maintain payment advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know of any way that you can do that through vanilla Baan, but maybe with some modifications you could do the following???<br />
<br />
<br />
Create a table that would house the supplier number and the proper fields for your 'check' address using similar formats as the supplier master does for addressing.<br />
<br />
Then you could create a print device that prints your Baan check run information to a file.  <br />
<br />
Re-read the file against your 'check address' table for alternate addresses replacing values as needed.  Then shoot those off to a second report that actually prints the checks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you've discovered, although the address in the supplier master is the default for purchase orders, postal addresses can be used in PUR to direct purchase orders to different supplier locations.<br />
<br />
Ideally, there should be a similar provision for a separate &quot;remit-to&quot; address. In CMG, however, the only supplier address used for payments is the one in the Supplier Master. Even if Finance has &quot;ownership&quot; of the supplier master address, payments may be made to a lock box address that has no logical relation to the suppliers location.<br />
<br />
To use standard Baan functionality instead of customizing, look at using Factoring Companies. If a Factoring Company is entered in Maintain Suppliers (Form 3?), payments via CMG are directed to the factor.<br />
<br />
Factoring Companies were intended for a different legal purpose (literally, a separate company to which payments are assigned), but there is no reason that your supplier (Great Supplier Inc., 123 Anywhere Street, Anywhere, US 12345) can't be linked to a factoring company whose name and address is Great Supplier Inc., 456 Somewhere Street, Anywhere, US 12345.<br />
<br />
Review the sessions Maintain Factoring Companies (tcmcs0125m000), Maintain Banks by Factoring Company (tcmcs0126m000) and Maintain Suppliers (tccom2102m000). <br />
<br />
(This answer pertains to Baan IV, which you're using. I think there are some other wrinkles that can be used with Baan V.)<br />

Neat idea.  I never knew.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
