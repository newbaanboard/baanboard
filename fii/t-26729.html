<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VilasoorRavi</div><div class="date">25th March 2006, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">When invoicing is done through Distribution module and Sales is posted to the General Ledger in January,2006, with invoice date January, 31st, through the step &quot;Process Delivered Sales Order&quot;, when will the related cost of sales entry posted in the General Ledger?  If I post the integration entries in, say, March, 2006, the Sales Invoices are getting posted in January, 2006, based on the invoice date of January, 31st but cost of sales entries are getting posted in March, 2006.  Is this correct (or) is there any way to post the Cost of Sales entry also in January, 2006, chosing the right date?<br />
<br />
Would be grateful for any inputs on this.<br />
