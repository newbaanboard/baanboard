<br />
I am a bit confused about the Inventory Valuation report by warehouse where we had 500 pieces on hand and 300 pieces in transit on the 27th of September. These 300 pieces where issued via a manual transfer order and the receipt on the target warehouse had not been made yet. On the 28th of September the remaining 500 pieces where issued to the same target warehouse - still the receipt was not done before 1st of October. When running the inventory valuation by warehouse report for the 29th or 30th of September for the source warehouse we get the message &quot;nothing within selection&quot; - and of course nothing for the target warehouse. I should have thought that the 800 pieces should be printed as in transit for the source warehouse until the 1st of October. Can anyone help on this ?<br />

Looking at it from financial point of view, you're right. Have they got any fix for this in BS?<br />

I had different Baan IVc4 session (tdinv6230m000) in mind.  Not sure about Baan V . <br />
<br />
But functionally the inventory must be shown for transit warehouse during the transit period. Have u checked the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">18th October 2004, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only the inventory valuation report and as mentioned checked if the goods in transit are either shown on the issueing or receiving warehouse - but it can be found nowhere during this short period. I believe it must be a bug.<br />
