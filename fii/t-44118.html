We use credit limits marginally to control certain customers but would prefer to have more control based on terms versus limits.  Is there blocking codes that Baan can automatically apply to certain customers over their terms?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zacharyg</div><div class="date">8th November 2007, 23:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello pmilitello,<br />
<br />
I am not aware of any possibility to block sales orders for a certain customer based on terms. You must customise your system to acheive this goal. Baan only offers the three automated possibilities defined in tdsls4100m000 form 2 in combination with the blocking step for a relevant order type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">12th November 2007, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Additionally to the 3 mentioned blockings (credit limit, doubtful, overdue) you have a fourth one when you use the sales margin controle, plus a manual blocking.<br />
<br />
But none of these is related to the customer directly or to the term of payment. <br />
In case of e.g. advanced payments, you could use a 1 in the credit limit field. <br />
<br />
could you give some more information?<br />
<br />

Our problem is that many customers are not paying according to their terms.  In tdsls4100m000, I set Baan to signal if an invoice is overdue but I have not set the block for overdue invoice because I'm not sure how to manually over ride.<br />
<br />
I do not want an order to be entered or shipped if a customer owes money on an invoice that is overdue.  I would prefer to have Baan do this automatically.</div></div><hr />

You can release each single Sales order afterwards, where is the problem?<br />

Do you want the SO not to be entered --&gt; then you should block the customer, or do you want to block the shipment then you should set the blocking step in the sales order type just before Maintain delivery, or Generate Outbound, depending on your warehouse management?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">13th November 2007, 20:07</div></div><div class="posttext">You can always set the customer to Doubtful with those terms and it should work in your case.<br />
Baan will allow to enter the order due to credit reason. Do you want the based on Invoice over due or just credit terms.<br />
<br />
Anyway it is a simple customization. In our environment we have given some grace days after invoice due date. <br />
