could someone tell me what this session tfacp1100m000 is good for?<br />
I can insert an invoice and approve it, but is it also possible or better how is it possible to book it or to bring it, to the open entries. <br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
Schweizer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">21st November 2006, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">First usefull to control invoice received before you process it.<br />
There is a control not to repeat a customer invoice number.<br />
<br />
Second, while maintaining transactions, if this is of type purchase invoice, you can copy it from one registered. Then its satatus in tfacp100 changes to copied.<br />
<br />
We use it in our system and it is useful for us.<br />

thats great.<br />
It makes sense, but hard to find out.<br />
I did it before but I was not sure whether its right or wrong.</div></div><hr />
