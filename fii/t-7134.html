Today four of our nine companies are running in Baan 4c4 on one server.<br />
In the work in rolling out Baan to the rest of our companies we are looking on the effects of changin from MultiFinance/Multi Logistic to Multi Finance/Single Logistic.<br />
Do anyone have experiance of a similar setup/rollout?<br />
We will probably need the MCR extension to solve some issues concerning home currency, in the MCR extension we can use 3 homecurrencies.  Can Euro be used as homecurrency also in countries like Poland, Tjeckei and Hungary as long as we keep the transaction currencise in the local currency?<br />
<br />
<br />

In a single logistic environment you will get intracompany bookings but no invoices between your financial entities. However, that is a legal requirement here in Europe. Also keep in mind that - when using PCS - the multifinance - single logistic functionality is very limited in Baan IV. For example you are not allowed to sell from a project which belongs to a different financial company. <br />
<br />
Without knowing multicurrency extension I doubt that you will be able to use the EURO within a company in a non-EURO country as home currency for the same reason - it might work in Baan, but legally it might not be allowed.<br />
<br />
(Baan 5 offers a lot more possibilities for multisite setups, but I guess you will not migrate just now)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 19:02</div></div><div class="posttext">We have multi-finance/single logistic on 4c4 MCR.  Ulrich is correct in saying you don't get inter-company invoices but you get inter-company automatic bookings at standard/project cost.  We cancel these out &amp; raise manual inter-company invoices where relevant.<br />
We have to do this anyway as for tax reasons (transfer pricing) most transactions have to be at &quot;arms length&quot; pricing - there must be a profit.  We only occasionally come across the problem of PCS items needing to be sold to a different finance company so that is not an issue to us.<br />
<br />
With MCR, we do have one of our currencies as the Euro - we started off with 4c3 MCR and when the Euro was not the legal currency of the EU.  We use MCR as we need to report in both Euros &amp; GBÂ£.  It works ok - as Euro is our number 1 home currency all transactions are effectively transacted in Euros so I don't think it is a legal problem for us in our mainland European operations reporting (Belgium &amp; Germany).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maalpoel</div><div class="date">8th December 2002, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">BaanIV isnt disign to have multi country and multi currency support on the finance area.  Having this there are 2 problems, moving goods between 2 eu countries via e.g. a warehouse transaction, only 1 intrastat transaction is logged, also of course there is no invoice for this. Second problem is the currency, you can have only 1 currency for all finance countries. The MCR extension only solves this problem half, all the currencies (max of 3) should be the same for all the finance companies. BaanERP will support you on both cases as for i can see.<br />
