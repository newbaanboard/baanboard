<br />
I got something to ask here. Hope you guys can help me.<br />
<br />
In (AR) in Print Non-Finalized Transaction -tfgld1401m000 there are a few columns like below:<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
DOC /SUPPLIER /LEDGER ACCO/ AMOUNT/ AMOUNT IN HC/CURRENCY<br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
When the currency USD is entered, the bank account curency appeared USD.<br />
 <br />
but the  ledger account-(Sales Debit Notes)  appears in wrong currency (RM)<br />
<br />
<br />
**** RM is the HOME CURRENCY.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
So i checked tccom1501m000-Display Customer -the currency field.<br />
<br />
This problem appears (if I'm not mistaken) when the customer currency field is defined as RM but a different currency (USD) is entered in the transaction.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
In real situation this happens. When a customer did the agreement, they agreed on one currency (Example-RM) but when payment they pay in USD.<br />
So in finance; they just entered the value according to the payment document they received. (I think they don't want to calculate in the currency originally agreed). <br />
<br />
So, in the non-finalized transaction the ledger account for document type-sales debit notes  account currency appear in original Currency as defined (RM) and the bank account currency appear in USD which makes the DEBIT AND CREDIT IS NOT BALANCED.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Currently, what we practice is do the correction in ttaad4100 -<br />
tfacr200 and tfgld102 (I know this in not correct).<br />
<br />
I would like to know how to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day. :)</div></div><hr />
