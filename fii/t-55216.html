     The session you have mentioned (tfgld4201m000) is the Post Integration Transactions to Finance Transactions. If your requirement is only to post the sales related integration transaction, then use the following setting<br />
Transaction Origin (From - To): Sales - Sales<br />
Financial Transaction (From - To): Inventory on order - Receipt from Project<br />
<br />
w.r.t the financial transaction, i have chosen the A to Z of options in it as that would guarantee all the possible combination related to sales will get posted. The usual combination (depending on integration setup) would be Sales - Issue, Sales - Revaluation, Sales - Inventory Transfer, Sales - Revenue, Sales - Material Costs &amp; Sales - Sales Invoice.<br />
<br />
hth<br />

<br />
P.S: Prior to running this i hope you have executed the Process Delivered Sales Orders {tdsls4223m000}</div></div><hr />

do you have any idea as to how i can increase the time out timer from 10 miniutes to 30 mins?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">14th March 2009, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi mitesh,<br />
   Since you already have a timeout of 10 min in place, i reckon that you already have the setting &quot;session_timeout:10&quot; in either the &quot;BSE\lib\Defaults\all&quot;  or the &quot;BSE\lib\user\u&lt;username&gt;&quot; file. Just change this value from 10 to 30 and it should do. If you put this setting in the former file, you set it for all users while in the later file, you control it by user (Ideally suitable to take out the restrictions for admin users by entering a large value).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mitesh13</div><div class="date">15th March 2009, 08:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Sukesh,<br />
for user specific user there is nothing like &quot;session_timeout:10&quot; in file..<br />
However i can see the the in all User file..<br />
I just want to change the setting for specific users only and not for all users..<br />
Please suggest...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">15th March 2009, 09:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
  Create a new line in user specific file (BSE\lib\user\u&lt;username&gt;) and enter &quot;session_timeout:30&quot;, without the double quotes, and then save the changes. <br />

It's not working.. my session still ends after 10 mins..</div></div><hr />

   I am going to assume the following:<br />
1) You weren't logged in when you did this change to your u&lt;username&gt; file.<br />
2) After setting this parameter in the above file, you didn't run the Convert User Data to Runtime Data Dictionary {ttaad4200m000} for your username.<br />
<br />
If the above are true, then please post the contents of your u&lt;username&gt; file so that we could check out if its to do with how you set this parameter.<br />
<br />
