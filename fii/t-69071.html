<br />
I am on LN10.4 and while searching the finalized Transaction tables i have found there are multiple Lines inside a Particular Document.<br />
<br />
I want to know which transaction is a Tax Transaction and which is its corresponding Net Amount, the Amount on which the tax is based.<br />
<br />
