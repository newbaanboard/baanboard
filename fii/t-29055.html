<br />
we are using BaaN IVc4. A few months ago we added a new line of products for sale.<br />
We added a new dimension for that. <br />
But when trying to integrate got an error of &quot;invalid dimension&quot;, in other threads i see that we need to include the dimension in the session <br />
tfgld0109m000 with the ledger account...<br />
<br />
i did that. 2 of 3 of the errors went out, but i still have an &quot;invalid dimension&quot; error. it's a record with the new dimension so i think it must be related but i don't understand what could be happening...<br />
<br />
any idea?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

I think you have create the new dimension in tfgld0110m000 and in tfgld0109m000 but it's important to check the following sessions: tfgld4126m000 there please check the integration transaction and integration element. In session tfgld4120m000 you have to define the new dimension created previusly.<br />
do you speak spanish? please ask me in spanish if you have any problem<br />
