I have a sales order that is taxed (multiple tax rate). I was able to Post the intgeration transcation, but I get an error when finalization. We are using standard Baan tax module (no external tax provider)<br />
I am on Baan Ivc3.<br />
<br />
This is what I have set up.<br />
<br />
1. Deifine Tax code in tax code by country and singular tax set to no.<br />
2. Define Ledger in tas code by country.<br />
3. Define tax rate (multiple tax rate).<br />
<br />
The invoices, order acknowledgement calculated the tax rate correctly. I can see the tax been calculated in tfgld410 also.<br />
<br />
The error message is in the attachment.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for help.<br />

It seems my attachement didn't go through. Anyway I found the problem, the tfgld107 was having no ledger and dimension. <br />
