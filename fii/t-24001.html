<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steiner</div><div class="date">9th May 2005, 19:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm writing an AFS to match purchase order invoices to receipts.  The problem I'm having is handling cascaded child sessions.  Specifically, executing a continue.process on session tfacp1110s000 starts the sub-session tfacp1130s000 which I can handle, but before I can handle it tfacp1130s000 starts it's own sub-session tfacp1131s000.  So my function server hangs due to the lack of a handle for the tfacp1131s000.  Has anyone else written an AFS to match purchase order invoices to receipts or handled this problem for another reason that is willing to share a solution?<br />

I am sure there are several posts there with regards to this subject.  The finance moderator should also move this post to that forum.</div></div><hr />

I have seen other threads related to this issue but not on this specific problem where child sessions are started by another child session automatically.<br />
