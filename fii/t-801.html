In some new documents (Accounts Payable) field balance amount differs from Amount (tfacp200)<br />
Who can explain a reason?<br />
Maybe settings are wrong? <br />
Problem applies only to a few documents, not to all.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Regards<br />
Anna</div></div><hr />

<br />
What type pf documents are these?  The only reason why the balance should be different to the amount is if the eg.  the document was an invoice and some of it had been paid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">annpaj</div><div class="date">17th January 2002, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
There are completely new documents like invoices (without any payments), Bank transactions (advance or unallocated).<br />
On a subsession tfacp2523s000 Display Payments on purchase invoices there are no any documents displayed, but amount is differ then balance.  So it looks like en error.<br />
I unclosed a screenshot with an invoice.<br />

<br />
I'm not sure why this is happening but the correction programs that Guido mentioned will reset the balances for you.   If it does not happen on every document then it could be just a temporary problem.  Has anybody been using General Table Maintenance on your system?  Maybe there were some allocations done on these documents and then deleted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">annpaj</div><div class="date">17th January 2002, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for answering my question. I didn't run any corrections program. I try to find out about reasons, why error occurs. <br />
Maybe some patches are needed? Or, like you suggest, some payments were registered and removed from the system ( but it's unlikely).<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<br />
We also suffer from this problem but very only very occasionally. In our case it tends to happen after payment runs where some balances or part balances can be left on tfacp200 but I don't think that it happens on new documents.<br />
<br />
This naturally confuses finance with regards to whether an invoice has been paid or not.<br />
<br />
We have raised a case on this before and updated our cash management module to the latest solutions. The problem then stopped we closed the case and then of course it started happening again but it only seems to happen maybe once a month.<br />
<br />
At the moment I'm just using GTM to correct these problems until I can establish a definate pattern but with the frequency of the problem being so low I guess maybe it's something we'll just have to put up with for a while.<br />
<br />
We are running Baan IVc3.<br />

I think Neal is right, we have to put up with this situation. GTM is a good place to make fast corrections.<br />
We are going to install SP7, maybe it helps. Now we are working with Baan cIV sp6.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all<br />
