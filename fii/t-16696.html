<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">4th October 2004, 13:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You can tick these to include cost ivnoices or anticipated payments. If you don't tick these then the aging won't show those types of transactions.  If you include anticipated payments then it will show those invoices as being paid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">4th October 2004, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Cost type invoice are invoice that are not matched to orders, but entered as type cost.  I think most businesses have different transactin types to show the difference between a cost invoice and an invoice matched to a purchase order.  The aging will not indicate the difference otherwise.</div></div><hr />
