<br />
In the past I have had a similar problem with Triton version 3.1.<br />
The problem was due to the fact that we had integration turned on to real-time. The system could not cope with the backlog of integration transactions.<br />
<br />
Our solution was to turn off the real-time mode and create 6 daily jobs run over a 24-hour period that ran the posting of integration session. This worked for us and the backlog was cleared in about 5 days.<br />
<br />
This may help.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

Thanks for your reply,<br />
<br />
It is not real-time posting. The session is scheduled to run at Midnight as a Job.  Still we are facing same problem. <br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">24th November 2003, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">First thing to try is rebooting your system.  This will clear any old locks.   If the problem persists - the code could be causing the problem, or your environment.  Check if any patches, etc. were applied before this started happening.   <br />
<br />
This Post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=119&amp;highlight=Error+107) talks about a similar problem.  It leads to an oracle discussion, but you can see that there are some settings in the Environment (db_resource) that can effect this error.  You can also see from the post that it can be a serious problem, and Baan Support may  be of use to you.<br />
<br />
Please backup before letting anyone try anything.  The reboot should be safe, but the 107 lock table errors in NT can be the signal of other problems.  This type of thing can snowball, pls backup!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the same problem in tfgld4201m000 (but in table tfgld418).<br />
Probably there was a process locking this table.<br />
<br />
I rebooted the server and it was solved.</div></div><hr />
