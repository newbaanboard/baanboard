<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">29th October 2004, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">We currently have a dimension which is mandatory for certain accounts (the dimension is populated solely through integrations).  Our Finance department has decided to retire this dimension as our business has evolved away from its use.  I believe that all I will have to do is the following (we are planning on going this on December 31st for a clean cut):<br />
<br />
<br />
 Go to Maintain Chart of Accounts (tfgld0108m000) and change the dimension requirement from Mandatory to Optional.<br />
 Go to Maintain Options by Integration Elements (tfgld4121m000) and remove any setup relating to that dimension.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if there are any pitfalls you may know of or if there is something I have missed.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!</div></div><hr />

You may wish also to block the dimensions.  You can do this in maintain Dimensions.  Block as of the date you want to stop using and set the ending date WAY out.</div></div><hr />
