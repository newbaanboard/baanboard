So would someone please advice how to delete AR/AP opening balance from GL? Since the GL opening balance would be entried perviously.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
I assume that you are dealing with a conversion from another system. What I do in general is:<br />
<br />
Post open invoices from the old system to an interim account, e.g. a sales invoice:<br />
<br />
   Customer Account<br />
   To/ Interim Customer Opening Account<br />
<br />
This Interim account would total up to the old balance from the previous system.<br />
<br />
On your first opening balance of the system you post the customer balance to this Interim account, that will thus be in balance (i.e. 0).<br />
<br />
Same way with the purchase side of course.</div></div><hr />

There is no ACR/ACP bookkeeping done in Baan that is &quot;aside&quot; of the general ledger. Any transactions in ACR/ACP are basically transactions in GLD which are ALSO logged in ACR/ACP. The data in this areas is linked, and you cannot delete a part of it without creating an inconsistency. So you have to find a posting scheme for your opening data as described above.<br />

Thanks for your kind advice.... We i implmented other ERP system before. I always first entry GL balance, then entry AR/AP opening balance, and delete the AR/AP transactions posted to GL.<br />
<br />
So according to your advice, first i should entry GL opening balance, but use AR interim account for AR OB;<br />
Then entry AR opening balance by customer in ACP module, and use AR interim account as the sales account. Therefore then interim AR account would be balance. <br />
Am I right?<br />
I think this could be a good solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, that's the correct procedure!<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">The other reason that you pretty much have to do it that way (at  least in Baan IV) is that once you have defined a ledger account as a Control Account in your set up of AR/AP, you can no longer enter an Opening Balance transaction type against that account.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anthony_wang</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 19:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice to see you again! Scott.<br />
Ye, do agree with you.<br />
Actually for other system, should be the same - there won't be any entry for control account in GL level.<br />
When i implemented Scala before, we will first setup AR account as normal account, entry the OB. Then link with AR module, entry the AR OB by customers.<br />
Before posting, we would copy the GL datafiles (differ from AR files). And then restore the GL datafiles after posting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan also slaps you on the wrist before you can enter the open items if you try that approach. <br />
<br />
If the account is first set as a &quot;normal&quot; account and you enter an opening balance transaction, when you attempt to set it as a control account in ACR or ACP you are prevented from doing so because the account has a non-zero balance.<br />

I have been through this many times with different ERP's and the following approach is always best:<br />
example : A/R<br />
1. Never convert G/L balances into control accounts.<br />
2. Set up a temporary G/L account just for the G/L conversion<br />
3. Load G/L balance for receivables into that account<br />
4. Load A/R open items into ACR<br />
5. Populate A/R control account automatically via the A/R conversion (if using Baan exchange this can be part of exchange scheme)<br />
6. Offsetting entry (the debit) to the A/R load is the temporary account<br />
7. The temporary account has two entries - a credit from the G/L conversion and a debit from the receivables load<br />
8. If the balance of the temporary account is not equal to 0, there is a reconciling difference on your old system - it is nothing to do with Baan. Blame your finance department!<br />
9. Write off any difference and block the temporary account.</div></div><hr />
