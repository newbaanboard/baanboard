<br />
I would like to clear two old open entries (aging issue) which are in different currency and different sign but exactly for same amount in home currency.  As we can not assign two unallocated payments with different signs in Baan IV, is there any workaround?  I have some limitations like already periods are closed for those entries and I can not write off because of big amounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the unallocted document a new unallocated document with negative amount and same rate need to be created and directly assigned to the existing una. payment. This will create a balance on the dummy bank interim account.<br />
<br />
Now in the same dummy bank transaction type create a normal payment in tfcmg2100s000. This will clear the interim account exactly down to zero. When you check the non finalized trans. you see a small currency difference posting which is fine.<br />
<br />
As well I suggest to create an inquiry at Infor Support. It is not a good way of working what i explained but i see no other way.<br />
<br />
Let me know your comments.<br />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I tried to do the same.  But I am sorry, I forgot to mention you another limitation.  As I told you both unallocated payments are in different currency.  One of them is in BEF which is not in use anymore.  In my current environment, I can not create any new transaction with BEF currency to nullify.  So, this way of solving ths issue is ruled out.  <br />

Thanks.<br />

<br />
Look at GTM as the option to offset these 2 amounts.<br />
