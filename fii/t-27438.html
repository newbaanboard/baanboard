In maintain curriences (tcmcs0102m000), there is the rounding factor to key-in.  So in future, do this master data allow for changing of this factor if there is transaction entered for Purchase and Sales.<br />
If not allowed, then how to go about it?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">26th June 2006, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, once there are transactions on for the selected currency, no changes to the rounding-factor are allowed. What do you mean by &quot;how to go about it&quot;? Just define a correct rounding factor, which will be relevant &quot;forever&quot;...</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
The &quot;how to go about it&quot; means is there any workaround or alternative ways since there are no changing allowed once there are transaction?<br />
<br />
Is this means it is a one-time setup for the rounding factor?<br />
Let say maybe this year the setup is using rounding 0.01.<br />
Then what happen if one year later down the road, user decide to change to 0.1.<br />
<br />
Hope to get message through and to get a reply.<br />
Thanks very much.</div></div><hr />

You know per currency what the correct rounding factor is. For instance for USD, rounding factor is 0.01, for instance for JPY (Yen), the rounding factor is I think 1.00, etc.<br />
<br />
In other words, each currency, depending on the value of their coin, has its relevant roundinf factor; I don't see any reason why this would change over the years...</div></div><hr />

<br />
the only way you can change it through GTM level. I came across of some problem where I require to change the rounding factor. Below is my problem.<br />
<br />
Initialy, my Rounding Factor is 0.01<br />
<br />
1. 29.7 x 261.05 = 7753.185<br />
                       = 7753.19<br />
<br />
2. 29.7 x 261.05 = 7753.185<br />
                       = 7753.19<br />
<br />
7753.19 + 7753.19 = 15506.38 (Not correct)<br />
<br />
If I don't have split line -&gt; 59.4 x 261.05 = 15506.37 (Correct)<br />
<br />
After having change the Rounding Factor to 0.001, split lines or total gives the correct amount.<br />

<br />
Indeed GTM is the only possible way.<br />
Changing it from 0.01 to 0.001 is no problem.<br />
Do not change from 0.01 to 0.1. Then amounts get corrupted. An amount of 0.96 can be registered before the change. When this amount is taken into account during a calculation the cents will be lost.<br />
