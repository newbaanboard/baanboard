 We will implement commission module on BAAN LN, but I met a problem now, so wish you all can give me help, thanks a lot.<br />
 My problem is the transaction for commission of employee, when I released the commission to invoicing(tdcms2201m000), its status can be changed to &quot;closed&quot;, but how can I find its finacial transaction on finance module, maybe I need key in voucher manually,right?<br />
 I have tested the commission of suppliers, it can generate a purchase invoice and sales order/commission integration transaction.<br />
<br />
 Another problem, when I key in the paid on &quot;Payment employee commission by order&quot;, my system show the message liks the attachment, I have set up the finacial year and period, and them are opened.<br />
 <br />
 Thanks you for your reply and support!<br />
