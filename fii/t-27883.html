In order to have all corrected, you must consider also the type of transaccion involved. This mean, if is a document from, logistics, ACR, ACP, CMG, etc. All of these transactions have different tables involved.<br />
<br />
With this on mind, I suggest you to reconstruct the status of the batch in order to have it ready to finish.<br />
<br />
1.- Tfgld100. Batch status to ready.<br />
2.- Tfgld101. Must exist the type of transaction and status set to ready to finish. If not exist, you must create that record.<br />
<br />
With this you must be able to finish that batch or at least you can see it with the session Mantain transacctions and corrected or deleted.<br />
<br />
The other solution involves to delete the batch records from tfgld102, tfgld101, tfgld100 and tfgld018. Also must consider the records from the type of transaccion, like tfacr200, tracp200 or tfcmg101. But, it depends on the type of transactions.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aliceK</div><div class="date">15th August 2006, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for explanation!<br />
<br />
Sorry I wasn't clear enough, these transactions are ordinary ACP purchase invoices (not linked to logistics!)<br />
<br />
But what do you mean by:<br />
2. If not exist in Tfgld101, you must create that record?<br />
I actually don't quite understand the meaning of the table and what process creates records to that table in what stage overall?<br />
you mean I should just add the record directly to the table?:o <br />
<br />

The record on tfgld101, is created when  you create a batch.<br />
By example, suposse your purchase invoices have the transaction type 201<br />
<br />
When you create a batch to register these invoices, first you create a batch, say number 123. When you do this, a record is created on table tfgld100. Then you have to create the transaction type. In our example you type 201. When you do this, a record is created on tfgl101. By you explanation I undersand that this record is not present on this table, right? (you have to be sure that you have been looking on the right year/batch number). If this is correct, then somebody with access to GTM have been deleted this record an changed the status on tfgld100.<br />
<br />
Let's continue, after this, you crete the necessary invoces entrys. This process creates a record on table tfacp200 and in tfgld018.<br />
<br />
There are all the records that creates a purchase invoice without Purchase Order.<br />
<br />
In short, if you dont have the record on tfgld101, you have to add it, directly on the table using, the appropiate transaction type, year, and batch number.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />
