 Problem: wrong ledger account being posted on PCS / COGS.   <br />
I am seeing certain Fin Customer Groups go into the wrong ledger. But then once in a while I will see the same Fin Customer Group with a different Item group go into correct ledger.  <br />
<br />
See attachment<br />
 The settings for the Integration are  (PCS Projects tfgld4121m000)<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Cost (pri-1) Project (general) Method by Ranges<br />
2. Prod (pri-0) Fin Cust Grp PCS Proj -  Cost Price Component by ranges<br />
3. Div. (pri-0) Fin Cust Grp PCS Proj- Cost Price component by ranges<br />
<br />
Problem: the ledger accounts are basically set up the same. <br />
1 Cost Center Optional (same for both ledgers)<br />
2. Product line =Optional (same Products in each)<br />
3. Division =Optional (same division for both ledgers)<br />
4 Project=optional (note this is optional in correct ledger)<br />
but the wrong ledger it is going to it is set as =not used. <br />
<br />
Not sure why These Customers are going into wrong ledger. The same financial Customer Group can go into either account. But the wrong ledger is used 90% of the time.  But the wrong ledger is posting 90% of transactions. The Item's can be used in both ledgers. <br />
<br />
Note: since the CP is posting into the wrong account we can't use session Tipcs8150m000 to fix. Since the components have already posted.  <br />
<br />
Thank you for your help<br />

It looks like the component 400 with the same item posted ok. And this is a trend happening with all. <br />
<br />
CP 100 Raw material is posting too wrong ledger</div></div><hr />

I guess you should analyse the integration set-up in more detail:<br />
- check set-up of tipcs8150m000 for combination of FCG, FSG, CPC, etc.<br />
- the screen shot given by you for tfgld4121m000 is showing only for 3 dimensions (not for 4th dimension)???<br />
<br />
Check for data errors. For e.g. FCG of customer may differ from FCG of the sales order / project.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you don't mind, I will share my experience . <br />
I have same situation with you when I report duty to new place. <br />
Here , task list in order to help you find root cause and solution <br />
<br />
1. Print active mapping scheme details with dimension<br />
From here, you must have details ledger with dimension been setup. <br />
You could classified based on your error finding <br />
<br />
2. From here, you must extract information General Item which you have relation with Project. Normally, for project, it has separate item code to ease tracking <br />
<br />
3. Match information and find the weird things <br />
<br />
4. You may start seeing what's been wrongly setup, which transaction triggered the mapping , who did the process <br />
<br />
5. You will find option for solution and open for discussion . <br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />
