Urgent help required:<br />
<br />
I have a situation wherein for a single supplier I have several purhcase orders. Against each P.O there are several invoices received from the supplier. The user has entered these invoices in one single batch giving purchase orders for some invoices and not for some. When these were being matched in tfacp1131s000(Match Receipts) individually, system generated a message &quot;Tax code not found&quot; since tax field in tccom2101m000 was set to Yes,though no tax is required to be calculated. Later on this field was set to No. The system then matched all the invoices by itself and the user could not control it manually. In ACP parameters Automatic matching is set to No.<br />
<br />
Now the system is not allowing to reverse the matching and the cursor is jumping the match field. I reset the status to No in tdpur045. Though the status is No in tafcap1131s000 in match field, still I am not able to reverse the matching. What could be the reason. What all table I shd check and the references and change?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
Check tfacp200 and tfgld102 as well.<br />
It's a tricky thing, reversing matching.<br />
<br />
I recall some urgent solution with regard to tax. I don't know if it relates to your problem. Better check it out on support.baan.com.</div></div><hr />
