<br />
We have a sales quotation with two lines, each with the same item. Such item has a discount of 5% if the sale is up to 5 units, and 8% if the sale is between 6 and 10 units. We have 3 units in the first line, and 4 units in the second line. At the time of the quotation creation, the discounts are 5% and 8% for each line, respectively. But if a new calculation is made for the entire quotation (through the following path: tdsls1501m000 -&gt; Specific -&gt; Recalc. Price/Discounts Entire Quotation, all parameters checked), the discount for each line should be now 8%, since the total quantity is 7 units. This works well if the parameters Refuse and Signal in session tdsls0120 (Margin Control Parameters), are both non-checked. But, if any of these two parameters is checked, then the system displays a message and leaves the discounts unchanged. We believe this is an error of the standard, but we dont find a solution. We will appreciate if someone let us know a solution for this problem.<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
