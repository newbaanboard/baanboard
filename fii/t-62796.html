<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chitaranjan</div><div class="date">4th September 2012, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Experts,<br />
<br />
We have created one capital item with item type &quot;Cost&quot; &amp; item group &quot;Cost to be Specified&quot;.<br />
So after purchase receipt in integartion following transaction are triggered<br />
1-Purchase Order/Receipt<br />
Inteim transit a/c Dr <br />
Invoice Accural a/c Cr.<br />
2-Purchase order/Cost to be specified<br />
Interin Cost a/c Dr(this interim cost nullfied after matching &amp; approval &amp; CWIP a/c dr with asset no.)<br />
Interim transit a/c Cr <br />
<br />
upto this everthing is ok, but if we used Landed cost in purchase order then system generate following integration transaction-<br />
1.Purchase order/Landed Cost Invoiced <br />
Interim transit a/c Dr<br />
Invoice accural a/c cr.<br />
2.Purchase order/General Cost<br />
End A/c Dr<br />
Interim transit a/c cr.<br />
<br />
here we have one issue , we want system should triggered Purchase Order/cost to be specified&quot; transaction instead of &quot;Purchase order/General Cost&quot;.<br />
<br />
We want additional charges should be debit on Interim Cost a/c in integartion transaction &amp; this interim cost should be reversed after matching &amp; approval &amp; CWIP a/c debit, because such additional charges are also part of Fixed Assets Cost.<br />
<br />
So please suggest us how this can be possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

Landed costs related to cost/service items, eventhough the item group has the cost-to-be-specified flag set to yes, are handled in the same way as if this flag was set to no, so normal cost/service items. The only way to get those landed costs to your fixed asset is to add those cost yourself manually in FAM.<br />
You can ask support to create an enhancement request for this.<br />
