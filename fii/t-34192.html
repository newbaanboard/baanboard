<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mike_mayers</div><div class="date">13th April 2007, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Finalization batches abort about 10% of the time with a server termination message notation in the bshell.log.  Most often the tfgld109 status does not get changed to &quot;finalized&quot;.  It is left &quot;in use&quot; and it requires a GTM to change it. The batch is really completed. Sometimes the batch aborts are in other stages but most of the time it is the 109 fix. We are on version B40c.73 and seems this started after the last service pack upgrade in July 2006.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't session tfgld1117s000 availabe on your Baan-version as well..? If so, rather use that session to correct the status, rather than gtm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mike_mayers</div><div class="date">16th April 2007, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on service pack 20</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mike_mayers</div><div class="date">16th April 2007, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Session tfgld1117m000 changes status from 'in use' to 'free' - typically we need to change tfgld109 to 'finalized successfully'.  We do use the session depending on where the abort occurs and if restarting the finalization run is appropriate.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">17th April 2007, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">So the session tfgld1214m000, tfgld1119s000 and tfgld1118s000 should probably serve your purposes...</div></div><hr />

We used to have that problem also. Another implication of the &quot;wrong&quot; status is that the tiral balance were not correct. Month after month whe have to rebuild the balance. After a long trace of the records, whe found that the batches that the system not changed their status not were counting for trial balance!<br />
<br />
After this, Infor support, suggest us to upgrade the object otfgld1213. After this our problems were solved.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

Please check whether you have updated the component otfgld1210-otfgld1213. The table tfgld109 was updated last in the finalization process.<br />
<br />
I assume that you use &quot;Finalization&quot; for your transaction type.<br />
Even after you correct the status of the finalization run, you have to confirm whether the GL was updated correctly. Print the finalization report to check whether all the transaction lines were there. Print the trial balance to check whether the GL balance was updated.</div></div><hr />
