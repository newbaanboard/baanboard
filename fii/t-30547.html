tfgld101 there are no records for batch<br />
tfgld100 shows batch status 4 (Ready) final status 1 free<br />
batch modifiable 2(No)<br />
I also can't see the batch in tfgld1101m000<br />
if I print non-final trx there are no transactions (as prev table indicated)<br />
but I can select from session Select Batches for Finalization this batch.<br />
How can I delete the batch, only through GTM table setting the status in tfgld100 to deleted?<br />
<br />
or is there a possibility in application also?<br />
or can I just try finalize the batch that has to documents?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th January 2007, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try to change the batch to 'modifiable' via GTM and then see if you can access it through the session. If there are any transaction types connected to it, you will be able to delete them via the session. If not, you can try to add a trasaction type through the session, then remove it. Standard Baan should then normally remove the batch/change status to deleted...<br />
<br />
Let us know please if this worked..<br />

but still can't access the batch.<br />
it doesn't show in the tfgld1101m000 maintain trx<br />
may be because it belongs to previous year:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th January 2007, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">So look in the transactions for precious year...!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aliceK</div><div class="date">29th January 2007, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">there are no transactions, this is emty batch, for some reason it's not in deleted status as it should in normal case when no documents are linked.<br />
If I select the year 2006 it still does not bring me this batch in normal tfgld1101m000 session.<br />
wouldn't it be ok also if I just change the status in GTM tfgld100 to deleted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th January 2007, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that's fine, no problem at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jalitrek11</div><div class="date">29th January 2007, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Your best bet is to change check to see if its already attached to a finalization run number buy looking at tfgld100.  If it has a finalization run number, you need to go back to the session &quot;finalize transactions&quot; and look for that run number, enter it and then finalize.  <br />
<br />
Chances are that the batch is there in a &quot;Yes&quot; Status which is causing it to be hung up.<br />
<br />
Simple changing the status to deleted may cause a error in the month end close becuase the finalization run number will still be open.<br />
