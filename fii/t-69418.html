Yes! Grinya are a pain in the neck!<br />
But here are the general steps to have your grinya accounts under control.<br />
1.- Make sure that every po, have been conciliated vs invoices with po. A common mistake is to pay to a supplier a po with an invoice without po. Or even worse, with a journal entry in gld!<br />
When you done this, you grinya account will be diminished.<br />
2.- Review all your po. If there orders where they will no recieved anymore, it is better to delete.<br />
3.- Check your recieved goods that are not concilied. It is normal to have some recent recieved orders without invoice. But if you have several during years, there is probabily that your company have paided without invoce with po.<br />
4.- In grinya module, there is a manual match where you can match recieved goods against manual invocies and even journal entries in gld.<br />
<br />
I have seen this in several companies, and it require a lot of work but, at the end, the effort will pay.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To take full advantage of the current GRINYA reconciliation process, check Infor solution #107147, which contains the GRINYA user manual and a link to download the software for your version of Baan. For ERP LN, look at Document Code U8942C US.<br />
<br />
It is called User Guide for Reconciliation and Analysis. If you are not running the latest GRINYA solutions, patching will require a good amount of time in filling the Interim tables this solution runs from. Infor has posted several procedural write ups, so check the Support Site and read up before tackling this for the first time.</div></div><hr />
