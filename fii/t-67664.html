When we do payment ,from tfacp200 ,payment type can be &quot;assignment',&quot;unallocated payment&quot; etc. Once do the payment, the system will generate a new line where transaction type(tfacp200.ttyp) is SAME as payment type(tfacp200.tdoc).<br />
<br />
I notice that if my payment is &quot;normal payment&quot; ,the system will NOT generate a new line where transaction type(tfacp200.ttyp) is under this &quot;normal payment&quot;. <br />
<br />
My Question is , where the record keep if it is not keep in tfacp200, because I need to generate a report that show the transaction detail (normal payment) for specific supplier.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks alot.</div></div><hr />

I think you are searching based on Index 1 with Payment Transaction Type.  Instead search based on Index 1 with Invoice Transaction type (ttyp = invoice ttyp, ninv = invoice number, line = invoice line number, tdoc = payment ttyp, docn = payment document number)</div></div><hr />
