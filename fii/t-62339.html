Most of the finance tables have company number as keys and without any custom script I don't think it willbe possoble to do it. If you are open to custom scrip then all we need to do is write scripts to update the open items and then share the table. It will need a smal, progect plan though. It is possible, but will need effort.</div></div><hr />
