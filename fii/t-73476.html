We have a Supplier group which is linked to a specific GL account and we are generating AP Aging report detailed with invoice and the total of the same does not tally with GL account balance for a certain year and period. Is there any option to identify the difference between GL and Sub-ledger in LN 10.4 version. Let us know details of how we can find this differences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were able to find the document that was the reason for the different between GL and AP sub-ledger by running the Control Account Checklist report and we fount that there was a payment document which is found in tfacp200 which attached to the Invoice. Whereas this document is found deleted in GL.<br />
Hope this information will be of help to all in such scenarios.</div></div><hr />

Should be run on a monthly basis.</div></div><hr />
