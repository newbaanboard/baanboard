<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">batwood</div><div class="date">25th June 2013, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know of any way to speed up the LN payment reconciliation process? Unlike other bank transactions, payment reconciliations require addition sessions to be accessed which greatly slows down the manual processing of checks.<br />
<br />
I've just begun to explore the possiblity of the electronic bank statements but don't really know much about it and the user guides aren't all that informative. Currently using version 10.2.1 of ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Any help/work arounds would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
