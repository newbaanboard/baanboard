<br />
It's amaizing to me how ERPLN 6.1 (and older versions of Baan) seem to SUCK so much at generating useful reports. <br />
<br />
For example, I need a very simple report that shows item #'s, on hand quantity, and price per item.<br />
<br />
 So, I tried the Perform Inventory Valuation (whina1210m000) session. But as usual, I can only print to Wordpad, which gives me a .txt file with a bunch of stupid page headers, making conversion to excel a pain in the butt! We are FINANCE, we need reports in Excel format!<br />
<br />
Plus, when I print this report with item details, it gives me a txt file with items #'s in one row and quantity/prine in another row. Grrr...<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to print cleaner reports that are better for conversion to Excel? <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

The main problem, if you're using standard interface devices is that the report format is not excel friendly and you end up re-writing the report or creating new ones. <br />
If thats not a option it's probably third party add-ons.</div></div><hr />

This file can be loaded in for example Excel to make own calculations and own filtering at the data.<br />
<br />
This report will also be made available as of May 2010 in the feature packs FP5 and FP6.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another good option is to use HiDox www.hidox.com<br />

<br />
I'll look into buying the third party software. That would be a good interim solution until the next feature pack. Although, it'll take months to get something like that approved.<br />

As one of our company's lead finance users I would say that this product satisfies most of our user needs.  It is pretty simple to use and even non-finance individuals find it helpful to output BAAN data to Excel, Word, Notepad, HTML, and XML.  It is also very inexpensive.</div></div><hr />
