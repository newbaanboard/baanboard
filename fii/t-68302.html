<br />
Can you please help us with the below query :<br />
<br />
Is it possible to assign a credit note (not related to any order) to a PIN which is already matched to an order ?<br />
<br />
We have to create a credit note (which is non purchase related) and assign it against an existing invoice for that BP (but this invoice is purchase order related).<br />
<br />
Our approach will be Create a normal PCR but not match it to any order. Instead add the transaction via &quot;Add Costs&quot; and then using APC, assign the PCR to the PIN .<br />
We just want to understand if there will be any issue in doing so as it is not the ideal approach.<br />
Will there be any ledger left unbalanced ?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can I ask why create credit note non purchase related if you are going to assign against  invoice purchase related? If credit note is purchase related system will allow to assign to existing PIN as long as still have balance.<br />
<br />
