<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">19th September 2002, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">We have invoices issued with a terms code that has a payment schedule attached to the terms code.  Example, the customer is expected to pay 1/2 in 30 days and 1/2 in 60 days.<br />
<br />
It appears that Baan populates table tfacr201 &quot;Receipts Table&quot; with a record for each due date this is used in a subsequent process to print a statement to customer with proper due dates.<br />
<br />
This is working in my test environment but I cannot get it to work in my live environment.  Asside from setting up the terms code with a payment schedule, are there any additional settings?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. - Joy Conner</div></div><hr />
