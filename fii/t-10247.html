<br />
In BaanIVc4,  'Maintain Invoice details accounts(tdsls6102m000)' sessions has &quot;Turnover&quot; in the &quot;Invoice Details&quot; fileds.<br />
How can I connect the dimensions as sales departments to &quot;Sales&quot; Credit Account in the &quot;Maintain Options by integration elements(tfgld4121m000)&quot; sessions?<br />
Especially what Integration options should be selected for dimensions as sales departments?<br />
<br />
Please let me know the truths.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your helping.<br />
<br />
Sincerely yours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know it is not possible to do it in BaaN 4.<br />
The same problem exists for the COGS accounts that are defined in the same session.<br />
To overcome it for the COGS you can set the integration definitions so that COGS is debited during the delivery.<br />
This it self causes a timeing problem and you must take care to invoice all deliveries before you print any financial reports.<br />

<br />
In session tfgld4126m000 for the combination Sales invoice - Revenue, you choose for credit an integrationelement which has an relation to the dimension you want. <br />
As there is no field Sales departement in the Sales Order you have to find another characteristic, e.g. take the sales representant to connect to the sales departement, or the field Area, or whatever.  <br />
