We would only do journals in this company. I have created the company and set everything up as expected. But get the error company 6 is not a finance company when i go into finance transaction processing. Please see the attached image. Help would be appreciated the board members are giving me the evil eye.<br />

<br />
Kindly check the last error message in the attached screenshot.<br />
<br />
I assume resolving Group Company parameter issues can solve your problem!!.<br />

<br />
&quot;I found my own answer... You have run tfgld0100m000 and add an entry for your financial company/logistic company in there first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which has fixed the problem nicely.<br />
<br />
On the group company parameters i set the parameter to the attached as i was getting the error when trying to setup as single finance/single logistic. What does the multiple finance/single logistic imply... am i sharing finance tables with another company?<br />
