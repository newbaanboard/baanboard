<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rijandubey</div><div class="date">27th February 2007, 10:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear,<br />
I am calculating the Outstanding Balance of a Particular BP as on 31.03.06 by using session tfacp2424m000, The Output based on Doc date is different than the output based on Fiscal Period, <br />
Again by Using Session tfacp2534m000, the outstanding as per Doc date and Fiscal Period is completely different, than the abovementioned session. Which should be considered as correct??<br />
Hope someone help me in finding the reason for such variation.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Is not correct to use the session tfacp2534m000 because that value has the last information for the partner, and as I see you want for 03/2006.<br />
<br />
Is better in that case use the session tfacp2415m000 and please compare results with tfacp2534m000.  Sometimes the value is different because tfacp2534m000 shows only invoices, advance and credits  and  could exists  assignments or payments in 03/ 2006 when the invoice is dated in a different period ( ex: 04/2006).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The report printed for tfacp2534m000 or tfacp2424m000 might difference when we choose doc date vs fiscal period. This is due to some of the transactions mignt not post to correct fiscal period if the period was closed.<br />
<br />
tfacp2415m000 will based on fiscal period and we have to ensure the amount in tfacp2415m000 same as amount in GL.</div></div><hr />
