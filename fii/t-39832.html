<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">27th July 2007, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Many of our customers are now sending me EDI 820 (Remittance Advice) for Electronic Payments.  In the past we have always just printed out this EDI and processed it manually.  That is getting to take too much time.  The raw EDI for a single 820 transaction prints out to 7 pages.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I decided to try to get the 820 to process into Baan (IVc4).  Baan is supposed to support the EDI 820 Transaction.<br />
<br />
After enabling the EDI 820 (Multi File), I started with the conversion setup.  I didnt like what I saw so I made several changes there.  I have gone through this before.<br />
<br />
After that was done, I took the mapping information and wrote a translator in my EDI Environment (TLE Enterprise).  The test translation looked ok so I gave it a shot in Baan.<br />
<br />
The import went through without any errors.  Great so far!<br />
<br />
I ran session tfcmg5101m000 (Maintain Remittance Advice Messages (Receipts)).<br />
<br />
I saw all 101 lines of the remittance.  In addition, at the bottom of the form, I could see the total amount of the remittance.  This shows that the changes I made in the conversion setup worked.  I had a full relationship between the two tables I could determine were used here.  Table tfcmg506 (Statements for Remittance Advice) and table tfcmg501 (Remittance advice messages (Receipts)).<br />
<br />
The matching status at the table level for all 101 rows was set to 1 (Conversion in Process).  The other status are 2=Converted, 3=Matching in Process and 4=Matched.<br />
<br />
In reviewing the lines, I see that I definitely need to Maintain at this level as several lines need invoice numbers fixed and transaction types added but everything I have so far is correct.<br />
<br />
This is where I am at a standstill.  I have no clue as to what sessions to run that would allow me to move forward.<br />
<br />
There is a session tfcmg5201s000 (Convert Remittance Advice Messages).  It is a sub-session and can only be run from another Main session.  However, the session tfcmg5201s000 runs library tfcmgdll5201 (Convert Remittance Advice Statements).  That library is also the object that the EDI systems 820 transaction is linked to.  That means that it has already been run by the EDI system while importing the 820.  If I need to run it again, I cannot find what main session will allow a zoom to that sub-session.<br />
<br />
I can run session tfgld1101m000 (Maintain Transactions), Create a Batch and enter periods.<br />
<br />
I can then insert a transaction type, select it and hit the Transactions button.  This starts sub session tfcmg2100s000.<br />
<br />
For the Type of Transaction field, I use Receipt by Rem. Advice.<br />
Tab to Enter Currency.  Tab to enter the customer Number fill it in.<br />
From there, I can enter the Remittance Advice field.  If I try to zoom there, I do not see anything.  However if I just enter the statement number from the Maintain session, I get the message tfcmgs9010 that says Remittance Advice has been Reconciled.  This brings me to a standstill.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that I have no where to go from here that I can find.  I still need to finish the conversion process where the status is Converted and then go on to the matching process.<br />
<br />
How do I do that?<br />
<br />
Any Help will be appreciated.<br />
