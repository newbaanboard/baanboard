<br />
We are using BaaN IVc4 with an view to moving to BaaN LN only in a few years.<br />
We are a multi-multi set-up with global operations in 13 locations in 7 countries.<br />
We are using the MCR option.<br />
<br />
We would like member input and commentary on what tools are available for consolidated budgeting and for financial consolidation reporting.<br />
We had Hyperion many years ago but never implemented. Is this still a strong option?<br />
Can we achieve both stated goals with a single tool or is there a “best of breed” approach to be considered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it would make a lot of sense to contact your account manager. If you're on maintenance you're entitled to the Infor Open SOA Framework. That technology opens up the door for new products like Advanced General Ledger and the Infor Performance Management tools for financial consolidation, planning, budgetting and forecasting.<br />
<br />
All this can be used on top of Baan IV and will 'stay alive' when you move to LN. Actually all this can run on both systems at the same time so even making a phased migration easier... So this is a future proof investment.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
