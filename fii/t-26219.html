<br />
I have a little &quot;issue&quot;:confused: <br />
<br />
One of the girls here in my office, tried to link a money receipt with an invoice. <br />
The money receipt was (example )  for 5k,  she found 3 invoices to be applied, but she only applied 4k... what should I do with the rest?<br />
<br />
Now I can't find any money left over to be applied with a CAU ...<br />
<br />
I can't adjust manually, since the accounts ( Unallocated receipts &amp; Trade receivable  ) are control accounts that should be affected by a special A/R transaction.<br />
<br />
Can any one help!??   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
