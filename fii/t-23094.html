Howz the setup done for Complimentary accounts in BaaN V? How to achieve the purpose of maintaining such accounts for some reporting requirements?<br />
<br />
Is there any way to link statutory and complimentary accounts? or shall we have to map integrations seperately and transact manually to update complimentary accounts?<br />
<br />
The basic reason for some many queries is that<br />
<br />
a) i am not able to establish link between statutory and complimentary accounts<br />
b) i am not able to transact with a complimentary account<br />
<br />
c) i am not able to define integration mapping for complimentary accounts?<br />
<br />
Am i missing some important control or parameter<br />

I have not come across the term &quot;complimentary accounts&quot; before. (when I look compliment up in dictionary it means to praise). Had you said supplementary accounts (which I have also not heard of) I would have assumed someting like &quot;another set&quot;.   <br />
<br />
I am aware of the concept of multiple sets of books (statutory vs other) where different accounting treatment may be given to things like depreciation and other amortised values, cash based versus accrual treatment of expenses and sales, cut-off periods etc, but I am not aware that baan addresses this natively (to BaanIVc).  <br />
<br />
Will be interesting to hear from the experts<br />

<br />
yes its not complimentary but complementary. regrets i stand corrected. In BaaN V you have this concept of dual accounting.  the first (statutory) for fiscal and legal requirements and the other (complementary)can be for reporting and MIS requirements.<br />
<br />
This is understood and just a spelling mistake. And I would appreciate answers from BaaN Vc experts</div></div><hr />

<br />
You create the complementary account structure the way you want to report your results and balances internally.<br />
In some countries, there is a fixed accounting structure you have to follow. If that is the case, you can use these complementary accounts.<br />
You create the link on ledger level, which is why you don't see it in the integration.<br />
You link it in the field, &quot;complementary parent&quot;<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
