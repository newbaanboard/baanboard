We have 3 different companies (all are Single/Single) and the currency is different in all 3 companies - USD, CAD and EUR.  We currently use Sales Orders and Purchase Orders and are finding it very cumbersome practice - no value added processing.<br />
What are other company structures, or how do other companies handle sales of inventory from One Company (CAD) to a Second company (EUR)?  <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel the current practice what you follows is the best practice. But if you have implemented the ILC then session will be increased while maintaining this transaction.<br />
<br />
There is another method if ILC is implemented where you can reduce your manual transaction. In the session tdilc1120m000 your can your PURCHASE and SALES combination in the source and destination company respectively. Here while creating the order inventory will also reduce and Print Sales Invoice / PO or PDSO etc steps you can reduce. <br />
<br />
Here only one problem you will have if you wanted to transfer multiple items then you have to create seperate orders for all item. You can't create one order and transfer more than 1 item.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help you.<br />
<br />
with regards,<br />
