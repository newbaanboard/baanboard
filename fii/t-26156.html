<br />
I'd like to know if there's some kind of implication swithching the field bloc in the general ledger plan (tfgld008) from blocked to manually enter to FREE.<br />
<br />
This due that wrongly we put an ammount in an account of this type and when we want to reclasify the ammount the parameter in this field doesn't allow us to do it.<br />
<br />
I did a test in development environment and it works but certainly I don't know if in the future it won't have any repercution.<br />
<br />
best regards.<br />
