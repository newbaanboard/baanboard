    Simulated Price uses a domain thats widely used in Baan (atleast in Baan4) by Price fields. The domain in question is &quot;tc pric&quot;. If you pull this up in Domains (under Application Development/Tools), you can see that it has a current format of 15,4 (15 digits before decimal and 4 digits after decimal). To customize, you would have to first copy this domain into your own customized VRC, make the necessary adjustments to the format and then run Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary for all packages and tables. <br />
<br />
As i said before, its a widely used domain and so the changes that you make here would be seen in every sessions that has a Price field. Tread carefully!!<br />

    Thanks very much!I find that this problem can be solved by changing the Formats by Generic Unit(ttaad1107m000).</div></div><hr />

    I still have a problem,The decimal digits for the price Simulated Purchase Prices can  be increased to 6.When I print the Simulated Purchase Prices,the price displays 6 decimal digits,too.However,the latest two numbers(not zeros) have been  changed into zero,as  abandon into zero. How can I solve this problem ?</div></div><hr />

   What you did in the earlier step is just to change the display format. It would have been ok had your domain (tcpric in your case) would accept 6 digits after decimal. But by default tcpric domain only accepts 4 digits after decimal. Therefore you need to change this inorder to meet your requirement.<br />

  I am not sure if there is another way of extending the 4 decimal digits to 6. :( It all comes down to how the values are stored.<br />
