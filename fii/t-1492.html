<br />
does anyknow know a program like tfgld3206m000 that does not take extremely long to run  and does not require everybody to leave finance?<br />
<br />
I need to rebuild the gl for periods 1 - 3 for the current year. I do not need to rebuild history or anything like that.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

there are two other rebuild sessions but, you can only run them for the Year.  The tfgld3206m000 session is the only one that gives you the period range, and wether you want to rebuild the Ledger, the Dimensions, or both.  No one must be in Finance while any of these sessions are running.  <br />
You are always dealing with History ( tfgld106).  What these rebuild sessions do is recalculate the Opening balances and ytd activity based on what is recorded in the tfgld106 Finalized History table. It depends on which session you run and what parameters you select but, these are the tables involved in the recalculations:<br />
<br />
tfgld201 ledger account totals <br />
tfgld202 dimension/ledger totals  <br />
tfgld203 opening balances ledger  <br />
tfgld204 open balance dimension/ledger  <br />
tfgld205 history dimension/ledger combination <br />
<br />
The tfgld106 is more or less the BIBLE of the finance module.  It is not properly indexed for these sessions to run at maximum efficiency. ( in our version c3 mcr0)<br />
The tfgld106 table is almost always a large table, and this causes the sessions to run more slowly.  Make sure you have enough space roll back segments. roll back segments being to small has caused this session to abort for me.  <br />
Hope this helps to clarify,<br />

<br />
First of all, indeed make sure that no financial transactions are made/posted. These transactions update the history tables (tfgld201+) that your rebuild session also alters. The result may lead to wrong figures that needs to be corrected ... by rebuilding!<br />
<br />
It's quite common for a number of our customers to rebuild just one or a few periods per night; thus requiring more than a week to rebuild an entire year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure what version of Baan you're using but there are some performance improvement patches that were issued for this session late last year.</div></div><hr />
