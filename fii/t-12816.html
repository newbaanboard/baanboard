<br />
Could someone give me any hints on how to solve the inbalance preventing the year close?<br />
<br />
Case history:<br />
<br />
1) When trying to close the year I got the following error message:<br />
<br />
	&quot;Total profit and loss balance is not yet zero; debits = 2901287287.692600, credits = 2901287287.682800&quot;<br />
<br />
	-&gt; DR &gt; CR by 0.0098<br />
<br />
2) I ran a &quot;home made&quot; query which indicates in which period there is an inbalance:<br />
<br />
	Period 1: CR &gt; DR by 0.0002<br />
<br />
	Period 4: DR &gt; CR by 0.01<br />
<br />
3) I corrected the inbalances by:<br />
<br />
	- running correction program otfcor9996, which rouns off amounts to the second decimal (Period 1)<br />
<br />
	- via GTM increasing the CR of the inbalanced document (which I identified by running session tfgld3410m000 &quot;Print Debit and Credit Amounts by Document&quot;<br />
<br />
4) I ran Session tfgld3203m000 &quot;Rebuild Opening Balances/History from Transactions&quot; for all periods.<br />
<br />
5) When trying to close the year I get the same error message, but with different amounts:<br />
<br />
	&quot;Total profit and loss balance is not yet zero; debits = 116355698.070000, credits 116355698.080000&quot;<br />
<br />
	-&gt; Problem 1: CR and DR amounts are completely different from the ones in the first error message. <br />
<br />
	-&gt; Problem 2: This time it is the CR which is higher than the DR <br />
<br />
	(Note that the 0.0002 inbalance has been fixed)<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />

<br />
Your first step must be to run the session tfgld3203m000 &quot;Rebuild Opening Balances/History from Transactions&quot;. <br />
<br />
With this rebuild you becomes completely sure about the real difference.<br />
<br />
Solution one:<br />
If the difference still exists search for the period. <br />
If you know the period search for the document. <br />
By GTM (tfgld106 and maybe VAT and ACR and ACP tables too) you can change the document (be sure the document becomes not out of balance)<br />
Rebuild again the totals and try to close the year again.<br />
Is it not possible for you to find the wrong period and/or document, than you can create a query which is making totals by document. Be sure that the amounts are printed with 4 or more digits behind the dot. Import this in excel and search for the not balanced documents. If you find them modify them by GTM and rebuild your totals again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Solution two (If nothing helps):<br />
By using GTM you can change a total table (tfgld200 series) for only 0, 01. <br />
You must do it for the ledger totals but of the ledger and dimension totals too. <br />
After this actions try to close the year again.<br />

<br />
Thank you for your answer. Unfortunately I think that I tried everything you suggested:<br />
<br />
Suggestion 1: If the difference still exists search for the period. <br />
If you know the period search for the document. <br />
By GTM (tfgld106 and maybe VAT and ACR and ACP tables too) you can change the document (be sure the document becomes not out of balance)<br />

Be sure that the amounts are printed with 4 or more digits behind the dot. Import this in excel and search for the not balanced documents. If you find them modify them by GTM and rebuild your totals again.<br />
<br />
Answer 1: I did retrieve the documents which are not balanced, included one with a digit after the 4th decimal.<br />
Through the correction program otfcor996 I could correct the unbalanced document with the digit after the 4th decimal and I corrected another document with an inbalance of 0.01 via GTM in table tfgld106, by increasing the Credit to 0.01. I then rebuilt all periods. Then, when I ran the session tfgld3410m000 and our &quot;home made&quot; query, no unbalanced documents was found.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestion 2: By using GTM you can change a total table (tfgld200 series) for only 0, 01. <br />
You must do it for the ledger totals but of the ledger and dimension totals too. <br />
After this actions try to close the year again.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: I tried that way as well.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<br />
If you modify a tfgld200 serie table this must effect the message while closing the year. If not you modified the wrong table and you must search for another tfgld201/2/3/4 table.<br />
<br />
If you found the correct one than have a look at the difference in the error message. Based on this difference you can calculate what the exact correction must be.<br />
<br />
Another possibility is too that the software is not up to date and isn't calculating correct. If this is the case than you need a software fix.<br />
<br />
yes, year closing isn't in all case easy.<br />

<br />
I hope I have found the solution, but I would like your opinion on this:<br />
<br />
In table tfgld201 Credit and Debit for the top parent account are balanced, however in table tfgld203 there is an opening balance of -0.01. (ledger A/C = Debit).<br />
<br />
I think that the initial inbalances are actually fixed, but that the system, after checking the balance of CR and DR of finalized transactions, adds the opening balance to the balance of finalized transactions occurring during the year.<br />
<br />
At present when trying to close the year the system tells me that DR &lt; CR by 0.01. So what if I change the opening balance of -0.01 to 0? <br />
<br />
My guess is that it would solve the problem, but hopefully it won't screw up the system elsewhere.<br />
<br />
What do you think of this?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />
Erik</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can always test this and see what happens.<br />
<br />
If the error message is changing you know that you are working at the correct table.<br />
<br />
Is this balance for the year to be closed or for the next year?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erik Konrath</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">It is the balance of the year to be closed. note that the opening balance of the next year is also out by 0.01.<br />
<br />
I'm going to try it and I'll let you know.<br />

Unfortunately my last attempt to solve the problem failed miserably again...frustration is rising...<br />
<br />
I am quite sure that the problem lies with the opening balance, but I still have to find a way of fixing it...<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<br />
Bad answer!<br />
<br />
I do not have another id√©e how to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
A suggestion can be that I have a closer look into the system and based on that analyses maybe I can advise a corrective action.<br />
<br />
Thats my latest suggestion.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Problem is solved!<br />
<br />
Basically I hadn't read the error messages properly...<br />
<br />
The firts message was &quot;Total debit/credit not in balance....&quot;<br />
<br />
After I had made the corrections in tfgld106 to the unbalanced document, the second message was:<br />
<br />
&quot;Total profit and loss balance is not yet zero...&quot;<br />
<br />
What happened is that by solving the balance problem I created another problem in the P&amp;L, because instead of increasing a Balance sheet ledger account by 0.01, I increased a P&amp;L ledger account!<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway for your time.<br />
<br />
Bedankt,<br />
