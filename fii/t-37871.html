<br />
In tffbs1101m000 'Budget amounts and quantities by period' I want to simply input manually a budget for each period by account / dimension code. When I try to Insert a 'New' budget against a ledger / dimension code I get the message 'Budget Amount per year are not defined cannot add.'<br />
<br />
I do not want to define a total budget for the year and spread using any factors I simply want to manually input the budget each period.'<br />
<br />
Has anyone got a business process / procedure for adding budgets by account / dimension code (more than one dimension type by ledger account) for each period in Baan 5.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

i checked in our System. I think you have to define a record for year. This one can have a value of 0.0.<br />
Try the following:<br />
In budgets per year (tffbs0505m000/tffbs0105s000) insert a record for the Year/budget combination and leave the field budget distribution empty.<br />
Afterwards insert a record in Budget Amounts and Quantities per Year (tffbs1500m000) for your desired ledger account/dimension combination (amount 0.0).<br />
From there you can start session Budget Amounts and Quantities per Period where you can insert your values per period.<br />
The values are automaticly accumulated in tffbs1500m000.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
Its going to take many hours to input the budget this way but if I use pre-defined spreading factors it may cut down on the time taken. <br />
<br />
I wonder if there is a way to upload budgets from a spreadsheet as I will have multiple budgets for budgets and re-forecasts etc.</div></div><hr />
