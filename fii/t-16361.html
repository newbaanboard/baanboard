<br />
Is there a way to create a cash invoice so that the entry would be ....<br />
<br />
Dr.. Cash<br />
Cr.. Revenue<br />
<br />
if it is not possible to do so, is there a way to make a job for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other option is to create a customer Cash with its own FCG that has a link to a Cash account ( problem is you will not be able to use the account for JVs directly since it becomes a control account) but then you can use the invoice control and still be able to print this cash invoice.<br />
<br />
I don't think jobs can be created.<br />

thanks for answering<br />
<br />
Using the first method assumes I'll use  the transactions to just book the entry, but we need to use the centeral invoicing to creat an invoice which is paid at the same time of purchase.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
