<br />
After Post Integration transaction to finance, Some of the data still in the table tfgld416 [Un Posted Integration Transaction]. Why it is happened. <br />
<br />
We have two correction programs to list out the unposted transaction and to delete the posted transaction from the table tfgld416.<br />
<br />
                      1. otfcor0615<br />
                      2. otfcor0213<br />
<br />
But what could be the reasons of those data in the table tfgld416.<br />
<br />
If I run the correction program 2, sometime it is not deleting the records. Why becuase, the integration batches against the correspoding records should be finalized, then only its getting deleted. I also attached a file which is the output of the correction program 2. Pls see the attachment and explain me what the remarks column tells.<br />
<br />
Pls clarify<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />
