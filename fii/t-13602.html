This error message is generated when the program which is posting the integration transaction found already record in table tfacp200. The record in tfacp200 must fulfill the following criteria, the field tfacp200.ttyp must equal the field tfgld410.ttyp and the field tfacp200.ninv must be equal to the field tfgld410.docn.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
The error message was generated for a sales order (sales invoice) transaction. So, as per your reply, I checked the tfacr200 and tfgld410 tables.<br />
<br />
The sales invoice transaction type document that got stuck appears in both the tfgld410 and tfacr200 tables. <br />
Should I check this for all the document lines?<br />
<br />
How should I proceed?<br />

For this kind of error message you need to run program otdcor0341, which will delete duplicate integration booking from tfacr200 table.<br />
cheers!!<br />

There is invoice in acr200 alredy fully paid and in gld410 invoice with the same document number unposted (err).<br />
What would you advise ? I think that only one way is to set up Not for Finance, otherwise we are not able to close year.<br />
<br />
thanks for any advice</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this problematic invoice in 410 is not a new invoice but the same old one that was posted ok to finance (tfacr200 + tfgld106), and it is stuck only in integration tables you can do it.<br />
<br />
You can change the status of relevant records in tfgld418 to not for finance or posted.<br />
You also have to check and maybe delete relevant records from tfgld415, tfgld416.<br />
