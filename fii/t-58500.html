The problem is that now I get two different transactios, using a Provisional account in the Sales Invoice Transaction, and cancelling it on the on the mapping scheme and assigning the final sales account.  :eek: In Baan IV, the same, but everything under the sales invoice transaction.  I´ve tried to assign the final sales account per Item group on the debit and credit sides on the mapping scheme, so I can have it in the sales invoice transactions, but the system doesn´t record the proper details to assign it correctly.  This is a problem for the official Audit.  I can see a sales invoice document, but it is not possible to see the final sales account in this document.<br />
Any idea?<br />
Thanks in advance.:(</div></div><hr />

If in Baan IV the setting can separated only by customer group, Item groups, and Items. <br />
but the setting only once time untill to tocreated the new groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnbhatt</div><div class="date">30th June 2010, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">it is a standard design of Ln integration where debit ledger a/c defined for IDT sales order / revenue analysis is getting credited while posting sales invoice. For Audit a report may be developed from tdsls401 or tdsls406 to establish link with sales order revenue transaction and sales invoice.</div></div><hr />
