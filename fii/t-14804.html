<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jochen</div><div class="date">15th March 2004, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">We are working with BaanERP 5.0c and have got a problem when using integration periods. Actually we thought that when closing the period in tfgld0107m000 it would mean no integrations would go into this GLD period. Example: We had closed current period for integrations but had the GLD period open. After having run the program &quot;Post integration postings to Finance Transactions&quot; a vast amount of postings went into the actual GLD period rather than into the next open GLD period. In addition to that the Integration Parameter had been set to allow postings into the next period. Can anyone let me know if that is a bug or if I am missing something here.<br />

<br />
Please find attached the solution text from Baan Support on how to use the periods in integration:<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
tfgld4150m000, Integration Parameters<br />
<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
This solution is to clarify how the integration parameter &quot;Posting to Next Open Period Allowed&quot; functions for fiscal and reporting periods. The parameter does not affect tax periods.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The parameter only relates to the fiscal and reporting periods because the tax period is not present in the integration tables. The tax period is not present in integrations because integration transaction do not have any tax implications. The system uses this parameter at the time the records are inserted into the integration tables. At this time, the system will look at the INT module of the fiscal and reporting period that coincides with the transaction date. If the INT module is closed, and the parameter setting &quot;&quot;Posting to Next Open Period Allowed&quot; is checked, the system will look at the next fiscal and reporting period. If the next period is open, the integration tables will be filled with that fiscal and reporting period. <br />
<br />
If the parameter setting, &quot;Posting to Next Open Period Allowed&quot; is not checked, and INT module is closed, the system will not allow the process to occur and will give the user a message, &quot;Fiscal year XXXX, period X not open in company XXX.&quot; The process will not be allowed.<br />
<br />
When you post integrations, the system does not look at the integration period to see if it is open, it looks at the GLD period. The integration period is only looked at when the integration tables are being filled.<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE(S):<br />
<br />
The user has maintained receipts on a purchase order and it should have gone to fiscal and reporting period 5, but the INT module of period 5 is closed, so the integration table will update with fiscal period 6. Before you post the transaction, the fiscal and reporting periods are already present in integrations. Now, you go to post the transaction to the General Ledger. Upon posting to the General Ledger, the system will use the fiscal and reporting period 6 because they have already been inserted in the integration tables at the time of receipt. However, it will look at the transaction date to determine the tax period. Since tax period 5 in the GLD module was open, the system posted to period 5. When you post integrations, the system does not look at the integration period to see if it is open, it looks at the GLD period. The integration period is only looked at when the integration tables are being filled.</div></div><hr />
