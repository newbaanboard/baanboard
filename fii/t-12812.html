<br />
We have local sales in  our organisation for catering to the local market. Most of them in such case are through a One-time customer code, otherwise we would land-up with lot of records in the Customer master. While the goods are delivered, if the customer pays money it is accounted as unallocated receipts in Cash management, since the invoice is not available till the Sales orders are fully processed and Integration to finance is done (mostly done during the night). Hence in the one-time customer account, at any given time, has a lot of unallocated receipts which have to be allocated on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
Since each of the receipts are for a particular sales order invoice, it needs lot of maunal intervention and is time consuming in reconciling this one-time customer account.<br />
<br />
Is there a process in Baan to allocate receipts to a Sales order (or invoice) without much of manual intervention.<br />
<br />
As a consultant, I do not find a way out other than for the users to go a manually allocate the unallocated receipts in the one-time customer on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if there is a way out in Baan to take care of such point-of-sales transactions. Since inventory and stock is involved, the financial records have to come through from the distribution module.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.....<br />

<br />
How do you get the list of to-be-allocated receipts?  If it is in electronic format, you might want to create a session where you read this file, and, by using the aplication fuction server (AFS (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=59)), allocate them to the correct receipts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The unallocated receipts are entered in Baan session as Baan is available at the point of sale. The receipt is also printed from Baan and given to customer. This is done through the cash management sessions.<br />
<br />
But the problem is we have to input this as unallocated receipt and not against a sales invoice at the time of receiving money from the customer.<br />
<br />
Hope this is clear.<br />

<br />
Hi jmathew,<br />
<br />
There are several solutions to solve your problem:<br />
<br />
The first solution is that you change the procedure around booking the cash transactions into baan. You can think about waiting one day and after that day the invoices are arrived during the night jobs into finance. The booking can be done easily without the use of an unallocated receipt.<br />
<br />
Another possibility is that you are using the cmg direct debit module within the cmg module.<br />
With this module you are able to select all open invoices and unallocated receipts. <br />
The balance of the selected invoices and unallocated receipts must be zero. <br />
You can maintain that with session tfcmg4501m000 Direct Debit Advise.<br />
After processing and posting the results you must create a batch with cash transaction type. In this batch you are able to reconcile the direct debit batch. <br />
<br />
The result of this transaction is that all invoices and all unallocated receipts are booked off individually. The process takes a few minutes and can be done weekly, monthly or quarterly. In all cases the process costs a few minutes.<br />
The largest problem is a correct setup of the direct debit module. You must have experience with it but it is possible too that you first try it in a test environment and if you have success you can work it out in the life system. (In all cases, first do a test in a test system).<br />
<br />
If you have questions please ask me.<br />

Reply<br />
<br />
The above paragraph in your reply says that Open invoices and unallocated receipts can be selected. I tried that and we could only select Sales invoices or Credit notes and not unallocated receipts. At the time of receipt of money we do not have the Sales invoice, hence an allocation is required later.<br />
<br />
You have mentioned about session tfcmg4501m000 which is a display session and nothing can be maintained in this session. Hence, your solution does not seem to be true.<br />
<br />
Could you please clarify the above points...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaap Roos</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">In the attached word document you can see a screenprint of session tfcmg4120s000. I'm using baan Vc and therefore I think that the session code differs a little bit.<br />
<br />
In that screenprint you can see that the following documents can be selected:<br />
1 Purchase Invoices<br />
2 Purchase Credit Note<br />
3 Sales Invoices<br />
4 Sales Credit Note<br />
5 Advance Receipts<br />
6 Unallocated Receipt<br />
<br />
Based on these selection criterion I decided that the system automatically can select all of these documents.<br />
<br />
It is important that the cmg parameters are setted correct.<br />
<br />
It is important too that the selection criterion are setted correct too.<br />
<br />
I didn't do a test but now I will with it.<br />
<br />
This is currently the information I can give.<br />

Maybe I can give you more information after my test.<br />

<br />
The session tfcmg4120m000 is to define the Direct Debits. Here if we first input sales invoice and amount and for the same if we input unallocated receipt it amounts to double receipt, which is not correct.<br />
<br />
In this session, we either input sales invoice if it exist or else we input unallocated receipts when sales invoice is still not created in the system.<br />
<br />
I hope you understand me....<br />

<br />
The result of my test is that the system automatically picks up sales invoices but no unallocated receipts.<br />
<br />
If you will use the direct debits procedure, you must manually add the unallocated receipts in the direct debit batch.<br />
<br />
You wrote:<br />

Answer:<br />
You must select the sales invoices automatically with session: &quot;Select Invoices for direct debit&quot; and you must manually add the unallocated receipts. You do have the idée that both amounts are equal but the type of document make that the invoice is positive and the unallocated receipt is negative.<br />
<br />
You Wrote:<br />

Answer:<br />
You can do this actions ones a week or month. You must do this when the sales invoices and unallocated receipts are finalized in the Finance module.<br />

<br />
If sales invoice already exist we do not have any problem since the receipts of money could be done against the sales invoice. The problem we are facing is when sales invoice does not exist and hence recording the same as unallocated receipt. <br />
<br />
If we record sales invoice and unallocated receipt in CMG module, both amounts to receipt of money from customer. In this case the sales invoice will not have any outstanding balance but the unallocated receipt will still have an outstanding (negative) balance in customer open entries and we will not have be able to allocate this to any invoices, as the sale invoice is already received in the CMG module. <br />
<br />
Please try this in Baan....I have tried the same and the above is my findings....<br />
<br />

John.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since we receive the money from customer and same is to be deposited to bank it has to be accounted in the system. At the point-of-sales customers keep coming and paying in cash for the sales which if not accounted in Baan can be manipulated. We even have the cash receipt from Baan itself so the person receiving the money at the end of the day has to deposit the money and not keep it with him/her. <br />
<br />
I hope it is clear....<br />

<br />
No, currently it becomes less clearer to me.<br />
<br />
Can you write down the exact steps of the procedure?<br />
For example:<br />
1) Customer is ordering<br />
2) Order is delivered<br />
3) Customer gets an invoice<br />
4) Customer is paying<br />
5) Payment is booked in Baan as unallocated payment<br />
<br />
Maybe that will help something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmathew</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 14:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jaap,<br />
<br />
The following is the complete process;<br />
<br />
1) Sales order created when one-time customer orders as <br />
     a collect order hence the inventory is also reduced<br />
2) Cash is paid by customer which is recorded in CMG module<br />
     as unallocated receipt and receipt is printed and given to <br />
     customer.<br />
3) Print Sales invoice (not required by customer) but mandatory<br />
    in Baan.<br />
4) Process delivered sales orders (run as over-night job)<br />
5) Post Integration to finance (run as over-nigh job)<br />
6) Next day sales invoice is available to finance user<br />
7) Allocates all unallocated receipts created in step (2) to the <br />
    sales invoices created after step (5) for the one-time<br />
    customer.<br />
<br />
The above is the procedure. Our problem is that the step (7) is consuming lot of time as the allocation is to be done to the right invoices. We would like to automise this activity to an extent that is logical and possible so that we do not complicate the system and also make the life of the user easier.<br />
<br />
Hope the above process is clear.<br />

<br />
Am I correct in assuming that ALL unallocated receipts of one day have to be matched the following day?  If so, you could write an EasySQL query to do the job for you, and run it as the last step in the night-batch.<br />
<br />
For the query, use a parameter table as the input, and simply select the sequence number from this table.  Then, generate the report, and edit the report script.  Add the sections &quot;declaration:&quot; with the tables to be updated, and a section &quot;after.receive.data:&quot;.  In this last section, issue all the necessary database updates to the tables.  Selecting a parameter table as the &quot;driver&quot; for the report will ensure that you receive only one record, and hence the &quot;after.receive.data:&quot; is executed only once.<br />
<br />
Ok, sounds easy, doesn't it?  But which queries?  Well, thats possible in two ways:<br />
<br />
1. Trace the database actions during a manual allocation, and copy all the update queries.  You will probably have to follow the exact sequence, with all necessary reading of other tables as well.<br />
2. In the &quot;after.receive.data:&quot; section, start using the AFS (application function server) to feed the correct session with the actions you want to perform.  There is a seperate forum on the AFS for details if you need them.  <br />
<br />
As for the matching process itself, select all unallocated receipts for the &quot;dummy&quot; customer, and process them one-by-one, like you are doing manually as well.  If you need help with the development, send me a PM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaap Roos</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Possible workaround:<br />
<br />
Hi John,<br />
<br />
Maybe this is possible workaround for you:<br />
Instead of booking an unallocated receipt, book with a cash transaction type a journal entry for each receipt. Important is that you describe the journal entry carefully (for example date, sales order and customer name). <br />
<br />
During step 7 you create a reversal journal entry (in cash transaction type) and book off each sales invoice during a normal sales invoice procedure. The reversal journal entry is equal with the total received invoices from the past day.<br />
<br />
What do you think about that?<br />
<br />
With Regards,<br />
Jaap</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have the similar case, our version is V C<br />
<br />
&quot;We have local sales in our organisation for catering to the local market ...&quot;. &quot; Since each of the receipts are for a particular sales order invoice, ...Is there a process in Baan to allocate receipts to a Sales order (or invoice) without much of manual intervention.&quot;<br />
<br />
We do the next:<br />
<br />
1) In session tfgld1101m000 we use a TT (tfcmg2130s000 and tfcmg2105s000)<br />
<br />
2) In session tfcmg2130s000 select the unallocated receipt and by &quot;specific&quot; Assig Advance...&quot;<br />
<br />
3) In session tfcmg2105s000 by &quot;specific&quot;  select &quot;Assign Advance/Unallocated... Based on Aging&quot;<br />
<br />
4) In session tfcmg2109s000 we select special criterion or considerations, like :<br />
&quot;Transaction Type or Documents or Documents Date or Due Date&quot;<br />
