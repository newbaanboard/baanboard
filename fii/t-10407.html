<br />
There are two reports for customer ageing <br />
<br />
1. Print Customer ageing summary - tfgld2411m000<br />
2. Print Ageing analysis by Customer - tfgld2420m000<br />
<br />
Problem is we get different balances when we run these reports for the same set of parameters.<br />
<br />
Any clues?<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you would like any further info. We are on Baan IV C4 Sp 10.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is not the case maybe you need to see if there are any later patches for the sessions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no option for Include Cost Invoices (or anything similar). I also checked the Baan support site and there is no correction patch.<br />
<br />
Included is the snap shot of the screen.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

SOL 104943, Peter Plooij, 2000-09-06<br />
The sessions tfacp1450m000 and tfacp2421m000 don't print cost invoices if the selection field &quot;Invoices to be printed&quot; is set to &quot;Registered&quot;, &quot;Reg./Matched&quot;, &quot;Matched&quot;, &quot;Approved&quot;. This is different from the sessions tfacp2420m000 and tfacp2424m000. In the aging analysis (tfacp2420m000) the cost invoices should always be included, therefore in order to keep the functionality the same in all sessions, cost invoices have to included for the above selections.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I can suggest is that you compare each customers balance and see which ones are different and then investigate each document to see where the problem could be.</div></div><hr />
