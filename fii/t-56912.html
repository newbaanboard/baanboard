Trying to write a session for finance and they are requesting that one of the fields in the table be the date that the invoice was paid in full.  Anyone know if this exists somewhere in LN 6.1?  This is for a sales or MSO invoice.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">9th October 2009, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">there is no field called 'paid in full' date. But you will be able to derive that information from tfacr200 (open entries). Pick the last receipt recorded against the invoice and look at the date</div></div><hr />
