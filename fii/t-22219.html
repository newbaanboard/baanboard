<br />
I am asking about the late payment surcharge and how is it calculated in Baan V.0c.<br />
<br />
I found that its calculation is based on the document date not the due date :confused: <br />
<br />
help appreciated</div></div><hr />

i had the the same results when i tested the late payment surcharge some months ago.<br />
Had a discussion with support about that. They told me that this is standard functionality :confused: and they implemented it as a special requirement for the dutch market  :confused:  :confused:  :confused: .<br />
This is how it works:<br />
The late payment surcharge is calculated and is shown on the invoice independently from the due date.<br />
Suppose you have invoice of 100 and surcharge of 5% after 30 days the invoice shows a sum of 105. Very clear for Customer :eek: .<br />
When you are booking payment in tfacr then the surcharge is booked back if the payment is done before the 30 days.<br />
So all transactions are correct and with a little customization on the invoice report you should be able to use this functionality.<br />
Nevertheless we decided not to use it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
