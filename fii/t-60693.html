<br />
  I ve issue in my finance maodule. I have a situation where one ANP document is assigned to 2 diff checque.  I mean to say Ex. ANP11030122 assigned to cheque no 202213 and 202214. <br />
<br />
 My finance user rejected one cheque using reset payment. but he is paid the amount through someother means. <br />
<br />
  My worry is i need to delete That perticular ANP . Which is allready finalized. Can you suggest me the GTM changes i need to make inorder to delete ANP 11030122. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
