<br />
I have recently disposed of an asset and everything went well except for that the asset still shows a net book value in the FA register. Can anyone please tell me what I have done wrong and if you need more info?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">henk21</div><div class="date">13th April 2007, 05:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I spoke to a consultant and we came to the conclusion that the report we printed, tffam8477m000, was infact incorrect. We checked the posting to the GL and checked that the asset was disposed in the asset register, which it was and we ran depreciation and saw that no depreciation was added to this asset. He told me that it must be the report that is broken. We will now try and figure out how.<br />

Thanks a lot for your reply.<br />
