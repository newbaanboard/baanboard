    We are working in Baan IVC4 single logistics and multi finance environment .We are deducting some amount from certain employees thru certain set of ledger accounts for which Opening Balance /Debit entries are done in Head Office Company.<br />
<br />
But in day to day transaction credits are done thru individual companies as required.<br />
<br />
Eg.<br />
001 Company    <br />
Axxxxxxx Dr <br />
Byyyyyyy Cr.<br />
<br />
002 Company<br />
<br />
Axxxxxxx Dr <br />
Byyyyyyy Cr.<br />
<br />
I want to transfer these deductions from different companies to Head Office in the same set of ledger accounts maintained at Head Office.<br />
<br />
100 Company<br />
Axxxxxxx Dr <br />
Byyyyyyy Cr.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there any way by which we can achieve this automatically? Kindly detailed me assuming me as novice in Baan IV C4 Finance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

I think that it can help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felipe_Saavedra</div><div class="date">9th December 2005, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option is a customized session that will read from your 001, 002 companies and create the records into 100.<br />
<br />
The session will need to create a batch number and then post the vouchers, then you will post and finalize the batch into 100.<br />
<br />
I had written that application before, if you need more info, just send me an email.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

   I need to do this as we are making Balance Sheet from one company from various other companies by transfering the amounts,In this perticular case as the dimension 2 is mandatory so extreamly time consuming approx 1000 enteries per companies monthly.<br />
<br />
I can not use Intercompany Transaction as instructed by earlier consultant.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felipe_Saavedra</div><div class="date">23rd December 2005, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">a)	use a standard functionality JVIMPRT Exchange provided by Baan.<br />
<br />
Using Excahnge export or your own programs create the 4 files required by JVIMPRT to load the information, (the last file contains text may not be required)<br />
<br />
Export the info from company WWW and then load it with The Exchange Import in company YYY.<br />
<br />
Attached you will find a document that I wrote like 2 years ago, Sorry it is in Spanish but the screen shots will give you the idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
b)	Order a customized session that will do the following:<br />
<br />
This will be a customization that you could create or order someone to develop for you.<br />
<br />
This will populate records in 3 new processing tables  from company WWW into company YYY.<br />
<br />
Use the new tables create the transactions in GL and report error at document label regarding GL accounts, and Dimension or not balanced document.<br />
<br />
This new session will simulate that you are typing the info manually and use the same Baan logic.<br />
<br />
<br />
