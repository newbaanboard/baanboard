<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">30th September 2005, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello I have this query from our finance people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it possible to main two Bank accounts within the BaaN Cash Management System. When our system was originally set-up it was explained that we could only maintain one.<br />
<br />
We would like to maintain both a sterling and euro bank account within our system. The euro account would be used for both for Debtor receipts<br />
and Creditor payments although the majority of the  euro creditor  payments would still be paid out of the sterling bank account, therefore we would need the flexibility of paying out of either account. This I think we could maintain by  a journal transactions to the appropriate accounts if sterling values were allowed to the euro account !<br />
<br />
The debtor receipt would  be allocated by setting up a new transaction code which would debit the Anticipated Debtors Account  and Credit the Sales Ledger Control Account. Before we could allocate the payment we need the transaction  as a credit in the Anticipated Debtors and as a debit in the<br />
Euro  Bank Account, back to my original question can this be maintain in a second bank account in the Cash Management System.<br />
<br />
We have found that the euro self bill procedure produces an invoice in the debtors account  so all we need to do is to reconcile the  euro payment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Can anybody assist ?<br />
<br />

Each must be pre-designated by a transaction type and a contra GL account that's all. This should be fairly simple and easy. For each bank and payment method you can define posting data and other related data. I don't foresee any big issue on this.<br />
<br />
We are having more than 9 accounts in our set-up like <br />
Hsbc sgd acct<br />
Hsbc usd acct<br />
Citi sgd acct<br />
Citi usd acct etc...</div></div><hr />
