If it is wrong use this.<br />
Correction programs for Supplier/Customer Invoice Balances:<br />
<br />
The correction programs can only be run from the Baan Main Menu thru File/Run Program option.  <br />
Type in    otfcor0261   to correct Customer Invoice Balances.    <br />
Type in  otfcor0260 for Supplier Invoice Balances.  <br />
The sessions run in ASCII .   You can run for one or for a range.  Answer YES to the 'Print Only ' field if you want to verify the changes before Baan actually modifies the tables!  This works if you are recalculating only a few or one at a time.  <br />
<br />
BE Careful!!!!  The only way to exit without processing is to recalculate for one or to click the x at the top right.<br />

First of all, I don't think we have that session, we are using BaaN 4c4. To answer your question, in the Display Sales Invoices screen it shows that there is an outstanding invoice with 3000 balance.  But on the Display Customers session, it is showing 0 on the Invoice Balance.<br />
<br />
Thank You!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We run Baan4c3 and the session is there.  It's just not on the menu structure.<br />
<br />
Do This:<br />
<br />
At Baan Main Menu  click the File pull down menu at the top left.<br />
select  Run Program<br />
You will get a screen asking for the program name and program argument.<br />
type in the customer correction program and leave the argument blank.  click continue.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

As far as I know..  clicking the X exits the screen and does not run the correction program.<br />

Do you know beside the session you mentioned above, what other ways can update table tccom011 (Maintain Customer Balance By Company?)<br />
<br />
ss</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 21:31</div></div><div class="posttext">It can be answered by going into the tools folder from the baan menu.<br />
Navigation path is<br />
baan main/ Baan IV tools/ Application Customization/ Domains and Tables/ Reports/ Print Where used Tables.  This session will give you a report where the tccom011 table is used throughout baan application.  fill in the screen with the table name and filed name (buin = invoice bal).<br />
The report will take a long time to finish as it really does look through all baan sessions to see where the table is used.  It is quite helpful when you really want to know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 22:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a hard copy document headed &quot;Correction Programs FINANCE&quot;. The descriptions are sketchy and I don't know if it was an official Baan document (or if it came from one). It looks like something that Baan would have produced but it doesn't have a header/footer, logo or document name. <br />
<br />
I received it several years ago. Unfortunately, I can't find the soft copy, so I've retyped what it says about the supplier and customer balance correction programs:<br />
<br />
tfcor260	Correction tfacp200/tccom020<br />
<br />
This program reads the open item table and recalculates the balance amount (tccom020.buin) for the open item table and the total invoice balance in the supplier table<br />
<br />
Tables which are updated:	<br />
 tccom020	Suppliers<br />
 tfacp200	Open Items (Purchase Invoices &amp; Receipts)<br />
<br />
tfcor261	Correction tfacr200/tccom010<br />
<br />
This program reads the open item table and recalculates the balance amount (tccom010.buin) for the open item table and the total invoice balance in the customer table<br />
<br />
Tables which are updated:<br />
 tccom010	Customers<br />
 tfacr200	Open Items (Sales Invoices &amp; Receipts)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. (Just remember it is from an OLD document without pedigree.)<br />

<br />
It is very easy to use the sessions in 4c4.  For both customers and suppliers, the recalculate sessions appear under the Open Entries - Maintenance folders for their respective modules.<br />
<br />
These are easier to work with than the ASCI formats from earlier BaaN versions.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Linda</div></div><hr />
