<br />
All of you are really very Helpful. Your help is needed again for the following integration problem. <br />
<br />
When the goods are received in Stores and receipts are created, Baan Debits Stock A/C and credit Invoice to be received A/C.<br />
<br />
In finance, at the time of creation of Purchase Journal Voucer(PJV), Invoice Received A/C is debited and Supplier A/C is credited. And when we do matching, Invoice to be Received A/C is debited and Invoice Received A/C is credited.<br />
<br />
But here in few cases, instead of debiting Invoice to be recieved A/C, Baan is debiting Stock A/C, and as a result finance Stock inflates.<br />
<br />
Can any body help on this matter and tell why this is happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

Same problem we faced in my office for 3-4 entries. What we did was simple modified the same at the GTM, instead of deleting and posting again. <br />

<br />
bye</div></div><hr />
