<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rosanne</div><div class="date">5th November 2004, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a process in Baan 5C that allows you to register invoices. After all information is entered into the invoice entry screen, we would try to match the lines of the receipts to the invoice. If there is an error in matching (usually on quantity or price), we would leave the invoice in a registered status for later approval after the quantity or price differences were corrected. This saves time because we do not have to reenter the information again in invoice entry.<br />
<br />
We tried this process for several months in 2003, but found difficulties in clearing some of the registered invoices. We implemented Baan in 2003. We discontinued using this process because of the difficulties we encountered.<br />
<br />
If anyone using the registration process who is using Baan 5c?<br />
Has anyone else encountered any problems with this process and how did you solve the problems?</div></div><hr />
