<br />
As part of being aquired my another company, we must start reporting with a clean slate.  That is, are balance sheet accounts and profit and loss accounts must be put to zero for the first period that are aquisition becomes finalized.  Thus, if we become aquired in P3 how do we not show the P1 and P2 balances?  <br />
<br />
The only way that I know of to accomodate this task is to do a year-end close.  This will zero out the P &amp; L accounts and bring forward the balance sheet accounts to the opening balance table.  However, if we are &quot;Fiscal&quot; year &quot;2004&quot; how do we do another year-end and still be in a fiscal year of 2004?<br />
<br />
Other options would be to just subtract out period one and period two from all financial reports going forward.  We could customize the trial balance in some way so that these two periods don't show up.  But, I think the year end close would get us what we need but how do you do it in midyear so that the new year is still 2004?<br />
<br />
Any feedback is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Are you sure that you have to clear also the ballance sheet accounts ????<br />
<br />
It does not make sense to have a company that have no assets or liabilities !!! ???<br />
<br />
If you have to clear only the P&amp;L accounts then the regular tfgld6202 will do the job.<br />
It is usually ran on close year but there is really no reason why not to run it in the middle of the year !!!<br />
It does not change any tables / fields that are connected to close year issues.<br />
This way you can continue to work on the current year.<br />
<br />

<br />
If you run the &quot;Automatic Balancing of Profit and Loss Accounts&quot; this will only create the batch for the retained earnings amount (which I am assuming would be in the current year).  You would still have all of the balance sheet accounts still showing with activity for the current year.  Everything before the aquisition needs to be seperated out, i.e., become the opening balance when the aquisition is done.  Even if we only ran this session and did the year-end close at the end of the year, everything for 2004 would be commingled together.<br />
<br />
I think  t.leijdens may have the only option since everything needs to be seperated.  Trying to substract out the balance sheet account information for periods one and two everytime you printed a trial balance would be a nightmare. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback everybody.<br />
