<br />
Is it possible to maintain one single MAUC by item/company in Baan ERP 5.0c ? <br />
All I know is Baan ERP 5.0c maintain the MAUC by item/Warehouse.<br />
<br />
I have asked some colleagues about how other ERP's maintain the moving average price. They said that it's possible to maintain the moving average price by item/company or by item/warehouse, depends on setting parameters.<br />
<br />
I need your opinions.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lakmisoftware</div><div class="date">21st October 2005, 07:46</div></div><div class="posttext">For MAUC BaaN supports only Item / Warehouse combination. I.e. Item XX can have two different MAUC in two different warehouses. <br />
<br />
When integrating into finance, its posted with different MAUC based on the item / warehouse combination if your inventory valuation method is MAUC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not how our 5.0c SP7 behaves. It simply uses single MAUC value per item code per company and uses that for integration. Did they change the feature on SP8+ ? It does make more sense to have MAUC per warehouse in companies which is geographically dispersed in large country with each warehouse supplied by different supplier (for geographical reason), but that would make tracing back integration transactions a lot harder. Honestly, people can go so far as to calculate MAUC per supplier lot, but then at one point, the advantage of MAUC system disappears. MAUC assumes that when issuing goods from warehouse, people don't really know which exact shipment that particular unit came from (and what price). By using MAUC and simply averaging the cost of the good before being issued, the accounting of inventory can be somewhat simplified<br />

<br />
I do not understand your comment; but I can assure you we have never had MAUC per company. MAUC was (and is) always calculated and registered per warehouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">21st October 2005, 08:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, probably because we always transact certain item only in certain warehouse (like finished goods only transacted from finished goods warehouse) that we don't observe this. Man, this is a big revelation. Probably why the accountants are complaining (because they were explained the wrong thing by the consultant) about how hard it is for them to trace inventory transactions in accounting. Ouch. Better tell them and see whether it helps them<br />

I have used MAUC 5.0c SP14+ its based on item / warehouse combination. This method was very helpful in one of my previous site, where they have different transfer price or purchase price for the same item in different WHs (located in various regions). In logistic MAUC prices can be viewed against each item and WH. I dont know the exact session (not in front of the system now). <br />
<br />
Moreover in the later SP some more bugs like (when returning material against service order / sales order, baan was picking up standard cost) got fixed in the MAUC. One more bug BaaN didnt fixed is, using wrong MAUC price for inventory valuation report when we run the report for previous days. E.g. If you run the inventory valuation report as of last month or previous date it will produce you with wrong values.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure what 'bug' you are referring to. When transactions are backdated to a period for which you later re-run the inventory value, then indeed the value will be different.<br />
<br />
If that is that what you mean, then it is not a bug. If you are referring to something else, please log a case at SSA Onepoint Support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lakmisoftware</div><div class="date">21st October 2005, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I am not talking about back dated transaction. <br />
<br />
Will send this bug to baan when I go for next implementation project.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your comments. <br />
I think I have to discussed it with our external auditor whether MAUC per item/WH is acceptable for GAAP standard. <br />
Currently we maintain some warehouses which have scouple of same items.<br />
FYI, some other ERPs like SAP and Axapta have options to maintain the MAUC per item/company or per item/WH.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hi Lakmi Software, Are you in 5.0c SP14+ now? Is that ok (you got no bugs in it)?<br />
You mentioned that later SP has some more bugs. Do you reffer to SP 17?<br />
Can you suggest me what SP (plus solutions?) that I have to install to get a stable system?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />
Handy</div></div><hr />

I used 5.0c with SP14 plus last year for moving average in two locations. I dont know the exact solution or SP number that was involved in fixing the below mentioned issue. But this issue was fixed.<br />
<br />
When returning material against service order / sales order, baan was picking up standard cost<br />
<br />
The only problem I had with MAUC at that time was showing wrong closing valuation, if I go back and print the closing inventory valuation report. (Note that no back dating transaction was allowed in our system through customization.)</div></div><hr />
