<br />
Is there a way for us to know, who (which user id) print the sales invoice for a specific sales order number?<br />
<br />
At my company, the process for Print Sales Invoice is done by logistic people. Now, our finance people need to know who print the sales invoice because sometime, the SO status is deleting line, the invoice transaction is integrated to finance, but the hard copy for the invoice is not delivered to finance dept.<br />
<br />
In User History, we can only know, who log in to Print Sales Invoice session but we can't find out which order that he/she printed at that time.<br />
<br />
The user id that Baan captured in document history, integration history &amp; sales order history for Print Sales Invoice transaction comes from the one who did the Process Delivered Sales Order session.<br />
<br />
The problem is, in Process Delivered Sales Order session, we can't specify which sales order that we want to process in that session.<br />
<br />
So, if you have any suggestions on how to track who print the invoice for each sales order, please share them. I really appriciate your kindness for that.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
J</div></div><hr />

You can store this info in new table when invocie is printed. ANd you don't need source code also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
turn on auditing for the sls tables, particularly the sls045 or sls051 table<br />
<br />
How to do this? Is it through Audit Management in Baan IV Tools? Do you have document on how to use this functionality? Thanks<br />
<br />
Dear AV,<br />
<br />
May be a small customization would help. You can store this info in new table when invocie is printed. ANd you don't need source code also.<br />
<br />
What kind of customization. Would you please elaborate? Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
Btw, infor gave me solution #164842. Does anyone here ever try this solution before? The document said that it will allow us to choose SO range in Process Delivered Sales Order session.<br />
<br />
One more thing, in tdsls051, there is a field called Record type (1-3) (tdsls051.ckor). What is the meaning of record type 1/2/3? <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />

Yes its done through Audit Management but i am afraid i dont have the document for this. You could search it on infor. Or best, if you have a support contract with them then you can download the ISO image of Baan4c4 documentation CD that includes all documentation made for version 4. <br />
As far as the solution is concerned, this function was added on to Sales Order Processing session in one of the Service Packs. Dont know how this would solve your problem, unless ofcourse the users are told to only process sales orders pertaining to a particular series. That might help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jftello</div><div class="date">27th September 2007, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Try tdsls051. Record type 1 means added, updated sales orders. Record type 2 means deleted. Record 3 means printed. You can see the username on the logname field.</div></div><hr />
