<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khalleck</div><div class="date">20th April 2010, 23:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I am attempting to create dimension mappings based upon both Sales Order Series and Project Number Series. In order to do so I created two new Integration Elements. One is to be used to assign dimensions by Sales Order Series and the other is to be used to assign dimensions by Project Number Series. I then attached these two new Integration Elements to the appropriate financial integration transaction combinations via tfgld4126m000. Once this was accomplished I created relations for each of these new Integration Elements via tfgld4122s000. The general ledger accounts which are mapped to each of these financial integration combinations each have the associated debit and credit general ledger account dimension defined as &quot;OPTIONAL&quot;. So far, so good. I thought.<br />
<br />
I have posted and finalized transactions and documents associated with the transactions types I have linked to these two new Integration Elements and to the new relations attached to these two new Integration Elements, but the associated dimension is not being populated. The integration transactions are posting and finalizing to the general ledger as if the new dimension mappings did not exist. Meaning the transactions are posting to the correct general ledger accounts, but the dimension field is left blank.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why this might be the case?<br />
<br />
We are in a PCS environment and all of the transactions to which I am referring involve PCS projects and, therefore, involve transaction types where the &quot;PROJECT TRANSACTIONS&quot; flag is set to &quot;YES&quot; in tfgld4126m000.<br />
<br />
Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnbhatt</div><div class="date">29th April 2010, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">logistics elements are specific to transaction origin. only valid elements can be used for a combination of transaction origin and financial transaction.<br />
<br />
So please let us know the combination for which you are trying to set the dimension with element of series. This would give clarity to Baanboard members to help you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khalleck</div><div class="date">30th April 2010, 02:33</div></div><div class="posttext">The Integration combination for the Sales Order Series integration element we have created is Sales/Sales Invoice.  The integration combinations for the Project Number Series integration element we have created includes the balance of the integration combinations mapped via tipcs8150m000 (Maintain Project Transactions Account) such as Purchase/Material Costs, Purchase/General Costs, and others.<br />
<br />
We logged a call last week with BAAN support and they stated that even though the option to assign dimensions by Series exists, it does not work.  Why it is available for selection, I do not know.<br />
<br />
BAAN support suggested using FINANCIAL CUSTOMER GROUP as the Integration Option.  Unfortunately, we use the same Customer Numbers and FCG's for different business units.  Our business unites are for internal reporting units only and our customers do not reconize them as distinct entities.  In addition, the current logic for the FCG is based upon domestic, non-domestic, and inter-company customers, not business unit.<br />
<br />
Our solution for the Project Number Series was to simply map the relations by project number instead of by project number series.  Unfortunately, this does not work for the Sales/Sales Invoice combination because the project number is not part of the integration record.  Also, there is no Integration Option for Sales Order Number.  As such, we are currently trying to find an alternative Integration Option.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a suggestion?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you ever solved this problem?<br />
<br />
I seem to remember that the Project indicator in tfgld4126 was set up so that:<br />
Yes, means 'real' projects from the tp module (tppdm6100m000)<br />
No, means tipcs projects. Is it possible to change that Yes to No, post some integrations to see if it works?<br />
<br />
Another thing, is table tfgld419 filled? <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Bebaan</div></div><hr />

This is FYI<br />
