<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">6th November 2007, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">We have run across an interesting situation :<br />
<br />
When processing supplier payments Baan IV c4 picks up the Supplier name from session: tccom2101m000, but the supplier address from session: tccom2103m000.<br />
 <br />
This has recently become an issue as we have a supplier who has sold their receivables to another company; therefore, we are buying from one company, but paying another.<br />
<br />
If the cheques would pickup the supplier name with the remit to address from session: tccom2103m000, this would solve the problem. As it is now, we are toasted ....<br />
<br />
The cheque processing sessions are as follows:<br />
<br />
Select Invoices for payment: tfcmg1220m000<br />
Maintain Payment Advice: tfcmg1120m000<br />
Process Payments: tfcmg1240m000<br />
Audit Payment: tfcmg00021, report rtfcmg125511000<br />
Transfer Payment: tfcmg1260s000, ttstpsplopen, report ftfcmg126011001<br />
<br />
 <br />
Has anyone run across a similar scenario ? Are we looking at a customization here ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any advice is appreciated !  Thanks in advance ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan 5 / LN much better for this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that creating a factor company should work (tcmcs0125m000).<br />
<br />
Put this company then in the supplier (tccom020.cfcc). <br />
<br />
And i think your report will take the name and address from the factor company you have put in the supplier.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Embrechts</div><div class="date">12th November 2007, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hallo,<br />
<br />
I checked the way to do it with a factor company and the I saw that the session tfcmg1260s000 picks up the data from the factor company if you put the factorcompany in the supplier.<br />
<br />
So it should work<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">12th November 2007, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thanks for trying it out. We have never used the factor company session across any of our 10 companies world wide. I'll have to do some research on the functionality of the session so I know how it all works :) ...<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestion and help !<br />
<br />
I'll post how it all goes ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">12th November 2007, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I created a new Factoring Company entry 001, and went to maintain Supplier and entered in 001 into Form 3 for the original supplier ...<br />
<br />
I think that is all that's needed?  <br />
<br />
We ran session tfcmg1120m000 and entered the original suppler, but we were expecting to see the factoring company name pop up for supplier name and address. Maybe this is not what it is supposed to do ?  <br />
<br />
The cheques printed out with the original suppliers name at the top of the cheque and address, not the factoring company. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions where we may be missing something ??<br />
<br />
Wonder if we are in an older release that has a bug in it ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I checked it with the remittance letter.<br />
I created the factor company in tcmcs0125m000.<br />
<br />
You must enter a bank in tcmcs0126m000 and fill in this bank in the factor company in tcmcs0125m000.<br />
<br />
It didn't work without a bank in tcmcs025.cban. This bank must exist in<br />
tcmcs026.<br />
The factor company should be entered in the supplier.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />
