We update our standards at year end and try to cancel all open production batches going into the new year, but there are always a few that are missed or in process at January 1st.  This year we had a production batch issued in 2011 but no production till 2012.  We can follow the gl transactions and dollars until it gets to the overhead calculations and variances.  The overhead used on this batch was not the old or the new standard for the item, so we are confused as to how the system is looking at this and doing the calculation.  Any help or if you could point me in a direction for information would be appreciated.  Thanks</div></div><hr />
