<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srikarthy</div><div class="date">10th March 2008, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">You may have to extract the records for these documents from the table tfgld106 with 4 decimal precision and do the sum. You may get a difference less than 0.01, anything between 0.0001 and 0.009. You can use easy SQL query but you must see that it prints up to 4 decimal precision. <br />

With your suggestion, from the table tfgld106, the differences were identified and the problem is now resolved.<br />

This is to eliminate the 0.00- or 0.00 diference reported.<br />
<br />
After this, a rebuild data from batches session, must be performed to that financial period/year that the documents belongs. This is to correct the balance on trial balance report.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
