<br />
I am new to LN and trying to find out on relation between finance co and logistic co.<br />
<br />
In Baan 5 there is a table called tfgld000 (Logistic co.s by finance cos.) which keeps relation of Finance and logistic co but i dont see this concept anymore in LN. <br />
<br />
Can anyone help me in exploring this functionality / concept?<br />
<br />

This table survived the BAANIV - BAANV upgrade, but only because it was initially forgotten.<br />
<br />
The multi-company concept in SSA ERP LN is the same as in SSA ERP 5.0x.<br />
Each type of department (purchase office, sales office, work center etc.) is linked to an enterprise unit. The enterprise unit has an operational company (logistic company) and a financial company. So the enterprise unit is the link between operational and financial company.<br />
