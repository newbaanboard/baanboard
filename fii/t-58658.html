<br />
We maintained a Sales Order in the Month of May-10 for X Item @ 10 USD and the Delivery Date is of that Item is in June 15. But due to the Re-negotation with the Customer the Price has been Revised from $10 to $11.5. We released the Sales Order to Warehousing and Confirm the shipment.<br />
<br />
Now We use the session tdsls4122m000 for Change Price &amp; Discount after delivery for changing the Price. We change the price thorugh this session, and print the Excise Invoice. We checked the Price in Invoice, it has the old price i.e. $10. But right now the Valide Price is $11.5.<br />
<br />
We release the Sales Order line to Central Invoicing and make an invoice. The sales Invoice has the right price i.e. $11.5.<br />
<br />
the problem is Excise invoice is Submiited in many legal Authorities. The Excise Invoice have the Different Rate and Values from the Sales Invoice.<br />
<br />
Please suggest me, how we can handle such type of cases and how we can prevent this type of errors.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Now since invoice is been generated and sent to authorities I thing correction documentation may be done in consultation with excise experts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you are right. But I want to know, is it possible to change the Price in the Excise Invoice before the goods is move out.<br />
<br />
e.g. We make an Excise Invoice &amp; Sales Invoice, when we compare both invoices, we found the variation in the total amount due to the rate of the commodity.<br />
<br />
We already print the Excise Invoice but not mentioned the departure time on it. <br />
<br />
Please guide me how can update that excise invoice and Match with the sales invoice.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
