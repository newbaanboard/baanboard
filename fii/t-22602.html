<br />
I have a little problem, to activate the &quot;Receipt Schedule&quot; I have to set the Localization paramters in session &quot;General Localization parameters&quot;. How should I do that because all fields are disabled in the session.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Generally you have to decide at setting up the Baan company, if you must use localization parameters; at this time it´s possible to do it directly via session tccoml500m00l (filling table tccom936).<br />
<br />
As far as I have understood, session tccomll101m00l General localization parameters by Country (tccom937) is only for information purpose, and only the settings in tccom936 are used by the various Baan session to validate the used localizations.<br />
<br />
After you have already started daily business in Baan, you can only fill table tccom936 via database (ttaad4100) and you have to be carefully, because of possible references and restrictions.<br />
<br />
Independent of filling tccom936, you have to activate the localizations for the relevant users by linking the localization parameter code to user defaults in session tccoml106m00l. Only for those users linked, the relevant localized fields and reports are activated.<br />

With reference of reply: <br />
<br />
After you have already started daily business in Baan, you can only fill table tccom936 via database (ttaad4100) and you have to be carefully, because of possible references and restrictions. <br />
<br />
What care should be taken? If I set the parameters in table tccom936 directly in the database, will it effects the existing processes negatively? Is there any idea/reference which sessions and process should be checked after setting the parameters for Receipts Schedule to verify that Receipts Schedule is activated correctly and working well.<br />
<br />
Secondly, how should I check the reports are compatible with the Receipts Schedule and will be updated or I will have to update the report layouts and scripts to print the amount and date according to the schedule (Reports which are supposed to be updated with the Receipts Schedule like Statement of account, Open entries, Reminders, Aging analysis etc.)?<br />
<br />
I appreciate all responses<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Let´s assume that when activating a certain localization parameter, new transaction data will have a certain flag set, which was not the case before activating this parameter.<br />
<br />
In such a situation it´s clear, that Baan can not handle pre-/Post-parameter transactions data in the same way, you will get a mix-up of data in reports or even fatal errors in transaction handling.<br />
<br />
For sure, each situation has to be checked carefully, as for the receipt schedule, please let a tools specialist check the consequences.<br />
