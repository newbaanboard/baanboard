<br />
I'm trying to integrate sales invoices.<br />
<br />
I've setup dimensions and integration elements (in tfgld4120), as well as linked the integration elements to dimensions within Maintain Options by Integration Element (tfgld4121).  We also have setup Sales (as the Transaction Orgin) and Sales Invoice (as the Financial Transaction) with the different types of sales along with Integration Element Dr. and Cr. within Maintain Transaction Types by Transaction Orgin (tfgld4126).  <br />
<br />
However, dimensions are still not being added to the Accounts Receivable debit side of the entry.  (they are being added to other ledger accounts for the transaction, such as sales, inventory, etc.)  <br />
<br />
One note, I did notice we can't setup a Transaction Type within Maintain Transaction Types by Transaction Orgin.  Could this be the problem.  If so, does anyone know where we can make this an option?<br />
<br />
Any explanation into why AR won't accept dimensions would be tremendously appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<br />
The first place that I would look is at your ledger account in the Maintain Chart of Accounts session - if the account is set at &quot;not used&quot; for the dimension, you won't get any when you post your integration transactions.   Our AR accounts are set in this way.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this is your situation, or what you see if it is not and I will try to provide further help.<br />
<br />

<br />
Integration Options or elements have nothing to do with capturing the dimensions for AR.  It is maintained in the session Maintain Ledger Accounts by Customer Group, which is available as a zoom from the session Maintain Financial Customer Group (tfacr0110m000).<br />
<br />
Here you can map dimension for the particular AR Control A/c, provided the dimension usage is set to Mandatory or Optional in the session Maintain chart of account (tfgld0108m000).  If the same is set to &quot;Not used&quot;, you can not maintain dimension in for that account in tfacr0110m000.<br />
<br />
Hence, please check the dimension status for your AR account in session tfgld0108m000 first, and set it &quot;Mandatory&quot;.  Then come to tfacr0110m000 and specify the dimension to the account.<br />
<br />
Note:  If the dimension status is not already set to &quot;Mandatory&quot; and some transactions are already recorded in that ledger account without dimension, you will not be able to change the status to &quot;Mandatory&quot;.  Then the only option is to make it &quot;Mandatory&quot; through a GTM correction in the table tfgld008.  But this gives raise to problems at the year closure.  So if you decide to resort to this, better take a professional help before proceeding further.<br />
<br />
The other, safest way is, to create a new account itself, with dimension set to &quot;mandatory&quot; and map that new account in tfacr0110m000.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
