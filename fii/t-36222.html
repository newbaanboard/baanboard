   While finalizing group of batches, we got this error &quot;Sort error 6: No more files can be created at this moment&quot; and upon clicking the OK button, it just went on to finalize the batches...<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me what this error actually means? Is it baan, sql or network related problem?<br />

<br />
we had this error when we moved our Baan system to a new server. It actually was an authorization problem within the filesystem. The user wasn't allowed to write in $BSE/tmp.<br />

What you said might hold some truth as it had been just couple of months since the server was changed when we came across this error. However, baantmp folder doesnt have any sharing given(naturally) and in the security tab of this folder, group &quot;Everyone&quot; is given full control as permission. This should rule out permission problem, doesnt it??<br />

sounds logical to me what you wrote. We are on UNIX and Windows (as operating systems in genaral) is not my area of expertise. I can only tell you what solved our problem. I saw this error twice in my &quot;Baan life&quot; and it was always an authorization problem. The funny thing is: the report is printed anyway as soon as you press the OK-button :eek: .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ks_ks_</div><div class="date">18th June 2007, 04:17</div></div><div class="posttext">By saying the authorization problem, you mean to say the SUPER USER of Baan will not have this problem (this SUPER USER will have all the rights on OS level as well of course). If it is so, then what I had faced is something different, as in my case even the super user was facing this problem.<br />

 <br />
Ks: IMHO, this error could be due to more than just authorizations. This opinion is further strengthened when the same user without any change in his authorization gets to do the same process without any problem the second time around. <br />

The problem is because handles are not released, and if Baan is not completely shut and restarted, eventually the O/s gives up:<br />

After clicking on OK the document prints.<br />
