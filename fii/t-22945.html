<br />
   I have made payment to the wrong bank but I have not finalized the  batch, however, when I try to delete it in the maintain payment advice(tfcmg1120m000) , I get a message that &quot;Payment already been posted&quot;. Is it possible or is there any solution/sugesstion/work around for this issue?     <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

1) Finalize the batch.<br />
2) Use your reconciliation transaction to reject the individual payments. This will reverse the payments and &quot;re-open&quot; the invoices so that they can be selected for payment using the correct bank.<br />
<br />
If the batch had payments to many suppliers, it may be laborious but it is still the best way. Any GTM approach involves a number of tables and is apt to lead to other errors.<br />

<br />
In case it is a bank transaction reverse using JV. Payment batch once posted cannot be reversed.<br />
