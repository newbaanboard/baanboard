<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dwgeis</div><div class="date">22nd November 2005, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently implemented ACH transactions within Baan.  They are working fine but as we've started to contact vendors, many of the big ones are expecting us to send ACH transactions with a CTX record.  <br />
<br />
I am exposing my ignorance here but it looks like there are extensions to the ACH format known as CTX and CCD+ which are used to attach remittance information to the payment.  The remittance advice is in EDI (X12) format it appears.  <br />
<br />
I've contacted Baan and they did not know what I was talking about   Later, they said they'd found something about it on the Internet.  Needless to say Baan does not seem to support this.  <br />
<br />
Is anyone doing this in Baan? I don't expect it would be that hard to modify the form to output the extra data but it would be helpful if I could even find a good source as to how the data should be formatted. <br />
<br />
It is strange because several of our vendors seem to expect this as an obvious thing but Baan (and our Baan implementation consultant) didn't seem to be familiar with it.  Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance-- <br />
