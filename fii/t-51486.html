i attached help text from fp7, maybe this may guide you on how you will do this in your baan. from this session you will just select an existing finalized sales invoice from same customer that you need to setup recurring sales then from specific ran the generate recurring transactions instructions to setup your monthly instructions, this will basically get same settings from existing invoice then you can ran generate recurring sales invoice any period each time or one time ran depends on your period status and trans type last batch number.<br />
<br />
hope this will help you,<br />
