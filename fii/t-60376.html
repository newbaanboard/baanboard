Hi Sir,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the valuable suggestion, as you have mentioned-&quot;credit note has to be handle &quot;stand alone&quot; in the payment procedure&quot;<br />
<br />
May you please elaborate this, as I'm new in ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

I am not that familiair with CMG, but as long as the amount you have to pay to a certain Business Partner remains positive that way of settling is allowed. <br />

Hi Sir,<br />
Thanks for explaining this, now I understand how to assign debit note entry with purchase invoice, at the time of making payment through CMG module. We can select Type of advice- Purchase credit notes under same payment advice batch where we have selected Type of advice-Purchase Invoices.<br />
In this way Debit note will be settle with purchase invoice &amp; payment advice will be generate of Net Amount, for example-<br />
Invoice Amt		Debit Note Amt			Net Amt for payment-<br />
 100 USD		20 USD			=	80 USD	<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
