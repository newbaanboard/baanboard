One of the documents for a certain batch is not balanced. This transaction is purchase approval (purchase correction).  Transaction type  batch status is 'free', and when checked at maintain transaction (tfgld1101m000), the batch is not accessible or cannot be found. This batch was not yet finalized. When checked in tfgld1111s000, the batch is not available for selection. Can we correct tfgld102 to make the entry balanced and set the transaction type batch status to 'Ready' via GTM? By doing this, will this batch now be available for selection in tfgld1111s000 and can it then be seen in tfgld1101m000?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards, <br />

What is the batch status in tfgld100?  Even if the batch is not in balance you should still be able to see it if it has not been finalized yet.   Another thins to check is the access mode for the batch(also tfgld100)?  If the access mode is set to individual then only the usercode defined against the batch will be able to see it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The status of tfgld100 is &quot;Ready&quot; and the access mode is for all users, that's why I am wondering, why it was not seen in tfgld1101m000. Also, no error log was displayed in tfgld1506m000.<br />

Thanks and regards,<br />

<br />
additionally, what is the status in tfgld101?<br />
<br />
And you can print out by &quot;Print non-finalized Transactions&quot; tfgld1401m000.<br />

If this approval was done using session Match/Approve Purchase Invoice with Orders (tfacp1130m000), then you will not be able to see the batch in Maintain Transactions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Status of tfgld101 is 'Free', yes, i can run print non-finalized transaction.  The approval is done after the matching process, meaning this is automatically created by the system, will just prompt you the ledger account, if there is a difference to be posted. This process is being done regulary and can be seen in   maintain transaction, only for this particular batch that we were unable to see it, probably because of the unbalanced entry. Debit entry for a particular document was recorded twice, causing the document to be inbalanced. Is it safe to delete the other debit entry and change status of tfgld101 to 'Ready' via GTM. ?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />

<br />
But you can see it if you set in tfgld100 the batch on modifyable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you very much for the information. I was able to see the batch when I set the field modifiable to yes.<br />

Status= &quot;free&quot; is shown when you entered a transaction type but did any transactions with that transaction type (it is only in the list of that batch). Problem: a batch is only shown in &quot;Select batches for Finalization&quot; when the status of all transaction types is &quot;ready&quot;. That is the reason why you should avoid to enter a transaction type in a batch which you do not need.<br />
Status=&quot;ready&quot; is shown when you entered a transaction type, did some transactions with that and everything (so far) is okay, e.g. debit and credit are balanced. Normally, you should be able to finalize such a batch without problems.<br />
<br />
As far as I know there is no history of the amounts entered in a transaction. So, if the status was &quot;ready&quot; and somebody changed or added transactions for this transaction type in that batch, you are not able to see what exactly has been changed meanwhile.<br />
The non-finalized transactions you can see, of course, by using Session &quot;Print non-finalized transactions&quot;.</div></div><hr />
