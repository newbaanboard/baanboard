<br />
I have found that in tables tfacp250 baan is saving the information related to the invoices link with purchase orders and tfacp251  baan is saving the information related to the invoices link with receipts, but i saw that there are some receipts that are not linked to an invoice, but the purchase order is in the table tfacp250.<br />
<br />
How can i know what receipts are linked to that invoice in tfacp250 if there is not receipts in tfacp251?. i thougt that maybe in tdpur401, but what happen with parcial receipts?.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your great help.<br />

You have two matching scenario's:<br />
1) Match to Receipt; the link to each individual receipt is stored in table tfacp251 and at the same time in tfacp250 (link to order line/sequence).<br />
2) Match to Order; the user is apparently not interested in the receipts. You just match to orderline/sequence. During approval the system just checks whether there is enough received approved quantity, but there is not link created between the invoice and the receipts.<br />
<br />
So if you have tfacp250 records and no tfacp251 records, then it means that your invoice was used in the &quot;Match to Order&quot; procedure and you do not know the link with the receipts. <br />
