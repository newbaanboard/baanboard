<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 20:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The provisional closing is meant to be run as a means of getting Opening Balances for the new fiscal year WITHOUT keeping finance from making adjustments to the previous fiscal year.  It doesn't require that you do anything other than run the provisional close session.( you can leave the periods open )  However, It is highly recommended that you do a rebuild of the dimension/ledger history before the provisional closing.  The rebuild requires that no one be in the finance module or have transactions set to 'real time'.  So, the rebuild does require some coordination.  It is also known to take up a lot to archive log space so watch for that.<br />
