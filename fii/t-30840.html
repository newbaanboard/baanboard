<br />
Problem with finalizing acr invoice (with same currency that home currency), the error:<br />
<br />
document status record not found<br />
update method &quot;finalization&quot; not executed; see error log file<br />
document xxx balance (home currency) is: 3148,5<br />
document xxx balance (foreign currency) is: 3148,5<br />
document xxx not balanced<br />
<br />
I have checked tfgld102, the amount is correct , tax amount also (3148,5)<br />
tfgld107 the tax amount is same 3148,5<br />
nothing seems to be missing from these tables, periods are correct and i can't see any rounding error<br />
<br />
what it is comparing, what table from where something else could be wrong or missing to cause this error (error that refers to tax amount) ??:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">5th February 2007, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the acr200 table too, just to be sure...<br />
The application event log should give you some clues...<br />
<br />
sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aliceK</div><div class="date">5th February 2007, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you but I have checked also acr200 (and also acr401 just in case, as the level of tax calc is transaction line)<br />
the tax amount in HC, FC and invoice curr is everywhere the same (and correct as it should) and is not missing from anywhere.<br />
the period has to be closed and I'm still not able to find the reason:confused: <br />
<br />
What is application event log?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">5th February 2007, 20:46</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a bit unusual. In the past on c3 I always used to correct these by amending the values in gld102 as mentioned previously in the thread. The HC and FC being the same makes it even stranger.<br />
<br />
Just as a matter of interest what version are you running and do you have the latest version of the sessions.<br />
<br />
Sorry can't be more help.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 07:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The application event log is only applicable if you are using a windows platform. It will be in the Administrator Tools in Control Panel. Open the Event Log Viewer in that and go to the Application log. Most of the times there will be an entry related to the error that you got. In one of these errors might be a listing of data not found in so and so table or cannot relate to so and so field. You would have to browse through the log to the time you got the error. <br />
<br />
Good Luck!!<br />

Neal: Why wouldnt the home currency and foreign currency be the same if the invoice is based on a local or home currency? Since there was no mention about a foreign currency in use for that invoice, i take it that it is based on a local currency.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 09:48</div></div><div class="posttext">sk: I mentioned the Foreign Currency simply becuase when I had this problem in the past it was generally down to rounding errors with the FC values. Apologies for causing any confusion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jalitrek11</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">This has happened to me on several occasions.  It general happens when a user gets &quot;Kicked&quot; out when finalizing an ACR invoice.<br />
<br />
I usually go into GTM and go to the table &quot;DOCUMENTS&quot;  (maybe tfgld107??) and look up that document number.  Generally the fiscal period and batch number or some other relavant information is missing (for whatever reason).<br />
<br />
I add the missing values in (compare with a good record) and try to finalize.  It works everytime.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">6th February 2007, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point Justin, documents table is tfgld018.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rijandubey</div><div class="date">8th February 2007, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Can u please take the print of Non finalised transaction after rotating the currency, May be there be differences in the Dr and Cr side, b'coz if u r getting the message &quot;Update method finalisatio......executed&quot;, then It would be mentioning some amnt also, that we have to reconcile.<br />
Now go to table tfgld100, 101 and 109 also, set the batch status ready and then try to finalise the batch.<br />
Let's see whether it works??<br />
B'coz I have tried it in LN 6.1  and it works well there. <br />
<br />
Best of Luck</div></div><hr />

the problem was in table tfgld018, the doc status and periods missing,<br />
the document not balanced was just a confusing message...<br />
