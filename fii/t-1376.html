Does anyone have any documentation on dimensions in Baan Finance?  What I am looking for is informaiton on how they should be used, the proper way to set them up, and any other tidbits of knowledge that maybe available outside of the &quot;Using Session&quot; help functionality.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
the general way how to use Dimension is not very complicate, in fact it is as easy as how to use the chart of account and you can learn it from the Baan help or User Documentation. <br />
<br />
But the details how to set them up is also as complicate as to set up the chart of account. You need a concept of cost accounting, booking rules, reporting necessities and Integration Logistic-Finance before you set them up. A good knowledge of the logistic processes helps too. <br />
In my opinion this cannot be described in a general documentation but you have to work it out e.g. with a finance consultant.<br />
<br />
What is also important do you need information about Baan IV or BaanERP? <br />

<br />
dimensions are conceptually subledgers and are attached to GL either by making them mandatory or optional.<br />
if it is made mandatory when GL posting is done it searches for the subledger(dimension) to be posted.<br />
this ensures the subledger is also posted while posting to GL<br />
<br />
by this way 5 dimensions (subledgers) can be attached to a GL thereby ensuring that the growthof GL is not drastic and altered during the course of the business which also ensures the legality of the object(COA).<br />
<br />
this is a USP of baan and if put effectively eases the job of Users of Finance in baan and also provides an excellent report for the MIS.<br />
<br />
the sessions wherein this can be done is in the Integration with other modules B-object in GL module and u can use the session available in this b-objects.<br />
<br />
happy linking,<br />
