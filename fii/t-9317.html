<br />
In Baan session, tfacr4101s000, Maintain Sales Invoice Lines, prior to upgrade we could use Special menu session tipcs3140s000, Maintain General Project Costs,  to tie our credit to a project via transaction type, document, etc.  After upgrade, this menu selection is missing.  <br />
<br />
We contacted Baan and the session<br />
tfacr4101 has been scripted so that this session can not be<br />
added to the special menu.  <br />
<br />
Would someone have some advise as to how we could duplicate the functionality that we require?<br />

Thank you for your help</div></div><hr />

Maybe if u fill the integration indicator (with PCS) of the accounts for which u use to book these general costs, you will be able to fill the Project in any transaction for which these accounts are used.<br />
Hope this will help.<br />

<br />
We have filled in the integration indicator (with PCS) of the accounts for which we need to book these general costs,  but we are still unable to cross referece the Project in any transaction for which these accounts are used.  We had the same problem in A/P and that fixed it but A/R is still having problems.<br />
<br />
Baan has replied that <br />
&quot;You can not access ticpcs3150m000 from tfacr4101s000. This is not the correct functionality. &quot;<br />
<br />
This was a defect in ban 4c2 /4c3 etc. which was fixed in Baan 4c4. Hence the user is not able to go to session ticpcs3150m000 from maintain sales invoice lines.<br />
<br />
Hence if you wanted to give credit to for a specific project either you need to maintain a negative line to the sales order and process the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adding a negative sales order line is not the business practice that we can use.  <br />
<br />
Have any other Baan Finance Users of BaanIVc4 run into this issue - how are you handling it ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.</div></div><hr />

Here is another suggestion:<br />
1) In maintain sales invoice lines dont use the account with the PCS integration indicator, but a interim one, instead;<br />
2) After maintaining sales invoice lines, create a journal voucher transaction, from where you would book to the account with the PCS indicator and reverte the interim account booking.<br />
<br />
This is a little bit more time consuming but it is a possible workaround.<br />
<br />

<br />
We tried it.  When creating a journal voucher transaction from an account with a PCS indicator, we receive an error message, &quot;Integration Transactions not allowed here&quot;.  It looks like we cannot  do a manual entry using a PCS account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pfsilva</div><div class="date">25th March 2003, 02:01</div></div><div class="posttext">That's strange.<br />
I tried it, running Baan IVc4 with SP7 and it allowed to enter General Costs into an account with PCS indicator.<br />
Hope u find a way...<br />
