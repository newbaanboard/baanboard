<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">4th June 2012, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Though we have been using Baan IVc4 in the US for 10+ years we have not needed to deal with multiple currencies.  Now we are looking to create a new Baan company which will represent activities at our Costa Rican facility.  I see that there is a Baan IV Multi-Currency 'package' which can be installed (U7088E US) but I was looking to see under what conditions (or what desired functionality) we would implement it for.<br />
<br />
We have not yet decided which home currency this new company would use, however they have the desire to use both USD and Colones... perhaps this alone requires us to use the Multi-currency package.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any information or knowledge they could share on the subject?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">6th June 2012, 11:01</div></div><div class="posttext">We have used the MCR extension since go live in 1999.<br />
For the first year or so it was a nightmare as every object seemed to fail due to not being properly written for MCR. With the advent of PMC that changed and it has been pretty reliable as it will automatically download pre-requisite objects.<br />
<br />
Functionality wise:<br />
1. You set up 1 or 2 additional currencies to be your home currency as well as the main one - presumably USD in your case.<br />
2. Many tables that have amounts will then have multiple versions of that<br />
e.g. item master can have 3 values for standard cost, latest cost, selling price etc.  e.g. you will have an array field tiitm001.copr(1), (2), (3)<br />
3. When certain sessions are run, e.g. Automatic Balancing of P&amp;L accounts tfgld6202m000 it will balance them off in all home currencies.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps - I can give you screen shots to give you a visual idea if that would make it easier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">6th June 2012, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that the extension then allows you select a 'home currency' and then view basic 'dollar data' in various other currencies.<br />
<br />
A few questions if I may...<br />
<br />
For example, the home currency is US Dollars and one of the alternate currencies is Costa Rican Colones.  <br />
<br />
Will Baan IVc4 then allow you to have a USD cash account and a Colones cash account with respective payment methods so that a check can be written in USD or Colones?<br />
<br />
Can a sales invoice be generated in USD and another in Colones?  Can then USD cash payments be posted against the USD invoice and Colones to the Colones invoice?  Same question but for Purchase Orders?<br />
<br />
I see fields in 'standard-vanilla' BaanIVc4 which lead me to believe that I could enter a currency different than the home currency and there are Common Tables to maintain currencies and various exchange rates so do we need the extension package to use two currencies in Baan IVc4?  Or does the multi-currency extension only allow me to see any $ amount in two (or more) currencies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">6th June 2012, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">The purpose of the MCR extension is to have more than 1 accounting currency really...  you can transact for sales &amp; purchases without needing MCR - it will just convert the foreign currency amount on the sales invoice into your 1 home currency using the system exchange rate. The difference is that MCR will convert your sales invoice amount into more than 1 accounting currency.<br />
<br />
e.g. Sales invoice for 1000 colones. <br />
Exchange rate 100 : $1 US<br />
120 : 1 Euro<br />
<br />
In standard, your home currency is US$, so your accounting will transact a sale of $10.<br />
<br />
In MCR, you have say US$ and Euro as your home currencies. You will see sales in the general ledger as $10 and 8.33 Euros for the same transaction.<br />
<br />
Or Colones could be the second home currency - just trying to illustrate that you can have transactional currency and different home currencies.<br />
<br />
The main issue as to whether you need MCR is whether you need to have accounts in more than 1 currency... Do you need to prepare local accounts in Costa Rica in local currency as well as consolidate them into the US parent is US$?</div></div><hr />

I will take this back to our Finance department so they can hash out what their true requirements are and from there we can determine our course of action.</div></div><hr />
