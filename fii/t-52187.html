<br />
My company structure is attached in the document and its a single logistic with multi finance companies and multifinace copmanies are again linked to another group financial companies.<br />
<br />
When i raised a purchase order i am unable to approve purchase order and the tables logical company 911 or shared with company 910 tfacp 240 , 245, 250,251 are also shared and the error is as follows <br />
<br />
tfacp240 is shared with company 910, but company 910 is not a part of financial group of 911.<br />
<br />
902 company is the group company for 910 and 911.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
I do not understand what you try to setup here. What do you mean &quot;...910 is not part of financial group of 911...&quot; but &quot;...902 is the group company of 910 and 911...&quot;  ? <br />
<br />
I believe you want the following setup:<br />
<br />
910 = logistical and financial company, meant to be master data comp. as well.<br />
<br />
911 = financial company<br />
<br />
902 = group company<br />
<br />
If that is so then both 910 + 911 have to have 902 in tfgld004 as group company, an entry of all companies in tfgld001 and in tfgld003 as base company.<br />
<br />
In addition to that all have to have the same ledger accounts, period types, Ref-Currency and dimension types. If that all is the case then you should easily manage to link the acp tables.<br />

Its correct 910 is logistic and finacial company and 911 is only financial company and the group for them is 902.<br />
<br />
In 902 the financial companies by group are 910 and 911 that is tfgld004 table but i want to know which company has to be entered as base company <br />

<br />
table tfgld001 has to be shared for 910 and 911 and all companies in your scenario have to be in that table --&gt; 910, 911 and 902.<br />
