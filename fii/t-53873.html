<br />
I have one supplier that our Accounts Payable Dept. would like to cut separate checks for on one particular check run.  Short of entering each invoice into a separate payment batch, isn't there a flag somewhere in the supplier record where I can tell it to print one check per each invoice?  I do not want to change the entire process in &quot;maintain payment methods&quot; for this one supplier, one time only deal.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

I gather no one else knows how to do this either.  I'll log a question with Baan and post the solution so others will be in the know if needed.</div></div><hr />

   Did you try changing the Bank Relation code for the Purchase Invoice (that you want to print to a different cheque) to a different code? Lets say you have selected three invoices for payment against a batch. In the session Maintain Payment Advice, change the bank relation code to another dummy code(DEF) of the old code (ABC). Make sure the new dummy code(DEF) is defined against the Payment Method and it has the same ledger account code as the old bank relation code (ABC). When you process this batch, it would print two cheques and the correct ledger accounts would be updated..<br />
<br />
Just did this out of curiousity and so you would have to tell me if this would work for you...<br />

This will allow you to have two cheques for the same supplier in one cheque run but with two cheque dates.<br />
Hope this is clear,if not let me know.</div></div><hr />

Was hoping there was another solution but it worked out.</div></div><hr />
