<br />
    How do we deal with the following in baan IV C4:<br />
<br />
1- Invoices to be received account wrongly reflects our liability to the suppliers because of &quot;bad&quot; receipts dating back to the old days of Baan.  In summary, many of the receipts have not been invoiced and subledger cannot be cleared.  Our objective is to clear the subledger and the GL as well<br />
 <br />
2- the other issue is that some of the purchase order lines have 0.01 or 0.02 balances in them.  Reason is that when the po is matched if there is foreign currency involved chances are that the total balance is completely match.  We also need to clear these small variances to the price variance account.  These are the legitimate price variances.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the first case the invoices of supplier must have been paid wherein the bank ledger account and corresponding debit account (supplier) must have been input to have an accurate trial balance. Hence supplier invoices could be made and matched/approved with related purchase orders and these invoices could be set off by creating debit notes for the supplier and allocating the debit notes to the supplier invoices. <br />
<br />
In the second case such balances in accounts payable could be written off using the session &quot;Write of Currency Differences&quot; which is found in ACP=&gt;Open entries=&gt;Maintenance module.<br />
<br />
Hope the above solutions are of help!!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Write off currency difference will write off  open item balance and not ITBR one . So this may not  be relevant for small variances in ITBR ledger and report.<br />
<br />
If the key user is unwilling to raise new invoices/debit notes , then manipulating invoiced quantity,invoiced amount delivery status and matched status in tdpur045 may eliminate the PO lines in ITBR report. For real ledger balance in ITBR , user may pass a JV on that (with PO listing for justification) .</div></div><hr />
