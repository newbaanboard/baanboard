<br />
How can the delivery status change to &quot;all approved&quot; if it is not through accounting ?<br />

<br />
The delivery status is changed in pur045 without matching an invoice when you canceled the order with a delivery of zero. If this is the case, the record is changed by running session tdpur4223m000. This is done in order to be able to delete the orderdata or close production orders or projects. In the past it was also possible to insert records in pur with 0 quantity an zero amounts, this is solved a long time ago. Perhaps this is the case at your end?<br />
