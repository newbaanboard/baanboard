We are using Actual costing, and historically have had this session setup in a job with both estimated and actual costing performed.  I would like to reset the job by doing only actual costing (I know the reports show both, but we only look at the actuals).  I am sure that the effect will be zero by saying no to estimated costing, but I just wanted to know if anyone else out there knows of any effect.  I am assuming that Baan included both in the same session to be a one-stop-shopping session.<br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Some accounts like to compare the estimate with the actual even though they are on actual costing.</div></div><hr />
