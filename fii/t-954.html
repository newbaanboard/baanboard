<br />
I recall a session where you can round down. But for the life of me cannot find it.<br />
<br />
Can someone out there help me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The domain definition contains instructions for rounding (off, up, or down).  This gets used in calls such as icom0001.domain.round() which is used in itdsls0006's invoice calculation routines.  You can also use something like format.round(), which, in fact, is called by domain.round, to manually force rounding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">7th February 2002, 22:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I would not suggest messing around with the domain code for vat rounding. It would be domain tcamnt, but this domain (and rounding using this domain) is also used in a lot more functionality of Baan. <br />
<br />
Vat rounding is (at least in the simple version (I do not know the Tax Provider thing version) controlled by the VAT code. Here you can enter if the VAT is rounded UP or rounded NORMALLY. You cannot round the VAT down. <br />
<br />
You have to do program modifications if you want to. A good place to do so would be include file (function) itdsls0006, since here the VAT rounding operations are performed.<br />

It's too pervasive.  I believe most people have source for itdsls0006 since it is used in reports.  Of course, you probably don't have source for the program script (ptdsls4404).  If you truly have a need to do this, you want to have someone with source code -- dare I say this :D -- customize the function and recompile the script for you.<br />
<br />
I've modified this function for a customer who wanted custom sales tax rules that Baan's standard couldn't handle.  This kind of change should be simple for someone with source.</div></div><hr />
