<br />
I touched on this in an earlier thread but I feel obliged to mention it again.<br />
<br />
Does anybody else suffer from poor performance in Maintain Purchase Invoices session tfacp1110s000.<br />
<br />
The problem is related to the number of records in tdpur045 which causes the entry of the Packing Slip to take about approximately 30 seconds as there is no index on packing slip in the table tdpur045.<br />
<br />
We have approx 100000 records in tdpur045 and we have now archived up to the beginning of this year. So we are really running out of options.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know if is there an index on packing slip in later releases of the software ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Neal Matthews</div></div><hr />

That table becomes huge and is usually the first to be archived.  You may be experiencing delays as the session tries to post.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Funnily enough we're currently archiving the integration transactions.<br />
<br />
However the performance problem is very specific and is related to the packing slip field where the user has to wait for approx 30 secs.<br />
<br />
We have performed various traces on this session and the problem is definately related to the number of records in tdpur045.<br />
<br />
We have proved this beyond all doubt by clearing tdpur045 in our test company and unsurprisingly enough the session then flies.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.<br />

Document<br />
Business Partner - Document<br />
Business Partner - Invoice number<br />
Fiscal Year Batch<br />
Business partner - Document Date<br />
Payments<br />
Batch number<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
How many keys are there on tdpur045 in Baan ERP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">14th November 2001, 10:36</div></div><div class="posttext">probably by tdpur405, that table has only 2 indexes. <br />
<br />
Did you already investigate the query? If you know how the sql statement looks and if you are using a level II driver you can probably add an additional index in your database.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">14th November 2001, 11:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for that,<br />
<br />
How does the Maintain Purchase Invoices session work in Baan ERP with regards to entering the packing slip on the first screen and subsequenting matching.<br />
<br />
Would I need a development licence to add an extra index ?<br />

<br />
For the add. index: you can create it directly in your db, not within Baan but as stated before you have to use a level II driver in that case.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">14th November 2001, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Han.  Good to hear from you again.<br />
<br />
Would adding the additional key in the DB and not in Baan actually help?  I assumed that when Baan does the query it would ignore any keys it did not know about.<br />
