Otherwise, how can you tell the project from the recievable?<br />
Any ideas?:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our project field is always filled in tfacr200, so long as the invoice was generated from the project (tppin) module.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">7th November 2001, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">tppin is Big Project invoicing, isn't it?<br />
If so, that's helpful, as I'm not getting the same result. Could you let me know your Baan version.<br />
This will help when I'm having my &quot;discussion&quot; with Baan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do check ur PRC parameters for the relevant transaction type in Projects i m using baan iv c 4 and i  am able to populate the field Project in tfacr200<br />
<br />
also check with the session tpprc2810m000 and try defining for the appropriate type<br />
<br />
also the customer control accounts for the FCG.<br />
<br />
regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
I second what sajit says, although it appears he uses maintain revenues as opposed to project invoicing (yes, tppin is 'big project' invoicing). We too are using Baan IV c4.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">8th November 2001, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...<br />
We're implementing on 5.Oc and I can't find tpprc2810m000. Could you give me the session description so I can try and dig it out?<br />
Thanks for your help, though, guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is one of the sessions in the Project link to finance where you specify which accounts to debit and credit when generating revenues on a project. This particular session is 'Maintain ledger accounts', which opens up a whole host of session options accessed by buttons on the right. I don't think your probleis here though.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">9th November 2001, 20:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I don't think this is it either. In 5.0c all the account code mappings are in the financial integrations part of the general ledger.<br />
Thanks for the help though, knowing the functionality worked in Baan IV has led me to log the issue with Baan Support as a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">14th November 2001, 00:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I have talked to Baan support. Basically, this field is not populated in Baan 5 and there is no intention to populate it. This is because:<br />
1. It is not used by the system anywhere<br />
2. Multiple projects can be consolidated onto one invoice<br />
3. The field length is less than the field length for project number in the projects module!!!<br />
This makes the report writing more complicated as you have to link back through the invoice records.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the discussion, it's reassuring to know there's some project finance users out there.</div></div><hr />
