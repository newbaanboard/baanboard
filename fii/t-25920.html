I have a user that wants to add some fields to the form for this session - Approve Price Differences.  It looks like I'll have to write a new session that duplicates this session as much as possible to get the info they want on it since we don't have the session script.  I was wondering if any could tell me what all takes place when the users flips the tfacp200.papr field from No to Yes.  Does it set up anything besides doing just that??  Also, upon opening this session what information is returned from tfacp200?  just records with No in the papr field, just records where the difference is &lt;&gt; 0?  I see I am also going to need to put validations in to check the user and if they are permitted to approve. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

What you are about to do is (in my opinion) a potential risk, because it can give you problems when you want to migrate to new service packs etc.<br />
Maybe there is an other way of solving the user needs, and maybe you could/should persuade Baan Support to change standard, if your user can't get the info he needs within standard.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th December 2005, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree, it's a big risk to try and duplicate a session such as this.<br />
<br />
There are other alternatives.  The 'wrapper' tools can allow you to generate code that calls the standard code, allows you to add your own code to it, without modifying or owning the source code. <br />
<br />
Baan programmers use concept and call the results a 'Bolt On'.  RMCis (my company) puts out the tool called 'RMCgen' (Link to RMCgen page (http://www.rmcis.com/rmcgen2.html)), and Full Scope puts out the tool called 'QKEY', which do similar things, these can be used by developers without source code to add their own logic to sessions (and other things).  There is also a free ware version without support, you can find this under the code and utilties forum on these boards, search for the keyword 'rush'.<br />
<br />
Good luck whichever method you choose.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking...would I be able to create a new display only session with all the info this user wants and allow the user to somehow zoom to the tfacp1142m000 session on a selected record from my customized session then they can approve it?  How would I go about bringing up the tfacp1142m000 session on the record I've selected in my customized session?<br />
<br />
Good Idea?  Bad Idea??<br />

thanks - tnzabo</div></div><hr />
