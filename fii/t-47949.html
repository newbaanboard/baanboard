Thanks for your reply. Batch status ''free'' ,finalization status ''Free'' and batch modifiable: 1 (Yes).  Can we delete this ANP transaction because by mistake this single entry has passed? Please suggest me how and where I delete this ANP Transaction entry in GMT. Or also suggest any other procedure to do this.<br />
<br />

What i was thinking about was that if the batch was made modifiable than you could have accessed it through session Maintain Transactions {tfgld1101m000}...<br />

<br />
You are write, but we can not modified ANP transaction through maintain transactions session once entry finished and the ANP transaction show only one documents. We are getting problem while preparing ANP transaction in sub session tfcmg2110s000. The sub session is not reopening before finalization of the batch and display of transaction entered for editing purpose is not possible. This is only occurrence in ANP transaction type. <br />
<br />
I have to delete or correct this document which have in ANP Transaction and it is misstep by our new user.   <br />
<br />
<br />
waiting for your responce<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

  How about just creating a reversal entry for this particular transaction to negate its effect? This is what you would have done had it (this transaction) been finalized, right? So why not go for this approach?<br />
 <br />
I hope someone else would give you a better solution...<br />

First note down the ANP document number and delete it from tfgld102 batch. Now for the batch status to get corrected, just open the batch and save and exit. The batch will have the correct status - Ready<br />
<br />
Now for this ANP, firstly check in the cmg tables if any line is present in tfcmg101,103,110,111,112,113 and delete from there. Next would be tfacp200, if present delete from here also.<br />
