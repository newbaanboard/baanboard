<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">13th April 2006, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently testing an ACH payment process and are having some difficulty.  We've been able to successfully create a file using the ACH formatted report within BaaN through the Transfer Payments session (tfcmg1260s000).  Some questions we have is with assigning a document number.  In the Maintain Payment Method setup we set the Use Check Master to No so there is no document number assigned to the transaction.  How do you reference the payment if there is ever a need?<br />
<br />
Also - does this payment method need to go through the whole posting process.  Since there is no &quot;clearing&quot; process I was wondering what happens once the payment is processed.<br />
<br />
Any info would be great!!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
