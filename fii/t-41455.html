<br />
We have more dimensions relating to the Finance, and Employee. Now, we wants that those dimensions are not in used, they are not appear at the time of transaction. We are shifting employees from One plant to Another and give them another employee code for that plant.<br />
<br />
Now, we face the problem the employee dimensions are double shows at the time of transaction, we can't delete them but we blocked those dimension.<br />
<br />
we wants that those dimensions are blocked, those dimensions are not shown at the time of transaction.<br />
<br />
Please suggest me what to be done for solving this problem.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

<br />
You can do this by setting 'Maintain Dimension Ranges by Ledger Account'. The old dimsnions will not be included in the range of valid dimensions. Thus they will not show up at the time of data entry<br />

Thanks for reply.<br />
<br />
We have a lot of dimensions in all 4 types of dimensions. Now, which dimension are not in used they are also in more quantity.<br />
<br />
There are two possibilities that we entered the dimensions range by ledger account for every dimension but these process is lengthy, because, like first dimension are used second dimensions are not in used.<br />
<br />
Now, how can we shortlist these dimesnion for transactions.<br />
<br />
Please, suggest what is the easiest way to resolve it.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

But subsequently you can regularly maintain it. If it is any easier you can take all dimensions in an excel report dlete the dimensions not in use and then upload the data back to baan. This will avoid the effort of entering valid dimensions for each and every ledger account</div></div><hr />
