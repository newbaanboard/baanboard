Cheque Nos. are skipping in between Or Two cheque Nos. coming for one payment in tfcmg1240m000 - process compose payments.<br />
Some times we are getting cheque nos. 101,102,105 like that skipping in between. We are clearing the un used cheques manually. Next, Major problem is we got two cheques for same PO , same amount for one batch .<br />
We could not find out what is the reason for both these situations ?<br />
What might be the reason ?<br />

You also need to check the support site for any later solutions for your software.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We need to check the payment methods (tfcmg0140m000) also as told by you. SEssion tfcmg1240m000 is just a process session which internally calls many sessions like tfcmg1255s000, tfcmg1256s000 etc. tfcmg1260s000 is the main  session which actually transfer the payments &amp; prints the cheques. <br />
we identified the problem with tfcmg1260m000.<br />
I got solution from baan saying Invoices are sorted in descending order in the check report using US checks layout presently.<br />
We need to see Invoices are sorted in ascending order and printed on the check report using US checks layout.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />
