<br />
I have a small question. As soon as I activated the &quot;Receipt Schedule&quot; in the financial company, I am not able to enter the payment against an invoices which have no schedule line(s) in the session &quot;Receipt Schedule&quot;. How should I enter the payment information for such invoices which have no schedule lines. I am trying through sessions Transactions (tfgld1101m000) and Bank Transactions (tfcmg2100s000).<br />
<br />
I observed one thing, if Receipt Schedule is not activated and we try to zoom to select the Invoice in session Bank Transaction (tfcmg2100s000), it opens the session &quot;Open Entries&quot;. While if Receipt Schedule is activate then it opens the session &quot;Receipt Schedule/Receipt Schedule by Busniess Partner&quot; session for selection of Invoice.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I am sorry but how can you activate &quot;Receipt Schedule&quot; in the financial company !!<br />
<br />
We just set the &quot;Receipt Schedule&quot; for the invoices we want from the open entries..<br />
<br />
Please indicate the sessions you are using to do this &quot;Receipt Schedule&quot; activation..<br />
<br />
<br />
any way,, try to set one line for the full amount of those invoices that has no &quot;Receipt Schedule&quot; as one payment in the &quot;Receipt Schedule&quot; session..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sorry, my wording were wrong or interprated in correctly. You are right that Receipt Schedule can activate for invoices from open entries. Please check the following link to see how I activated Receipt Schedule parameters. <br />
