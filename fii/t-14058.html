<br />
Is there anyway in baan, wherein when the Receipt is approved thro maintain approvals, the system should pass direct Credit to the supplier account.  We dont want to do the match and approval process.<br />
<br />
Our idea is to reduce the workload of match and approval and instead concentrate on other activities of accounting.<br />
<br />
Since, all the receipts are created thro POs, we can put a control there, instead of checking the values of bills against receipt after the material is purchased.<br />
<br />
Anybody has any solution for this?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">29th December 2003, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally u can not override Baan steps and securities. However u can achieve your purpose in this case following way.<br />
<br />
1. Populate tfgld410,418,415,411,412,413,414 etc table immediately after approvals is done in distribution. The transaction origin has to be External and financial transaction has to be purchase invoice. There is no need to populate tfgld417 (the way sales/sales invoices works) .<br />
<br />
2. Run Post integration transaction  (tfgld4201m000) in AFS for transaction origin 'External' and Financial transaction 'Purchase Invoice'. This will create purchas invoice in Finance . The session tfgld4201m0000 has specific programming code for External/Purchase Invoice.<br />
<br />
3. Start match invoices session tfacp1130m000 using AFS and approve the purchase invoice there.<br />
<br />
4. After print the non-finalized transactions (tfgld1401m000) with /without AFS.<br />
<br />
And u have the purchase invoices posted and approved. <br />
<br />
Though this is lengthier process, it is sure shot and right procedure to accomplish the objective u desire.<br />
<br />
U may also use atomatic matching parameters in tfacp0100m000 besides this approach to take advantage of automatic matching parameters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">20th January 2004, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
We did a customization that Match, Approves Purchase Invoice. As you know there is always a timing difference betwen receipts of goods and receipt of invoice from supplier. Our AP used to check every day if the goods have been received or and apporved through QC. We completely eliminated this step. Now as soon as Invoices are received, AP enters the invoice details in a customized Baan session and thats all. From that point onward system does all the work.<br />
Every night system looks for recieved Purchase Order and tries to match and appove the order and Invoice. If there are any advance payment linked it also offsets that. At then end system emails an HTML report to the AP stating what invoiced got processed, $value,, what are still open and the reason foe being open. This has made the Goods recived not invoiced account reconicle very easy. It took some time for me to do it as I am not a Baan finance person, so I had figure out what tables gets updated. If you want to see the logic I can send the document.<br />

<br />
I thought, I was the one having this problem.  It seems, many people are in the queue.  The method followed by Arvind, was not suitable for me, since we have a different system at our place.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have developed the program in this way.<br />
<br />
When the material is received at the main gate, the Material receipt entry and Purchase Invoice details entry will be made at once at gate itself.  MR entry will be done in baan, and a customised session will capture the link between MR no. and purchase invoice details.  This entry will go to received purchase invoices table.<br />
<br />
AP will run a customised program, which will show all the transactions which are approved by QA and their corresponding MR value and the invoice value.  In case of any discrepancies between MR value and Invoice value, it will not be booked.  All other transactions, wherever the amount matches, will be shown in an excel like grid(partywise, since we book all the bills partywise).  AP can then choose the transactions to be booked (any no. of transactions can be booked at once).  All these transactions are then booked and the approved transactions are then put in a non-finalised batch.  This batch can then be finalised by AP.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions to improve this?<br />

you've probably noticed that a large crowd is interested in your solution, not to speak about them to shy to ask you  for your code!<br />
Wouldn't it be a great idea to post it here on this forum.  I'm interested to see how you solved it.<br />

Mine is a customized solution to address my business need. Here is what isi based on<br />
1. AP enters the invoice detail into a custom Baan session. No GL posting takes place at that ime.<br />
2. When goods are received system tries to match and approve the invoice. It only matches and approves the complete invoice.<br />
3. It sends a email notification of all the processed and un processed invoices to AP. It also give the reason for not being able to process it.<br />
<br />
I can post the documentation and the code that I have written, if user needs it. And I am not sure how do I do this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">18th March 2004, 13:16</div></div><div class="posttext">The customized solution developed by Arvind is excellent. And one can always create , test and use such solutions as long as it meets their business requirements,increases automation without hampering standard flow.<br />
<br />
In this regard  we  had registered a case with Baan quite earlier and we had got  following solution which might be of help to people who may wish to use standard facility of external/purchase invoice . We are yet to create program in this direction due to lower priority for this task. However it may help  anybody who wish to use the standard functionality built in Baan integrations for External/Purchase invoice.<br />
<br />
Our case no. with Baan is  1007604 and the solution we got is quite detailed one .<br />
<br />
Case description:  <br />
if we want to update records in tfgld410(Display Integration Transactions) with field tfgld410.tror(transaction origin) = external package and field tfgld410.fitr(financial transaction) = purchase invoice .how do we update this record<br />
 <br />
Solution description: <br />
There is no specific documentation which explains you how this can be done, however on simulation at my end you need to atleast update the following tables and fields.<br />
<br />
tfgld017 increment the last used document # by 1.<br />
tfgld018 insert a document with reserved status.<br />
tfgld410 insert transaction type, document #, supplier code, ledger account, dimensions, fiscal, reporting, tax year as well as period, document date, amount, debit/credit, country, transaction date &amp; time, order #, position, sequence, temp field for unique.<br />
tfgld412 insert transaction type, document #, terms of payment and due date.<br />
tfgld415<br />
tfgld416<br />
tfgld418 insert transaction type, document #, finance co, order, order position, transaction status, line number and temp field for unique.<br />
<br />
Now on posting integration transaction using tfgld4201m000 the system will populate tables tfgld102 as well as tfacp200.</div></div><hr />

 Hi Avpatil,<br />
<br />
Reading your description I was not clear on this statement that you have written in paragraph 2 &quot;If there are any advance payment linked it also offsets that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I am assuming that if an free standing advance transaction is in the system for that vendor then your program will link it to this new invoice that you are matching and processing...Is my assumption correct?<br />
 <br />
If yes, then does the system link/apply the advance to this new invoice ?? What is there are are 2 advances (does the advance have any reference to get linked to the right invoice&quot;??) <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.: does anyone know that if 810IN is processed for AP, does the EDI also do the entire match(using auto matching) or only does the load in a AP invoice booking batch that it creates. - Some insight in the EDI 810IN processing for fianance is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

We do wire transfer for imports. We have made a procedure to have one wire transfer per Purchase Invocie. When AP mainatians the Purchase Invoice they also links the wire transfer number (Advance payment) and system offsets the advance payment to PurchaseInvoice.<br />
