Integration elements allow you to post transactions to different dimensions within a particular ledger account.  This can be done based on different options eg. customer, area etc.  <br />
<br />
If you look at the help on the baan application this should help you with many of your questions.</div></div><hr />

On the subject of debit/credit integration elements,<br />
let's suppose that, in a goods receipt transaction, you want to post into the dimension &quot;product&quot; within the debit account and into the &quot;coutry of origin&quot; dimension within the credit account. The possibility to choose different rules of posting dimensions depending on the debit or credit transaction, is the purpose of the debit and credit integration element.<br />
Hope this will help.<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">24th April 2003, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">In most cases, the debit and credit integration element will be the same (and there have been problems in the past, in Baan IV, when you entered a different integration element for debit and credit).<br />
<br />
Only when you have a good reason for a different mapping to financial dimensions for the debit and the credit side of a transaction would you consider using different integration elements. <br />
<br />
A common example where this is the case is for labour cost related transactions, where the cost (debit) side is split out into product related dimensions and the labour recovery (credit) side is broken down by department. Since these would be different dimension types you could still use just one integration element to achieve this. <br />
<br />
Only when you want to break down the debit side by departments linked to products and the credit side by departments linked to the employee would you need two separate integration elements. The only time I ever had to do that was for Project Industries integration transactions.</div></div><hr />
