This error may be because of some rounding factor issue. Get it corrected from Infor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is just a warning message. you can close period then do automatic balancing.<br />
After completion of above process then go for finally closing periods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katiekelley</div><div class="date">17th July 2012, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend that you do the rebuild by period as part of your month end close so when you get to year end this doesn't cause problems.  Also a rebuild CAN change financial numbers since if the totals are not correct due to a system issue that happens and if you are publicly traded and have reported already these changes can be a big problem.  You also will need the GLD open in the last period to do your autobalancing</div></div><hr />
