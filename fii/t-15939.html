Is it safe to delete (using sql) some old transactions in tfgld432 (Integration transactions log).<br />
<br />
The reason we want to do this, is because there are errors from 2002, due to old Integrations Transaction Scheme definition, and we dont want to run again Post for these old transactions.(Companies are closed)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vernabush</div><div class="date">9th July 2004, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">How were you able to close periods (Maintain Period Status tfgld0107m000 or Close Periods tfgld1206m000) in 2002 if there were unposted integration transactions (tfgld416)?  If Baan is working correctly, and periods are closed correctly through the above sessions, you cannot close periods before all integrations are posted and batches finalized.<br />
<br />
Unless there is a defect that prevents Integration Posting tfgld4201m000 from removing the errors as transactions are corrected and posted, you should not remove the errors directly from the tables.  You should always post all integrations and let that remove the errors: <br />
<br />
First check tfgld416 to see if you have unposted integrations.  If you do, then it will be a little messy to go back so many years but you definitely should post all even if they are in 2002.  This will impact financials, so Print Integration Transactions tfgld4410m000 report first to get total EUR impact before you do anything.  <br />
<br />
If possible, test all this in your test environment first, especially if you have done General Table Maintenance and/or Finally Closed periods/Closed Fiscal Years 2002-2004.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was also my wonder. How can we finally close all periods when still unposted integration transactions exists. When trying to Post old integrations (ex from 01/10/2002), I found out that non-finalized transactions created in tfgld102, with document date 01/01/2002, but the fiscal period and year was the first open period of the company (03/2004). So I suppose baan works fine.  All our Integrations are with Purchasing, so I assume that BaanERP let you close the periods, although you havent invoiced some pending but delivered orders (or something like that) <br />
<br />
The fact is that our financial dept, closed those periods without posting all the integrations with purchasing.  Before closing those periods, they correct manually all the accounting differences, by creating stand-alone financial transactions (!!!).<br />
Now, if I post those old transactions (according to Fin dept) will be a mess.<br />
Tfgld416 has unposted old (less than 2004) records. <br />
Ive created a scheduled job that posts only transactions later than 01/01/2004, but tfgld432 displays all the errors and its very difficult to find out if my schedule job produce some errors, cause it displays every error since 2002.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Ill try to find out, what posting all transaction will cause.<br />
Otherwise I just wanted to know, what clearing tfgld432 (it is just a log or not) means.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your interest. <br />
