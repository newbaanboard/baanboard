Would like to include negative sales order lines on a sales invoice without creating a credit note.<br />
<br />
For example, <br />
<br />
a sales order with 2 lines.<br />
<br />
1) Line 1 = $100.00<br />
<br />
2) Line 2 = - 50.00<br />
<br />
3) Total invoice = $50.00<br />
<br />
Presently, Baan creates two documents (a sales invoice and a credit note).  The sales invoice will be for $100.00 and the credit note will be for $50.00.  Would like a single document.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">28th October 2002, 15:08</div></div><div class="posttext">one other thing you have to do is in your billing request additions, check to overwrite sales orders and credit transaction types. Then in your billing request, select that addition and indicate the transaction type to use. If you only use the 'collect sales orders' options on your invoicing method you will likely get 2 invoices - 1 with the sales invoice transaction type and 1 with the credit note transaction type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shafco2</div><div class="date">28th October 2002, 20:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies.  What I did was replace the transaction type for credit notes in the SLI Parameters to match the transaction type for sales invoices.  I also modified the transaction type to allow negative values.<br />
<br />
This change seems to have fixed the issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
I have set all the things you all have written. But it's not working. Shafco 2, is there any setting you have changed besides the points in this discussion?<br />
<br />
Somebody help me!</div></div><hr />

Please post your invoicing methods set-up and I will check it against mine.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
