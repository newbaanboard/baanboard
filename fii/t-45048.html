<br />
In FAM Module, i have entered the Asset purchased using Assets (tffam1500m000) session qty 1 @ Rs.5000/- and accordingly the status is shown as entered. Thus the assets record is maintained but not capitalised.<br />
<br />
Then, in Accounts Payable module, the purchase invoice from Business Partner is accounted for by using transaction type of purchase invoice with category &quot;Cost Invoice&quot;  is done. And also accounting of the &quot;Interim Asset Investment&quot; ledger account with Fixed Asset Integration &quot;Investment&quot; is linked by selecting the &quot;Asset&quot; recorded in FAM Module &quot;Assets&quot;(tffam1500m000) session.<br />
<br />
However, the problem is when the above steps are done, the current quantity and current amounts gets double ie. 2 nos. &amp; 10000 value, which is manually can be edited before capitalisation.<br />
<br />
The query is why the quatity &amp; amount is doubled in the Assets record.<br />
<br />
Kindly help.<br />
<br />

<br />
Initially you have gone into FAM and maintained the asset and again using ACP you have added the same.<br />
<br />
It will get doubled as you are entering the asset again using ACP. If you always want to use ACP to register the purchase of the asset then it will automatically take you to the assets session to maintain it. You need not maintain the asset seperately in FAM again.<br />
<br />
I hope this clears your doubts.<br />

<br />
Thanks for  immediate reply. I have tried from ACP module but I am unable to maintain the assets using Assets (tffam1500m000) session from ACP Module as the field &quot;new&quot; is disabled in the session for maintaing assets and only find &amp; select option is available. Hence, i first maintained Assets from FAM Module. <br />
Had i missed any required step or is there any settings issues.<br />
<br />
Kindly help me.<br />
<br />
Thanking you<br />
<br />

In the invoice related session check on form2 wherein you can fill in the asset number and save the transaction. The asset ledger account should have the Units field also enabled.<br />
<br />

I tried the same and as said earlier creating of asset number &amp; maintaining asset record in FAM module is not possible from Accounts Payable module as it only select the Assets maintained and field&quot;new&quot; is disabled.<br />
<br />

<br />
The problem is resolved now, while maintaining the Assets record Assets (tffam1500m000) session in FAM Module, the value has to be kept 0 &quot;Zero&quot; which not mandatory field, with this the Asset number is generated without value and then through Accounts Payable Module, the aforesaid asset record to the ledger wtih option &quot;Investments&quot; &quot;Purchase Invoice Transactions&quot;tfacp1120s000 session, the amount is updated in the FAM Module. In this manner the recording of double amount and current quantity is avoided manually.<br />
