<br />
Just thought I'd see how many of you are generating e-invoices in BaaN and how you're achieving it.<br />
<br />
I currently using B2WIN and Cognos Impromptu.  Both can do the job, but both fall short in certain areas (I won't bore you with the facts unless requested).<br />
<br />
Any feedback appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">4th May 2010, 20:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We generate PDFs invoices and email them through a s/w called Formscape. We also post the invoices on our B2B site so that customer can access them. I don't think Cognos is a good tool to do this kind of job. S/w like formscape are document management s/w and they do a good job in that. We can fax, print, post (on a different kind of paper), email all from Baan by this. The baan o/p is same in all these cases, and formscape handles the format and distributing of the document.<br />
<br />
We generate all our other docuements like Purchase Order, Picking list, Commercial Invoice, Packing slip, Customer statement, different kinds of labels, Reirn Authorization, Reapir Authorization from this s/w, with the ability to fax, print and email</div></div><hr />

I'll take a look.  Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />
