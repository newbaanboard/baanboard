  I have a problem with fixed assets integrations.Whenever a fixed assets transaction(investment,depreciation,disposal) is performed a financial integration transaction is created automatically and a batch is created(normal baan 5 c functionality(.But there are no debit/credit entries in this batch.When this batch is finalized ,only the message finalized successfully is displayed.The journal transaction type document gets used with no transaction lines<br />
<br />
The version is Baan 5.0c and all the integration mappings are done for various transactions.Also the FAM parameters ,suppress journal entries is set to ,'NO'.<br />
<br />
Can anyone point out the problem or is it a bug...<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance,<br />

One of the things that we ran into was that for many of the transactions in FAM, it picks up the Debit from one integration mapping and the Credit from another mapping.<br />
What service pack are you on? What type of transaction are you running when you get the empty transactions created? I will try to run some tests here and see what I get.<br />

  Iam trying to capitalize an asset followed by depreciation..<br />
Everytime in the nonfinalized a transaction batch is created using the transaction type defined in FAM parameters.<br />
We are on service pack-6 version Baan 5.0c.<br />
Please try like this..<br />
define a new asset and after that try to capitalize it.Iam getting the message that the process is completed successfully and the asset book inquiry also shows the status.<br />

I tested here and it worked ok and created actual transactions in GL. The Asset Book inquiry looks ok also. On the integrations it is picking up the DR from the Fixed Asset/Asset mapping and the CR from the Fixed Asset/Capital Accumulation mapping when I capitalize the asset. We may not have all of the latest patches in for FAM so perhaps there is something that recently caused this.  How are your asset books and book parameters on the FAM parameters set up?</div></div><hr />

<br />
    We were adviced not migrate to 5c from our current version of BaaN IV C4 because of the the Fixed Asset Module .Is the Fixed Asset Module working fine in BaaN 5c as in BaaN IV C4? I have heard that it has a major problem, is it true? <br />
<br />
Any experience and share some light on this is highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">1st July 2003, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">That certainly was the case - 5c was released before the fixed asset module was anything like ready. However, if you are up to date on SPs you should be O.K. now. Can't remember which one was the clincher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">9th July 2003, 06:17</div></div><div class="posttext">In BaaN 5c<br />
<br />
1. How is the setup different from BaaN IVc C4?<br />
2. How does one handle CIP entries &amp; reporting<br />
3.Conversion of Book Depreciation<br />
4. Tax Depriciation<br />
5. Keeping up with Laws ie US IRS laws?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

We have been on 5c since November 2002 and are going to start up the fixed assets in the next two months....we do not run on the very latest SP but can you tell me which SP you are on where things are working....just want to make sure we are up to that one at least...<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

We do not actually use Baan fixed assets because our implementation was started before the fixed assets module was ready, and we did not deem it worthwhile to go back and fix it.<br />
I'm thinking we got up to SP6 and it was around about there that it was fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_r</div><div class="date">10th July 2003, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Everybody,<br />
<br />
We have BaaN V SP 6.<br />
<br />
We are working with FAM and it works fine.<br />
<br />
But...when we sell a Fixed Asset and this is not completelly &quot;amortized&quot;, there is a problem, at least in my country.<br />
<br />
ThatÂ´s to say: <br />
The system is &quot;cancelling or nulling&quot; the costs of amortization and the acumulated amortization (BOTH), we only need to &quot;cancel&quot; the acumulated amortization, the cost are assumed by the company which ussed this Fixed Asset until before to sell it.<br />
<br />
When we sell a Fixed Asset and this is completelly amortized; there is no problem, the system only &quot;Cancell&quot; the acumulated amortization.<br />
<br />
 Please, do your tests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />
