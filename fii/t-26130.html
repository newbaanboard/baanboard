<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kanbaan456</div><div class="date">18th January 2006, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, these kind of differences are very common in Baan IV. <br />
You have lot´s of chances to see such differences.<br />
<br />
First check, if you have all Integration transactions processed to finance and also finalized these bookings in Finance! (No integration errors, etc!)<br />
<br />
Please be aware, Baan Logistic doesn´t take care on Fiscal Periods, so this can also may result in a Difference to Baan Finance.<br />
<br />
Of course, the most common reason for differences (beside &quot;simple&quot; Software-Bugs) is the integration Setup. <br />
<br />
On the first run, you can check the balance of your inventory account against the Inventory per Item or Warehouse report in Logistics.<br />

<br />
You say it is very common in Baan 4. Does this also happen in LN?<br />
Will this issue be solved in LN? Can we see more clearly the stock in warehouse and that it will tally with Finance at each monthend.<br />
<br />
thanks and regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kanbaan456</div><div class="date">21st January 2006, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, they did a lot of improvement on that issue in LN. <br />
For examply, LN does a lot of checks on the consistency of the integration setup, but it is not possible, to prevent a user 100% from doing wrong.<br />
<br />
LN provides also tools to do a regular periodic reconciliation of (integration) accounts<br />
<br />
