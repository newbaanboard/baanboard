<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">27th June 2002, 09:35</div></div><div class="posttext">This is interesting.  I've never created a payment method like that, why would you want to create one without using anticipated payments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">27th June 2002, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason is that currently we have one bank relation linked to three payment methods (CK= check, MC= Manual Check, WT = Wire Transfer).  The transaction type that we are using to reconcile our payments is CHK.  The problem that I am facing is this.  When we run our cleared check report it picks up all three payment methods.  For the Manual check it's not a big issue since we only do one or two a year if that.  The Wire transfers are the problem, we have to pull each one of them out of the report to determine what our true cleared check balance is.  The second area is that when we pay by wire transfer the funds come out of our cash account imediately.  We don't need to go through the reconciliation process.  The final problem is this when we pay by wire it's in payment of foreign amounts.  When the system clears the payment it does it for the exact amount that the payment was made for.  Their is a field that you can input the actual amount paid but it overrides it when it process the record.  We end up doing a J/E to adjust our cash account and FX currency gain/loss account to actual for each payment we make since the bank uses a different FX rate then what we have in the system.  We don't want to change the FX rates in the system to match the banks each time we do a deal.  <br />
<br />
When you combine all of these factors it would cut down on the amount of work we have to do to handle this situation.<br />
<br />
Now all we would need to do is process the payment and the system will Dr. Accounts payable and Cr. Cash when this is done.  Then do a J/E to adjust cash and FX Gain/Loss.  Rather then having to go through the entire reconciliation process.<br />
<br />
We want to keep the anticipated payments in place for our checks since they do not clear our cash account at the bank until a later date.<br />
<br />
The only way that I can figure it to work is to setup a new Bank relation and link a new payment method and Transaction type as well as Mtn. Data by Bank/Pmt Mtd.  making sure that I set the anticipated fields to NO.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I didn't lose you in this<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<br />
I replicated your requirement and created a Payment method with aniticipated payment(both the fields) set to &quot;No&quot;.  I then linked this payment method with a Bank that already has another payment method linked with it and made an advance payment using a foreign currency.  In the session tfcmg1120m000 I changed the exchange rate also to a rate different from the master rate.  I then processed the record.  I got no problems.  <br />
<br />
What was the message that came up in the session tfcmg0145m000 when you tried to maintain the bank/payment method combination?  You have to fill in the field &quot;Anticipated payment ledger account&quot; with a dummy account number and also give the series number for the transaction type tied to the bank.  <br />
<br />
You will not be able to reach the zoom session.  But this is not required.<br />
<br />
The entry ultimately passed was<br />
Debit - Advance payment<br />
Credit - Bank<br />
<br />
The rate of exchange used was the rate I input in the session tfcmg1120m000. <br />
<br />
I am on Baan IVc3<br />
<br />
I hope this helps<br />
