<br />
What is your procedure for clearing balances from ACR left from foreign curr paymants?<br />
those have arised as big currency amounts have been matched with the sales invoice. So the document has a insignificant balance e.g 0,03 in  HC, but zero in FC. How is the best way to get rid of them?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madan.meegada</div><div class="date">14th December 2007, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">In some cases, write off currency difference may not solve the issue.  Because already the balance is zero.  If you want these amounts to be cleared to avoid issues in aging analysis (which inturn blocks logistics), you can manually clear those using GTM in table tfacr200.  Mind that you need to change the entries of the receipt too.  If you cant change the receipt, create one receipt posting with only home currency amount and zero FC amount.  Infact this works like currency difference record.  Otherwise if someone runs recalculate BP balances, the balance will come back and create issue again.  But clearing only in tfacr200 will cause the difference in control account checklist.  For this to handle you need to do manual changes in tfgld102/106.  But, if the periods are already closed, we can not do anything.  Usullay Aging Analysis will have more priority than Control account checklist as per my knowledge.</div></div><hr />
