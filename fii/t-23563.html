<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acompain</div><div class="date">30th March 2005, 01:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Every month we have to go into file tiacr200 and modify the interest field flag in all the records &quot;cain' so we can have the interest calculated.  For some reason this flag starts out okay during the month but gets changed in all the invoice records prior to running interest.  we also have 2 types of runs (wholegoods and parts) and sometimes the second run will go okay and sometimes it won't and we have to rest flag again.   Any ideas as to problem would be appreciated   tks in advance</div></div><hr />
