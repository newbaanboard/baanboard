In Baan ERP LN (FP5) we have session where we could view the integration transactions for a particular order. If we take a Purchase order for example, we can view the transactions and also take an output. However, the order transactions for a PO and its Inventory transactions are different and we need to switch to view them. Is there any way to see the entire GL transactions for a particular PO or Sales Order or Service order. Is there any standard session to generate this in Baan ERP LN. Please let us know on this, or do we need to customise for this purpose.</div></div><hr />

I checked the solution 1059274 on Infor site and it reads as &quot;Zoom on business object company doesn't show financial only companies&quot; and is related to Map Integration transaction session. Can you please check and let us know the right solution number. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

While going through the solution for session tfgld4582m000, I found the solution number 1015217 which is for &quot;How to print all integrations related to an order in one report? e.g. integrations related to purchase order.&quot; This seems to suit our requirement. Is this the solution number that you meant, please let us know. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I have installed solutions 251559 and 248714 and the report is now available and working fine. The system has added a report session tfgld4482m100 from the print option of session tfgld4582m000 and is working fine. Thanks for all the help.</div></div><hr />
