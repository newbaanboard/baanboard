<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">When trying to close the year (tfgld6203m000) the following error message pops up:<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; Currency Translation Account not found (tfcmgs0111) &lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
The ledger account intered in the Company Parameters (tfgld0103m000) is of type &quot;Balance Sheet&quot;, only &quot;Statutory&quot;, and not blocked.<br />
<br />
Periods are open for the new year and finally closed for the old year (after P&amp;L posting).<br />
<br />
Running BaanERP 5.0b with Service Pack 6 loaded.<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I think the year-end program checks both before it starts processing. The reason is that if you want to know whether complementary accounts have been used in the system, it will have to check the full account table whether complemenatry accounts have been used. This costs time, so that is the reason I guess that both accounts (staturory and complementary) are checked eventhough maybe the dual accounting functionality has not been used at all.<br />
<br />
I know that with SL158180 this check is done in tfgld6203 and the complementary currency translation account does not have to be filled in, in the company parameters. So either fill in this complemenatry currency translation account or install SL158180.<br />
