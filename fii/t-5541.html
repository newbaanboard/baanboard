<br />
I am using Baan IVc.<br />
<br />
Currently the way it is set-up now is that a freight accrual account has been created and it gets credited each time there is a purchase receit.<br />
<br />
ie Debit: Inventory - Raw<br />
    Credit: A/P Accrual<br />
    Credit: Freight Accrual<br />
<br />
The way it clears is that when the freight expense actually comes in, the expense gets debbited against the accrual.<br />
<br />
Does this some about right to anyone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">larkin_jack2</div><div class="date">21st June 2002, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Then at the end of the month, what I do is take the difference in my freight accrual account and post it to my COGS.<br />
<br />
Something about this sounds strange, but this was the procedure I was given.<br />
<br />
What do you think!</div></div><hr />

Inventory Costs&quot; then charge the freight to this account so that it will not affect our standard cost of our inventory items.  For our Cost items we just let the freight go to the applicable expense account.</div></div><hr />
