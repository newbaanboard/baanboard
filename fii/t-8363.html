<br />
There is a session in accounts receivable (session no tfacr2240m000), which is used to write off the balances against invoices. Many times it so happens that the invoice balance is negative. This session doesnot accept negatibve amount in the filed &quot;Maximun amount to be written off&quot;<br />
Is there any way to write off the credit balances in tfacr200.?<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

I see from the program script that it checks against the absolute value of the invoice balance so it should be OK also for negative invoice balances.<br />

<br />
I have checked. It doesnot allow negative amount in  the field &quot;Maximum amount to be written off&quot;<br />
I get message &quot;Negative amount not allowed&quot;<br />
We are on BaaNIVC4<br />
The negative amount allowed field ,  the transaction type used for posting the write off amount, is set to &quot;YES&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You did not understand me.<br />
You are allowed to write onle positive amounts on the screen, which is OK.<br />
<br />
The program now takes the absolute value of the invoice balance which is always a positive value, since the function &quot;abs&quot; turns a negative value to positive, and now it compares it to the Maximum Amount which is also positive, so the comparisson is valid and works OK.<br />

The solution works well. Thanks<br />
However do you remember some session in baan to write off the balances against &quot;Advances&quot; recd from custopmers,<br />
Say we reecive 100 from customer as advance and suibsequently we adjust the sales invoices against this advance,a dn suppose a balance of 0.15 remains for adjustment  and now we want to write off this balance of 0.15 thru the session .<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that such a program does not exist.<br />
The best way to deal with it is to create a fictitious Invoice document, (Only in Finance, you do not need a logistic invoice), and then close the advane against it.<br />
<br />
You can also look at threadid = 7506 which discusses the matter and get some more details about good and documented procedure to do it.<br />
<br />
Glad to help,<br />
