<br />
We have some production orders (with subcontract operations/ purchase orders) against which receipt is already done but approval is 0 as entire lot was rejected. And as such receipts with 0 do not appear for matched and approved in Finance, Is there any way to close these production orders withoud doing match and approve in finance. For example chaing flag in Purchase order lines.  Back Order is zero. PO line status is &quot;Deleting line...&quot; with status code 9. Can anybody guide how this can be done.<br />
