<br />
In the GRNI module, a difference between debit and credit entries for a given purchase order is shown in session tfacp1535m000. Therefore, a correction line is created using session tfacp1137s000 (reachable from the first session). Then, the following sessions are executed: tfacp1535m000, tfacp1240m000 and tfacp1535m000. The result is a order line by the amount of the correction, and a diary entry in Finance by the same amount. To this point, all is fine. The problem comes when the balances by order lines are printed using session tfacp1435m000, and the order line that was corrected, is shown, just as if it had not been corrected.<br />

I think maybe IÂ’m missing some step. Any suggestion will be appreciated.<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Any correction created has to be posted, finalized and again selected in the GRNI table. I think that after you have done this the correction is &quot;visible&quot;.<br />
