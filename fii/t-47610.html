<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">txarmel</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
when doing a query on tfacp200 it was returning float exception error.<br />
When i looked in the data, i found some records with the following value<br />
-1.#IND.  This value was in fields of type double.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how this data gets recorded in the database? How do I avoid this from happening again?<br />
<br />
By the way i am running BaaN IV c4 with SQLServer 2000-<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">txarmel</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">When you get a division by zero, BaaN gives Fatal Error and does not save anything.<br />
In this case, there was no error when doing the calculation, the invoice was posted and paid for ok.<br />
<br />
When trying to print Supplier Invoices I got the error. I tried to do the query directly from the database and GOT THE SAME ERROR (it was an sql server error)<br />
I went into General Tabla Maintance and saw this value in tfacp200.balc = <br />
1.#1ND.</div></div><hr />

Programs updating the balc field are invoicings , corrections , payments , allocations , currency differences , payment differences etc . U need to monitor such invoices for further occurrences in future. <br />
<br />
U can correct the error in SQL server through SQL  query . Also tfacp2245m000 can probably correct this .</div></div><hr />
