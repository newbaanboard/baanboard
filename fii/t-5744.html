<br />
I am trying to provisionally close my current fiscal year 2002 allowing me to roll the balance sheet opening balances to fiscal 2003.  The problem I am having is that session tfgld6201m000 only allows me to roll 2001 (the previouse year's balance).  Does anyone know what session allows me to create a new fiscall rolling or what is preventing me from rolling my 2003 opening balances.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Steve<br />
<br />
By the way, I am using BaaN IV c4</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have to close definitely year 2001 to be able to run the provisional close of year 2002. <br />
<br />
That's all.<br />
The provisional close of the year is only running for the year which is &quot;current year&quot; in session tfgld0103m000. <br />
<br />

<br />
The Provisional Opening Balance is created for the (single) &quot;current&quot; fiscal year. When progressing into the next fiscal year you may create an OB based on the previous fiscal year, that in Baan will be the &quot;current year&quot;.<br />
<br />
Baan only has one &quot;current year&quot; and that's the only year that can be used to calculate a prov OB from to be used in the &quot;next year&quot;.<br />
<br />
This OB is an temporary update of the tfgld20* tables and will be deleted when you eiter - create a new prov OB, or - create a final OB, or - when you recalculate the totals (tfgld3203 session). In the latter case you need to run the Create Prov OB session (gld6201) again.<br />
<br />
In your situation I think you need to close the 2001 year first as Baan will see this as the &quot;current year&quot;.<br />
<br />
Succes,<br />

<br />
First do close year 2001. After all procedures the 'current year' in session:tfgld0103m000 or field tfgld004.year will automaticcaly be higher for n+1. Actually, after that currenty year in within session 'Maintain company parameters' should be 2002.<br />
<br />
Than try to run session tfgld6201m000 'Closing the year-provisional'. Before that just look into session. Current fiscal year should be 2002 and next fiscal year should be 2003. Tha it is O.K.<br />
<br />
By no means You can not change just parameters in tfgld004 and just change current fiscal year.<br />
<br />
Regards and good luck!<br />

<br />
I want to start by thanking you for the quick response.  I &quot;Finally Closed&quot; my year 2001 but I still cannot get the parameter year to chank=ge to 2002 so I can Close-provisionally and roll my balances of 2002 to 2003.  I did the following steps:<br />
[LIST=1] I ran the Automatic Balancing session (tfgld6202) and finalized the transaction<br />
 Finally closed my year 2001 (tfgld1206)<br />
 Closed the year (tfgld6203)[/LIST=1]<br />
Is there a bug or am I doing something wrong?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Steve</div></div><hr />

If you did not get this message than perhaps it did not complete. Did you get this message?<br />

<br />
Yes It did.  There was some Finalization errors that I fixed.  It was due to some accounts being blocked.<br />
<br />
Everything is perfect now<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />
