Current year is from oct 1, 2001 until sept 30, 2002.<br />
They want to change their next fiscal years equal to the calender year. So they have to bridge 3 months. From their German sister-company they have got the proposal to make a bridge fiscal year 3002 from oct 1,2002 until dec 31, 2002. Next fiscal year is 3003 starting jan 1, 2003.<br />
They use also reporting periodes and tax-periods. They have the intention to make a 3 period long fiscal year (3002).<br />
Can anybody give me pro's and contra's for this proposal, regarding that they know that the fas module cannot be used anymore.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Another alternative could be to make the year 2002 a year of 15 periods OR 12 periods with last period consisting of 4 months !! . For statutory purpose , you may have to many things manually . And year transitions has to be planned and monitored closely by Finance experts . In that case company can carry on with natural year mapping to calendar year . <br />
<br />
I am sure no company would have tested 3003 /3004 scenario in live .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done this kind of conversion last year. Same idea, the FY changed from Oct-Sep to a full calender year.<br />
We changed the number of periods to 16 instead of 13; created dummy correction periods for the previous years; created 3 new periods in the current year.<br />
<br />
Next, we changed the data that was already posted into periods 01, 02 and 03 to periods 13, 14 and 15. The correction postings in 13 were moved to the new correction period 16.<br />
<br />
This required a number of conversion scripts, but the advantages are evident. Reporting is done in a normal way, all calculations in CAL, FAS are done properly, no funny looking reports with odd years.<br />
<br />
This solution was accepted by the auditors.<br />
<br />
This may differ from your situation as you're not yet in October now.</div></div><hr />
