<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">3rd September 2010, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Im thinking that this means the extension of the file, like .txt or .prn files? I assume the Start positon and End position mean where the data starts on the row? Or perhaps it means how many columns there are in the file? Im having trouble understanding this as I think its the cause of why in the convert EBS I dont see any or the test files I have.<br />

<br />
Record types for an EBS are used to identify each line in the EBS File. The bank will usually provide a record layout for the bank file.  This information will be used to define the conversion details.<br />
<br />
For testing purpose you can create record types as follows:<br />
Define start position &quot;1&quot; end position &quot;1&quot; and value A<br />
<br />
Use record type and create conversion data. Note that in the conversion data you can not use first position.  Because the first position is now reserved for record type.  Starting from position 2, you can create conversion data (Ofcourse, in the real scenario these positions will be based on bank's own layout).<br />
<br />
For example the record in your file will look like below for our testing:<br />
A.......<br />
<br />
Record type is not file extension.  It is used to create conversion data.  In the global scenario, for some banks the record structure will be depending on the record type. <br />
<br />
For example, if there are two record types like A and B<br />
The setup will be as follows:<br />
Define start position &quot;1&quot; end position &quot;1&quot; and value A<br />
Define start position &quot;1&quot; end position &quot;1&quot; and value B<br />
<br />
A &amp; B can have different conversion data.<br />
for example A conversion data is as follows:<br />
A &lt;Incoming/Outgoing Receipt&gt;&lt;Date&gt;&lt;Amount&gt;<br />
<br />
Let us assume B conversion data as follows:<br />
B &lt;Date&gt;&lt;Amount&gt;&lt;Reference&gt;&lt;CheckNUmber&gt;&lt;Incoming/Outgoing Receipt&gt;<br />
<br />
Now the EBS file can contain both record types A &amp; B.<br />
System will check for the conversion data based on record type.<br />
<br />
Example file:<br />
A   i   01092010   1200.00<br />
B   02092010    2000.00 Reference-Testing  100   i<br />
<br />
Hope it is clear.<br />
please let me know if you have any further queries.<br />
<br />

<br />
I believe I understand the setup process now. For testing i took my flat file (.prn) and I placed a letter J in each of my rows, i.e. :<br />
<br />
J 2010-03-09  200.00   Wells Fargo Bank   123465<br />
J 2010-03-10  1395.15  Wells Fargo Bank  654321<br />
J 2010-03-10  459.95   Wells Fargo Bank   879654<br />
<br />
J is the record type value, or what Baan is looking for to read. Then in the maintain conversion Data for EBS I set each value as a detail along with the starting/ending points for each value. <br />
<br />
Im still having an issue with the actualy conversion process. My file name for testing is called 123456. This file doesnt seem to be working. Get an error first with EBS batch #1 saying file not found or in good format. I then change it to my 123456.prn file and it says batch not found. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">13th September 2010, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been able to successfully take a test file in import it into Baan. Heres a document I put together that helps better explain what to to. I hope this will help out as others try to use this feature and figure it out.  Thanks for your help Madan!!<br />
