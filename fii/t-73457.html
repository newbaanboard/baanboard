They've been using Baan IV for almost twenty years and all of the original expertise has since left or retired. The finance work instructions are now just hand written pages from tribal knowledge. Does anyone have a set of work instructions for invoice matching that they would be willing to share?<br />
<br />
My area is manufacturing and distribution now in LN so I have nothing in my archives on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I am currently working in a similar assignment in ERP LN.</div></div><hr />
