<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">18th March 2004, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I need to urgently create a list with all the purchase orders which are received but not yet invoiced. <br />
<br />
I know that there are sessions available in Baan (tfacp1235, tfacp1535, tfacp1237, tfacp1435 etc), however, people at our company have tried in the past to get that system working, without success. Currently it is for me not an option to contact Baan support about it, because our version is way behind, (SP9!!) and the first thing they will tell me is to install the latest solution. <br />
<br />
I am right now starting a migration to the latest service pack, but for now, I need to get this list out somehow without putting too much time in it.<br />
<br />
So my question: how do I get this list together? Which tables/table-field values are to be considered in order to determine the purchase order lines received, but not yet invoiced. Or, can I retrieve it maybe from an already existing report in Baan...?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to any help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
En.</div></div><hr />

We have created a custom session that monitors the Received not invoiced every day We have this account in control after we implemented this. I can provide with the logic and the output that we produce Email me at apatil@bogen.com, in case you want to see the result. <br />

<br />
We are also in SP9 but have been using GRINYA reconcilation and this has given very good results. We have not encountered any major problem with same.<br />
<br />
Advised is try again with standard functionality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been told that a couple of years ago there have been several attempts at our company to get GRNYI working, without success. This was however before I was in the picture here, so I have not tried it myself. <br />
<br />
Since however, we are right now upgrading to the latest version (SP16 if released on time), I am not putting any effort/energy in the old version. <br />
<br />
Since I needed to get this list sorted out urgently, I just needed a quick resolution for this issue. <br />
<br />
I will gladly receive the WATERPROOF logic from Arvind for retrieving the correct balances of the GRNYI ledger account. <br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">2nd May 2007, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">en@frrom - What was it you did to the already existing session tfacp1430?  I also went this route and I just put in the print condition of the detail layout of the report to only display if tdpur045.iamt was 0.  I don't believe this is correct though because said purchase order could be already invoiced on another record in that table.  I'm just not showing it.  I know this is an old posting and you may not recall but I wanted to give it a try.<br />
<br />
Thanks!  NikkiZ</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main thing I added is a form selection to select only rows where quantity received &lt;&gt; quantity invoiced, and adjusted all the reports accordingly. I don't know if you have access to the sources...? <br />
