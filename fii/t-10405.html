<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigcheese</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently working in session TDINV8150m000 Maintain Inventory and WIP accounts and have a basic question.  Do I need to define accounts for EVERY possible set of transactions or only the ones that I want integrations for? Specific example: I have no need to track the combination of Purchase and Issue. Are there problems created by not setting up this combo? <br />
Thanks from a newbie at integrations for inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emcandrew</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 04:15</div></div><div class="posttext">You just need the integration combinations for the transactions you will be using. (i.e. If you are not  using Purchase/Issue, you do not need to set it up).  However, if you do start using different functionality and the integration is not set-up it will error out.  To correct the error, set-up the integration combination and post integrations again.<br />

Good Luck,<br />

You will soon see what is left out by the integration errors.</div></div><hr />

Some versions of tdinv8150 session even let you set up combinations for which Baan will never create transactions.<br />
Just keep your eye on the integration log to check for errors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't really need to create integration mapping for transactions you are not using.  But within a particular transaction combination, there are priorities which the system assigns, about which you must be very careful.<br />
<br />
For example, you can map inv. trans. based upon warehouse, item group and item code.  If you leave all these fields blank, and map inventory transactions, say, by cost price components, this serves as a generic mapping for that combination.  Suppose there is an item group which you need to track into a separate set of accounts, then, you should map a separate set of accounts for this combination, by that item group also.  This will have an overriding effect on the above generic mapping for the combination.  Same is the case with warehouse.  If you don't map for these specific transactions (i.e., warehouses, item groups etc), even these specific transactions will get posted to the general accounts.<br />
