<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">1st February 2006, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
	Couple of days ago we finally closed year 2005 (tfgld6203m000). But, now we found that one the finance person forgot make a re-class entry in period 13.  So, is it possible to re-open the year, make the entry and close it again? Will it mess up anything? Are there any other way of doing this without re-opening the year?<br />
<br />
	Greatly appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrbraun1</div><div class="date">1st February 2006, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">No there is no way to post to period 13 if the year is closed.  Again, this is standard Baan.  There may be ways to go behind the scenes to accomplish this, but you need to proceed very carefully.........</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwbfin</div><div class="date">1st February 2006, 23:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, the GTM is the only way to reopen the period. Be aware that this should only be done in the current year, in case you accidentally finally closed a period.<br />
<br />
If you do so for already closed fiscal years and you make some changes, the closing balances will alter and thus no longer be the same as the opening balance of the next year... unless you change that as well. Baan does not support that in any way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">1st February 2006, 23:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry but that is not so - even if periods are reopened via GTM and then closed again (of course the fiscal year has to be changed back to prior year in tfgld004) all results will be fine - for sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">2nd February 2006, 00:38</div></div><div class="posttext">not hundred % sure about that what about the batch that gets finalised in first period of the following year for the Interim Closing Account when running tfgld6202m000,I would want to try this in a test system first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">2nd February 2006, 00:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your feedback. I think I was able to talk the finance department out of re-opening the year. Just too many unanswered questions and not sure about what might happen if we force it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">2nd February 2006, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no problem at all to do this. First change the year back in tfgld004, reopen last period prior year, open first period next year, do your corrections in period 13, make all the closures + finalize the batch. Close books old year, finalize batch with open balances new year - thats it. Done this many times with no problem at all.<br />

	Thanks again for your response. When you say make all the closures do you mean run the following sessions:<br />
<br />
	Close Year  Provisional<br />
	Automatic Balancing of Profit and Loss Accounts<br />
	Close Year.<br />
<br />
 I guess we should run this after finalizing the batch that we would create for period 13 for the corrections.<br />
<br />
	Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Did you check your trial balance? When doing this mutiple times, Baan will create an opening balance mutiple times too.<br />
<br />
So, every time you will do ' Close Year ' (tfgld6203m000) an opening balance will be created. So, your opening balance amounts will exist double, triple, etc.<br />
<br />
This means, that you should change your opening balance by ttaad before finalizing. Only the amounts added to the reopened year should be processed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">3rd February 2006, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">For this there is a correction programm tfcorxxx (forgot the exact programm) which fixes that. Anyway the amounts are not posted multiple times.<br />
