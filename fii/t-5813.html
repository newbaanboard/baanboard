<br />
I know some adjustments to this account were made directly, not through integrations, but when I tally them up I am still off quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I tried to rebuild ledger accounts but this didn't work either.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions of what reports I can run.<br />
<br />
Thank-you!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />
<br />
Without everyones' help on this board, I don't know what I would do.  This board has been great.</div></div><hr />
