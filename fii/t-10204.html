<br />
the same dilemma I also had couple of months back when the DOC cd no 8 came out with FAS and FAM but with similar documentation<br />
<br />
the latest doc cd now doesnt have the FAS and u can be rest assured that for BaaN 5 c its only FAM.<br />
<br />
Please check with your local vendor for the latest releases of the Documentations<br />
<br />

<br />
You are right. <br />
<br />
The documentation is the same, (Maybe it`s a mistake) but in the practice...there are many differences.<br />
<br />
The code of sessions, concept of&quot;books&quot;, Location Segments, Asset Distribution, Integration Mapping Scheme,  etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />
