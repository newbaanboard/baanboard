<br />
please advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">1st August 2005, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">The transaction type for purchase invoices has a field &quot;Match with purchase orders&quot;. There could be two types of trans types based on that, one with match purchase orders and the other without. For example we take with matching = P03, wthout matching = P02.<br />
<br />
When you enter a P02 invoice in the session, the status of the P02 dcument becomes &quot;Transactions Entered&quot; and will continue to remain like that. This is b'cos in this case there is no need to match with any PO.<br />
<br />
When you enter a P03 invoice in the session, the status of the P03 document becomes &quot;Registered&quot;. Later when it is matched with PO the status becomes &quot;Matched&quot; and when approved, the status becomes approved.<br />
<br />
Based on parameter setting, only approved P03 invoices can be paid. For P02, they can be paid in cash management, right after finalisation.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
