I just did a provisional close of our last financial year. The problem I have is that the opening balances geneareted by the provisional close for the new year are completely different from the closing balances of the last period of last financial year.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this problem before?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Maybe while you did provisional close,somebody worked in finance for the previous year  modifying the closing balance</div></div><hr />

I may be able to help you if you answer the following<br />
<br />
What version of Baan are you working with?<br />
I presume the year you have provisionally closed is 2004?<br />
Prior to doing the provisional close have you rebuilt any transactions?<br />
<br />

<br />
The problem is now solved. There was an unfinalized batch which originated from the final close of 2004. After we finalized the batch, we did a rebuild of ledger history with option opening balance on Yes, and then we did a provisional close again. The opening balances of our FY 2006 are now correct.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
