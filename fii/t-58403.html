<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srivinayak</div><div class="date">9th May 2010, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
 <br />
This is a question regarding Baan - CMG - Electrnoic Banking Statements.<br />
 <br />
Can any one help me in handling the following business case?<br />
<br />
Summary of the question - Does Baan EBS (Electronic Bank Statements) handles the scenario of excess amount received than the actual invoice balance or not? <br />
<br />
Or in other words,<br />
<br />
Does Baan EBS build with the assumption that the bank file always contain the exact amount or less amount than the actual invoice balance and not greater than the actual invoice balance?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Case Details -<br />
<br />
Customer has an invoice balance of 1000$ but customer has paid 1500$ as an advance in a single check through bank. The customer intention could be, to clear the invoice balance and keep the additional 500$ as an advance/unallocated. <br />
<br />
When Baan imports the bank file through EBS and tries to match the conversion line, the match will not go because of the excess receipt amount. Baan EBS does not allow changing the amount on converted line also. In that case, what is your recommendation to handle this transaction through Baan EBS?<br />
<br />
If there is any place to change the amount from Received amount to actual amount then how to keep track of the excess balance amount (in our example it will be 500$) through EBS only? <br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />
Srikanth</div></div><hr />

Using Manual Matching we can enter the receipt for invoice and separate advance (500).  After posting EBS, an advance receipt will be created.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srivinayak</div><div class="date">11th May 2010, 07:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot Madan. I got the same response from Infor too but the way you drafted clarified how to do this and all. When I open EBS session that your refered the add/duplicate icons are disabled. I got to know latter that once you double click the line, the detail session has the provision to add the excess amount. Thanks a lot Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />
