I wanted some help on, how to make a Invoice on BaaN V?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you want to customise the invoice layout, or are you wanting to know what data to enter so that you can generate and print an invoice for a customer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GustavoRF</div><div class="date">8th February 2006, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Both, I need to generate and print an invoice, because I did some changes on<br />
the session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">8th February 2006, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">You are still not being very clear. There are Baan sessions to do this. Do you need to know what standard Baan sessions to use, how the Baan logic works, how to create your own logic, how to call the Baan sessions from within different sessions....?  What is it you're looking for?? You have to be more specific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GustavoRF</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to know what standard Baan sessions I need to input data to<br />
create an Invoice and let it ready to print.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several ways to do this, you can go to Sales and enter a new sales order, do the delivery and then release the order to central invoicing, or just go and enter a manual sales invoice in central invoicing.  It all depends what you want to test.  After that you need to link the order to a billing request and Compose/Print/Post Invoices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a tools question.  I will move this to the finance/invoicing forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to slightly disagree with Maria. I think, with all due respect, that there is NO WAY to process an invoice without having the necessary (basic) functional knowledge of Baan, which obviously GustavoRF, you are not yet in the possession of. By just playing around without knowing what exactly you are doing, it is guarenteed that you will make very big mistakes, which will in turn cause severe damage to the system/company...<br />
