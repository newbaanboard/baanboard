On the error report i gets the message : &quot;Unable to find a ledger acccount for integration document type FAM_ASSE, elemts group ATF002 value 000020(this is the Asset Code) in the mapping scheme.<br />
<br />
I checked the mapping scheme and for FAM_ASSE, the group for ledger account is ATF002 The mapping ledger(tfgld4569m000) appears to be correct. There is a ledger account for all elements values.<br />
<br />
Does anybody has faced something like this? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">_Ralph_</div><div class="date">26th December 2008, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I checked. <br />
<br />
I found the error too, it was a standard error.<br />
<br />
We open an Incident, but until the solution comes I did a customization to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
Just for register, here is a description of what was wrong:<br />
<br />
<br />
On the calling of function tffam.dll0002.map.leac.dimx on the DLL tffam8505(line 4204) the fields of tffam100 used as arguments are with no values and them are not loaded anywhere.<br />
<br />
The customization select this fields before the calling function.<br />
<br />
Now everything works fine =)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the answer</div></div><hr />
