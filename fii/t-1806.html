<br />
<br />
We are a manufacturing company based in New Zealand, with distribution and support companies in 7 countries around the world. We are currently on Baan 4c4, with each company operating their own database. <br />
<br />
We are about to migrate to Baan 5, and at the same time move to a single-logistics / multi-finance structure. The goal is to provide visibility of inventory, sales orders etc throughout the group. Also to reduce the administration involved in processing sales from the manufacturing company to the sales companies. We will use bilateral invoicing (and possibly triangular) with reference to transfer price lists, and actual costing (MAUC) to enable inventory to be held at appropriate values in the sales companies. <br />
<br />
We have proved the key concepts involved to our own satisfaction, but would like to talk to anyone who is already successfully operating a similar environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On this documentation CD you find several documents about Baan and the Baan-modules.<br />
<br />
On this CD you find a document about costing in Baan5.0C (it contains more than 100 pages).<br />
<br />
This document provides you a lot of information about costing.<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />
