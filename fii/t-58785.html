I would like to keep this sales order type active.  However, I always want to block any sales order written with that sales order type.  Is there any way to always block all orders written with a specific sales order type?<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RHartmann</div><div class="date">9th July 2010, 21:32</div></div><div class="posttext">The normal credit blocking won't be enough in this case.  Under certain circumstances, a particular type of sales order needs to be reviewed every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reeyah</div><div class="date">10th July 2010, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, you cannot block a particular sales order type. My suggestion is, assigned this particular order type to a specific user using the Sales User Profiles session and then flag this user as Inexperienced Operator. Sales order created by this user will always be block.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keni99</div><div class="date">20th July 2010, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">HI, we had the same situation at our company, because a Sales order can't block. If a order insert (doesn't matter if it approved or not), than all data availbale for Warehouse and Enterprise Planning.<br />
We have decide to use for this Sales Quotations additional. That means if we have a order which should be not yet available for WH and EP but we would have it at the system than we insert it first as quotation with a specific number group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">22nd July 2010, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Get Qkey tool or similar products. You can do lot of fancy stuff with it. This situation could be dealt with very easily. We use it all the time.<br />
Next best option would be what 'reeyah' mentioned - inexperienced operator, but here all the orders entered by this user will be blocked. Dont know if that would be practical at your business</div></div><hr />
