<br />
I'm having issues when trying to reconcile my GRNI numbers with the actual Ledger numbers for invoices actually paid. Even though invoices are matched and approved, I still see them on the GRNI report as 'not invoiced'.<br />
<br />
Looking at the table level, I see that for those that show up as 'not invoiced', the tfacp250 table has them as approved (tfacp250.apry, aprp, data), with the approval year and mnth filled in. But, in the tfacp251 table the same fields are empty.<br />
<br />
This is the only pattern I see....<br />
Purchase orders, which are matched by receipt, and which have been used in the &quot;Approve by Receipt&quot; functionality, but which have also been used in the &quot;Approve by Order&quot; functionality do not have the approval date information (date and year and period) filled in tfacp251. <br />
<br />
I have a correction program to populate the missing fields and fix this problem, for now. <br />
Shouldnt the system stop me from doing a 'Approve by Receipt', If I've already done a 'Approve by Order' for the same Pur Order?<br />
<br />
But how do I avoid this from happening from a procedural stand point.<br />
All suggestions are welcome. Thanks<br />
<br />
