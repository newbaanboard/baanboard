Otherwise Baan will think that on one day a credit is being given (not allowed) and on other days a payment is being made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Woeste</div><div class="date">25th April 2005, 23:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply.  When you say payment date are you referring to the due date or some other field in the tfacp200 table?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I'm referring to the payment date in the payment advice created by &quot;Select Invoices for Payment&quot; (the cmg tables)</div></div><hr />

It must be your dates.  Double check to be sure that all payments are due and dates are correct.  In your selection, select payment based on supplier number, and due through date (say today).  That should pull all invoices scheduled to pay through today and should pull the net of your debits and credits.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

 Hi,<br />
Pls check the payment advices in the payment batch. There must be some credit notes selected. Credit notes are the ones causing the message for &quot;negative payment not allowed&quot;. If you delete the credit notes from the batch. The payment will be processed without errors assuming the rest of the setup is in order. Good luck !</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all check your payment advice TO SEE IF THE INVOICES YOU HAVE SELECTED HAVE REALLY DEFAULTED THE CORRECT VALUE.  It may so happen that the invoice balance in tfacp200 was not correct and the same wrong values have been populated in payment advice.  This is a bug for which correction object is available.<br />
<br />
Deselect the invoices from payment advice.  Run correction program otfcor8099 and after that otfcor0260 for the affected supplier.  Then make a fresh payment advice.<br />
<br />
Tell me if this helped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">14th June 2005, 11:57</div></div><div class="posttext">While composing payments, the audit checks the totals by supplier / currency / payment method / payment date and payment document (invoice, credit note). If the totals for any of the combination is negative, it may create an error saying negative value in audit or so.<br />
As an example the supplier may have credit notes of say SGD 1000 and invoices worth USD 1000 ( equiv of SGD 1650 ). Now the net of payments is positive SGD 650. But when we actually compose, it would give the error which you are getting b'cos when it does the totals by currency, it gets the amount for SGD as -1000 since it is consisting of only the credit note.<br />
<br />
I don't know whether I have explained it correctly, but is worth giving a try.</div></div><hr />

We had a similar problem here and I had to bring down the newest objects to resolve the problem.<br />
