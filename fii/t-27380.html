<br />
We have four Batch which the status of those Batch are &quot;In Use&quot; (tfgld1502m000) , but when i tried to print those Batch it gave me &quot;No Data within selection&quot; (tfgld1401m000).<br />
<br />
When i checked in session tfgld1116s000 those batch are &quot;in use&quot;.<br />
Any idea with this issue?<br />
<br />
Can we just delete it, if yes how to delete it?<br />

Thanks &amp; Best Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">19th June 2006, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally, this is due to a bshell-termination while having the batch open. I guess since printing gives you no data in selection, that there were no lines entered in the batch. However, you can reset the status to free with session tfgld1116s000.. Of cours eyou can also look through GTM if there is any data in this batch, which user created it, date, etc.. Like this you can determine of this batch can be removed or not...</div></div><hr />

This looks like a perfect batch which is waiting to be finalized. When you create a new runnumber and want to select the batches, does this batch not appear...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">malkotianil</div><div class="date">5th February 2007, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">these batches were not visible when i checked in tfgld100 the batch status in &quot;Batch Modifiable&quot; was &quot;no&quot; I made it yes and then finalised the batch. But i have another problem in some batches. the user entered the entries making debit to one company and credit to another company. when i pressed on company it show that there is no company inter relations.<br />
