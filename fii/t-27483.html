It seems all of a sudden we have invoices for our reimbursement contracts and the billable cost records are gone.  Just wondering what might be deleting them.</div></div><hr />

I have been searching code and sessions for a couple of days to try to figure out what is happening.  The finance people tell me that an invoice can not be created without the billable cost lines. Once the invoice is final the users should not be able to delete the billable cost records.  I have tried everything to figure out how this is happening - none of the baan code lets me do it.  We are going to turn auditing on for the tables to see if we can find which session which might be causing the problem.</div></div><hr />
