<br />
We have face the problem when sales invoices, generated for particular customer, are not posted to the Financial Ledger Account <br />
out of total 5 invoices raised on customer, 3 invoices are only posted to sales Ledger Account. This has happened in case of 9 other customers also. <br />
<br />
It is identified that certain batches of integrated transactions are in Ready status and not finalized. When we run the session tfgld1110m000, selecting batches for finalization, these batches are not appearing for selection. <br />
<br />
In the session tfgld1210m000  global selection of batches for finalization, when these batches are selected, no process is running!<br />
<br />
Please advise how do we select these batches for finalization.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Can you open tfgld100 for these batches and see if any run number is associated with it. Check the status of the batch in tfgld101 also.<br />
<br />

If there is data for this, then the batch status in tfgld100 and tfgld101 should be ready. Before that, please check if tfgld102 has any data at all.</div></div><hr />
