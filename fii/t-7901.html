<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">macica</div><div class="date">2nd December 2002, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We tested results on basis of acctual postings and acctual performances. On the report from session tfcat2480m000 (Print acctual cost allocation sheet) we expected:<br />
- acctual amounts on basic accounts (those where the amounts were actually posted to)<br />
- allocated amounts from secondary accounts, where the acctually posted amounts from higher levels are allocated to (instead of acctual amounts we got 1/12 of the amount planned in the FBS module)<br />
<br />
Does anybody have an idea of the real problem or a good explanation why we get planned amounts in the acctual costs allocation sheet?</div></div><hr />
