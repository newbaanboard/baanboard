<br />
Using baan V.0c...<br />

we have a legal issue where for each sales department their must be a sales account and sales return account in the chart of acount..<br />
<br />
using integration  centeral invoicing (sales)/revenues analysis...<br />
<br />
for normal sales order it sould be:<br />
<br />
Dr.Turnover account<br />
Cr.Revenue 001<br />
<br />
for sales return order it sould be:<br />
<br />
Dr.sales return 001<br />
Cr.Turnover account<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
--- Invalid comination of selected fields for key definition---<br />
<br />
<br />

We use the department as the main key definition for ledger accounts, also we are not using dimensions to use option by integration element ..'' where the sales order type exists &quot;.. as the sales order type is not a main key definition..<br />
<br />
other ideas !!</div></div><hr />

Hi Mohamed_alsadr,<br />
i had a quick search on my Baan Documents. The key element combination 'reason' and 'sales office' is not applicable for Integration Scheme Sales Invoicing (sales)/revenues analysis.<br />
You can use  'Enterprise Unit' (of sales office) in combination with 'reason' or 'warehouse' in combination with 'reason' if these key fields are different for return orders in your setup.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />

Hi Paul,<br />
how did you do that?<br />
As Mohamed_alsadr already stated the salesorder type is not a key element in Integration.<br />

Using sales order types is not possible in Baan V but was in IV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">19th July 2005, 04:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Using SO type wouldn't solve the challenge as directly in BaanERP as it would in BaanIV. Yet, it can still form part of the solution in BaanERP. Remember that in SO type there's a place to define sales office? We then can use this sales office as part of the integration scheme in accounting. But actually, I don't have access to BaanERP right in front of me right now, so if I was wrong then my memory is not serving me right anymore :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">19th July 2005, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no sales office to be linked to an SO type. Only the sales office or reason (but not in combination) can be used for the integration mapping scheme. As mentioned before the integration element is the best solution for that.<br />

<br />
If it's a legal issue, then it should be sufficient to have a special revenue account for CN per tax code and there is no need to map the integration (revenue analysis) accordingly.<br />
<br />
Prerequisite: if you have bgl0 (Global Localizations) in your Baan system, you have a standard functionality for this!<br />
<br />
Please check the attached document: you need to activate the localization parameter for Credit Notes and Sales interim account and then enter the special account as Sales Accoutn for  Credit notes in the Financial Data for Tax Code by Country.<br />

The sales office is in the user default instead, along with order series and inexperienced operator flag stuffs, right? I guess I shouldn't talk much when it comes to accounting. It's just not my domain.<br />

<br />
actually we don't use any localization.. but we agreed to use dimension using the sales order type and sales office as integration element..<br />
