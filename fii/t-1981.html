<br />
We wish to interface our parallel running HR package with BaaN for Finance. One of the solution being reviwed is to create a non-finalized batch externally using Exchange Schemes. <br />
<br />
Wish to know what are the relevant tables which need to be updated and in what <br />
formats to load transactions in tfgld102 of Type Journal and Invoice.<br />
<br />
Reference in mind is the BaaN functionality of Posting Integration Transaction in Finance which does the same job.<br />

<br />
We have never used this functionality here and I am also not much informed abt the same.<br />
<br />
Could you give some help in this regard. But yes on first view this does seem to be the solution I am looking for...<br />
<br />
Problem would be in case of importing invoices as this would also involve account payable tables..</div></div><hr />

But for that perhaps you can use EDI-Functionality. <br />

<br />
FORMAT FOR IMPORTED ASCII FILES<br />
<br />
when u run the EXCHANGE SCHEMES for import journal voucher functionality there are 3 tables which are updated viz., tfgld213 tfgld 214 and tfgld215 which will record your batch, document header and document lines resepectively .<br />
<br />
The first position of each record must contain a record type identifier of B,H or L respectively to indicate the record type. The fields of each record are delimited with the '|' character.<br />
<br />
At least one each of record types B, H and L must be present for a successful import.<br />
<br />
For payroll purposes, the batch would probably equate to one pay period or check run.<br />
<br />
We have been using this functionality effectively.<br />
<br />
any other info, on this pl. revert back<br />

 <br />
<br />
I don't think that exchange to tfacp100 would help, because there is no booking functionality with this table. From this table you have to copy the invoice each single in the manual booking session. <br />

<br />
You were talking about integration of the HR package with Baan.  Where did the Supplier control accounts come in?  We have integrated an external HR package with Baan using the journal import functionality and it works pretty well. <br />
<br />
Individual employees can be maintained as dimensions and the entries can be trigerred to fall into the proper dimensions.<br />
<br />

<br />
Do you need to issue cheques to the employee accounts using Baan Cheque master? <br />
<br />
If you don't then I would suggest that you don't use the ACP module for salary processing.  You can create a control account for each component of your salary.  Then, in all these accounts you could activate the dimension for employee where you have the name of the individual employees.  Then using the JV import procedure you can import the payroll details from the HR product. <br />
Then for making the payment you can use the maintain transactions session and process Bank payments with the payment type set to &quot;Journal&quot; or You can possibily import these details as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
In this process, you can see the consolidated salary details in the ledger accounts and the individual employee-wise details through the dimension views.<br />
<br />
Regarding the One time payment and the recurring payments to external parties these could generally be done through Baan.  <br />
<br />
This is my opinon.<br />
<br />
Warm regards<br />
Sudarshan</div></div><hr />
