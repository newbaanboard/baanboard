<br />
we have a problem with calculating the average purchase Price in Baan IVC4.<br />
<br />
Here some Informations to discuss the Problem:<br />
<br />
Integration to Finance: yes<br />
<br />
Calculate Average Purchase Price on actuall inventory<br />
<br />
Base for Costprice Calculation is the Average Purchase Price<br />
<br />
Now we have the following Problem:<br />
<br />
From an article the current stock is 0.  <br />
We order 14 pieces of this article to the price of EUR 36.50.<br />
the Delivery is 14 pieces and on the same day we book away 7 pieces by an production order.  <br />
On the next day the calculation is booked, assigned and approved for order.  If we proceed now from the formula, which is indicated in the Baan-Help we must get an average purchase-price of EUR 36.50, the calculation however results an average purchase price of EUR 18,25.<br />
<br />
<br />
Has anybody similar problems?<br />
Has anybody an Idea how to solve this Problem?</div></div><hr />

We had the same issue. Baan's calculation is based on the stock on hand.<br />
There is some parameter setting on average price calc method. You might consider switching it. Since avg price is really not used in actual financial transactions, I used avg sql function to get the avg price in the PPV report.</div></div><hr />
