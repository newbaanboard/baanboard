<br />
we need a help related to interim variance, we have a big amount of interim variance which not balance which we do not know from which transaction causing it, so what we do is we make a manual journal to balance it.<br />
Is there any suggestion from where we should start to look for the caused. We have do process inv. variance in daily basis.<br />
<br />
thank you,<br />

<br />
you ought to be more precise on what exactly you are looking for. You have nowhere explained that the &quot;interim variance&quot; might originate from Integration Postings - I presume that is what you are talking about. If the latter applies please let us know which &quot;interim Variance&quot; (origin) is meant since there are several logistical transactions where those transactions may come from. Once you have clarified that I will try to help you on that issue.<br />

<br />
thank you for your update,<br />
yes, it is from Integration Postings, the problem we faced is related to all Interim Transit and Interim Variance that come from integration, our suspect it was related to wrong mapping scheme previously, but now we have difficulty to sort it out related with the manual adjustment through journal which done by previous user.<br />
<br />
thank you,<br />

<br />
in fact for all interim Transit and/or Variance reconciliation groups you can run a report sorting out where the balance might come from. So in case for each of the many reconciliation groups an account had been setup then you should be able to find where the differences are coming from.  Have you setup the reconciliation groups up properly for all Interim Transi and Interim Variance Groups ? Do you have a unique account for each group or are you using a single interim Transit/Variance Account for all reconciliation groups ? <br />

<br />
thankyou for your update,<br />
currently we are using a single interim Transit/Variance Account for all reconciliation groups.<br />
<br />
thankyou,<br />

<br />
I am afraid you will have to run all the reconciliation reports where this single interim account is setup in the Integration mapping scheme. You should easily find out which of the many groups are affected.You will have to run those reports for e.g. Jan., Feb. and March to determine if the balance is a period shift going up and down proportionally or if the balance is just building up in one way. <br />
<br />
Apart from that I would recommend to use separate interim accounts for all those reconc. groups. <br />
<br />
