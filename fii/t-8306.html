<br />
We got problem in Calculate currency difference in GLD (tfgld5201m000) in our BAAN IV c4 system with SP6.<br />
since we didnt use reporting period in our finance system, but the auto-generated currency diff batch DO have a reporting period as the same of the financial period, so the batch can't be posted.<br />
I think it's a BAAN system bug, isn't it? and how to resolve the problem?</div></div><hr />
