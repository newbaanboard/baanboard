<br />
A receipt transaction increases the balance on invoice accrual, the approval of an invoice related to that same order will decrease the balance.<br />
If the user is approving that invoice in a period prior to the period of the receipt, then the invoice accrual account gives a strange result.<br />
If the user does not want this to happen, then this parameter can be of use.<br />
<br />
This parameter however has no influence on the actual matching. If you use the match to order procedure and you are in tfacp2541 and you match a specific order line and you get in session tfacp2150s000, then the user is able to match even if the goods have not been received yet. In all other situations the user can only match if the goods have arrived.<br />
Note however that approval of an invoice will only be possible if there is enough &quot;approved&quot; received quantity.<br />
