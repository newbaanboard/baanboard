<br />
I am not a Finance person, I work in IS supporting the technical aspects of Baan.<br />
<br />
I have been asked to compile a report of open transactions in Baan, be they SO's, PO's or invoices. Could somebody please give some pointers as to where I can look for this information. i.e. Baan reports or the base tables to create my own reports.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

for purchase orders follow similar path to tfacp200<br />

<br />
The definition of open transactions probably needs to be clarified. The previous note from baandude will be entirely correct if the definition is: sales delivered  and purchases received but payment not yet received/payed.   If it is: sales and purchases in the book but not yet delivered / received then the td tables will need to be considered.<br />
