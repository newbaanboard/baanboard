<br />
If the standard costs before 20.11. has been 0,00, then for sure NO COGS has been posted; therefore also the sales issue transaction must have been posted at 0,00 costs. Any related P&amp;L transactions will have been already done at purchase receipt, since at this time the PPV had been calculated against 0,00 standard, so there is nothing you can do, but only check that 0,00 standard does not happen anymore</div></div><hr />
