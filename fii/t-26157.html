<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">charrondl</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 00:12</div></div><div class="posttext">:eek: We are looking to change our financial reporting structure due to a recent reoganization.  In the process, I need to move one logistics company from one finance company to another for reporting purposes.  Does anyone know way to do so without completely reimplementing from scratch?<br />
<br />
For instance, I would like to consider dumping the existing company, import to a new company and change the finance company.  I know I can copy the company to another company number, but question the ability to change the finance company.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

Something like this?<br />
Actual:<br />
Log 100 - Fin 100 (single logistic - single finance)<br />
Future:<br />
Log 100 - Fin 200 (single logistic - single finance)<br />
<br />
Fin 100 still live? Fin 200 new or existing company? <br />
Please clarify</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">charrondl</div><div class="date">23rd January 2006, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Two logistics companies / One Finance Company:<br />
   Logistics company = 340<br />
   Logistics company = 330<br />
   Finance company = 330<br />
<br />
Would like to create new finance company for 340 or even make 340 a finance company so that it is single - single.<br />
<br />
And, would like to change company number for 330 to 121 and create a new finance company 120 which will eventually be the finance company for many logistics companies.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
