<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katiekelley</div><div class="date">31st March 2015, 21:17</div></div><div class="posttext">To create open AR in a new company it is best to create an scheme to have the system create your open entries from a spreadsheet with all the needed information on it.  Before you do so it is important to make sure all the customers are setup in your new system since you will need to use the new customer number in the import.<br />
<br />
On the AP side you will have 3 groups, The PO's that are open with no receipt or invoice in the system (just create new PO in new system and process as usual), PO with full receipt but no invoice- you will need to see if you can clear as many as possible in your old system and those still open at cut over will need to be entered into excel or as a report with the details and then when the invoices come in for them you will enter them in the new system as a cost invoice with an account for the expense that is the same number as your goods received not invoiced account you bring from the old system (need cutover new number for this) so when these are all done that account should balance to zero.  New PO's and those without receipts will use your long term account for goods received not invoiced that you create in the new system.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  If you have questions, feel free to give me a call.<br />
