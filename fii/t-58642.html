Is this a matter of the changing the parameters to 15 months for year 2011/2012 then change it back to 12 months for 2012/2013?  i guessed i also need to change the calendar?:D<br />

Its weired that company's fiscal period go beyond 12. I think you can only go upto 13 period 12+1(correction period). This is in 5c</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">novina888</div><div class="date">22nd June 2010, 01:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sujith, the company's normal period is 12 months but next year they are changing the period from Jan to Dec (current) to April to March(new).  <br />
<br />
So next year, from Finance point of view, they will be having Jan to Dec(12) then Jan to March(3) therefore the total is 15 (Jan to Mar) then the following year they will start using April to Mar (12) again.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of using the reporting period - <br />
Jan-Mar 2011 - period 1<br />
April - dec 2011 - period 2<br />
Jan - Mar 2012 - period 3<br />
<br />
then normal group of 3 months period (1,2,3,4) from April 2012 onward.<br />
<br />
Is this doable?  how would you do it?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You need to change period data using GTM for 15 month year, define period master for 15 month. Once this year is completed change again to 12 and defne period master accordingly. System keeps a check on last date only so it will not create any problem.<br />

<br />
So far i have received information on way to manage 15 months from 12 months financial period (GTM).  <br />
<br />
I was wondering, if there is anything else i should be also considering - such as calendar in the manufacturing, distribution, integration transactions, statistical data - what impact this financial period change will have on them?<br />
<br />
Greatly appreciated informative feedback from all of you.<br />
