<br />
We are on Baan IV C4, Supply Chain extension, Service Pack 15.<br />
<br />
We are facing this peculiar problem in Finance - Cash Management. Just last month, we paid some of our suppliers by checks in Baan (payment Advice -&gt; Anticipated route). Before close of the month, we reconciled the check (In session tfcmg2100s000, status changed from Open to Complete).<br />
<br />
Now we have come to know that one of the checks was wrongly reconciled and the same was actually returned by bank.<br />
<br />
If I create a new batch, I don't see my check. <br />
<br />
Is there any way by which I can change the status of the check from &quot;complete&quot; to &quot;rejected&quot; ? My transaction type has 1st session as tfcmg2100s000 and 2nd session as tfcmg2120s000.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I dont see any way to set it back, except through a series of GTM corrections, which is not advisable, since the transaction is complete in all respects and technically fine.<br />
<br />
As an accountant's solution, I advice you to make a direct bank receipt into this bank (journal type) so that the bank balance will be OK, atleast (credit to dummy account).  Correspondingly you need to raise a credit note on the supplier so that supplier account balance is set right (corresponding debit to dummy account).  You may put the corresponding debit/credit accounts of above two entries to one dummy account, so that the effect of the above rectification is complete.<br />

<br />
Cancel cheque should be a normal process.  It can be done prior or after finalization.  The way we cancel/reject cheque is by choosing normal transaction type (not anticipated payment) for the bank in which we issued cheque. Then do cancelation.<br />

<br />
The process you seem to suggest is the normal cheque reconciliation process WHEN THE CHECK IS STILL IN ANTICIPATED STATUS.  Once the reconciliation is over and the RECONCILIATION batch is finalized, I don't see any functionaity to re-set it.<br />
<br />
Or am I missing out something?  Please explain<br />

We can unfinalze a reconcile batch by session otfcor0313. How can we do this after that.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Run invoke back ground process for batches in run.  Then refinalize the batches under the same run no. <br />
