<br />
Please go to tdpur045 and here for that Purchase order on form2, check the field Delivery Status. this should show as Matched. Also check the fields - Qty on packing slip and delivered qty and update them accordingly.<br />

SO I chk from table tdpur045 , the Matched = 'Partially' , delivery status ='All Approved' .<br />
<br />
Even I change the status to 'Matched ', the record still appear in tfacp1131s000.<br />
<br />
where else should I chg so tht the record not show anymore ?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajhyd</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 05:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The record will not appear for matching if the Matched field is Completely/Partially and Delivery status field is Matched/Approved. But it will also check for the Quantity fields as present in form3. This was already mentioned to you in my first update. The field approved quantity cannot be 0 if it has been Matched and Approved.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
