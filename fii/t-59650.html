<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanravi</div><div class="date">6th December 2010, 06:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Anticipated statuses come based on the no. of steps you want to carry out for a payment. Refer to Form 2 in Maintain payment Method sessions. If you issue a cheque to a supplier and wait for a confirmation from the bank to see if it has been realized or not till that stage it remains as an Anticipated Payment.<br />
<br />
Advance is as usual payment without reference to an invoice.</div></div><hr />

In anticipated payment , you are waiting to clear a check in bank &amp; system.</div></div><hr />
