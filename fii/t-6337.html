From your other posts, I assumed you are on Baan IV. Is that correct? <br />
<br />
You have LTC implemented and Lot pricing specified for the item in question. Std Cost (FTP) is $80, Purchase Price is $100. At receipt, Baan will recognize a $100 DR to inventory as the cost of that lot, as expected.<br />
<br />
When you issue the lot to production, Baan issues to WIP (/SFC Order) at Std Cost (FTP) of  $80. The difference of $20 is recorded as a Lot result [Transaction Origin = Production(SFC) ; Financial Transaction = Lot result]. <br />

Thanks for your reply. We do use BAAN IV C4.<br />
I haven't finished this post when i post it, so please kindly find another post i have copied here.<br />
The issue we have is the client is a trading company and want to use BAAN to record lot actual price.<br />
That is for both purchase and sales, we will expect BAAN can recognize lot actual costing. We dont'e have TI module implemented in this case.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

We implemented a lot actual costing system to 1 of our clients. But the pricing for goods issue cant march what we expected.<br />
I found that even lot actual pricing implemented, goods issue will still be recorded in Fixed Tranfer Price:<br />
<br />
For instance, a lot was purchased at 100USD while FTP is 80 USD.<br />
The Purchasing receipt will book:<br />
1. DR goods (inventory), 100<br />
CR invoiced to be received, 100<br />
<br />
But when goods issed to customer at price 120, sales issue will only book:<br />
2. DR goods to be delivered, 80<br />
CR goods, 80<br />
and book sales lot result as<br />
3. DR goods, -20<br />
CR to lot result, -20<br />
<br />
from 2,3. altoght the total goods will be CR 100, but the total for sales issue will be -60 (???)<br />
<br />
Since the goods to be delivered can't be specified by customer group, so we have to use invoice detail for the record of COGS by customer group. <br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
We can't find lot actual pricing in &quot;Maintain invoice detail account&quot; (tdsls6102m000)<br />
<br />
would someone here please help!!<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />

<br />
The bad news is that you cant find lot actual pricing in &quot;Maintain Invoice Detail Accounts&quot; (tdsls6102m000) because it isnt there. (Invoice Details wont let you direct a Lot Result to a specific account by Financial Customer Group because the [logistic] inventory portion of the procedure is complete at delivery.)<br />
<br />
The good news is that I see a net $100 flowing to the bottom line as a result of the sales issue and COGS transactions. I think your $60 net total is an example of why many accountants dislike introducing negative CRs and negative DRs<br />
<br />
Sales issue generates entries of: $100CR Goods (inventory); $80DR Goods to Be Delivered; Lot result -$20CR (i.e. same as +$20DR) to a P/L (expense/cost) account. <br />
<br />
When you actually invoice the sale (Process Delivered Sales Orders), you have $80CR to Goods to Be Delivered and $80DR to the COGS account(s) specified in invoice details. <br />
<br />
If the account specified for your Sales/Lot Result is reported in the COGS area of your statements, your COGS is correct in total ($80DR - $20CR =$100DR).<br />
<br />
The problem is that the lot result is recognized at delivery whereas COGS with invoice details is recognized at invoicing. So there is a timing difference that requires more disciplined procedures if you want to treat the Lot Result as part of COGS, matched to period sales revenues. <br />
<br />
I dont know your clients requirements for segregating Sales, COGS and Lot Results by Customer Financial Group in the ledger, but have you considered using dimensions? CFG is an available element for the Sales/Issue transaction.<br />

This chould be solution to book the COGS in sales/lot result. But it's pity can't march with sales period, and can't be recognized by FCG.<br />
<br />
Since they have already used 3 dimensions, so i would not propose the solution for dimension of FCG.<br />
<br />
You seem to be so familiar with BAAN finance, guess you are also a finance consultant?<br />

Yes, primarily finance. But I like to think I also work outside the box.<br />
