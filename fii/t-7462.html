   For the above requirement ,if it is only finance implemented , you can open a diminsion called business partners and capture the information supplier/customer wise.<br />
<br />
If it is a finance and logistic implementation,you will have to allocate two dimension types(remember that you have exhausted two dimension types for this..agains nased on your requirement priorities)-one for supplier and another for customer.<br />
<br />
To capture the costing ledger entries your item coding should be in such a way that if an item 'A'  is bought for producing a finished good for customer  -CUST1 ..from supplier SUP-1..it should have a different code.<br />
The same item for a different combination should have a different code.This is very complex and will work smoothly if you have a one to one relation ,for a single item, between suppliers and customers.<br />
<br />
Using integration mapping/options by integration element the costing entries can be captured and an analysis can be done.<br />
ITEM-CUSTOMER DIMENSION  &amp; ITEM-SUPPLIER DIMESNION.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have done it for customer wsie tracking and a combination of both will be very complex.</div></div><hr />
