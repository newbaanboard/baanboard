<br />
Say there are two different organizations, both using Baan. <br />
Organization X wanted to raise a Sales Order to Organization Y. Sometimes Organization Y wants to put Purchase Order to organization X as well. Is it possible to do this through EDI?  <br />
<br />

Its absolutely possible in EDI. But the best methodology for integrating multisite locations is Business Object Interfaces (BOI). BOI is the safest way of data insertion into Baan where all the session level validations are maintained. U can ask BCK or OW Adapter.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Baan V, the DAL's contain the business logic, and you can use Exchange with DAL's for multi-site exchanges.   I have found it to work ok, and it's easy set up a test with your data to see if it will work for you.  Attached is a link to a Baan support site folder with info on exchange:<br />
<br />
ftp://ftp.baan.com/public/dumps/Sol-150963/documents<br />
<br />
Exchange User Documentation is the Baan V document.  <br />
<br />
I don't recommend Exchange for Sales Orders/ PO's in Baan IV because you don't get the business logic.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">11th April 2002, 00:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Exchange for Sales Orders / Purchase Orders in Baan IV is kind of a mess.  You don't get the business logic, so you don't get any of the field defaults for 1 thing.   You also don't get any delivery date validations, or stock validations.  All you do get are reference and domain validations (table validations).   I would not recommend it for this purpose, but it's feasable if you fill in all those fields with defaults in the exchange scheme.  Hard to create, but I understand there are some already created if someone is willing to share.<br />

Re:  BCK for c3:<br />
I am not sure of the Full Suite of BCK / Open World - I originally thought that was only for c4.  However, my latest documentation on Open World and AFS developement states that is available for all of Baan IV.  I don't have the BCK set up, but I tried some stpapi script I had in Baan 4c4, and ran it in Baan 4c3, and it works just fine.  I guess they ported at least the stpapihand library down to all of IVc tools.<br />
<br />
So, that's new to me.  The stpapi commands should be good for this purpose - you get all the session logic, including field defaults and validations.  I recommend taking a look at the following links in this forum:<br />
<br />
For a question just like yours (with all the same confusing answers!)<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=650<br />
<br />
This one has a nice AFS Developement Guide attached:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1225<br />
<br />
Or, just search for AFS on this board and you'll see all the posts.  Lots of questions similar to yours.<br />
<br />
Also, you don't need the BCK or OpenWorld software installed to just use the stpapi programming.   They run fine in a regular script called from any old session.  BCK and OpenWorld allow for integration outside of Baan. <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 07:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Since both organizations are in Baan, there is no need to translate the EDI files at both ends. You can directly load the EDI files and and the Standard Baan EDI setup will take care of all functionality. If number of EDI orders are less, the easiest way is to develop a session in baan which will transfer EDI files to other organization. This session has to run after genration of EDI messages. If the number of EDI orders are more, then you have to think of the third party software just for transfer of files between companies.</div></div><hr />
