<br />
This is regarding an issue in Baan report generation. While generating the report for the cost BOH, I am getting the details of 3 product lines in excel sheet.In which one product was sold to other company, So I need the details of 2 products alone. <br />
<br />
In the excel sheet I am getting the following columns   <br />
W/H DESCRIPTION, ITEM GROUP, PRODUCT LINE, ITEM NUMBER, ITEM DESC, 	ITEM TYPE, ABC, NET QTY, O/H QTY, HOLD QTY, TOTAL STANDARD, DIRECT,  OVERHEAD, COST COMP<br />
<br />
My question is, What I am suppose to do in order to get the details of 2 product lines alone? Do we need to change any input parameters? If so, in which session  we need to change it? Since I am newbie to Baan application, I do not have enough ideas, Please let me know your valuable suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
Raja</div></div><hr />
