<br />
We are planning to perform final year end closing for 2011. fiscal period 1-12 and tax period 1-11 have been finally closed,  fiscal period 13 and tax period 12 are still 'open'. <br />
<br />
Now we are trying to Run &quot;Automatic Balancing of Profit &amp; Loss Account - tfgld6202m000&quot; but got the error message &quot;Unfinalized batches exist in year 2011&quot;, we checked in tfgld018, tfgld100, tfgld101 and tfgld102 but we are unable to finad any non finalized batches or erroneous batches.<br />
<br />
Please advise the soluction,thank you.</div></div><hr />
