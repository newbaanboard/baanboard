<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pfsilva</div><div class="date">2nd March 2004, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
The set up of postings for purchase/results should be opposite of the ones for purchase/receipt because:<br />
If order price is 110 USD and Standard Price is USD100 the purchase receipt is booked at USD 100 and the purchase result is USD100-USD110=USD-10<br />
Because of this if u want to increase your purchase account u have to set the bookings on tdinv8150m000 as follows:<br />
<br />
Purchase receipt<br />
debit: &quot;Inventory&quot;<br />
Credit: Goods expecting Invoice<br />
<br />
Purchase Result:<br />
Debit: Goods Expecting Invoice<br />
Credit: &quot;Inventory&quot;<br />
<br />
and set the transaction type linked to these bookings in session tfgld4126m000 as defined not to allow for negative amounts.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help.<br />
Regards,<br />
Pedro</div></div><hr />
