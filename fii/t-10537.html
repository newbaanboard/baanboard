<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">27th June 2003, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">We have BaanIVc4 and use sales returns that are completely reversed. I can't think of why different accounts would be involved if the returns are for an exact for (similar) reversal. <br />
That is:  if the order involves inventory items then the inventory items are specified,  same customer, order has negative quantity but positive price and the amount is extended correctly to give correct total (note it is possible to not have the qty * price extended - we use this for value only invoice and credits).<br />
<br />
Please provide an explicit example of the order / invoice and the return order . credit note.<br />
