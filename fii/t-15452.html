<br />
Stop maintaining Receipts.<br />
Post all integrationtransaction type Purchase and all integrations Production SFC / Subcontracting.<br />
Finalize the batches.<br />
<br />
Select the values using tfacp1235m000. <br />
Then run tfacp1435m000 and tfacp1432m000<br />
Compare the amount on orders in tfacp1435mooo with the total of tfacp1432m000. Compare the total of tfacp1435m000 with the amount on the GRINYA account on the trial balance. If there is a difference take the opening balance of the first year of use into account. <br />
If differences occur between tfacp1435m000 (amount on orders) and tfacp1432m000 run tfacp1436m000. That list is recalculating the order logistically and compare the amount with the selected finance transactions.<br />
If you have differences run otfcor0641 to see what happened. Don't update records with that correctionprogram because it's not stable. <br />
If diffences occur please explain the variables, I think I can help you.</div></div><hr />

Most of the differences between SP4 and SP14 are in the sessions to write off the differences to the profit and loss. I my opinion completely wrong sessions. <br />
Take a try and see what happens. It's only a selection of finalized data into an interimtable (tfacp135).</div></div><hr />

<br />
ask your support , there is a dump of the GRinya session you can install without upgrading to SP 14 <br />
<br />
I think you have all the sessions at SP7 ;</div></div><hr />
