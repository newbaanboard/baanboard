<br />
I created Document series 2002xxxx for Sales Invoice(SIP) in tfgld0114m000 or Maintain Last used Document Number by Transaction Type Series, and our old series was 2001XXXX, but whatever sales invoices are being generated are picking old series in the range of 2001xxxx. This is happening for SIP or Sales Invoices only, for the rest , the documents are picking the correct Series i.e. 2002xxxx. <br />
<br />
Can any body please tell me why this is happening or where else we have to define this series no. Please treat this urgent<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance<br />

Look in session tcmcs0142m000 Maintain Order Type.  For each Sales Order Type you need to check which invoice series is defined.  You probably still have this set as 2001.</div></div><hr />
