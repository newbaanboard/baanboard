<br />
Manual Purchase TT is used and some invoices entered in the batch. Later on 2 invoiced are deleted from the batch. The batch status is ready.<br />
<br />
When tfgld1110m000 is run system generated error &quot;Background process not completed&quot; only for the two deleted invoices. Session tfgls1214m000 is run but error remains. Unable to finalize the batch because of this.<br />
<br />
System was showing document status in tfgld018 for the deleted invoices as &quot;Used&quot;. Why the system is showing Used, when the transaction itself was deleted????<br />
I have now  changed the status to &quot;Deleted&quot; thru GTM. <br />
<br />
Session tfgld1214m000 is run again but error persists. What could be the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Check in tfgld102 for the deleted transactions.  Maybe there are still some records there for them.  I have seen this happen before.</div></div><hr />

In  the future when u want to delete Manual Purchase Invoices from a batch, first delete line 2 , when you insert the ledger account and then the first entry (form 1). This way that problem should not occur.<br />
