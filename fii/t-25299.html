<br />
Item has a STPC of $501.85.. A qty of 1 has been transacted - the amount of integration transaction should have been for $501.85. However the<br />
entry has been passed for $2768.09.<br />
<br />
When checking the Item costing data the STPC was changed from $2768.09 to $501.85.<br />
<br />
The transaction date on the Production- Issue was backdated and hence the entry has been passed for $2768.09.<br />
<br />
I would like to know when will revaluation entry be passed for the inventory account?</div></div><hr />

Only problem is you will not able to locate it based on the production order number. Easiest way to find is run the integration report for the inventory transaction date and search for that item in the report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the revaluation entry posted during cost roll-up and after the fact the Production Order is closed or is it posted irrespective of the Production Order Status?</div></div><hr />
