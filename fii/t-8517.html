<br />
I have a problem the OB on some ledger accounts for the new year, they do not equal the CB on the trial balance as of last year, this is only for a few ledger accounts. <br />
<br />
As the last year has been closed is there anyway in the tables  the opening balances can be changed  for these ledgers in question?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />
Kam<br />

PS - I have tried to rebuild ledger history but this has not made any impact to the figures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would call Baan support before getting too far along, but here are some random thoughts:<br />
<br />
Did you also try Rebuild Dimension History (tfgld3202m000) and Rebuild Opening Balance/History from Transactions (tfgld3203m000)? (I think those are the correct session nos.)<br />
<br />
Because the prior year is closed, you can't rebuild its history. Out of curiousity, did you rebuild the prior year ledger history before year end close? (Just trying to pinpont where/how the imbalance occurred.)<br />
<br />
If you're certain that the opening balances (not the closing balances) are the incorrect figures, if rebuilds don't work and if Baan Support has no answer/solution, you might use manual opening balance transactions. (That will not work if the accounts in question are control accounts.)<br />

<br />
Please check if the balance in ledger account is matching with the balance in trial balance.  If no, run session tfgld3203m000 (ensure that nobody is using Finance module at that time).<br />
<br />
Also check if any manual correction had been made earlier in table tfgld201 to 206.  You may need to correct the same<br />

Do you know what caused you to have duplicate records on the tfgld106?  I am curious. ...  if it's in your previous post ...  I didn't get it!  <br />
:)<br />
Thanks,<br />
