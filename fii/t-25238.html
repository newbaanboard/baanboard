All the variances charge of account type is P&amp;L. May I know how shall we accounted in our Profit and Loss statement?<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
In general terms the variances effectively provide the difference between Standard Cost and Actual cost but there are timing differences to be considered also. As to how they will be treated in the P&amp;L is is up to your accounting people to setup the accounts and the integration tables.<br />

<br />
The usual way is to group it under COGS in P&amp;L statement, but then again it's so basic that I'm not sure that's what you're asking about. Unless you're not from accounting background or your client's accounting manager is not so familiar with standard costing in their pre-BaanERP operation that you have to ask this question during implementation.<br />
