<br />
When I go to open entries (see attachment) I see balances with zero amounts. these invoices have been paid and the balance is correct but why is it showing up on open entries.<br />
<br />
Upon further investigation I checked GTM and in the balance field it is 0<br />
but the ones that are correct displays 0.00<br />
<br />
In SQL server the value in the field is a number eg. 9.82325332188339E-13 <br />
<br />
Thank in Advanced</div></div><hr />

These amounts as shown in SQL will have to be updated in the database directly as 0 and then these amounts would not show up in the open entries.<br />

I am aware of this but why is it happening? Isn't this some sort of Bug in the system?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Must be a problem in the query which fills the session. The system works with doubles, so floating points and depending the database and operating system, it is possible that even if the value should be 0.0, you can still have very small values in the database. If the query is using then something like, tfacp200/tfacr200.balh &lt;&gt; 0.0, then also the invoices which have actually no balance, but such a very small value are shown in the grid. The query should use a tolerance. I guess you need to contact support for this.<br />
