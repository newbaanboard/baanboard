<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arshavin</div><div class="date">8th July 2008, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We need to define a transaction type with Transaction Category=Cash that will be used for allocation of advance/unallocated payments to purchase invoices. Since Transaction Category=Cash, we need to define contra cash account. What should I enter here? The thing is, cash account is not involved in the allocation process at all. The transaction will debit A/P control account and credit Advance/Unallocated control account as per business partner/supplier group mapping. There is no posting to cash at all. Is it just a system design deficiency, where Baan developers were too lazy to create a separate Transaction Category for advance allocations? :D:D</div></div><hr />
