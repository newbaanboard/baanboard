<br />
I am trying to have multiple Invoice To roles for a single customer by attaching different sales offices. Each Invoice To record has different Financial BP Group and each Financial BP Group has different Control A/C linked.<br />
<br />
So, with this setup, I raise 2 sales orders - both with separate Sales Offices and hence separate BP groups and hence different Control a/c. When I finalise the batch after doin process in cisli, I get posting to the default role (one without Department attached) always. <br />
<br />
I want to control my postings to Control a/c by maintaining multiple INvoice-To roles for same Business Partner.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me if I am doin something  wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The possibility of having multiple records for INVOICE TO roles makes me feel that you would be able to split posting to different control a/c by specifying department in sales order. <br />
<br />
Can anyone say whether my expectation is too ambitious?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

You wrote that you defined different sales offices for the invoice- to BP.<br />
I had a look at Baan-Help and think you should define accounting offices per invoice- to BP.<br />
Did no testing, just a hint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayoobi</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 05:29</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as i remember , Finance supports only one accounting department which is specified in the company parameters(i guess) .  so while picking up control account , it will try to post to the role linked to the accounting department . if it is not found then it is posted to blank role . <br />

<br />
I also feel that only one a/c office per finance company can be effective. <br />
<br />
Reg multiple values for INvoice-to roles, I tried simulating. But did not work. It always posted to the Invoice - To role that contains no department. <br />
<br />
I feel this will work only in case of a multi-finance setup.</div></div><hr />
