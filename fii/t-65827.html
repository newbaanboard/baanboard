<br />
I was wondering if someone could please assist. We currently have an issue where the GL is not picking up inventory trx. As a result we are always having to write off from inventory on a monthly basis. <br />
<br />
We believe the issue is the interim accounts (e.g. Interim Transit etc) that are not clearing on their own in some cases and we are having to manually clear them at month end causing our write offs. <br />
<br />
I am wondering if anyone else has had this particular issue and if anyone has advice to remediate this issue which we got since upgrading to LNFP3 about 5 years ago and these interim accounts came into being.<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
<br />
Fred</div></div><hr />

On LN,they have made it's simplified on Inventory integration transactions/mapping scheme which put in on reconciliation group category Inventory only. All of your Chart of Account's which related to Inventory must be put in this category reconciliation group. I have no issue with inventory and GL since beginning on my LN.<br />
