When printing cheques for many invoices of a supplier, the system prints out that many cheques. If there are 5 invoices, 5 cheques are printed even if the cheque date is the same.. I can almost say that its not a report related problem because we copied the report from a site wherein it works properly(i.e printing one cheque for all the invoices of a supplier). <br />
 <br />
The sessions i use are...<br />
Maintain Payment Advice(cheque dates are the same and so is the Payment method for all the invoices)<br />
Process Payment<br />
Assign Banks to Payment<br />
Audit Payment<br />
Transfer Payments<br />
......<br />
 <br />
So what could be the problem? <br />

I would have a look to the settings of &quot;Maintain Payment Methods&quot; tfcmg0140m000 for the cheque-payments. <br />
There (on form 2) you can decide wether the payments should be combined by Baan or  if each invoice should be payed with a separate cheque.<br />
May that be a way?</div></div><hr />

   You are right. The field which does this combining is &quot;Composing Limit&quot; on Form 2 of Maintain Payment Method. It had a value of 1 which was changed to 99 and it started combining the transaction...<br />
 <br />
Thnx a lot mate...<br />
