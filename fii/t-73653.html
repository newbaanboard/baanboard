<br />
there is no such retention field in LN up to 10.7 but perhaps &quot;Supplier Stage Payments&quot; might be an alternative (Document code: procsspug (U9819)):<br />
<br />
Stage payments enable customers to pay suppliers before or after the ordered goods are actuallyreceived for a purchase order. The payments are spread over a period of time and the amounts must be paid to the supplier on specific dates. The purchase order item's invoice flow is separated from its goods flow.<br />
<br />
Supplier stage payments can be useful for items with characteristics such as long lead, high value, much engineering, and a fixed price. The stage payments can include the dates and events for which the supplier must complete specific tasks before receipt of any goods, such as providing design documentsor test results.<br />
