Recently my AP staff overpaid an amount to a supplier.  That amount hit a Control Account.  We later obtained a refund check for the overpayment.  We want to book the overpayment to the same account so they wash out; However, we found that we can't book to a control account.  My AP staff has tried to do a negative AP entry, but it doesn't work.  Please help us!  <br />

We have ERP LN 8.6<br />

Thank you!<br />
