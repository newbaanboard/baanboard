&quot;Calculated Closing balance not Equal to entered closing balance&quot;<br />
<br />
Get the above message when trying to exit Maintain Transactions after entering an unallocated receipt(tfcmg2100s000) could it be that the ledger balance for the bank account is incorrect and needs rebuilding?<br />
<br />
any other ideas??<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonian</div><div class="date">20th May 2002, 20:59</div></div><div class="posttext">When you enter the session the system would have popped up a message to enter your expected closing balance &quot; opening balance +- your transactions = closing balance&quot; .  This is a check, upon leaving the session, to confirm that all transactions were posted to the bank correctly.  It is a bank reconciliation control amount.<br />
<br />
You can go to &quot;Special&quot; and click on Maintain Bank Balance to input the correct closing balance.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">23rd May 2002, 11:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you compare the closing-balance you entered with the one on your window where you enter the transaction (cmg2100)?<br />
<br />
The closing-balance is the total of the postings on the &quot;Bankaccount&quot; ledger-account for the specified currency. Did the currency change?<br />
<br />
You may indeed try rebuilding the ledger-account; if the current balance in the system is not Ok, the warning is to be expected.<br />
<br />
Maybe you encountered a bug in the unallocated receipts. Try deleting this entry and insert it again in a new batch...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kamran</div><div class="date">23rd May 2002, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
Checked all the balances, only entered one line transaction, however if i got this message I was able to exit the session and system allowed me to finalise the batch! checked Baan support site and did find a solution about this message appearing even when batch is balanced, will try this solution.<br />
<br />
thanks for your help<br />
