<br />
We have got a some problem here with tfacr200. We have sent material thru Sales Excise invoice and the run PDSO after which we posted the data to finance (No errors at any stage) but when ageing was taken out it didn't show those documents/invoices, also nothing in customer ledger. when checked for table tfacr200 it didn't have those documents.<br />
<br />
Now what i wanted to know is:<br />
Is it that during the updation of tfacr200 the customer master data is also checked since in the customer data we have the financial company other than in the invoice???<br />
<br />
Now, how to get the entry in tfacr200 for these documents.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
