<br />
We are going to have another coy using the same Baan Server.<br />
<br />
Both Coy will use the same VRC.<br />
<br />
and the Sales invoice have bank account detail at the end.<br />
<br />
both coy use different bank and account no, we need to have the bank detail shown at the end of the sales invoices.<br />
<br />
We have alots of customise sales invoice like below, to duplicate every of them will have a very long lists.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">2nd June 2009, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a suggestion for this. Even though the VRC may be the same, but the tables belonging to individual companies within the same VRC will still be unique. So you have two options here :<br />
<br />
Pick up the Bank account for the Invoice from the standard Cash management Bank data tables based on some criteria (if USD, then account1, if EUR then account2, etc..)<br />
<br />
Alternatively, maintain a special table to maintain the bank account with the criteria and pick the field from there in the Print Sales Invoices.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">2nd June 2009, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't get what you mean.<br />
<br />
2 coy are under 2 different coy name with 2 different bank and different account no.<br />
<br />
eg..<br />
<br />
100 coy name 1<br />
200 coy name 2<br />
<br />
all are using USD$ for payment.<br />
<br />
only GL are using S$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">2nd June 2009, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I am assuming that you are using Cash Management module. <br />
In the Cash Management master data set-up, you would have defined bank account codes for the transactions. So while printing invoices, pick the account number from the cash management table (tfcmg001) for the respective company. If you have multiple account codes and multiple banks then have some kind of a logic to pick. For example consider the following scenario :<br />
<br />
Company Bank relation      currency      Account number     transaction type<br />
100         HS1    hsbc       USd             1234567890          AB1<br />
100         HS2    HSBC      SGD             1234567000          AB2<br />
100         CT1    CITI       USD              1234589001         AB3<br />
<br />
Now, if you have a rule which states that for all invoices you will use only hsbc bank accounts, then hard code the program to pick up the account number based on the bank = HS1 and currency = USD.<br />
<br />
Then use the same naming convention for the company 200 also. This way the account number for 200 for hsbc and usd will be picked for the invoices generated from company 200.<br />
<br />
The same effect can be had if you can define a customised table to just maintain the bank account and pick it up from there.<br />
<br />
Hope it is a bit more clear now.<br />
