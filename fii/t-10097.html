<br />
You can only specify invoice date when you are right about to compose an invoice. Once the invoice is composed, you can't change the invoice date (unless you want to play rough and change it through GTM which may cause data inconsistency for that particular invoice; very, very bad thing) :)<br />

<br />
in my business process<br />
<br />
first of all i must print invoice, then give it to a buyer. <br />
But buyer can CHANGE the invoice's date. <br />
therefore i ask how to first print invoice and later enter its date?<br />
<br />
maybe someone help me. <br />
For example how can i enter in ACR module an open entry with the transaction date other then the invoice date. I thought that the transaction date is filled at the &quot;Compose/Print/Post&quot; session into the field Transaction Entry Date, but it's not so on practice.<br />
<br />
waiting for replies....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">22nd May 2003, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you mean the buyer can change the payment date?<br />
<br />
Example - the delivery is scheduled for May 1 but you ship it and invoice it on April 30. The buyer calls you to say &quot;I wanted it in May and I am going to pay you as if it was shipped in May&quot;.<br />
<br />
We have this scenario sometimes. <br />
If the buyer is correct, we just adjust the &quot;due date&quot; in tfacr2100m000, Maintain Invoice Details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YevgenBalun</div><div class="date">22nd May 2003, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Not payment date.<br />
<br />
In Ukraine there's specific goods' issue procedure.<br />
<br />
We don't have packling lists witk goods' quantities without prices and discounts.<br />
<br />
Packling list and invoice are one document in Ukraine. We call in 'nakladna'.<br />
<br />
Therefore when buyer reject all or part of delivered goods we must rebuild not packling list but sales invoice, saying in Baan's terms.<br />
<br />
I cannot use packling list as 'nakladna'  because prices are unknown and can be changed by session 'Change Prices and Discounts after Delivery'.<br />
<br />
Though i use sales invoices and as you know i cann't alter its date.<br />
<br />
OK,<br />
please say is it harmful if i will change field cisli205.idat by database's means when sales invoice is ONLY in state COPMOSED (no printed and furthermore POSTED)?<br />
<br />
can i do so without bad consequances?<br />
<br />
Thank you...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">22nd May 2003, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about Baan 5 but in Baan 4, the help for &quot;Process Delivered Sales Orders&quot; says it generates financial transactions so if you delayed running that {is there an equivalent procedure in Baan 5?} so there wouldn't be too much harm that I can think of changing the invoice date using GTM.<br />
However, you may have to beware of currency exchange rates if that is an issue for you.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, can you modify the packing slip to show prices and remove permission for anybody to run &quot;changes prices after maintain deliveries&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanlegend</div><div class="date">22nd May 2003, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no difference in PDSO in Baan 5. You can surely change packing slip after changing the price after maintain deliveries</div></div><hr />
