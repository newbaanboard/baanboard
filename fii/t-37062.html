<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">7th June 2007, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">As far back as I can remember we have always used customized reports for month-end inventory reporting.  This includes:<br />
 <br />
 Raw material/Finished Goods reports for lot controlled and non-lot controlled material<br />
 Work in Process for production orders (standard items)<br />
 Work in Process for PCS projects (customized items)<br />
 <br />
<br />
 What are the 'Baan Standard' reports which would complement those which are customized... meaning what out of the box sessions need to be run to get inventory reports (from a Finance/Accounting department perspective)?  Ones that they would tie to the general ledger.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanravi</div><div class="date">21st June 2007, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">For non-lot items, Perform Inventory Valuation by Item<br />
For lot items, check for inventory reports in lot control<br />
<br />
For WIP, Print Work-in-progress in SFC module. This will print production order wise.<br />
<br />
For projects, use &quot;Print Project Integration Transactions&quot;. this will print financial integrations by project.<br />
<br />
