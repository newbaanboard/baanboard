<br />
Hoping we have some Israeli Baan users out there?<br />
<br />
I have been asked by our Israel finance manager if it is possible to get Baan to export VAT data in the PCN874 file format required by the tax authorities in Israel. Does anybody know if Baan IVc4 supports this? I think I know the answer but I thought I would ask.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I'm willing to try to help. I have a lot of experience in Baan in general and in the exchange modul in particular and I think that's the tool this customer need to use. Can you give me more details on that customer? You can also write to my e-mail address - ybadihi@hotmail.com.<br />
