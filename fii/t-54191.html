<br />
I heard that there is a module in BAAN that can scan AP invoices. Once scanned we can visualize the invoice linked to the voucher #. <br />
<br />
Is anyone using this and what is it called?<br />
<br />
Any info would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

it depends on what your requirements are.<br />
Scanning in Baan is not possible as per standard.<br />
If you just want to link the (externally) scanned invoice to a dataset in Baan then the ODM package could be an option (don't know if it's available in Baan IV).<br />
Try a search for ODM on the board.<br />
<br />
If you wan't to do a complete 'automated processing of incoming invoices' then there are several solutions out there which integrate whith Baan.<br />
Ask INFOR for partners or have a look here:<br />
