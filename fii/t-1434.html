<br />
please can you explain more detailed what do you want to achieve with the group company. What is your understanding of a group company? <br />
Is it for consolidation purpose or for ....?<br />
How many logistic companies are involved and how is the company structure, how are the relations between the different companies?<br />
And very important: Are you on ERP or BaanIV?<br />
<br />
Regards, Juli</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">20th March 2002, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, think how you want to integrate financially before you start poking in the tables.<br />
<br />
It is possible to (technically) maintain the two financial companies, but link all integration transactions to the single financial company that should remain. After this is done, no more transactions should be posted in the old company.<br />
<br />
The financial data should also be joined. Verify how tables are shared between the financial companies. Maybe you have the possibility to wipe the data together in one company. <br />
<br />
Also here you may consider finalizing the remaining invoices in the old company before you close it down.<br />
<br />
Before you delete the old financial company, consider the consequences for history data, archives etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
             - We have entirely two separate companies(no tables integration in terms of logical tables)<br />
<br />

<br />
some more questions: <br />
- do the two financial companies have the same currency? <br />
- How many logistic companies are involved and how is the company structure, how are the relations between the different companies? <br />
- Do you need only a Consolidated Report?<br />
- Did you set up separated GL-Accounts to identify intercompany transaction, with the purpose to eliminate intercompany profits?<br />
- Do you have the same booking rules, inventory valuation principles in both companies?<br />
<br />
regards, Juli  <br />
