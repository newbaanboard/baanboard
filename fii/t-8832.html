<br />
I want to know about the solution.<br />
<br />
If purchase order is created actually at Feb. 02. 2003,<br />
but I want to post that transaction at Jan. 31. 2003 to<br />
finance table, ie posting date should be Jan. 31. 2003.<br />
<br />
How can I  do that?<br />
<br />
Best regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">12th February 2003, 06:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you not simply backdate the receipt to Jan 31, 2003? As long as the fiscal period that includes Jan 31 is still open, the receipt should post to finance as of Jan 31.<br />
<br />
I dont think that you can enter a planned delivery date on the PO that is earlier than the PO entry date, but I believe that the receipt can still be backdated. You can test this fairly easily. Maybe someone whose focus is logistics can quickly affirm this or shoot it down.<br />
<br />
From a finance perspective, I hate to suggest backdated logistic transactions, especially if they are dated into a prior period. Doing so really complicates reporting and account reconciliation. However, sometimes there are compelling business reasons There are several other threads that discuss the pitfalls of backdated receipts. You may want to search for these and review them.<br />

You can backdate the PO so that your receipt can be booked on the last day of Jan, if the transaction should be posted in Jan.</div></div><hr />
