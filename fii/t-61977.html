<br />
My company is using BAAN 4.<br />
<br />
Some client invoices have been posted to a wrong project and Iâ€™d like to move them to correct project.<br />
<br />
The account receivable told me that from the moment a client invoice has been paid we cannot raise a credit note. Hence we cannot change anything in the accounting side and it could only be amended in the Project Module.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how we can do that?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />
