<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thomasthetank</div><div class="date">22nd January 2021, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there an automated way of individually printing &amp; saving PDF invoices for a large range of business partners, one partner at a time, for a given date range?<br />
<br />
Scenario:<br />
<br />
At the start of each month we produce invoices for the month just ended, and we email these (in PDF format) to our business partners.<br />
Because of assorted ship-from destinations, each partner may get several invoices and credit notes at the end of a given month.<br />
<br />
We use the session cisli2405m000 (Reprint Invoices) to generate the PDFs - one PDF file per business partner.<br />
These PDFs are then saved in a folder, ready to be attached to the email along with other relevant files.<br />
<br />
We need to have one individual PDF for each business partner, which contains only the invoices for that business partner, and for the date range that was specified (the month just ended)<br />
<br />
Each business partner number has a 3-letter prefix and a sequential 6-digit number.<br />
We have two separate groups so the range of business partners for which we need to reprint the PDF invoices is:<br />
Group 1 : ABC000001 to ABC000999<br />
Group 2 : XYZ000001 to XYZ000999<br />
And the date range needs to cover the entire month just ended, e.g. 01-12-20 to 31-12-20<br />
<br />
Current process :<br />
<br />
Start the Baan session cisli2405m000 (Reprint Invoices)<br />
Input the first business partner number e.g. from ABC000001 to ABC000001<br />
Input the date range e.g. for the month of December 2020 that would be from 01-12-20 to 31-12-20<br />
Print<br />
Baan generates a PDF file containing the invoices(s) for that partner.<br />
Save the PDF using the business partner number as the filename : ABC000001.pdf<br />
Repeat for ABC000002, ABC000003, ABC000004 and so on.<br />
Then when all of the ABCxxxxxx business partners are finished, repeat the process with XYZ000001, XYZ000002, XYZ000003, and so on.<br />
<br />

<br />
We don't need to do this for every business partner, as some may have no transactions that month.<br />
Let's say that across the two groups we will have a total of 200 separate PDFs created, each PDF containing only the invoice(s) for a single business partner for that month.<br />
<br />
As you can imagine, this takes a lot of time.<br />
<br />
The goal :<br />
<br />
I'd like to be able to enter a set of parameters and then leave Baan to do the rest, running overnight if necessary.<br />
The parameters would be :<br />
The first range of business partners : ABC000001 to ABC000999<br />
Date range : 01-12-20 to 31-12-20<br />
Baan will then print and save (in a folder of my choosing) the invoices for each business partner in turn, each PDF containing all of the invoices for that month for each business partner.<br />
If any business partner in that range has no transactions/invoices for that month, it will skip over them and move on to the next one.<br />
<br />
I would then repeat the same process with the second group of business partners : XYZ000001 to XYZ000999<br />
<br />
The goal is to end up with the same 200 individual PDFs, with the business partner number being the filename.<br />
So that I have a folder looking like this :<br />
<br />

<br />
Is this possible? Has anybody done this before, and how was it achieved?<br />
<br />
Any guidance would be very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

You are better off posting your screenshots as attachments to your post. The external links will probably stop working after a while.</div></div><hr />

We had tables we created to provide the parameters - in our case the one I am thinking of was outbound.  Basically we generated it overnight - each warehouse had different requirements.  So we put those in a table and would run it each night with the provided parameters - print outbound, print tags, printer, etc.  Then we could turn off or change things as needed.</div></div><hr />
