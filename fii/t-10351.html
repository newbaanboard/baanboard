<br />
I had faced this kind of problem previously. I had run the following sessions: Rebuild ledger History (tfgld3203m000) and the Recalculate open entries (tfcor0260m000) and I was able to solve the problem. I am not sure if this will solve your problem also. If your problem is nt solved after running the 2 sessions then the only way is to look at the individual transactions in tfgld106 and tfacp200. (generally the problem is in tfacp200 - the 'Amount', Amount in Invoice currency' and 'Amount in home currency' fields). Run a query to dump the data of tfacp200 as a report for analysis.<br />
<br />
Note: Rebuild ledger history takes quite a lot of time to run and resets opening balances to zero if you havnt closed the last financial year finally. You have to run the session Close year (provisional) to get back the opening balances for teh current year.<br />
<br />
Hope this is of help to you.<br />

<br />
Make sure that all batches for the period are finalized.</div></div><hr />

Did you check Baan Online Support for solutions?<br />
For example: solution 121629.<br />
Or has this one been installed aleady?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you checked all the simple things<br />
<br />
Like all transactions being finalised<br />
Any stuck batches etc.<br />
<br />
In the chart of accounts does the parent have the correct children and are &quot;families&quot; nested correctly. If these are set up incorrectly the total of a parent account will be wrong.<br />
<br />
These may not be the answer but sometime we look for the solution in a dark corner when it was in broad daylight all along.<br />

<br />
Pls let me know if Ur problem is solved. Otherwise try this:<br />
<br />
1) Print the check list for each financial supplier group<br />
<br />
2) Check whether the finalised / non finalised balances tally with ur trial balance<br />
<br />
3) If they dont reconcile for each supplier group<br />
<br />
4) If they do check whether the acp balances tally. <br />
<br />
5) If it doesnt then take the print out of the session tfacp2434m000 (print supplier total balances) and reconcile by supplier group<br />
<br />
6) Once U tally these two then U can tally this report with the aging analysis<br />
<br />
There could be other ways of solving this problem but this approach has helped me.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think you are taking a too technical approach to the problem  Yes, all these steps will certainly help you find out the difference.  Trial balance is the summation of all finalized transactions + Opening balance.  And the real comparision lie between the tables tfacp200 &amp; tfgld106.  This is what the control account checklist does.<br />
<br />
But did you check out for the most common 'accountant's mistake'?  ie, Journal vouchers in the creditors control accounts?  It is quite possible that the users could have tried to reverse some transactions by passing a JV instead of Debit/credit note which populates both GLD &amp; ACP.  But a JV has a single sided effect.  It does not populate the ACP tables, and not shown in the control account checklist, either.<br />
<br />
Also look out for any direct payment in bank (not using check payment route), using 'journal' transaction type instead of &quot;supplier transaction&quot; type.  Check for the corresponding debit account being a creditors control account.<br />
<br />
Run tfgld1406m000 for the control account, selecting only the above transaction types.  This is certainly not there in your aging report.<br />
<br />
Please do let me know this helped you.<br />
<br />
