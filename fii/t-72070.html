Session: &quot;Maintain Payment Advice&quot; , tfcmg1120m000<br />
We have two bookkeepers and I have to provide both of them to edit payment advice that the other one had opened. I know that it is a bad practice, but this is a requirement of the business process.<br />
<br />
One of the bookkeepers can edit the payment advice that had been created by the other one. I need to learn what permission shall I grant to the second bookkeeper to allow him to edit payment advice that was opened by the first bookkeeper.<br />
<br />
Needless to say that the permission for the session tfcmg1120m000 is already granted to both bookkeepers</div></div><hr />

At a time only one user can be super user. Whatever  the user ID that you update in CMG parameter that user will become a super and he can edit any batch, which you would be aware already.<br />
There is no other authorization session as per my knowledge.<br />
<br />
Now when user try to open the payment advice it will check two tables tfcmg109, tfcmg000.<br />
I think you have to overwrite this with little bit customisation.</div></div><hr />
