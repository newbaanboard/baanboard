<br />
Did you mean that you already make the matching transaction for your first receipt (Qty 1,amount = 10000 $)?<br />
If so, then you can check your integration transaction for that PO.<br />
It will show a new line for: Purchase - Result, the amount will be 5000 $.<br />
<br />
Since your PO is only for 1 unit and you have received &amp; match 1 unit, there's nothing more for you to receipt for that PO.<br />
<br />
Partial receipt means that the qty you received is not the full qty you ordered. Example: PO qty: 10 and you receive only 5. Then you'll still have back order for 5.<br />
<br />
I hope this explanation helps.<br />
<br />
