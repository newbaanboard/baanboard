PO Created - April 05<br />
PO Received - April 05<br />
<br />
When I run the integration transactions report, I notice that the Fiscal Period in this report indicated that this transaction's Fiscal Period is another period (let's said June 05).  :confused:  :confused: <br />
<br />
It is not only happen to 1 transaction. There are quite a lot of such transactions. <br />
<br />
What is the logic to determine which period to post?   :confused: <br />
<br />
Appreciate input from all of the experts.   :)  :) <br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mohamed_alsadr</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I have got this from Baan help..<br />
----<br />
BaanERP always posts an integration transaction to the same fiscal period for the companies related to the debit transaction and credit transaction. If a transaction with a logistical origin must be posted to two different financial companies, the transaction is posted to the same fiscal period in both companies. The same applies to reporting periods. This situation occurs if:<br />
<br />
The debit transaction and credit transaction have a different company<br />
The period statuses in the different companies differ during the posting of integration transactions<br />
<br />
BaanERP determines the fiscal period and reporting period as follows:<br />
<br />
1.Determine the period based on the transaction date<br />
<br />
2.Based on this period, determine the first open period for the from and to company<br />
<br />
3.Compare the determined open periods of the credit company and debit company: <br />
<br />
a. periods are equal, goto step 6 <br />
b. periods differ, goto step 4<br />
<br />
4.Select the latest period and check whether the period is open for the other company:<br />
<br />
a. period is open, goto step 6 <br />
b. period is not open, goto step 5<br />
<br />
5.Log an error<br />
6.The period is determined<br />
<br />
Example  <br />
A transaction is created in January, and the transaction must be posted to two financial companies. The status of the fiscal period January is open in company one. However, in company two, January is already closed. BaanERP will post the transaction to the fiscal period <br />
February in both financial companies.<br />
-----<br />
This also is applicable if the posting is to one financial company...<br />
<br />
In session tfgld4150s000 Integration parameteres U can allow posting to next open period or not.<br />
<br />
Hope this can help..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason that I asked because it only has one Financial company. <br />
<br />
Based on the explaination it should posted to one period but I faces many transactions facing such problem.<br />
<br />
If i set the parameter not not allow posting to next periods, what will happen for those transactions with next period?  :confused: <br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mohamed_alsadr</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">check if the integration is posted after the period is closed...<br />
<br />
If you try to post integration without allowing the &quot;posting to next open period&quot;, and the peiod is closed you would get the status error and an error log would be created.<br />
<br />
also try this:<br />
<br />
in session tfgld4510m000 integration transaction by project/order select the transaction you have problem with and in the posting tab you might find when it is created and posted and the user who posted it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MIALIM</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">yes. the parameter allow posting to previous period.<br />
<br />
My concern is why the system post it to next period since all transactions completed within this period. Izzit a bug? Have you ever encountered such problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mohamed_alsadr</div><div class="date">4th September 2005, 10:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
what do you mean by &quot;the parameter allow posting to previous period&quot;..<br />
<br />
have you checked the date of posting and the creation date ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MIALIM</div><div class="date">6th September 2005, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The posting to next open period is allow.<br />
<br />
Yes, I've checked the creation date and posting date. Logically speaking, it should post to the PO Receipt date but it posted months in advance.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
