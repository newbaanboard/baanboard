<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cybermin</div><div class="date">5th September 2019, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Good morning. I tried searching for an answer and didn't see what I was looking for.  Recently we switched some of our parts in the item data from manufacturing to purchased via the Item Group.<br />
<br />
The issue we are now having is when some of the parts are received, the FG GL Account is being credited instead of the RM GL Account and on other receipts the RM GL account is being credited for the same part.<br />
<br />
How would I go about finding out why the parts aren't flowing properly?<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
  Alex</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnbhatt</div><div class="date">4th October 2019, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">You must have already created PO with old item group that stores in tdpur041 and subsequently carries the same to tfgld415 after receipt from logistics.<br />
<br />
If you are still having the POs created prior to change of item group either you should change the new item group in tdpur041 before taking the receipt or tfgld415 before posting of integration transaction to Finance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope your issue will be resolved:):)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cybermin</div><div class="date">7th October 2019, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">bnbhatt... Thank you for your response.  As you mentioned, that is correct.  We had open POs dating back to the beginning of 2018 and were still being received upon.<br />
<br />
The issue is because of the way we acquired the new company, the company we purchased from is the only people that have admin rights to change the tables; as we are still leasing the ERP System.</div></div><hr />
