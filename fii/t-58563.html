Honestly, do you really think a question so unspecific like this will get an awnser here? Why do you want to change the currency? Which version are we talking of? What have you tried already? And &quot;currency&quot; is written with r's, not with t's. The Baanboard community is always keen to help, but it's really no good style to throw in a one-liner like this for a problem like this, showing no care for your question whatsover, and expect someone to help you.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you really have to change the home currency, you will have to get a decent consultant to your site. If it can be done at all, it will cost you a fair amount of programming / money.</div></div><hr />
