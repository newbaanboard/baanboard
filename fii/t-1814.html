<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">1st May 2002, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, the GTM is the only way to reopen the period. Be aware that this should only be done in the current year, in case you accidentally finally closed a period.<br />
<br />
If you do so for already closed fiscal years and you make some changes, the closing balances will alter and thus no longer be the same as the opening balance of the next year... unless you change that as well. Baan does not support that in any way.</div></div><hr />
