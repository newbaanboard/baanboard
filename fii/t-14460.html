<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">11th February 2004, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">When adding a couple of new payment methods we somehow managed to miss out the posting data on one of the Payment Methods. We made one payment with this Payment Method which we will probably have to raise a journal for to cover the transactions which should have been written to tfgld102 (if there is a correction program for this somebody please tell me).<br />
<br />
Anyway the problem we now have is that when trying to add the posting data via session tfcmg0146s000 we receive the message<br />
&quot;Anticipated payments found for this payment method&quot;.<br />
<br />
The one obvious way around this we be to add the posting data via GTM but in the circumstances is this safe ? <br />

<br />
There are records in tfcmg110/111/112 and they need to be cleared before u define new steps.<br />
<br />
Anyway how did you get around with the stuckup batch. I mean if you are doing payments then that invoice(for which you are doing payments) will remain open in tfacp200!!<br />
<br />
Revert with details ...You can make changes thru GTM as well.<br />
<br />

<br />
I checked the program and the error is issued if there exiats aat least one record in tfcmg110 for this bank and payment method that has an open payment document status.<br />
<br />
This records are not fully processed, reconciliation was not done yet.<br />
<br />
If you did not have any posting data so when you reconcile the postings, that were not created, will not be reversed.<br />
<br />
If you have defined partiasl posting definitions maybe you can reject the payment, this will open the invoices, and then you can pay again.<br />
<br />
The solution really depends on the exect situation.<br />
<br />
Anyway, changing the definitions should be done after processing the open payments, and then you should be able to add the posting data through the session and not needing GTM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As an additional issue we are now attempting to set up another payment method after adding the posting data we are getting the following message;<br />
<br />
&quot;Contra posting data for Payment Method ZAW step document accepted / sent line 1 not found&quot;<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me what this means ?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Neal</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which session issues the message?<br />
<br />
Does the message have a code?<br />
<br />
I will try to check if you give me those details.<br />
<br />
Without checking, it might be because you defined only one posting line under the document accepted / sent step of the ZAW payment method and the relevant Bank Relation.<br />

<br />
From what I know, the message means that for line 1 - Suplier Control Account / Debit there should be another line, on a different Payment/Receipt Procedure step, where the Suplier Control Account should be credited.<br />
<br />

<br />
I can now see what the session is doing.<br />

<br />
Attached document shows procedure for getting round our initial problem.<br />

We got around our second problem as Ruluca said in a earlier post by defining another line, on a different Payment/Receipt Procedure step, where the Suplier Control Account should be credited.<br />
<br />
Thanks for everbodies help in clearing this up.<br />
<br />
