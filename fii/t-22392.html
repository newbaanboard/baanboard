<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nicolas</div><div class="date">22nd November 2004, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to book invoice transactions from distribution to dimensions based on the &quot;distribution&quot; order type of the invoiced order within standard Baan?<br />
If not, does anybody have a hint whether is it possible to develop a customisation to include this as an eligible allocation criteria for integration elements, and what would roughly be the way to go? We're on Baan IV c4.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">23rd November 2004, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, Baan Standard does not offer the sales or type as an integration option (I guess the reason for this is that you could use different ledger accounts by sales order type).<br />
<br />
However, with a little development that issue can be overcome very quickly: Choose one of the options you have there but that you don't use. For example, Baan offers you an integration option &quot;service order type&quot;- this field is normally useless for sales order integrations. The integration table holding the data used for the posting to dimensions (tfgld415) will have an empty service order type field for all sales orders. The trick is, to abuse that field to hold the sales order type, and to the dimension posting with the value of this field.<br />
<br />
So: First, you need a new session, that runs over the unposted sales invoice integration transactions and fills the service order type field in tfgld415 with the sales order type. You will have to run that session always before you run the &quot;post integration transactions to finance&quot; session. <br />
<br />
Second, you just set up an integration from the *service order type* to your dimension. Fortunately, the program doing the integration posting does not try to be more intelligent then it should be - it does'nt care that a service order type does not make sens for a sales order. It just finds the integration option, is happy that the service order type field is filled (by your new session) and does the integration.<br />
<br />
I have used that kind of setup at quite a number of my customers - it really works fine.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />
