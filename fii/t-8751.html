Yes I've done this already for a few times.<br />
You should import a file to tables tfgld213, tfgld214 and tfgld215 and then run session tfgld2215m000.<br />
If you need I can send u an example of a type of exchange scheme that is performing this. As u may know the fields in the file and the type of complexity on the exchnage sheme depends on the type of information and the format of file you can generate from the software that is processing wages.<br />

<br />
Would you like to look into the possibility of using AFS? AFS is an instruction set provided by Baan so that you can remotely control BaanERP sessions from within or outside BaanERP itself. This is a very safe way for customisation as all the logic involved in the process you would want to customise are executed too. There is a separate forum in this board for AFS (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=59) where you can get many help from different people experienced in AFS<br />

Correct me if  I am wrong, I was only thinking to import the table tfgld102. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">There is an import journal voucher session which is already created in Baan.  As Pedro mentioned this works of tables tfgld213, 214, 215.  An exchange scheme is used to populate these tables and the sessions will create the tfgld102 entries for you.<br />
<br />
You cannot just import data into tfgld102 as there are other tables eg. tfgld018, tfgld100, tfgld101 which need to be populated to create a finance batch.  As you say to generate document numbers will require some programming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep - Baan released JVIMPORT, a sample exchange scheme with documentation that does this that you can use at least to start with.  Then run the standard Import Journal Transactions (tfgld2215m000) to create the gld entries from the import tables.<br />
<br />
Check solution # 155541 on the Baan support site.</div></div><hr />
