<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">5th October 2010, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">If you know a purchase is going to be invoiced in instalments one things that springs to mind is to create a purchase order with appropriate lines and value. e.g.<br />
line one - 30% deposit,  line two - 60% at delivery,  line three - 10% after 30 days.<br />
<br />
But what is it that you are purchasing? This may decide what you can or cannot do.</div></div><hr />

Hi Elizabeth,<br />
<br />
Did you get a solution? We have a similar requirement in Purchase, functionality similar to Installment Order in Sales.<br />
<br />
At present we are also doing similar way as suggested by Penfold, but it has few limitations like we have to do the Warehouse Receipt in any case so as to invoice.<br />
<br />
