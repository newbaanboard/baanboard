<br />
We are getting a: &quot;BNK DCK Amount tfcmg112: 3524.56 &lt;&gt; amount tfcmg111: 3524.56&quot; error when reconciling a supplier payment. <br />
<br />
In session tfcmg2103s000 (Reconciliation of Receipts/Payments), when trying to change “Payment Document Status” from “Open” to “Complete” we receive this error. The strange part is that, the two numbers it comparing are exactly the same.<br />
<br />
Hoping someone can help me with this. Appreciate any feedback.<br />

<br />
Can you check in the tables (tfcmg111 and tfcmg112) if the amounts are stored with more than 2 decimals and if there is a difference?<br />
<br />

Sorry, I should have posted a follow up to this. I actually was able to resolve this issue. There was a variance of 0.0000001 between the two tables. You really can’t tell unless you dump the data to Excel and analyze. Bad code. Should have used the tolerance with double compare in finance across-the-board.<br />
