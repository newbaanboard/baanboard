<br />
We just implemented new ERPln, in order to allow the system running we have created a dummy mapping scheme. But after 3 months parallel we decided to go live.<br />
The problem is when we checked our g/l all the transaction is as per dummy mapping.<br />
<br />
My question is how we can changed back all the transaction to follow our new mapping scheme.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

If it is NOT 'Posted', you can remap to new mapping scheme else you cannot change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not really understand what you mean with the phrase &quot;The problem is when we checked our g/l all the transaction is as per dummy mapping&quot;. <br />
So you had a &quot;dummy mapping scheme&quot;, but you still used that one to map and post your integration transactions? I am sorry to say, but that is of course a bit stupid.<br />
If you did not post them, then you can of course easily remap them with your new active &quot;correct&quot; mapping scheme. <br />
If you did post them already then you can use the session &quot;Remap Posted Integration transactions&quot;. With this session you can revert the already created integration transactions and can map and post again, see the help (it is session tfgld4282m100). I am not sure in which feature packs of LN this session is available by the way.<br />
