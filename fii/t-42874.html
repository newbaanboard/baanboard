<br />
I am a user on Baan 4C4. I have a issue in Finance which ia unable to resolve. I need all finance friends to help me out.<br />
<br />
I want to change the control account for a Financial customer group. I have checked the customer total balance (tfacr2433m000) against the customer group. The report does not reflect any outstanding invoice.<br />
<br />
However when i go to change the control account for the cutomer group, it does not allow me to do so, it says Debit/credit entries present, i am unable to figure out what to do next.<br />
<br />
Can somebody help me out to resolve this.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards,<br />
<br />
Neetal</div></div><hr />

U can use the program tfacr2415m000  - control account checklist report to analyse the differences / inconsistencies .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">12th October 2007, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">The regular way is that there are no open entries per group so the change could be done - but that of course will never happen in real life. It is possible to achieve that by changing various tables accordingly but that is certainly something for consultancy and nothing for the board I guess.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the Inputs. Yes, you are right. I did all possible checks &amp; workarounds could not succeed. Finally i created 2 new financial groups, and linked them to cutomers. Thats the only way i could resolve.<br />
<br />
Thanks once again.<br />
