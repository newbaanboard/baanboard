<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">djlang</div><div class="date">27th February 2007, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been reporting for several years with a balance sheet that has not been using dimensions with the exception of the inventory accounts which has been using the financial integration setup.  We do not use the FA functionality and post these as manual JVs.<br />
<br />
I am looking now at the possibility of splitting all the other Balance sheet items, and in particular Debtors &amp; Creditors by dimension.  <br />
<br />
The only place that I can see any linkage to dimensions is through the Customer/Supplier groups setup.  However am I right in saying that it would be one dimension per group.  I would be expecting to see the likes of the integration setup based upon customer or supplier.  If not would I need to set up seperate Customer/Supplier Groups for each dimension?<br />
<br />
Also, I cannot find the setup to where the posting for a Purchase Invoice Approval transaction is.  Is this system defaulted?<br />
<br />
I haven't got to the stage of considering the cash &amp; reserves but any info would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Can anyone provide any advice on these?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Purchase Invoice approval document :<br />
While making the receipt of Purchases, Invoice accrual account is credited by Integration (tfgld4573m000)  and once we book it into finance just after approval of the purchase invoice the credit entry of Invoice accrual is debited, this entry comes by default.<br />
