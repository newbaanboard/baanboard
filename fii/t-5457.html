<br />
does anyone of you have any experience with the Post-Triangulation?<br />
When should it be done, and how much time does it take?<br />
<br />
Regards, Juli</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">10th June 2002, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">The transition period end at the 1st of July so it should be done after that date.<br />
<br />
How long it's going to run depends of course of your data. I would recommend that you first run a test in order to check if it's going to run withour errors and also can find out how long it runs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">10th June 2002, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">In general the post-triangulation takes more time than the Triangulation (because all records are 'hit' and not only the ones with the foreign 'EMU' currency) but less than the internal-conversion (because all 'EUR' records already have the proper currency rate, often a large part of your database).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">11th June 2002, 11:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is Posttriangulation needed at all? Could somebody explain the background, please? During Triangulation all currency conversions for EMU currencies are done via the Euro. After the transition phase all currency conversions are done via the new home curreny Euro. The old EMU currencies don't exist any more. So why do we have to change the currency conversion algorithm that only operates when EMU currencies are concerned?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">11th June 2002, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">An answer might be that Baan will discontinue to support the Triangulation software. For now calculating the currency rates and amounts requires different codings.<br />
Maybe also some commercial reasons (Support licences) ???</div></div><hr />

Solution description <br />
This solution will be updated, if necessary!<br />
LAST UPDATE: 01/25/2002 (format: MM/DD/YYYY)<br />
<br />
Post-Triangulation is obligatory and should be executed during 2002. As of January 1st 2003 CS&amp;S no longer supports instalations that have not done the Post-triangulation. <br />
....<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
&lt;end of quote&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, that tells me one thing: There is obvously no business necessity for posttriangulation, it's a request of Baan support. <br />
<br />
I would guess (but that's just a guess) that Baan development doesn't want to have too many possible migration paths open if new countries decide to join the EMU. Because then, new software will be required to handle this, and this software better operates on a common installation base. <br />
<br />
<br />
So let's go for the next service packs... damn...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pfsilva</div><div class="date">21st January 2003, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I've performed for 4 Baan clients the Post-Triangulation.<br />
Mainly what it does is:<br />
- inverts the rate of all EMU currencies in tables tfgld106, tfgld410, tfacr200, tfacp200, tdslsxxx and all others that had mentions to the EMU currecies and the EURO.<br />
- transfers to table tcmcsXXX Currency rates of non EMU currencies.<br />
- it no longer uses tccri tables as currency rate tables.<br />
- there are no longer available transactions in the former EMU currencies.<br />
<br />
As far as I can recall these are the main changes.<br />
Regards,<br />
Pedro</div></div><hr />
