<br />
Purchases = use tax<br />
Sales, Service for the Sales Tax side.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.<br />

<br />
Both have a slightly different philosophy about how they have accomplish the same tasks.<br />
<br />
Taxware has thousands of preset tax product codes which define taxability for each state. You have a match your items to these preset tax product codes. <br />
<br />
Vertex has no preset tax product codes. Vertex's philosophy is that this is unique for your business and allows you to define product taxaiblity within the TDM module.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both have pro's and con's for this approach. Taxware's approach can lead you into a false sense of security because there definition may not be the same for your organization. Setting up custom product mapping is not user friendly within Taxware. All non taxable product mapping in Vertex has to be setup within the TDM.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vertex's monthly update process can be done by the appropriate end users, Taxware is more an I.S. function.<br />
<br />
As for the functionality question both packages will handle sales and use tax. The limiting factor here is Baan's functionality. You should know that standard Baan will not update the tax provider's register for use tax processing (Purchases). This is a major limitation as use tax accruals do not flow through to each of the packages returns modules. This can be accomplished with add on functionality. Standard sales and service invoices do update the tax provider register.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you need any further information</div></div><hr />

We did a demo on Friday of Taxware and I was wondering about the monthly updates and the amount of maintenance it would take to maintain all the items.  Vertex demo is coming up next.  <br />
