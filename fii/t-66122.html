This is of the format ***123/4567/89012*** or +++123/4567/89012+++.<br />
<br />
We think we have to enter this as Supplier invoice-nr of the ACP-Business Partner, so when a payment-run will be done this is the identification for the receiver of the money (the ACP-BP) which is invoice is paid.<br />
<br />
Is there a possibility in Infor LN, that automatic generates the *** and / (or +++ and /) in the field &quot;Supplier invoice&quot;) when entering a purchase-invoice.<br />
(session tfacp2600m000).<br />

Thx for your reply.<br />

You may also answer in Dutch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that is nothing that I have heard of so far but it is worth logging an incident at 365 Infor and ask for it. If it is a legal requirement then they will provide or have to provide it. <br />
<br />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
This &quot;gestructeerde mededeling&quot; is not a legal requirement. It is a special Belgium manner to match a payment to an invoice in a very easy way.<br />
I don't want this to be a customization for only our company.<br />
Perhaps it is indeed therefore a good idea to log this at 365INFOR, so they can have a look at it and write software as a localization for Belgium.<br />
