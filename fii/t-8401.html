Please help, what do we have to do?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">13th January 2003, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">The message appears when the integration table can not be written.<br />
I think &quot;000&quot; in the message is the order line number. This order line zero is used when an installment is invoiced. Does the order use installments, and if so, do you have the appropriate items set in the sales order parameters?</div></div><hr />

<br />
it is a normal sales without installments, without proforma invoicing or something. <br />
Yes, 000 is just the replacement for the order line, in the order it is 30. <br />

<br />
The error comes from tdsls4223 when it gets a return from tfglddll4011 that it did not succeed to write an integration transaction for an invoice line.<br />
The fields on the error text are:<br />
tdsls045.orno<br />
tdsls045.pono (I do not see why it is displayed as 000)<br />
<br />
I do not see such a problem in BaaN case base.<br />
<br />
I think that the problem can be found by debugging and / or you have to open a case.<br />
<br />
By the way, if you want to continue processing other orders until the problem is fixed, you can temporarily remove this order lines from tdsls049 (or change their key).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jan van dillen</div><div class="date">14th January 2003, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen this error when one invoice results in more than 32.000 tfgld410 records. In that case Baan aborts the database transaction and gives the mentioned error message.<br />
You should have a look at Baan solution 9316:<br />
After printing invoices, an attempt to Process the Delivered Sales Orders results in an error message similar to &quot;Invoice line could not be written to Finance for order 410275 line 960.&quot; <br />
You could check in tdsls045 how many sales order lines are linked to the sales invoice. If there are a few thousand sales order lines  linked to the sales invoice, this could be the cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
I think the best way to solve this issue is to run the session tdcor4404m000 for the invoice that gave the error, change the value of the field maximum invoice lines to for example 8000 (this value depends on the number of tfgld410 records created per sales order line) in the session 'Maintain Performance boosters' (tcmcs0197m000)  and print the sales invoice again. <br />
Please note that this will result in a gap in your invoice numbering.</div></div><hr />
