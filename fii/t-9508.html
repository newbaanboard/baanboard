I was almost looked BaanERP documentation for Finance. But I have a few questions for finance configuration. Because I don¡¦t know how many configuration is need to do it?<br />
	So, maybe someone can tell me which configuration has to do for finance basically?<br />
	Now, I know that have ¡§Ledger account¡¨, ¡§Fiscal period¡¨, ¡§journal entry for every finance transaction¡¨, ¡§payment term¡¨ only for finance configuration.<br />
	I remember finance have four main statements. It¡¦s ¡§Balance sheet¡¨, ¡§Income statements¡¨, ¡§Statement of Cash Flow¡¨, and ¡§Statement of owners equity¡¨. But I don¡¦t looked about these statement contents. May be I lose something about these statements.<br />

Simple to say, I just want to find out that four finance statements first, it's &quot;Balance sheet&quot;, &quot;Income statement&quot;, &quot;statement of Cash flow&quot;, &quot;Statement of Owner equity&quot;.<br />
Because in BaanERP 5.2a documentation that it's no too many explain. In the system, I no find out. <br />
Thans for your information for statement. But I don't understand German. <br />
Thanks a lot!!<br />

<br />
I think the answer is not one that you're looking for. <br />
<br />
There are no &quot;standard&quot; financial reports for &quot;Balance sheet&quot;, &quot;Income statement&quot;, &quot;statement of Cash flow&quot;, or &quot;Statement of Owner equity&quot; in Baan (either IV or V). <br />
<br />
In order to build these financial statements, you must:<br />
(1) understand the structure of your general ledger chart of accounts;<br />
(2) understand how transactions are posted to these accounts in your Baan environment (that is, understand the integrations mappings from Logistics to Finance, the setup or accounts receivable &amp; payable, etc.);<br />
(3) know what financial information must be reported in the &quot;Balance sheet&quot;, &quot;Income statement&quot;, &quot;statement of Cash flow&quot;, and &quot;Statement of Owner equity&quot; reports according to your company's requirements and the requirements of the country and authorities that it must report to;<br />
(4*) map the general ledger accounts to financial statement accounts and then build the content and format of the statements in FST; or<br />
(5*) alternately, use an external report writer (such as Crystal, Cognos, Safari) or a third party reporting software (such as Hyperion) to build the financial statements.<br />
<br />
If you don't understand (1), (2) or (3), you need to consult with your finance and accounting department to determine your company's requirements.<br />
<br />
If you don't understand (4*) and (5*), you may be able to self learn from the standard Baan documentation and help text. But I think you'll be better served by arranging training through Baan, your implementation partner or one of Baan's training partners.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps to answer your questions.<br />
