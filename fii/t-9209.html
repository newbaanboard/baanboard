<br />
We are in BaaN IV c4.<br />
<br />
When Fixed assets are transfered  from one group to another,<br />
Dimensions code for the ledger account  is not picked up for Depreciation transaction type which we have defined in Transaction schedule. <br />
<br />
Due to this,  we got error as &quot;Dimension is mandatory&quot; for the ledger account  when we tried to post to finance.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you be more specific, how yours transaction schedule looks like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">12th March 2003, 06:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi oleska,<br />
<br />
In the transaction schedule we have defined ledger accounts and dimensions for transaction types 'Investment','Disposal','Book value','Depreciation' and 'Depreciation costs'.<br />
<br />
Dimension one is mandatory for the appropriate ledger accounts defined in the transaction schedules and dimension ranges have also been defined for these ledger accounts.<br />
<br />
We transferred fixed assets from one Fixed assets group to another assigning the same code for the fixed assets.When the session 'Post FAS transactions to General ledger'(tffas1201m000) was run, a batch was created.When we tried to finalise this batch,we got the error report 'Dimension One mandatory'.<br />
<br />
When we checked the logged transactions (tffas 1520m000),<br />
The transaction type &quot;Transferred&quot; shows that Investment transaction  had picked up the ledger account and dimension but the depreciation transaction had picked up the ledger account only not the dimension.<br />
<br />
Hope this is clear for u.  awaiting reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regds.</div></div><hr />

Have you used an existing asset group for transfer or created a new group?<br />

<br />
Thanks for ur reply.<br />
<br />
Interim act. which we defined for the group does not have dimension 1 mandatory.  We are trying to transfer Fixed assets to exisiting group not new group.<br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When asset is transfered program also copies transaction schedule of the source asset to the target asset. You have to check your transaction schedule on group level and asset level(the highest priority) for a target asset. If transaction schedulle if fine check with Baan Support.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
