<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">24th September 2008, 11:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I am told that it is not possible due to Hungarian accounting law to send an invoice in an electronic format. For example print the invoice to a PDF and send it via email or even send the print job directly across the network to their printers. They require the original paper invoice received with the goods or sent separately . This seems like an odd requirement as I thought these practices were harmonised across the EU. In the UK we could just print out the PDF document. Hoping there might be some Hungarian accounts people who could clarify if this is correct.<br />

I wanted to reply to you earlier, but I had technical problems. I'm not accountant, and I'm very new on this forum, but unfortunately I had to say to you, that in Hungary it's required to get an original, stamped and signed paper invoice. Companies can't account their cost without it. There's a so called &quot;electronic invoice&quot;, but it's not that kind, what you described. It's more difficult to create it like paper invoice.</div></div><hr />
