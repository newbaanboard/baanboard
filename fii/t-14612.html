<br />
We are planning to outsource our suppliers payment to bank.  The bank required us to submit a payment bankfile in ascii format to them via connection to their server. <br />
<br />
The will provide the file layout which will consist such as, payment invoices details, payment date, supplier name, address &amp; etc. This is to be output from the Baan.<br />
<br />
The bank will prepare the cheque per supplier based on the bankfile submitted to them, at the sametime, bank will print the payment advice together with the cheque and send to the suppliers. After payment, the bank will return to us a bankfile (ascii) which consists cheque number and payment invoice details.<br />
The file is to be used to update the A/P and I'm not sure which table and which field to update the cheque number in the baan.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone has done this ? <br />
<br />
Need advise.</div></div><hr />

While Maintaining the payment methods the field Output type is to be &quot;file&quot;. So when the payment Advice is processed it will generate a file instead of printing Cheques and Payment advise. The file that gets generated have to to customised to the requirement of the Bank.<br />
<br />
As far as receiving the file from the Bank you will have to use the Electronic Banking System (EBS) functionality of Baan.</div></div><hr />
