When we try to reverse an approval, the system throws up a message and does not allow to reverse. The message says:<br />
&quot;Order which was linked to this invoice has been deleted. Reverse approval not possible.&quot;<br />
The order is present in the tables tdpur045, tdpur046.<br />
Any idea what this is all about!?<br />
<br />

There are a few different ways that this can be fixed depending on where baan goes wrong.   Baan usually tries to tie one approval document to two different purchase invoices.  But, not always.  It's probably a good idea to call baan support and describe the circumstances.<br />
The tables you will want to study for your analysis will be<br />
tfacp200<br />
tfacp204 <br />
tfacp101<br />
tfgld102<br />
tdpur045 <br />
There could be all or some of the above tables needing GTM.<br />
I have resolved this same problem 3 times in the last 4 years.  The fix has NEVER been identical to the fix before it.  If you are not familiar with finance transaction flow and processing you will definately benefit from a call to baan support.<br />
cheers,<br />

But, correction program otfcor0229 helped me solve the issue. Thought of posting it as it might help someone else.:)</div></div><hr />
