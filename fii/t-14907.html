<br />
We are working on Baan Baan 4c4 (in5).<br />
<br />
Earlier when we working under in3, TDS screen was pop up as<br />
&amp; when we register the purchase invoice, but now one has<br />
to deduct the TDS through Special drop down Menu.<br />
<br />
Is there any way that screen will be popup for TDS deductions?<br />
<br />
Earlier TDS was getting posted as &amp; when we deduct the TDS, but now Seperate session is available to post the TDS deductions to GLD.  <br />
<br />
Is there any way to post TDS transactions as &amp; when one can deduct the TDS?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Regarding posting TDS transactions, make a job or customise so that the session runs automatically at night.<br />
