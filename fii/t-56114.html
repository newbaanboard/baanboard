<br />
while trying to approve a matched invoice, i am getting an error which indicates 'Status in Integration table is errorneous for ledger account'.<br />
While trying to approve, there comes a difference of 0.25 paisa. I am attaching screen dump of the same.<br />
<br />
I shall be thankful if anybody can shade light on why this error is coming.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

despite the information you have given, still can't say exactly what is wrong.<br />
However, there are a number of sessions that might help you work it, and most can be found in: <br />
General ledger/maintain integration with other modules. [sess: mtfgld2007m000]<br />
You will have to look for an integration that is missing data for the purchase invoice e.g. the supplier country is not set up or it a new financial supplier group.<br />
<br />
When you have found the cause don't forget to clear the error log.<br />

Go have a look at Display integration Transactions by project/Order (tfgld4510m000) and make sure that all of the lines say Posted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That error message invariably means that the integrations status is erroneous. Best thing is to open tfgld4510m000 and search for this order and check the status. Rectify the error and post the integrations and then come back and Match&amp; Approve.<br />

<br />
The reason was simple, this was a new item group for which integration was not maintained in tdinv8150m000.<br />
<br />
Thanks to u all,<br />
