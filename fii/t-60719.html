<br />
I have one issue .<br />
My company is purchased currency from bank less than the rate of the day<br />
and transfer to one account to another account of same company.(this is happend due to negotiation with bank)<br />
<br />
While making Bank type JV the currency rate can be changed to the purchase rate.<br />
<br />
but if I want to track /or book the difference between the current rate and what we purchased from bank Even though it is bank to bank transfer<br />
but logically there is gain for compnay as we got the currency less rate.<br />
<br />
How can this issue can be resolved and book as currency gain</div></div><hr />

<br />
When a payment is introduced related to an invoice you can choose the exchange rate, but as you already now, only one. Yo can use the sundry costs fields to introduce bank charges in the same posting. As the account introduction is free you can use this field for several purposes.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue is not sale or purchase it is bank to bank transfer<br />
<br />
This solution will not applicable for the same as the type of transaction is <br />
bank (cmg)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply<br />
<br />
The solution is like below but if any entry exists the system will not allow to change the setting<br />
<br />
First go to chart of account for that ledger<br />
go to second form..make the currency analysis&quot;required,cal curr diff&quot;<br />
<br />
Then after passing entry <br />
run the session calculate currency difference <br />
if the parameter is set for the currency difference the system will pass entry<br />
<br />
