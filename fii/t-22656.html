<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nneilitz</div><div class="date">18th December 2004, 01:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We have our Tax Rates set up in Maintain Tax Codes by Postal Code and Exceptions by Location set up for our warehouses in Texas and New Mexico when selling to a destination address inside the state.<br />
<br />
This works well except for one hole:<br />
<br />
On service / cost items, the user is not allowed to tag a service order line or a sales order line with the warehouse. Because of this the Exception data is not used and the system bases the tax code on the destination postal code.<br />
This causes wrong tax codes to be filled in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Has anyone else run into this and/or have any suggestions.</div></div><hr />
