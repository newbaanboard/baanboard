We have a BaaN 5c version and we want to start paying our suppliers with Sepa. We think BaaN IV works the same way for Sepa. <br />
We are looking for someone who already implemented this. Do we have to structure the xml file ourselves? <br />

I've chosen to respond as a post rather to maintain the spirit of the forum and also because any ideas exchanged here could you useful for any other users interested in SEPA.:):)<br />
<br />
These are the steps I followed to implement SEPA<br />
1. We are on Baan 4c4 SP27. I had to still install loads of patches to get things working. Some patches were already available. A few were bugfixes I obtained during implementation.<br />
2. Generated a default XML layout. Modified the layout as per bank's requirement.<br />
3. I've infact extended the layout to cover some of our non-EURO payments as well.<br />
4. Got our finance maintain all our &amp; supplier bank account details.<br />
5. Setup a new bank/payment method and specify the path to export the XML file.<br />
<br />
There is a SEPA implementation document available on Xtreme which I found quite useful.<br />
<br />
I'll be more than happy to answer any further queries on this.<br />

I would like to know if it is possible to have a list of bug fixes that I have to install on BaaN IV and if you can publish an extract of how you implement the solution to generate the SEFA file.<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Infor created this solution to list the required information (i.e. solutions). You'll find a XML-file linked to the solution. It lists all available SEPA-Solutions for the supported Infor ERP/LN releases.<br />
KB 1180901 also contains documentation (PDF) on howto setup SEPA.</div></div><hr />

Below is a list of PMC solutions, I suggest to cross check with the list on inforxtreme. Once these are installed you then <br />
1. Use session tfcmg0524m000 to setup XML file layout. You can a default XML layout by selecting from the menu<br />
2. Maintain the default XML structure to suit your requirement. You can select/deselect, make tags mandatory/optional, and change &quot;Fixed Text&quot; or link with required baan fields. Your bank can provide you with a XML structure they use and you then try to match with that structure.<br />
3. Setup a payment method (tfcmg0140m000) with XML file = 'Yes'. Provide XML file path in tfcmg0145m000.<br />
4. Test by generating XML file before moving to processing a real payment.<br />
