The remaining integration transactions for the service order are correctly posting to 100.<br />
table tfgld417.fcom tfgld418.fcom and tfgld102.tcom will have 000 in it for service order costs.  Gtm these records to the correct company and they will process through integrations or finalization with no problem.   <br />
<br />
Also, it is the costs for a particular item that is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Have checked many, many places for the cause of this.  User defaults, order series defaults, order header, dug through many tables. No customers have a default financial company of 000. Although 4-5 did and we fixed that.  The orders with this problem have not been for customers that had the 000 default financial company.  No suppliers have a default financial company of 000.  <br />
The default financial company of the service order series is correct.<br />
<br />
Just found that tssma310.ncmp is also 000 for many orders - but even for orders which existed years before this became a problem for us.<br />
<br />
Any ideas or recommendations? :confused:</div></div><hr />

The technican on the service order line tssma3110m000 was linked to a workcenter in the employee master - the workcenter in tirou0101m000 had been changed to a default financial company of 000.<br />
<br />
When no contract is present for the order, the credit are posted to the service order company OR for working/travel time the company of the employee via the workcenter.</div></div><hr />
