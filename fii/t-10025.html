<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">15th May 2003, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone can explain why in the integration options there's not the logistic company? We have the multi-logistic, single-finance situation and this causes big problems to us. The work centers aren't shared and some work center has the same code in more than one company, so it's impossible to post integrations to different L/A for different logistic companies.<br />
Some idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maalpoel</div><div class="date">15th May 2003, 17:15</div></div><div class="posttext">2 possible solutions:<br />
1 baanERP does have log.company as steering option<br />
2 dont share integration setup tables. in theory this can cause problems, but with tigth procedures it could perhaps a solution. Integration can be posted by source company. The transaction tables 410 e.g. should always be shared.<br />
<br />
This last option is not an option which is support by baan i think<br />
<br />
kind regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">16th May 2003, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the previous reply that not sharing the finance tables is not recommended by Baan, but as long as you are sensible and test properly, it can be done.<br />
I'd try not sharing tfgld426 and use separate integration elements for separate companies. That allows you to post to different dimension codes for the same workcentre in different logistical companies.<br />
Your post mentions different ledger accounts. They are not defined in gld but instead in for example tdinv8150m000 /tfgld850 which isn't (or doesn't have to be)shared anyway, so different ledger accounts should not be a problem.</div></div><hr />
