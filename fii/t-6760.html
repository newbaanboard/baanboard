Could anyone tell me the tables I need to look at to find the cause of the problem as the last think I want to do is change the status in Gld102 of the background indicator! as it will not tell me what caused the problem.<br />

thanks<br />

In addition to identifiying and correcting the problem. If you have a non-integration transaction that causes this problem. You will need to delete the error log for the transaction as well, otherwise the system still thinks the error exists. You may already know this but the first time it happened to me I spent nearly two hours tearing my hair out trying to work out why a transaction would not finalise after sorting out the problem.</div></div><hr />

If there are errors there, just delete the records since trying to finalize the transaction will regenerate them if needed.</div></div><hr />
