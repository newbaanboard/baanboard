<br />
I have purchase order, PO send material to subcontractor for machining. No further in house process. Material in Meter and item in pieces. <br />
<br />
The setting is material stock is transferred to subcontractor warehouse when generating PO. Then issue from subcontractor warehouse to this PO when warehouse receipt. <br />
<br />
View this PO in integration transactions :<br />
 <br />
1. IDT 10001052 for PO/Issue (Material issue in meter to this PO)<br />
     Material cost is 8.19m * 18.6708 = 152.91<br />
2. IDT 10001074 for PO/Receipt (complete item receive from subcontractor) <br />
     Item cost is 252pcs * 0.54 = 136.08<br />
3.  IDT 10001091 for PO/subcontracting WIP (???)<br />
     Cost is 8.19m * 16.9365 = 138.71 <br />
     where 16.9365 is cost in item - costing, ticpr007<br />
4.  Item lot price per piece is calculated based on No 2 and No 3 (why ?)<br />
     = (136.08 + 138.71) / 252pcs = 1.0904<br />
5.  <br />
My question is <br />
1. Why system is getting standard cost in No 3 for calculation ? <br />
2. Why Item lot price per piece is not (No 1 + No 2) / 252pcs ? <br />
3. If PO is closed, system will generate 2 more pairs of transactions <br />
    IDT 10001030 for PO/Efficiency Variance<br />
    IDT 10001071 for PO/Purchase price variance<br />
<br />
Anyone has idea to eliminate IDT 10001091. Thanks from Cindy</div></div><hr />
