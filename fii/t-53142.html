I just want to ask how to correct this error: Cannot create ledger account during post integ. Post integ was done first before maintaining the tdinv8150m000. Error was there already even if I delete in the log and post again, same same. Please do suggest the best way possible. Thanks.<br />

<br />
normally the error-message is &quot;cannot define ledger account&quot; when there is a problem with tdinv8150m000. It is new for me that Baan wants to &quot;create&quot; a ledger account at this point.<br />
<br />
Just deleting the error-message is not enough: as long as the missing settings are not in the system the error is not solved, of course, and Baan shows you consequently the same message again. If you do not add the necessary integration settings you may post a hundred times and will get the same result.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when you add the integration settings and then do &quot;Post to finance&quot; the error message will disappear by itself without deleting something.<br />
<br />
From my point of view you have a logistic procedure for which the integration settings are not complete. What kind of setting is necessary depends on the details e.g. of the purchase-order, of the item, of the warehouse etc.. When the message shows you a hint to tdinv850 then check the relevant settings in tdinv8150m000 for the combination transaction origin/ financial transaction for the special details in your case (e.g. order number).<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
Actually there is no specific message that the problems came from tdinv8150m000 but when we tried in our demo co to make it item specific, there is no error, maybe because the setup has made already in tdinv8150m000. We will try to do it also on group item based.<br />
Again, thanks.<br />
