<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leewill</div><div class="date">21st June 2006, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We have some customers who take a credit based on the fact that they have sent product back.  Our company has not yet issued the credit.  How can we apply this credit when it is included on a check from the customer?  Currently our AR staff is applying it to an open invoice.  This creates a nightmare in reconciling later.   Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
show the amount as unallocated receipt.<br />
once you receive the sales return, system generates the sales credit note. later assign these sales credit notes to the unallocated receipt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leewill</div><div class="date">22nd June 2006, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks-that's what I thought (I am new to Baan and am working with our AR group that has used it for many years.)  However, the AR group tells me that it does not allow them to enter a negative number -which is what you need when they take an early credit.  Could it be we have to change something in our Master Data?<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
