<br />
What are the reasons responsible for &quot;Production order/Additional calculation office variance&quot;<br />
<br />
for ex- 1. if the valuation method of FG is FTP in that case variance between Estimated price &amp; Actual price trigger in &quot;Production order/Additional calculation office variance&quot; at the time close production order.<br />
2. If we process hours accounting after confirmed receipt of material against production order, in that case also variance trigger in &quot;Production order/Additional calculation office variance&quot; at the time close production order. <br />
<br />
Apart of these two reasons, I would like to what are the other reason responsible for &quot;Production order/Additional calculation office variance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
