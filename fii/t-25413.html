<br />
We got a wrong standard cost used in Integartion Transaction Lines.<br />
Eq. <br />
Standard cost for Item A = 1 USD (effective date 1 Oct 2005)<br />
Standard cost for Item A = 2 USD (effective date 15 Oct 2005)<br />
<br />
We created an integration transaction on 16 October 2005, and the system create the integration transaction lines based on standard cost which effective date 1 oct 2005. <br />
In other case, the integration transaction lines used 1.6 USD as standard cost, and we don't know where the standard cost came from.<br />
<br />
Does anyone ever faced the same problem? How to solve it?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />
Handy</div></div><hr />

What kind of integration transaction is it? What is the inventory valuation method for the item group to which this item belongs to? <br />

<br />
Thanks for your comment. <br />
The Inventory Valuation method is FTP. <br />
FYI, there are 2 similar cases we got. <br />
The first is : the integration transaction lines (let's say Production Issue or Inventory Adjustment) didn't take the standard cost with the last effective date. <br />
Another case (another item) is : the integration transaction lines took a price that we didn't know where it came from.<br />
<br />

Behaviour of our MAUC system is predictable and stable. What you describe, although way too incomplete for anyone to make good diagnose, sounds more like a bug than feature of FTP. You might want to log a case with BS on this<br />
