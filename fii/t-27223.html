I think this feature is great.  Especially that there are five different views of the same data.<br />
<br />
But I am wondering if people are actually taking advantage of the dimension aspect of the chart of accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">6th June 2006, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using two dimension types, for grouping purposes. In fact, we have used until recently only one dimension type, and now introduced the second dimension type, for an extra level of (sub-)grouping was required.<br />
<br />
Also in fact, I just logged an SSA Inquiry because there seems to be no efficient report available in standard Baan which prints grouped in multi-level; i.e. dimension type1, all underlaying dimension types2, total per dim.type1, etc. This data can easily be fetched however based on table tfgld205 (if totals per period are satisfactory...)<br />
<br />
Would love to hear from others using (more than one level) dimensions, how they visualize their data...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">6th June 2006, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
We are using all five dimensions, but very few accounts use more than 3.<br />
<br />
 Product Line<br />
 Department<br />
 Employee<br />
 Customer Group<br />
 Country<br />
<br />
<br />
For example;<br />
 our sales and cost of sales use product line, customer group, country.<br />
 our rebates use customer group.<br />
 our expense accounts use department.<br />
The balance sheet accounts use less dimensions than the P&amp;L accounts.<br />
<br />
We have written custom reports on tfgld205 to group transactions.<br />
<br />
We have also written custom reports on tfgld106, that include the ledger and all 5 dimension values.  The user then manipulates this data in Excel.  By using Excel's 'Pivot Table' function, the user can group data by ledger or any combination of dimensions that they would like.  This approach is really useful on expense account entries.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">5th July 2006, 13:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello John,<br />
<br />
I had logged an SSA-Support inquiry, and was told that they will not provide this functionality on current versions; I was allowed to fill in an enhancement request (some new regulation, that the customer has to fill in a whole form for this request!!!) for possible enhancement in later versions...<br />
<br />
So I also am writing our own customized report now. Would you mind posting your objects here, so that I can possible get some added value or extra ideas for our own reports?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

One of the most powerfull characteristic of Baan, is the use of dimensions.<br />
Here at our company before to use baan, the accountants use to have a &quot;plain&quot; chart of accounts. This mean, each account have one and just one purpose. Due to, in our bussines, the creation of costs centers is often, before baan, the acountants needs to create a separate set of account for each cost center... when we migrate to baan, the accountats have a master chart of accouts arround 10 000!<br />
<br />
With the use of dimension, u don't need to create that. U create only one account and assigns the dimensions u need. That was a great improvement!<br />
Nowadays we have only 2000 accounts and we use the 5 dimensions.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">6th July 2006, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course I understand how to use dimensions. I just was curious to see how the reporting issue was solved by John and others. How are you visualising the data, also by customized reports based on tfgld205? <br />
<br />
I have created a session which is totally variable. User can select which dimension types should be included, and by which order they should be grouped and ordered in the output...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">6th July 2006, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello En,<br />
We use the standard reports of baan. Extract of accounts, and finalized transactions by dimension. We developed one sesion in order to have the account, dimension, and amount in the same row, and we dont use the tfgld205 as a source, we use the tfgld106. We usually compare this report in order to verify the Balance report.<br />
<br />
If u find this usefull I can post our report here.<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">7th July 2006, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">So if I understand correctly, you do not have any reporting/visualising in a multi level dimensions, i.e. something like this:<br />
<br />
Dim1<br />
  - dim1<br />
  - dim2<br />
  - dim2<br />
      - dim3<br />
      - dim3<br />
      - dim3<br />
           - dim4<br />
           total dim3<br />
      total dim2<br />
total dim1</div></div><hr />

Just want to say that I have written myself a program in BaaN which gives the perfect report for dimensions in multi level etc.<br />
<br />
If anyone is in need for this progeam, feel free to contact me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">5th December 2006, 08:31</div></div><div class="posttext">A report like this could easily be done in the FST module. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WMR1982</div><div class="date">15th December 2006, 12:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that we can use less ledger accounts from dimensions-used advantage, especially, the famous one is cost center or department to record expenditure.  However, sometimes so many dimension types can make confusion for the user who inputs data everyday. I don't know, just some conplaint from my users. It's good for management to review data in different views, but if users who record data do not select right dimensions (in more details), this might cause unreliable information.</div></div><hr />
