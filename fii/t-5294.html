<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">larkin_jack2</div><div class="date">23rd May 2002, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if an invoice that has been approved, but not yet paid, can be unapproved &amp; unmatched.<br />
<br />
The reason being is that an item that was received, registered, and then approved.  <br />
<br />
It was not until after this fact that it was realized that the good received was incorrect.  <br />
<br />
The situation is that we now have another invoice that cannot matched to an item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">24th May 2002, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know you can only unapprove and unmatch if the invoice is not finalized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerebeer</div><div class="date">24th May 2002, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on the BAAN version. If you are using BAANERP50b or higher than you are allowed to unapprove a finalized invoice related to orders, so that you can unmatch etc.  In BAANIV that is (to the best of my knowledge) not possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In BaaN 4C2, you cannot unapprove/unmatch a document once the batch has been finalized.  <br />
<br />
What we have done in a situation similar to yours is to add and receive two lines onto the purchase order.  The first line is a negative of the original line.  We then match a &quot;dummy&quot; credit to this line, and link the credit to the invoice that was matched and approved in error.  We then add the second line, receive it, and match the new correct invoice to it.  This may seem to be a bit cumbersome, but it provides a clear audit trail through the system and general ledger of what occurred.  Of course, we also put good text on the PO of what we've done.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  :) <br />

<br />
I'm not understanding to well.<br />
<br />
Thank-you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">24th May 2002, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
<br />
in Baan IV c4 you can reverse an approval. But only in the same period. <br />
You create a batch with approval transaction type. When you enter you search the invoice in question. You push the button reverse, and finalize the batch. <br />
Then you can enter the session tfacp1130m000. You unmatch the receipts and match again to the right receipts. <br />
<br />
But please try it first in your test company, if it gives the expected result. <br />
<br />
Bye, Juli</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">24th May 2002, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Jack - what version of BaaN are you using?  If Juli's solution works for you (if you use 4c4), then I won't go into detail.  <br />
<br />
If you are on 4c2, there may be other ways of handling the situation depending on whether there was a purchase order involved and whether the items involved were inventory-related. I have workarounds for all of the various situations.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kclewley</div><div class="date">24th May 2002, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">There is also a correction program to unmatch a matched receipt called otfcor0229.  This correction program will remove the approval document, but will not remove any purchase results.  However, Baan Support may have updated this correction program since last I used it (available for Baan IVc).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">24th May 2002, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - we have been advised by both our BaaN consultant and BaaN Support not to use that correction program.   Why, I don't know.  We now either log cases to have GTM done, or use the various workarounds that I mentioned in my earlier postings.  <br />
