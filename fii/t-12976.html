<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">15th September 2003, 01:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We are experimenting with Advanced Payments but are having a problem:<br />
<br />
1. A new supplier is added and an advanced payment of GBP 100 is made and reconciled.<br />
2. The supplier sends us the &quot;real&quot; invoice for GBP 100, which is registered as a normal invoice.<br />
3. We run &quot;Select invoices for payment&quot;.  The &quot;real&quot; invoice is selected for payment even though we have already paid it with the advanced payment.<br />
<br />
I can understand that this may be correct, because the invoice received from the supplier could be for something totally different. I also can see that we should review all our advanced/unallocated payments and try to allocate them to &quot;real&quot; invoices before every payment run.<br />
<br />
But, what is the easiest way to see all advanced/unallocated (anticipated) payments?  Running an aging analysis for every supplier selected for payment will take too long.  I can't see any easy way!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to the session &quot;ttadv2100m000&quot; and select the session &quot;tfacp2421m000&quot; (copy this session to current VRC) and then on the 2nd page click on &quot;Reports&quot; which takes you to the sub-session &quot;Maintain Reports&quot; and select the 1st report &quot;tfacp242111000&quot; and copy the same to new report in your current VRC and the following changes.<br />
<br />
In the session &quot;Maintain Reports&quot; click on the button &quot;Edit Script&quot; and the report script will open. Here you find &quot;Detail.1&quot; and &quot;before layout&quot; some codes that is already written. Just add the following to that section of the code;<br />
<br />
if tfacp200.tpay = tfacp.tpay.unallocated or<br />
   tfacp200.tpay = tfacp.tpay.advance then<br />
            lattr.print = true<br />
else<br />
            lattr.print = false<br />
endif<br />
<br />
Now save and complie the report and then attach this report to the session. This new report will give you output of all the unallocated and advance payments made to supplier that is not yet allocated.<br />
<br />
Try the above. I hope this will be of help.....<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">15th September 2003, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the information.  I have copied the standard report and added the extra code as suggested.  It actually needed a little more:<br />
<br />
if tfacp200.tpay = tfacp.tpay.unallocated or<br />
tfacp200.tpay = tfacp.tpay.unallocated.ant or <br />
tfacp200.tpay = tfacp.tpay.advance or <br />
tfacp200.tpay = tfacp.tpay.advance.ant then<br />
....<br />
<br />
I was hoping that there was a standard report to provide this information, but it seems not to be the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will eliminate the need to customize.</div></div><hr />
