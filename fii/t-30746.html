We want to report sales and COGS at the product line level. We're going to use 'work order' or 'job' for manufacturing process. However, we're not sure how dimension of product line works. If anyone can briefly explain how to setup the dimension for product lines? Is it complicated? <br />
<br />
THANKS SO MUCH!!:</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have not defined a product line dimension you will need to add it (tfgld0101m000, then hit special zoom)<br />
Set G/L accounts to require the dimension (tfgld0108m000)<br />
In your G/L integrations there are certain choices from the list that work well for product line integrations.  We have used item group for most of ours.  Statistics group is also a good choice.  Of course this all depends on how you are using those fields.<br />
<br />
I would recommend that your G/L accounts are set to mandatory for these dimensions if you always want to capture it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Woeste</div><div class="date">22nd February 2007, 21:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't advise it unless you are ok with having the dimension blank in some instances.  If a dimension is &quot;optional&quot; then you will not get an integration error and the G/L and dimension will have a mixed bag of things that are fully coded and ones that are missing the dimension.  From my experience the whole reason a dimension is created is for reporting purposes.  If it's optional there will be things that are not categorized.</div></div><hr />
