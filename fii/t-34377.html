<br />
When I approve a foreign currency purchase invoice after matching it to a purchase receipt and there are different values on the receipt and invoice I get a 'Purchase Price Variance.' <br />
However if the exchange rate has changed between when I did the receipt and when I approve the invoice the total Purchase Price Variance includes the exchange rate gain or loss  for 'home' currency and therefore gives a false Price Variance. How can I split the Exchange Gain or Loss from the 'true' Price Variance?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or help very much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Yes, indeed that is the way that Baan standard, works. As you correctly point, if there are a diference day difference beween inventory reception and invoice approval then, the variance will appe<br />
<br />
One way is that when you recieve the invoice, you should put the reception date on Document date field. With this way, the system should take the exchange rate for that date and there will no have exchange gain or loss.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

Are you also recommending a Baan customisation of this session as your reply was 'noted' as customisation recommended.<br />

The other way is request a customization. In fact we use that customization, due to, our auditors not accept that we put another document date different to invoice date.<br />

Is this a Baan customisation if so do you have a reference or 'fix' number that Baan (SSA Global) would recognise that you could let me have or was your customisation done by a third party or 'in house'<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

The customization was done by Infor consultors. As I mentioned before, it was done due to fulfill an auditor request.<br />
