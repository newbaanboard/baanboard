Please do NOT CROSSPOST. Ulrich, can you please post the thread again in 1 forum and then I will remove this one. Sorry about the mess but cross-posting creates confusion (as you can see).<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But was this really a cross-posting? (Or did you just deleted it because of the same subject line?) I had two different message texts in the threads in the finance and in distribution forums (fora???). I think that some finance people don't read the distribution forum, and vice versa, but it's a thread where input from both sides is appreciated... I want to know from distribution people if/how they handled that issue and from finance people if it's really an issue... How do we handle that kind of postings in the future?  hmm... BaaN is more business process than functional oriented as we all know, so from time to time it's really hard to decide where to post.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I will go and repost it in Distribution. Hope that some finance people will find it....<br />

Sorry again, I did base my decision to delete the post from the 'View New Posts' option. I know it is not always clear cut to choose between which forum to post but we have to draw the line somewhere. I think you have a good chance of people viewing your thread regardless in which forum it is if your title is very clear and descriptive. Simply because most people use the 'View New Posts' option to check for new messages and that will always give you a posts selection across all forums.<br />

Good luck with the english :)</div></div><hr />
