I have a small question. How to define the schedule lines for partly paid invoices and credit notes? <br />
Actually at our side, Baan was configured without Receipt Schedule and we recently activated it. Now, to work in finance and central invoicing module, we have to define the schedule lines and we can define for all older lines which are fully unpaid, but the session is not allowing us to define the lines for the partly paid invoices and credit notes (negative invoices). How we can proceed for those invoices?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
