<br />
During the production reporting of a customized finished good that is having another customized item as raw material, system doesn't shoot any integration transaction that can show the shift of WIP value of one item group to another. In the defined scenario Item Group is one of the dimension's associated to the WIP Account.<br />
<br />
In simple words, the scenario is like this : <br />
<br />
-item group is one of the dimension associated to WIP account<br />
- There is one customized finished good that is having another customized item as raw material<br />
- In the trial balance printout with dimensions for WIP account the system shows the break down of the WIP value in terms of item group.<br />
<br />
Situation : <br />
<br />
For the above mentioned item, when Production SFC is reported, system doesn't show the reduction in the raw material item group WIP value and at the same time Finished goods WIP value is also unchanged.<br />
<br />
Is this a normal functionality??? If yes then the WIP value can be evaluted in terms of item groups????<br />
<br />
<br />
An early reply concerning the problem will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Baan considers PCS WIP as one big &quot;cost container&quot; that doesn't need to be splitted up in any way. As far as I know there is no way to overcome that problem.<br />
<br />
The only thing you can do is to get the PCS WIP by item group from the logistic modules: It's basically the stock of the respective items valuated by their estimated or actual costs, depending on your parameter settings. However you will still have to add the WIP of the PCS production orders also.<br />
