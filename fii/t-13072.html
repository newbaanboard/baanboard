<br />
We have a lot of small transactions in Finance from spare parts call -- $20 to $50. most of the time using credit cards. We are thinking of getting a small package that can do this kind of sales transaction, possibly with inventory capability then lumping them all together and enter as one transaction in Baan.<br />
<br />
Do you think this is a good idea? Does anybody in the board do this?any suggestion on which software to use? I guess what were trying to accomplish is not to have too many transactions in Baan that needs to be finalized.<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdruijter</div><div class="date">23rd September 2003, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">How about creating a one-time customer code,<br />
<br />
using a salesordertype collect order (1 order number a day) connected to the one-time supplier)<br />
<br />
This way u get 1 big sales order a day (multiple customers w/out registering customer data as they pay immediatly or by CC)<br />
<br />
On payment by CC u make sure that the ordernumber is added to the CC payment data so that receips of money on the bank include that ordernumber (to make a match with the total invoice amout (which has not been sent off course)).<br />
<br />
Every day the (1 big) order is closed and posted to finance. Make sure that in parameters tfgld4150m000 compression is on. (this goes for all transactions then!)<br />
<br />
When the bank receipts are maintained every receipt can be treated as an partly payment.<br />
<br />
Realize that when you do this, your stock is maintained correctly, but there is not a lot of data to track tis proces financially.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this all makes sense as I did not com[pletely set up a procedure for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
cheers,<br />
