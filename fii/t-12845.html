<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kevinm</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">In processing a check run in cash mangement, I discovered that one of my payables had the wrong payment method set-up(supplier Maintenance).  The check run was processed and it has locked the batch into a status that reads, Payments transferred cannot delete batch. We have tried to reset the payment status to void and have tried to call up the checks again.  However it is not creating a batch for finalization to precess the last step in the check process to the ledger.  I am unable to delete the batch.  In the check master my invoices have been assigned to check numbers,however to reconcile these checks (through maintain transactions) they do not appear in the check selection for me to mark them paid.  They are lost in Baan somewhere. PLEASE HELP ME !!!  :confused:</div></div><hr />

You are describing a complex situation and currently I do not oversee the situation.<br />
<br />
To solve this problem, it is important that I can analyse the situation (in the system). If this is possible I will try to help you, if not I'm not exactly now what to do now.<br />

<br />
If the status is &quot;Payments Transferred&quot; then this payment batch will have to be fully processed. For this purpose try to go to one of the following sessions in Cash Management and input the batch number and try to process. I am sure it will go through.<br />
<br />
      1) Create Payment orders (tfcmg1256m000)<br />
                                    OR<br />
      2) Post Payments (tfcmg1257m000)<br />
<br />
After posting the batch then if you want to cancel this transaction you could reject the check by recociliation and then reset the check status so that you could re-use the same check number. <br />
<br />
I hope the above information will be of help to you.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pls check the transactions in batch 11 . This will be the finance batch for ur payments. If this is true then u can open a reconciliation batch to cancel the payment.<br />
