<br />
We have a type of tax called Deduction tax where it is deducted from the invoice amount not added to it like sales tax...<br />
<br />
Please Note that we use it with purchase Invoices only..<br />
<br />
We tried to add it but we can't add a negative tax rate in tcmcs0132m000 we thought that we can add it as a tax but in this case we can't use the tax analysis with it....<br />
<br />
Example :<br />
<br />
Line 1 :  xxx    For 100000<br />
Line 2 :  YYY  For  150000<br />
                         ------<br />
Total :                250000<br />
<br />
Sales Tax  10%      2500<br />
Deduction tax 1%   (250)<br />
                         -------<br />
Net amount         252250<br />
<br />
The entry in finance is :<br />
<br />
Dr.  Registered invoices         250000<br />
Dr.  Sales(purchase)TAX        2500<br />
Cr.  Suppliers                                252250<br />
Cr.  Deduction Tax                             250<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is how can we do this in Baan V.c<br />
Please nOte that we want to use  the tax analysis with this deduction tax.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wanted to ask whether you have found a solution for this condition or not.<br />
We are also facing the same problem here and don't know the workaround.<br />
<br />
If you have a solution, would you kindly share it with us.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Hendra</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mohamed_alsadr</div><div class="date">8th June 2005, 21:27</div></div><div class="posttext">We made some customization for this issue, mainly in the session of tax rates to allow a negative rate, you may ask the person responsible for the tools,to do it..<br />
<br />
Also  u may need to make some other customization to the purchase invoice session as the tax field won't allow a negative amount, if the deduction tax is set alone in the purchase invoice.<br />
<br />
Hope this help..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the advice.<br />
We'll try to do that.<br />
<br />
Btw, Are there any impacts, that you know of, to other modules that we must pay attention to?<br />
I mean, would adjusting tax fields to be able to accept negativef values has bad effect to other financial modules?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mohamed_alsadr</div><div class="date">9th June 2005, 20:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
In our cituation there is no effect in other modules, as you only set the tax code in purchase order &quot; and you may not &quot;...anyway it is better to try it in a test server if aplicable and do a full cycle that you might use this tax in it..just in case there is a difference with you work procedure than us.</div></div><hr />
