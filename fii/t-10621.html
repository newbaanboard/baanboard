<br />
Baan IVc<br />
<br />
When allocating FC payments the error message comes up Different rate not allowed  I understand from this that because the payment is at a different exchange rate to the invoice they cannot be matched off. <br />
<br />
One of the effects of this is that cleared/paid transactions are being left open and thus get printed in reports such as statements.<br />
<br />
Has any one come across this problem? Did you find a solution?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's because you have set &quot;Fixed Rate&quot; at invoice entering.<br />
Go to tfaco2100m000 and check 2nd form to see if the invoice has fixed rate &quot;Yes&quot;. If it has, change it to &quot;No&quot; and try again.<br />
Hope this will solve it.<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the suggestion Pedro.<br />
<br />
I have checked the invoices, they're all set to be variable currency (i.e. fixed rate = No)<br />
<br />
If you have any other ideas I'd be glad to hear them.<br />
<br />

What currencies are you dealing with?<br />
Are there any EMU currencies? Have you run the Internal Euro Conversion?<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Our HC is GBP, so we have not run a euro converter.<br />
Eur is an FC along with USD etc.<br />

Your problem is really puzzling. Could you please tell me which sessions are you using to alocate the payments to the invoices?<br />
<br />
Pedro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">11th July 2003, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">A good question.<br />
<br />
Sessions are:<br />
<br />
<br />
tfcmg2131s000 &amp; tfcmg2106s000<br />
<br />
We have had to work around this in the tables but this only is only a short term fix as the problem could happen again,  so I'm still looking for a cure.<br />

<br />
Why not write of currency difference (tfacp2240m000) for the invoice and then allocate the payment ? <br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">14th July 2003, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I must admit I though this session was for after allocation differences rather than before allocation. But I'll try it out next time, thanks for the suggestion.<br />
