<br />
We have Baan4c4. When I execute tfacr3440m000(Print Statement of Accounts), it takes few seconds in one company and ages in other. What the reason could be? Package Combination etc is same for both companies. Its just the session is taking 20 minutes for a single customer and globally it doesnt works for this company, whereas the same session works perfect for the other company. Please Advise.<br />

Since it is working fine for one company, it is possible that the data is corrupt in the 2nd company. When I say corrupt doesn't mean physically corrupt, but possible that some data is not the way the pogram exepects it to be.<br />
<br />
For example, in the session Write-off currency differences (tfacr2250m000), we found that if one customer has a document in home currency(HC) and the same document with a different line number in foreign currency(FC) and if the FC document has a $0.01 balance to be written-off, then when we execute the write-off session, it simply hangs. When we talk to Baan support, they don't have an answer and say that they cannot reproduce the same. But the fact is that the session hangs.<br />
<br />
Similarly, there could be something contrary to the program's expectations. You can try to run a few customer code ranges and see where exactly the problem lies and then analyse the data to get a better picture.</div></div><hr />
