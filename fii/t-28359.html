Is there any functionality or migration/conversion tool to change the existing chart of accounts into the new one (so also history has to be changed)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would advise that you create a customized table with the relation of Old Vs New Account Nos. and use this for customized reporting.<br />

It would be a tedious job to this. Chart of accounts are present in lot of Baan finance tables. I guess it is not a difficult task to know where the accounts are located and replace it with the new one. It has to be done carefully. If you don't intend to rebuild ledger history or don't want oto take GL details by transaction then you can change the history tables that store the information in summarized manner.<br />
It is a difficult task, but a knwoledgeable person can do this.<br />

I would sincerely suggest inalfa again... to not plan on changing COA codes from history... Ledger accounts would then be required to be changed from masters/transaction including integration.... <br />
<br />
Any mistake or table missed may lead to massive data corruption...<br />

I understand your point. But there are only finite number of tables in finance. How much time it would take to go through such table say 3 days at the most. I am thinking updating would take more time esp tfgld106 and tgld410 and tfgd416 (just the size of such table). Its a challenging tack, but needs to be carefully done. I am not suggesting to do this, but if business needs this it can be done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">5th December 2006, 08:43</div></div><div class="posttext">What about using the field &quot;legal ledger account&quot; for the new account number, instead of changing the Chart of account?<br />
A lot of standard report can be printed accourding to that number. <br />
