<br />
We are using a third party software for all our electronic payments to our bank.<br />
<br />
We would like to eliminate the double entries (payment details entry into baan + into the third party software), by establishing a link between BaaN and the other software, more specifically by importing an ASCII file from Baan, containing all the relevant payment details.<br />
<br />
What I am looking for is detailed documentation on how to create the relevant ASCII files in BaaN (in the module Electronic Bank Statements?).<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

You dont need to use electronic bank statements to generate in Baan an ascii file that can be read by an external software.<br />
You just have to define in the payment method that the output Ã­s a file, and associate a combination of report and group report the format of the file you want and the kind of data you need (this data comes mainly from tfcmg403). Then you define the path where to put the file and the file name in data bank by payment method.<br />
When you compose payments the system generates the file.<br />
Then what you have to do is to pick up the file from that directory and read it with your external software.<br />
Hope this will help.<br />

Have you been able to successfully use use the Payment method with an output type as file?  It seems to me there maybe a lot of setup before you can actually do it.  I've created a new Payment Method(ACH) and set the output type to file.  I think I need to then pick one of my suppliers, for testing, and change their payment method to ACH.  Then will I need to create some dummy invoices for that supplier so I can then pay them?  Is that all I'll need to do?  Oh - I also when into the session Maintain Data by Bank/Payment Method and put a path and file name in there so the file has somewhere to go.  What else needs to happen for this file to be created.  Oh - I also wonder, the file that is created - is it just a delimited file of the report that is run from the session that you put in the Sess for Payments/Reciepts fields on the Payment Method record?  Could I essentially create a report with only the fields that my banks software is expecting and use that report in that field?<br />

<br />
             It is nice to here some success story; Couple of questions to Judy &amp; tnzabo;<br />
<br />
1. Do we have to change the report layout of the ASCII file, now which report layout do we change is it the report which belong to session tfcmg1260m000 or another. (I have attached the bank's import file which is a bit different from the baan report layout and also they require it in a standard CSV format, any suggestions, thanks) <br />
<br />
2. Now how does the bank software pickup this file from the baan server, where is the link, is it in BaaN or when the bank software is being run?    <br />
<br />
Appreciate any quick commments on this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I forgot to attach the Bank's Format file, which I have now.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far we haven't gone any further than getting that file created.  You can use the report that Baan already has or modify to look just like what your bank is expecting just by creating a new report layout.  The report on our system that is creating the file is from session tfcmg1260s000 Transfer Payments and is the report tfcmg1260f1000 ACH Formatted File.  It already pretty much what our bank is looking for, just some minor adjustments.  You need to setup the supplier as an ACH payment supplier and when you print their checks it will automatically create this.  Look at Judy's documentation for instructions here.  As far as the bank getting your file - I suppose they would a system of getting it from you or a way for you to upload it.  Again, we have not gotten to that part yet.<br />
<br />
We are also working on a reconciliation file to upload to our bank that I've modified the report that prints out our checks and it will create a record in a flat file for each check that is printed then this file will be transferred to the bank for reconciliation when our suppliers cash the checks.  Pretty slick.<br />

Thanks,<br />
