Please post specific questions on where you are having trouble with. Please refer to some FST documentation.<br />
<br />
I will be happy to help you through if you face any questions or a dead end.<br />

A lot of companies are prefer using an external report writer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">7th March 2003, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">This can be difficult to get through as there are a numbers of sessions to maintain to acheive a financial statement, and there is definitely a period of trial and error tryinf to get the statement to present as you want it.<br />
<br />
You may be able to create a statment with the chart of accounts using the legal account number (assuming that you dont have to use this anyway) this may be satisfactory but you probably will have to export it as a file for external manipulation. Which comes back to the above comment from Baanfin about using an external reporting system.<br />
<br />
However if you have no option then I seem to remember that another member had a download for how to create financial statements. I'll try and find it.<br />
<br />
