I was certain that I had seen reference to a tfcorxxxx program that would recreate tfgld410/etc from logistics transactions but I can't find it in my files. Might have only been in Triton; might be a figment of my imagination. It would be worth checking with Baan support. <br />
<br />
Can you identify which transactions are missing and need to be recreated? Is it all integration transactions for a date/time range? By transaction origin? By financial transaction? Random?<br />

Not sure how to rebuild tfgld410, but have come across one of the causes for missing records.<br />
<br />
At a company I worked at, they had a customisation that allowed them to change the standard cost price roll up date on the item master file. The date in tiitm001 then did not have a corresponding entry in ticpr (200 or 300 I think).<br />
<br />
When a transaction is created at the point in time when there is no corresponding date in ticpr, Baan simply drops the transaction from tfgld410.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps<br />
