I have re-opened the batch and tried to make periodics, but the kind of batch is not usable for this.<br />
Is it possible to change the fiscal period of the batch without re-typing all information?</div></div><hr />

You can do it Maintaining Tables. You will have to change at least:<br />
<br />
Tfgld018<br />
Tfgld100<br />
Tfgld102<br />
Tfgld107<br />
<br />
If you are using transactions related to customers or suppliers you will also have to change, al least, tfacp200, tfacr200.<br />
<br />
But if you are not accostomed to use this method I advice you to retype the batch.<br />
<br />

The description of the batch can be changed with Special. Why can't the others be changed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mario Alberto</div><div class="date">10th April 2011, 07:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you have created the batch and introduced a type of transaction you cannot modify the periods. In order to do so you should delete the registers, the type of transaction, and create a new batch.<br />
<br />
I am sorry for you but there is no standard solution for that. As I told you in my first message you should go to Maintain Table and I also advice you to avoid this option if you are not an expert.</div></div><hr />
