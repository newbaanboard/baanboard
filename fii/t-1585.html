BaaN's ledger and the fixed asset system &quot;feed&quot; the corporate ledger.  One of our challenges, is &quot;why aren't we using BaaN's fixed assets and ledger?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm in the process of researching who and how many companies are using BaaN fixed assets of the companies who are using BaaN finance.  I need to document how its used, ease of use, flexibility, satisfaction, set up ease, maintenance requirements, etc..<br />
<br />
Thought this group may be a good one for input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the United States you are mostly limited to Baan 5.0c.  Previous versions did not allow for multiple books (i.e., G/L and tax) as required in the USA.<br />
<br />
We in the process of implementing FA for 5.0c and for the most part it smoothly handles transactions.  Straight Line depreciation methods work as promised.  We are still working on getting the accelerated methods to work properly.  <br />
<br />
Feel free to email me with specific questions.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
