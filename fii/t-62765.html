<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joepte</div><div class="date">28th August 2012, 00:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I am trying to connect purchased items with purchase invoices from tfgld106. I want to find the last invoice date and cost for a particular item. Is there a way to drill down from the invoice to the item or to connect an item with the purchase invoice from tfacp?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">28th August 2012, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no 'hard' link back from the Finalized Transaction record to the Purchase Order Line.<br />
<br />
I would do this as a step by step search.<br />
<br />
The session references below are based on BAAN IV c3. Yours may be different.<br />
<br />
I will assume that you know the Document Type and Number, from your starting point of the finalized transactions (tfgld106)<br />
<br />
So, starting with the session Maintain Purchase Invoice Details (tfacp2100m000), binocular to the document. That gives you the Purchase Order Number.<br />
[I use the Maintain session to pull up the record, because the Display session does not have the Purchase Order Number].<br />
<br />
Then, using the session Display  Receipts [tdpur4531m000], binocular to the Purchase Order Number just found (with Position 0). From there scroll down to the position that has the part number you want. One of the forms will give you the price you are looking for.<br />
<br />
And that is one way to get to the information.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">29th August 2012, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">However, keep in mind that one Accounts Payable Invoice Number can in general comprise of amounts from receipts from multiple Purchase Order Lines - so again - no one-to-one link back from  the finance record to the purchase order line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">29th August 2012, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">table tdpur046 does support that. In this table one can find all the receipts under that invoice and thats how Baan keeps track of it. So one invoice can have  multiple POs and one PO can be under multiple invoice.</div></div><hr />
