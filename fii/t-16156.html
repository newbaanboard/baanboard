On Baan, Because of this conversion , financial tables and used domains of variables should be review.I don't know  any special software for it but many reports  should be customized. At soon , we are going to do this workshop for turkish conversion. This is important that every company usage can be  diffrent from others . At this point , according to your company, it will change. As a result , your firm's  need is important. That's all. <br />
<br />
See ya <br />
<br />
Best Regards,</div></div><hr />
