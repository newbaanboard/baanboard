                   I have very good knowledge in Baan distribution but my knowledge in finance I would say is zero. I would like to know where I can do the invoice approvals wrt purchase invoices. I complete all the purchase order processing. Once I complete the PDPO I do not know where to look in for the invoice in finance. Can anyone help me out with this?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will need to create the invoice in finance yourself through Maintain Transactions.  The transaction type should be a match to order type.  You can then enter the related purchase order on the invoice which will match the order to the invoice.  You can then also approve the invoice at the same time,</div></div><hr />

If it does then use session tfacp1130m001 Match Purchase Invoices with Orders and do a find  based on the PO number.</div></div><hr />

I can create invoice myself but incase of printing purchase invoices in the purchase flow there is an invoice number generated there too. so i have 2 invoice numbers once created by maintain transactions and once by print purchase invoices. which one should i use in this case?<br />

<br />
You have to use the invoice created in finance module for all purposes.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps ..</div></div><hr />
