Thanks for you replying. Another question is the system do not allow us to change the intergration account for the existing transactions. How can you change it in BAAN IVc4?</div></div><hr />

Plz note that if integration Account has been used it can not be changed afterwards.</div></div><hr />

You must change the value por tables, and then you can rebuild.</div></div><hr />

When you will do a close year you will see that the closing balance will be brought forward for this account as well.<br />
One point to be noted here is that if you have not closed the previous financial year then for this account Baan will get forward the closing balance. So if you do not want an opening balance for the current year then i suggest that you first close the previous year and then change the account type.<br />
<br />
I have tried in my system &quot;BIVc4 with SP21&quot; and the software allows me to change the account type from P&amp;L to balance sheet. However if u happen to change from BS to P&amp;L it will not allow and throw up a message that &quot;account has opening balance can not change&quot;<br />
<br />
Also you need not do any rebuild for this kind of a change. Rebuild is necessary only if you change the parent child relation or sublevel. That too running rebuild ledger history itself will help. You need not run session rebuild opening balance history thats 2 time consuming. <br />
<br />
Speaking about rebuilding from transactions, there is a new session released quite some time back tfgld3206m000 in comparison to tfgld3203 it is really very fast.</div></div><hr />
