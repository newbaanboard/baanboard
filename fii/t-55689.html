<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dan123</div><div class="date">21st April 2009, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">We are looking for a hosted e-commerce solution which integrates into Baan IVC4 ERP. The integration doesn't have to be real time, a batch mode would be sufficient. BOIs are enabled and we already use e-sales with very specific customers(Distributors) but it is too old and no plans to touch that area. <br />
<br />
I am looking for companies who implemented this kind of integration and perhaps share their experiences and/or recommend any products/services.<br />
We are on windows plat form with informix as database. <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
