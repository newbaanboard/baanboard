<br />
I am in discussion with a  Canadian company right now about how to correctly determine the Tax Code on Sales and Service Orders. The LN standard does look up the delivery address and if no GEO Code is linked to it eventually it will pick up the Invoice address. Now I have been told that it should always be the Invoice address as primary look-up rather than the delivery address.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I could not find any valid legal information about it only how other ERP systems would handle this issue and I wonder if anyone could give me a hint where find a legal explanation.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
