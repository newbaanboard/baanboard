<br />
This happens because there is a finance integration batch somewhere in your system which is in use.  In my case this happened in a multi site environment.  <br />
<br />
To solve:<br />
<br />
Find the original company num, transaction origin, financial transaction, date and transaction type of the transaction.  <br />
<br />
Look on tfgld430 for the batch info for that original company<br />
<br />
Find the batch and check it's status.  If it is in use change to free and rerun integration.  It should post now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I currently have an identical problem with an integration batch in our system.<br />
<br />
Error log contains the message &quot;Batch being used; try again&quot;, &quot;Cannot open batch for posting to finance&quot;.<br />
<br />
The transaction status is being shown as errorneous in Display Integration transactions. I have checked out the associated batch by looking at tfgld410 but the batch in question is fully finalised apart from this one transaction. See screen dump.<br />
<br />
Any assistance appreciated.<br />

<br />
You need to check in tfgld430 for the date on which the integration transaction occured.  There is probably a batch on that date which doesn't have the correct status</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">3rd May 2002, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Maria,<br />
<br />
Our tfgld430 shows two dates;<br />
<br />
Posting date : 02-05-2002 Batch : 2390<br />
Posting date : 03-05-2002 Batch : 2389<br />
<br />
All records in tfgld100 and tfgld101 for these batches have a status of Ready.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something ?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">7th May 2002, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol from support. Transactions already posted. Status field in tfgld418 incorrect.<br />
<br />
&quot;The transactions for production order 922059 have already been present in tfgld106. There was also no record in the tfgld416. Hence it was only necessary to change the the status of the transation in the table tfgld418 to &quot;posted&quot;. The error log has been deleted as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
