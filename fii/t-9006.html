<br />
How is the Process Inventory Variance suppose to work if part of the inventory is already issued ? When i check in the system , the receipt  amount is for the full quantity but Mauc is calculated based on available quantity . Because of this , Total of Receipt amount is not same as Issue Amount . Is this functionality or bug ?  <br />
<br />
We are on baan 5 b SP13<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

<br />
Which inventory valuation method are you using? With MAUC or FIFO (or even LIFO depending on what you mean by different), if you had existing stock before receiving new stock with different price, then there will be difference between the latest receipt price and price for issue that happens after the new receipt.<br />

Valuation method is MAUC .  I will try to give a bit more explanation on this one . <br />
<br />
We receive 300 pcs from production order . we issue 100 pcs . And after that we do process inventory variance . Now , The Receipt amount is for full 300 pcs but MAUC is calculated on 200 pieces only . This is happening only for sub assembly items . In case of Finished goods it is ok  ie received amount is for 200 pcs. What could be problem ? <br />

Indeed, previously we were having problem with MAUC calculation. We had to install a patch for that<br />
<br />
But in your case, could you please supply the amount involved too in detail so we all can look into it and probably decide whether it is a bug or not. Thanks<br />
