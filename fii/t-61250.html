<br />
I was asked to build a report that will show the Trial Balance that is very similar to the original report that comes out from tfgld3403m000 session.<br />
<br />
In this session you can choose the currency (USD/EUR) and the report will be in one of those only (+ the currency of the record itself).<br />
<br />
What I need to do is that I need both Currencies on the report, USD &amp; EUR. I have the Report script but not the session script, as I see all the calculation is in the session script (which I do not have).<br />
<br />
Basically what I need is the ledger account code, and the colsing balance (in all three currencies). No need for the other columns.<br />
<br />
Is there an easy way to do this?<br />
<br />
If not can someone explain the logic, so I can write a new report from scratch?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
Closing balance is a calculated field. What you need to do is that get the total amount by currency and ledger a/c for the required period from  table tfgld201 and opening balance data from tfgld203 and calculate the closing balance as a+b-c = Closing Balance. Here a= opening balance(tfgld203) b=Debit transaction total (tfgld201) and c=Credit Transaction total (tfgld201).<br />
<br />
Hope this will help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">david7</div><div class="date">18th October 2011, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank to you I have found the open balance amount.<br />
<br />
I am still looking for the &quot;b&quot; &amp; &quot;c&quot; in your equation and can not find those amounts in the tfgld201! I am looking in the same company, same ledger, all currencies.. What am I missing?<br />
<br />
Any help is really appreciated<br />
