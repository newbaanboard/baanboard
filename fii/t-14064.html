You have to look in table tfgld418 and see if field tfgld418.sint is with status &quot;not for finance&quot; in all transactions there. In case it is, no postings will be made.<br />

That means that you had the integration parameters on as you were using  distribution. Now you have two alternatives:<br />
a)Either you delete all records from tables tfgld410, tfgld412, tfgld415, tfgld416, tfgld417, tfgld418;<br />
b) You book all those transactions into a non-meaningfull account before starting for real with finance.<br />
Hope this will help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">29th December 2003, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that even when you have the integration with finance switched off, Baan will still generate the integration transactions. Once you implement finance they will be posted.<br />
I believe this has been done to make it possible during an implementation to go live with the distribution part of the system before finance is fully implemented without loosing the integration transactions.<br />
<br />
You can of course delete all records from the tfgld41* tables, but that may stop you from matching purchase invoices against existing orders. It may also have some implications for things like GRNI matching, WIP and stock reconciliation etc. I'd get some advise from Baan support on that.</div></div><hr />
