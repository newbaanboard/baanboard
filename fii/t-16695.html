<br />
1. Create transaction type with transaction category sales correction.<br />
2. attach this in session tfacr0100m000<br />
3. run session tfacr2240m000 after filling relevent details and posting date/period.<br />
4. Finalise the transaction generated from above session <br />
5. at the time of printing aging report from session tfacr2420m000, say yes to print fully paid invoices.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Without making a payment u cant hv a payment diff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">7th March 2007, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm being told by the user that they have written off total invoice amounts for reasons like, we never did the work, the customer has a complaint and isn't going to pay.  So - they've used this session to write off the entire invoice amount.  So, I'm assuming no payments were previously made.  I'm thinking the same as you though - the session help seems to indicate that some payment had to have been made already but the user is telling me differently.  We have an invoice that has no payment made and they want to write half of it off because that's all it should be worth I guess.<br />
