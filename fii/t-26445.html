<br />
I want to add another finance company that has a different home currency.  Am I able to do that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are the following pre-requisites for a group company:<br />
all companies of the same group must have:<br />
- same home currency-set-up<br />
- same period set-up,<br />
- same country in company address (workaround before go-Live: change the country after linking to the finance group!)<br />
<br />
br<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">speedracer786</div><div class="date">22nd February 2006, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">When you say home currency, do you mean reference currency?<br />
<br />
What would be the best setup?<br />
<br />
The group company is setup with all USD.  <br />
<br />
The company that I would like to add to the group transacts in Canadian and USD and reports in Canadian and USD.  <br />
<br />
Should I add it to the group and how (ref curr, local curr, reporting curr)?<br />
<br />
Should set it up as dependent or independent?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">altfplak</div><div class="date">28th February 2006, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">In a dependent MC situation, it is sufficient to have the same reference currency - from the reference currency the transactions are then calculated correctly to all the HC in use - because you only can define exchange rates between reference currency and transaction currencies!<br />
<br />
In an indepdent MC situation, all 3 Home currencies of all companies must be exactely the same, because rates must be defined from transaction currencies to ALL the home currencies in use<br />
<br />
hope this helps!<br />
