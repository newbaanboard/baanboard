<br />
I hope someone can advise me how to set the integration mapping for the following scenerios:<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a product consist of two processes. First process is produce internally and second process is subcontracting.<br />
<br />
The business requirement is after completing first process, the company will sell it (WIP item) to subcon and buy back the finished goods from the subcon.<br />
<br />
Let said the production cost for first process is 0.30 cents and sell it to subcon @ 0.50. At this point of time, the business requirement is they do not want to recognise the revenue and cost of goods sold.<br />
<br />
Subcon will sell back the finished goods @ 0.90. The company want to recognise the cost of goods sold for this item is 0.70 (0.30 for internal production cost + 0.40 from subcon purchase)<br />
<br />
Please help..... thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like life could be a lot simpler if it were possible to just use Subcntract operation as baan inteded it to be (with an order to cover the external cost and the system to keep track of the WIP asset while in-process).  There would be no sale to report or conceal until the actual sale was consumated and the costs would reflect the actual business processes.</div></div><hr />

When you sell it to subcontractor, do you include sales tax with it? And how about when the subcontractor sell it back to you, do they bill for tax too? What is the monetary amount on which the tax calculation is based? The sales price? If that's so, then there'll be lots of offseting involved. In my country, and many others, this will probably be rather tricky to explain and justify to the tax authority<br />
