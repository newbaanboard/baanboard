<br />
     Some of the records which is not posted to finance. Those records are in tfgld416. While Closing the periods it shows that &quot;Not all Transactions posted to Finance&quot; and also showing the combination.<br />
<br />
In that List, Some of the records which i could find what is the problem with that. The result of my analysis is the following:<br />
<br />
1. Those records are not in tfgld410, tfgld418 and tfgld417<br />
2. Only in tfgld416 and tfgld415<br />
<br />
How to proceed with this. What could be the possibilities for the above and how to correct and proceed<br />
<br />
Pls give a solution as soon as possible. Since it is very urgent work for me.<br />
<br />
How to prevent the integration errors before posting ?<br />
<br />

<br />
the only idea I have directely is, that somebody deleted the data in tfgld410. Please have a look on the General table with session ttaad4400m000 for tfgld410. <br />
<br />
Besides, in the beginning of a project, it is OK to have a lot of integration errors in the logfile of session tfgld4532m000. <br />
It is just a sign that not all masterdata have been maintained for integration. Especially in the beginning maybe somebody is not sure about some transactions, then it is better to wait until there is one transaction like that, and examine the error kneetly before just posting it to an account just to avoid the integration error. <br />

<br />
As Juli mentioned, you need to look in the tfgld4532m000 session.  This will tell you why the integration has not posted. Using this information, you will then need to create integration setup in order to post the transactions into the general ledger and finalize the batches created by the posting before you can close the period.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the respose.<br />
<br />
But I checked with the session tfgld4532m000. But there is no such record found for the combination for the log date. Since it is only in tfgld416, I have no enough data to find the transaction details in the session ttaad4400m000. <br />
<br />
How to proceed? Since this problem stopping me to proceeding closing periods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried posting integration transactions  (session tfgld4201m000) for the transaction type and date that you're seeing in the tfgld416 table?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbsmanian</div><div class="date">14th August 2002, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Linda<br />
<br />
    I am working in BaaN IV c4.<br />
<br />
    Yes I tried. But its not getting for posting.<br />
<br />
     I want to know, after post integration what are all the impacts.<br />
<br />
     1.  I  think those records will be deleted from tfgld416.<br />
     2.  In tfgld418, the status is changed to &quot;Posted&quot;.<br />
     3.  Those records will be moved to tfgld102.<br />
<br />
Is there any other impacts. Pls let me know? If i delete those records from tfgld416 through GTM will it be helpful for me?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depending on the transaction type/transaction origin, I would think it could also affect the logistical module tables.<br />
<br />
I'm not an IT person - perhaps someone else can shed some additional light on this?<br />
<br />
I've never deleted anything from my tfgld416 table, and wouldn't do it without the approval from BaaN Support.  <br />
<br />
Have you tried to print the integration transactions from session tfgld4410?  Unposted is one of the selections your can choose for transaction status.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ExPaxis</div><div class="date">7th April 2020, 23:59</div></div><div class="posttext">When you try to use the session: tfgld0107m000 &quot;Maintain Period Status&quot; and if you change the period from Open to Closed, it will think for a bit and then tell you: &quot;Not all integration transactions are posted for year... period...&quot; At the bottom o the screen it will tell you the type of the source and transaction. If it is PCS/Act. Cost of Goods, one thing that has worked for me was to close the Project and then Post the resulting Integration transactions using tfgld4201m000 and selecting the resulting batch for finalization using tfgld1110m000. This cleared out most of my offenders but now I am stuck with some projects that are not ready to be closed even though they have un-posted integration trx...</div></div><hr />
