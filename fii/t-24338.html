<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marcel_d</div><div class="date">20th June 2005, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">With the GRNI tools you are able to explain and check the balance of your Goods received not yet Invoiced account. This account is populated as soon as you maintain a receipt and is contra-posted as soon as you approve the purchase invoice.<br />
<br />
The accept functionality can be used as a kind of filter on your report tfacp1435m000. You have an option to only print the not accepted GRNI transactions.<br />
<br />
Later on when you want to finally accept the GRNI transactions, all GRNI transactions for an order have to have the status accepted.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.  :)</div></div><hr />
