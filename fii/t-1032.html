<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 04:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
 We are using Baan IVc2 and are planning to use the FBS system for the first time (Even though we've been using Baan for couple of yrs now).<br />
<br />
After maintaining the respective Budget Master data, When I try to maintain the Budget Amounts &amp; Quantities, I am facing a problem.<br />
<br />
Example : For a ledger account, I have 2 dimension codes...say.. Customer and Work Center. When you pass a regular journal entry in finance, you enter the respective ledger accnt and you can mention to which particular workcenter that amnt should be allocated to. <br />
<br />
When I use the session tffbs1101m000, maintain budget amnts and qts., why cant I allocate a certain amnt to a workcenter code.<br />
The system does not let me access the dimension fields on this session.<br />
(Yes, I have given 'yes' to dimensions in the Budget Master data).<br />
But the funny part is, the system gives me access to the dimension fields ONLY when I dont give the ledger code.<br />
(The budget is a bottom-up type and all manually entered ledger accnts are at level 0).<br />
<br />
Can anyone please guide me as to how to allocate amnts per dimension level ? If the functionality does not support it, how does the FBS system allocate the amount to the dimensions ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
try to copy the history data to your budget with session tffbs1202m000 and then change the data. <br />
Then you can see which combinations are possible. <br />
<br />
Bye, Juli</div></div><hr />

<br />
The system lets me allocate amnts per Work Center... not only at the low level work center, but also the main work center.<br />
<br />
I had a query related to budgeting. I have my budget present in a excel document (per ledger accnt\dimension).... is there a standard session one can upload this into FBS ?<br />
If not., presuming I do write my own session to do this..,<br />
(I was thinking of &quot;somehow&quot; uploading the data only for the level 0 (zero) ledger accnts.. and then do a rebuild of levels... that way data would be consolidated for higher levels.)<br />
<br />
Can anyone please guide me as to which tables need to be considered for this ? Has any one done this previously ?<br />
(Do i need to consider the gld tables) ? <br />
<br />
All suggestions are greatly welcome and appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in the process of doing this now.  <br />
<br />
Our Finance department has gone from annual budgets to creating quarterly budgets.  They have manually entered the 1st quarter using a distribution code to spread quarterly amounts over each of the first three months in the quarter.  <br />
<br />
They will then submit Excel spreadsheets (one for each of the remaining quarters) containing the account, dimension1, and quarterly amount.  I will then use Baan exchange to import that data into a table I created.  Then I'm going to create a session to read this table containing quarterly info, divide the quarterly amount into a value for each month in the quarter and update the tffbs101 table (this should be the only table you need to update).  Then I'll rebuild the sublevels.  Our Finance department is planning on going to monthly budgets in 2003 so I have a year to automate this process to where - hopefully- finance can run the whole thing themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Eddie,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
I have created a session and have completed the process of uploading all the budgets. Apart from the tffbs101 table, I'm also inserting the data in the tffbs004 table.<br />
As you mentioned, I too am uploading the data for ledger accnts at level 0.  (then do  a rebuild).<br />
I'm not using Baan Exchange for doing this. I'm directly uploading from the Excel file (I converted the excel file to a .csv file).<br />
<br />
Everything works fine... But the only funny thing is... Lets say I for a ledger accnt with a dimension 'work center' and the work center value is &quot;952&quot; (It is a main work center). AFTER I do a rebuild of sublevels... I see that the system has entered a record for the same ledger accnt and the dimension is &quot;T952&quot;.(same amnts)<br />
But.. there is no such WC center existing. But yes.. for this ledger accnt the dimension range is given as &quot;&quot; - &quot;989&quot;. <br />
<br />
Any idea why this is happening ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming that T952 is a valid dimension code in your system...  <br />
<br />
Is T952 a parent dimension to dimension 952?  That's the only reason that I can think that T952 has a value.  Rebuilding the sub-levels causes any parent dimensions and parent accounts to be populated with the 'roll-up' values of the sublevel 0 accounts and dimensions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm fairly new to programming (I spent 5 years in Finance and have recently transferred as our IT department needed someone with Finance experience).  Would you mind sharing your code for pulling the data directly from the cvs file?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">sure... no problem about that....<br />
I think we can pass it across offline....<br />
<br />
u can email me at minhaaj@yahoo.com<br />
