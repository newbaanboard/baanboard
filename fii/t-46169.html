 <br />
In ERP LN 6.1 we have Warehouse Order of &quot;SFC Production (Manual)&quot;, and using this the Consumable Items are Issued from Stores Warehouse to Work Centre.<br />
Now I got it to this point. But now I have further question.<br />
<br />
We have issued &amp; loaded the value to Work Centre. Where is this value going? How this value is captured in Production &amp; Finance ? Expenses.<br />
<br />
If suppose I Issue consumable material worth 1 Lakh in one month, then where will I get the reference that these are the expenses in one month for production, which occured thru consumables, but which are not directly loaded on production of end finished product thru production order.<br />
<br />
Please guide me, I want to learn. Sorry if its simple &amp; I have failed to find myself. I asked to some of my colleagues but not got answer. I am from the field of Distribution.<br />
Thanks.<br />

You would presumably map the debit of the warehousing order / issue to some expense ledger account and the cost center that consumed the materials.</div></div><hr />
