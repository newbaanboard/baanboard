<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">txarmel</div><div class="date">28th July 2010, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
currently in our BaaN system we have set up different delivery addresses for the same customer, and some of the delivery adresses have different VAT numbers (different from the customer VAT number) and some are also for different countries.<br />
When invoicing sales orders for these delivery adresses, BaaN looks at the delivery adress country to set up the country for VAT calculation, but the VAT number for VAT reporting is always the customer VAT number.<br />
<br />
What is the point of being able to set up delivery adresses with different VAT numbers is those numbers are not used? or are they?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
