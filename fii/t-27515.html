<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">5th July 2006, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: <br />
<br />
Finance has made a change to the Canadian GST ( goods and Services Tax ) from 7% to 6%, to take place as of July 1st.<br />
<br />
They used Maintain Tax Codes by Country (tcmcs0136m000), found the correct tax code and rate then zoomed down until they got to tcmcs0133s000 -- Maintain Multiple Tax Rates.<br />
<br />
The tax rate new entry was added to take place as of July 1st 2006.<br />
<br />
When printing an invoice, the 7% rate shows and the 7% amount is still being calculated.  <br />
<br />
Is there more to is than just this to get the change into effect ?  Any help would be appreciated !!  thx ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They'll keep me posted when they get one, thanks, I'll post the problem if one really exists ....</div></div><hr />
