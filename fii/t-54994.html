<br />
I have some logistic companies run 'SINGLE' currency system in USD. I 'm now setting a new finance company which use 'Dependent' currency system in EUR to settle the payment issues for those AP/AR in 'SINGLE'. <br />
<br />
I 've tried to settle the intercompany transaction from 'Dependent' finance company to 'Single' logistic company, the tfgld106 seems cannot reflect the correct currency figure.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to change those logistic company to 'Dependent' to apply same USD in the Home Currency, Reporting 1 &amp; Reporting 2 ?? and what is the impact if I change it ??  I 've checked there are the difference in rate2 &amp; rate3 from existing 'Single' - 0.00001 to 'Dependent' - 1.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
