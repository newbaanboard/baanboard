My user created 2 ach files for her io payments (her first batch was not correct).  The corrected file was sent to the bank using Valicert, so, now we need to delete the first ACH file from Baan.  How should the user go about voiding these ach payments?  We know what to do with checks, but not ach payments.<br />
