<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rozlynn Smith</div><div class="date">20th July 2006, 01:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any way to have nested financial companies?  For instance, we currently have financial company 632.  Our Finance department is wondering if there is a way to add two additional finance companies that would roll up to financial company 632.  I'm not aware of any way to do this, but I thought that there might be some way to achieve this in Baan IVc4.  Any help you can give would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you can make any number of child companies provided company 632 is itself not a child company of other. Just create two more companies, say, 640 &amp; 650. In Company Parameters, select comp 632 as their Group Company. You can also share their master data tables in Logical Tables session.<br />
thnx, finwizard</div></div><hr />
