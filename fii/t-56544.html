<br />
Can you please go into this batch and for this document, firstly unassign or unlink whatever documents have accidentally got linked to it.<br />
<br />
Then delete this record.<br />
<br />
For this supplier, try executing recalculate Supplier balances and then proceed further.<br />
<br />
If you still get the same message, then advise you to use GTM. Check in table tfacp200 for this document and check what invoice got linked to it. This would help you in processing it without any further errors.<br />
<br />

Thanks for the reply. I already tried unassign/unlink<br />
Now at this point we are not able to change / remove the allocation, remove the transaction or revise the allocation<br />
<br />
please advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use GTM to remove this in total.<br />
<br />
Note the document numbers and delete them from:<br />
<br />
tfgld102, tfacp200 (this document and also the linking that happened to the invoice for this doc), tfgld018(status to change to deleted)<br />
<br />
Recalculate the supplier balances for this supplier.<br />
<br />
This should work.<br />
<br />

Use GTM to remove this in total ...  <br />
<br />
 e.g. I booked on sup trans and finalised(001tran type) <br />
       and maintained the bank trans (077 trn typ)  this details are only available in non finalised to finalise.<br />
<br />
while trying to link  the payment for 077(bank trn) for 001(sup.trn) with setting status = automatic &amp; the remaining amoun column is not reducing, infact it is increasing.<br />
<br />
if there any solutions to remove bank trns or reverse the entry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajhyd</div><div class="date">19th August 2009, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible for me to do a remote login and check the same. I can do it through Team Viewer. In case you have something different then do let me know.<br />
<br />
I assume that you havent done the changes as suggested. The remaining amount will go on increasing and this happens. If this has been set as automatic then it is possible that this linking has wrongly happened to many more invoices too.<br />
