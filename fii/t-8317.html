<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ucanyu</div><div class="date">7th January 2003, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">There are three tax types in &quot;Maintain Tax Codes by Country&quot;.They are 'Normal','Shifted','On Payments'. Could you help me explain them? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pfsilva</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 01:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Normal tax is calculated by the product of the tax rate for the net amount,  the result is added to the net amount to determine the gross amount and is posted.<br />
Example: Net amount: 100- this is posted<br />
tax rate 20%<br />
Tax amount: 20- this is posted<br />
Gross amount:120- this is posted<br />
<br />
On payments tax acts like a normal tax except that the amount of tax is posted in an interim account till the moment of payment/collection, when the system reverses the posting of the interim account and uses the tax sale/purchase account.<br />
<br />
Shifted tax is calculated by the product of the tax rate for the net amount but it is not added to the net amount to determine the gross amount, instead, the tax amount is posted twice, in a normal sales/purchase account and in the contra account for sale/purchase tax.<br />
<br />
Example: In a Supplier invoice<br />
Net amount:100<br />
Tax rate:20%<br />
Tax amount :20<br />
Postings:<br />
Net amount:100 Credit to supplier control account<br />
Tax Purchase account:20 Debit<br />
Contra account for Shifted Purchase tax: 20 Credit<br />
Ledger account for &quot;whatever&quot;:100 Debit<br />
Contra Account</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pfsilva</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Ucanyu,<br />
Net means that the amounts you are going to enter in Baan Finance in maintain transactions are supposed to be net, therefore the system wil calculate the tax amount directly:<br />
Ex: Net amount 100 tax rate 17% tax amount 17<br />
Gross means that you are supposed to enter Gross amounts (Net + tax) in Baan Finance and the system will calculate the Net amount and the tax as follows: Gross 117 ;Tax rate 17%; Tax:117*17/117=17 Net amount:117-17<br />
Gross over hundred means that you are going to enter gross amounts in Baan Finance but tax is supposed to be calculated over Gross amoounts. Ex: Gross: 117 Tax rate:17% Tax amount=19,89 Net amount= 117-19,89=97,11<br />
<br />
Hope this will help you.<br />
