<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luisa Pereira</div><div class="date">17th May 2004, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I am implanting I modulate of fixed assets in baanV, and the amounts of monthly depreciation that is showing by system when execut the session of: tffam1500m000 (amortization of asset) is not the corresponding one, when consulting the values in the &quot;book of assets&quot; by the session: tffam1511m000 set up data is the following: method air line, frequently of periodic amortization, and calculation average depreciation method &quot;period later dates putting in good condition&quot; session &quot;tffam7510m000&quot; Yes, I apply the theory that baanV shows in the help for the selected option, the formula of the calculation would be the following one: Faltantes acumulada/meses cost of active-depreciation (in days) * 30 = monthly depreciation 1.296.000,00 - 712,800.00/3270 * 30 = 5,350.46 and baanV is showing 21,600.00, amount that does not correspond with the real value of the calculation of monthly depreciation. Can anybody support to me, indicating to me which is the calculation that Baan is using to show this value? And which would be the correct procedure to obtain the corresponding value?</div></div><hr />
