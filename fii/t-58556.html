<br />
i am facing problem to track the text entered in tfcmg204.<br />
<br />
the case is, the client is entering the text while 'maintaining the bank transaction'(tfcmg204), we need to retrive the text after the corresponding batch is finalized for generating a report.<br />
<br />
we thought of entering the text in the finalization session but that will be for a batch..we need text to be entered at document level...<br />
<br />
any idea is welcome.<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

but can i retrieve the text even after the batch, in which the document is created has been finalized. Because once the batch has been finalized i can't find the record in tfcmg204 table.  Is there any other way where i can find the text entered.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

after finalization tfcmg204 too is deleted . U can get text numbers in such case from backups of tfcmg204 (at a time it was non-finalized) or  tttxt010</div></div><hr />
