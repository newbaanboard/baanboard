<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sue Reither</div><div class="date">22nd July 2002, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to research how other companies approach financial reporting when not all company locations are part of BaaN.  We currently use a separate ledger system for corporte reporting and have each business unit send a file periodically.  We need to replace the corporate system.  One of our ideas is to use BaaN's ledger for our corporate reporting system. (why buy something else when you own one already????!!!!)  We feel OK that BaaN's ledger will be a good transactional engine but are very uncomfortable with its reporting and inquiry capabilities.  <br />
<br />
I'm looking for what others in this situation are doing.<br />
<br />
We are on version 4c4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">22nd July 2002, 22:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sue - <br />
<br />
Our company is multi-finance/multi-logistical in BaaN.  We currently are on version IVc2, soon to upgrade to c4.<br />
<br />
We create our financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, departmental operating expense statements, etc.) in BaaN, then export them to Excel to make them &quot;pretty&quot;.  We originally used a third-party software but ran into performance problems.  We produce departmental, divisional and consolidated statements in BaaN. <br />
<br />
Because we have all of our companies using BaaN, we are able to take advantage of the system's drill down capabilities - the amount of inquiry capability you would have would be determined by the level of detail that you bring in (import) from your other companies.<br />
<br />
