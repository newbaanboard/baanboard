I have a trouble, deleting one record from session tfacp0140m000.<br />
We are starting a new company, but by mistake a user creates one reccord on this session. No transactions has been made with this Aging Code, but when I try to delete it, it appears me a message telling me that the record is in use in another table.<br />
<br />
Anybody knows what tables afect this code? or knows a method to do an explode for this field in order to know all the possible table field in were can be inserted?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!</div></div><hr />

    Maybe you can try this solution:<br />
    delete record via ttaad4100, after you delete the record, system will show fatal error, you can check your OS $BSE/log/log.oracle8(depend on your oracle version), it should record which table reference to your record.<br />
<br />
    Hope it workable.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwbfin</div><div class="date">2nd November 2005, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Other option, go to session ttaad4229m000, check the table tfacp004 and the keyfield that was inserted in the table. This wil take some time but it will show you the table with the refference. Now you can use ttaad4100 to remove the record.</div></div><hr />
