<br />
I have not had much experience with this report but I know that the whole GRINYA issue is quite complicated.  Here is a bit of a description of the report that I found:<br />
<br />
The report is showing registered or matched invoices within the requested period that are not yet approved in the requested period OR appproved invoices within the requested period that are not yet registered or matched in the requested period.  In this procedure if an invoice/credit note has been entered before the given period range, and has been approved in the given period range this record will be printed because this affects the &quot;Invoice receipts&quot; account.  In general this session shows any invoice or credit note that will make a change of any kind to the &quot;invoice receipts&quot; account during the selected period.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Also please check that you have the latest version of the program as there are a lot of changes being done to these GRINYA reports.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kamran</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem I have with this report is that the Report balance does not tally with the G/L balance I am aware of a journal posting to this account but it still shows a difference, the Report balance is lower than the G/L account balance, What further areas could I investigate to find the difference?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
