Our environment is Baan ERP 5.0c (Multicurrency). When the sales orders are invoiced, the amounts of credit lines in the table tfgld102 show rounding errors for currencies 2 and 3. So for such currencies the total for credit is different from the total for debit, and therefore the entry can not be finalized before a correction is made. It seems to be a bug of the standard, but I'm not sure about the action to take.<br />
<br />
I will appreciate any help, <br />
<br />
Best regards,</div></div><hr />

I have the same problem on version IVC2 multicurrency. The Infor support, applied some patches to solve it.<br />
<br />
I suppose it is the same for version V. I suggest you to put a support order with your provider.<br />
