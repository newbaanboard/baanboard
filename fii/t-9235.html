Situation:<br />
<br />
I have different payment methods for a single bank relation but using same check series for all the payment methods. In tfcmg2115m000 I maintain the check number range for one payment method. For another payment method I maintain the same check number range. If I use a particular check for a particular payment method the status of that check for other payment method is Not used. I have to manually change the status of that check to void or damaged in tfcmg2115m000 for other payment methods. Is there any work around to have the status changed in tfcmg2115m000 for all the payment methods for the particular check?<br />

<br />
In the first place, the different payment methods are not interlinked.  So, when u use one check number in one payment method, the other payment method does not get automatically changed.  <br />
<br />
Moreover,  It is a control issue that you use the same check series for two different payment methods.  You will loose track of check numbers.  So it is advisable that you have different check books for different payment methods  Alternatively you can divide the same checkbook into two, and insert the ranges for payment methods.<br />
<br />
For example, your check book contains 100 leaves starting from 1 to 100.  Assign 1 to 50 to one payment method, and 51 to 100 to the other.<br />
<br />
Hope this works<br />
Best regards.</div></div><hr />
