<br />
We are in the process of year closing and are reconciling all the Purchase accounts.<br />
<br />
One major problem we face is to trace the Distribution transactions from Finance transactions. i.e., After when a receipt is maintained in maintain receipts, it passes Both Receipt and Result transactions thro integration.  These entries get accumulated in the ledger accounts specified in integration setup.<br />
<br />
My query is :<br />
<br />
How to trace the Purchase Order/Receipt no. from an Integration Transaction. i.e., If our Transaction type for Receipt (in integration) is NPU and Transaction type for Result is NPV, how to trace the root document ref. for say NPU-000001 trn.  This would have come thro say PO no. 230001 and receipt no. 450001.  I am interested in tracking this.<br />
<br />
Is there any standard session available to do this?  of, if somebody has already made a query for this, can they pass it on to me?<br />
<br />

<br />
To combine the distribution and financial data for our purchase activities, we use the table tdpur046 (Purchase invoices) as the bridge<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">N. sriram</div><div class="date">11th April 2003, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes paul,<br />
<br />
we also do the same in case of purchase invoices and material receipt entries.<br />
<br />
But, my query is :<br />
<br />
Whenever you change the price/discount after maintain receipt the system passes Result transactions in integration.  These transactions are directly posted to finance with say transaction type as NPU<br />
<br />
Now, when I print the general ledger listing, there may be 1000s of NPU transactions appearing in my ledger.  How do I track, which NPU transaction pertains to which PO/material receipt?<br />
<br />
and also, during Match/Approval a seperate transaction is created with transaction type say NAP.<br />
<br />
Now, in a typical situation, when I have 200 NPU transaction (RECEIPTS), 200 NPV transactions (results) and 100 NAP transactions (match/approval) in one ledger account, how do I track them upto material receipts?  This is very much required, when we are reconciling the purchase accounts<br />
<br />
Hope my query is clear<br />

<br />
I'm not sure wether I understand the problem, but can't you simply use tfgld4410 to print bookings per transaction type? Then you can get a report that shows transaction type, ledger account, project-nr. and purchase order-nr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">11th April 2003, 18:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you can get the linkage out of integration transactions, but it's not a &quot;clean&quot; report and you have to remember that postings to tfgld410 are by Cost Price Component which sometimes hides the forest for trees.<br />

<br />
I have been working on tfgld410 to track these.  But, since we are new to baan (just 7 months), I am not very comfortable with tables.<br />
<br />
Can u just send me a query (I am using sql 7.0) to take this.  The query may be like :<br />
<br />
transaction details of Distribution for<br />
<br />
NPU-2003001 i.e., for any particular finance document<br />
<br />
It'll be of great help<br />

<br />
We had similar need for printing Excise Reco, user specifies glcode and specific document if required, session prints sales order details part of the code is :<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
select	tfgld106.*<br />
from	tfgld106<br />
where   tfgld106._index3 inrange  {:leac.f, :ttyp.f, :odoc.f} and {:leac.t, :ttyp.t, :odoc.t}<br />
and	tfgld106.fyer inrange :fyer.f and :fyer.t<br />
and	tfgld106.fprd inrange :fprd.f and :fprod.t<br />
selectdo<br />
	mess(&quot;Doc No : %s-%d   &quot;,0, tfgld106.otyp, tfgld106.odoc)<br />
	select	tfgld418.*<br />
	from	tfgld418<br />
	where   tfgld418._index3 = {10, :tfgld106.otyp, :tfgld106. odoc, :tfgld106.olin}<br />
	selectdo<br />
		select	tfgld410.*<br />
		from	tfgld410<br />
		where   tfgld410._index1 = {:tfgld418.ocom, :tfgld418.tror, :tfgld418.fitr, <br />
					    :tfgld418.trdt, :tfgld418.trtm, :tfgld418.sern}<br />
| 					    :tfgld418.line}<br />
		selectdo<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
if you only need the PO Number and Line number, you need not access tfgld410 since tfgld410 contains Order No and Position number, while tfgld418 contains the sequence number also. Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
You can further link table tdpur046 to this to get Purchase Invoice details. ( Note : This would work only if Match with Purchase Orders is set to yes in Purchase Invoive Transaction type and Receipts are Matched with Invoice)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
