I'm a brand new Baan user, and are not trusted with the most challenging tasks, but one thing they have made me do is to delete &quot;empty batches&quot;, which are created when invoices are matches automatically to order number. I find them in tfgld1101m000. <br />
Because there can be up to 3000 single lines a week which has the status &quot;free&quot;, I was just wondering whether there was anyone who have got any tips on a quicker way of getting these out of the system other than having to delete every single one manually?<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />
