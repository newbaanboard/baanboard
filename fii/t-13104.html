<br />
We are looking at implementing Financial Statements within 5c and understand that the data will now be exported to a report writer such as Crystal.<br />
<br />
Having looked on the Baan Website there was a link to a document that will not open. Does anyone have any experience or preferrably documentation that they can let me have.<br />
<br />
many thanks<br />

unfortuntely I only have a german documentation (paper, no file) but I have already installed FST several times and could send the fst tables + 1 CR I have developed if that is of any use to you.<br />

<br />
I have done a Baan5c FST implementation and for sure the customer was not very thrilled.<br />
<br />
You will need the crystal reports and Baan native driver 2.0 inorder to access the reports.<br />
<br />
THe FST tables in Baan5 are modified drastically and generate the values into the FST tables which again have to be accessed from crystal and the report generated. The only advantage the specific account/dimension mapping is done at the FST level. <br />
<br />
The values still have to be selected from crystal like you would have created any other report.<br />
<br />
Try to look for the FST documentation in the support website under documentation. They have something in pdf. As as you say it does not open, try to go to some other location server for support. You could also request, open a case for the documentation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that it is not easy to reproduce Baan IV fst reports in Baan ERP?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">1st October 2003, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">It is quite simple to setup reports in FST since it is almost the same procedure like in Baan IV. You have to define the right levels in order to get the neccessary results in CR. The actual work is done in CR. To give you an idea - it took me 1 day for the first report, and about 3 hours for the 10th. <br />

<br />
Check out Cyberquery from Cyberscience before you put in Crystal - sounds much more user-friendly than Crystal and has a unique pricing model. They're making lots of Baan friends in the UK.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
