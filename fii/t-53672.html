<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">15th September 2008, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been having problems with Baan Sales Tax reporting since upgrading to BaanIVc4 and SP22.<br />
<br />
According to Baan Support they &quot;fixed&quot; it so that the sales tax reporting would conform to European VAT reporting requirements.  However, in the process they broke tax reporting for US entities.  They broke a link between a parameter and the form.  They have indicated that they will not fix this.  And to make matters worse, none of the help text matches the functionality observed and tested.<br />
<br />
So when Baan Support refuses to fix something they broke, what avenue do we have?</div></div><hr />

May be if you can explain what is not working, it would help. We are using Baan taxes (without external  tax provider) and have modified little but of it.<br />
