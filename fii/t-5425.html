<br />
we have problems with the Electronic Bank Statements in Finance - Cash Management. <br />
<br />
If a customer happens to pay on the same day to the same bank account two remittances with exactly the same reference number.  The customer might first have paid a wrong sum, then noticed his error and paid more using the same reference number, of course.  <br />
Manually it's ok but EBS cannot handle this.  There we have to allocate all remittances which aren't allocated automatically.  The first remittance goes automatically ok, but the second remains unallocated.  And when we try to allocate the second remittance, the system gives a message  'The voucher has already been chosen to batch'. <br />
<br />
Does anybody know this problem in IVc4 and offer some help?<br />
Bye, Juli</div></div><hr />
