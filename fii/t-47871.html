Year 2006 is not closed finally as well 2007. We want provisional open balance in 2008 created. Can this be done without GTM?<br />
Table tfgld004 has 2006 current year.<br />

I am sorry that this is not possible without GTM. As per standard functionality Baan doesnt provisionally close 2 years.<br />

Yes it is possible. If on table tfgl004 you change the current year from 2006 to 2007, after running session tfgld6201m000, you will get the opening balances for year 2008.<br />
<br />
But remmeber, try to avoid doing this. Put pressure to your accountans and Finance Controller to close the year 2006 definilty. If you show them that you can do this, perhaps, they want to do this, every year!<br />
<br />
And when they finally try to make the definitive close, it will a headache!<br />
<br />
Please belive me, try to avoid this!<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
