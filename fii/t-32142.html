<br />
One invoice has been lregistered and inked to one PO,but this PO has been matched with other invoice. So It means this invoice is not necessary.In the meantime,the registered process has been finalized. So how do we remove purchase invoice with registered status? <br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
Registered then you create a batch using a transaction type having transaction category Purchase corrections. Using this transaction type find the Purcahse invoice you have registered and chnage the value to &quot;Zero&quot;.<br />
<br />
However if the status is matched then first go to session &quot;Match Approve Purchae Invoice&quot;, find your purchase invoice and unmatch the same. Then follow the process above for removing the invoice having status Registered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank u very much for your reply. One more question, the invoice was registered into the system in last year and the year has been finally closed. So will the system allow to do in the way u suggested?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfri</div><div class="date">13th March 2007, 09:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes It will allow. Reason being you are doing this change through the application and not back end so the system takes care of every thing.</div></div><hr />

This means the credit note that was created can be used to linked to a PO.<br />
<br />
Changing the registered invoice to $0 will not solve the whole problem. This was because the registered invoice will always be shown in session Match/Approve Purchase Invoice.<br />
<br />
To solve the problem, first unmatched the registered invoice from all PO.<br />
Then approve the registered invoice without linking to a PO. System will ask you for a ledger account. Insert the ledger account and approve the invoice.<br />
<br />
Then create a credit note with a credit note transaction type that allow the credit note to match to a PO. The amount of the credit note is similar to the registered invoice. Similar to the invoice, approve the credit note without linking to a PO. System will ask you for a ledger account. Insert the same ledger account you used when you approved the registered invoice.<br />
<br />
Lastly, use a linking transaction type to link the approved invoice to the approve credit note in order to zero out the balance.<br />
<br />
With this method, the original invoice will be zero out and it will not be shown in transaction Matched/Approved Purchase Invoice.</div></div><hr />

It will create an offsetting credit note and link the invoice making the balance zero.</div></div><hr />
