If yes, Is it provided by Basware or Infor ? Have anyone integrated baan 4 with Basware ?<br />
<br />
In LN we are using the ION webservices to communicate to Basware? But I would like to know if there is any connector &amp; does it have any benefits over ION integration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know, there is no standard connector available for Basware to connect with ERP LN.<br />
<br />
If Basware can support Web Services Technology (which I believe most of the softwares does), we can integrate LN - Basware successfully, either by using ION or Without ION.<br />
<br />
Do not hesitate to PM me or connect with me on LinkedIn, if you need more details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A bit late, but I have developed a Basware interface for BaanIV and LN, and have had it installed at several customers in Denmark - most of them running BaanIV, but also one LN installation, who after several years use decided to migrate to another invoice-workflow platform (while running LN 10.3).<br />
<br />
Currently most of my invoice-workflow activities (in LN) are concentrated around the Medius and Concur platforms.<br />
<br />
