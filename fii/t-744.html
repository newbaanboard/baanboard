<br />
in case of purchase receipts follwoing defalt steps are performed by system as defined in the &quot; maintain inventory and WIP transactions&quot; :-<br />
<br />
1. when goods received in stores: DR. stock<br />
                                                       CR. invoice to be received<br />
<br />
2. when invoice received in finance: DR. invoice received<br />
                                                         CR. supplier<br />
3. Automatic matching with stores receipt: DR invoice to be recd.<br />
                                                                    CR. invoice recd.<br />
<br />
But in certain cases, system has performed follwoing steps the reason of which may please be explained:-<br />
<br />
1. when goods received in stores: No entry in Finance inspite of inventory quantity and value going up with the receipt amount in Distribution Module.  <br />
<br />
2. when invoice received in Finance and matched with Stores <br />
receipt: : DR. Stock<br />
               CR. Supplier<br />
<br />
Although the net effect of the entries is same, it causes the differance in distribution and Finance inventory valuation against the entries for which the invoices have not been received till the date of valuation.<br />
Please expain the reason of the same.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

<br />
This is a general nature of Baan to withhold some entries, which may not have been posted correctly from distribution. As you have mentioned that Baan has corrected it when in finance you did matching. The problem is serious when all the entries from Distribution are not posted correctly to respective accounts. In some cases you may have to change tfacp200 for purchase invoices if entry at all is not coming in finance, you may be required to create records manually in distribution also.<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />
