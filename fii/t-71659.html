<br />
I would like to how system calculate qty at integration transactions for production order/completion?<br />
it is because, we have maintain production receipt with qty 3pcs but in integration transactions for production order/completion it shows 1.005pcs.<br />
And the cost posted is lesser than it supposed to post.<br />
<br />
Hope anyone can help me to understand further on this.<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
