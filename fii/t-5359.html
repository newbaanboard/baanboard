<br />
Can you check up in table tfgld102 and see lf the document is available there.<br />
<br />
Also tell me if there is a document number if tfgld018 for that batch.  You can search using index 2 which has Fiscal Year and Batch no.<br />
<br />
I presume you are using Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a problem which we are also facing even in some live companies.  Certain batches get into this stage.<br />
<br />
If you can give me the above information, I can try to give you the procedure of how this is to be corrected.  Also what is the status of the payment batch.<br />
