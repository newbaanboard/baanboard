<br />
Purchase invoices are not booked by integration. <br />
You can book them by EDI or manually. As far as I know, please correct me if I am wrong. <br />
<br />
<br />
In case of purchase invoices with matching to orders the general ledger accounts are given in the Financial supplier group. <br />
It's the first account: Control account and the account called: Invoice Receipt which is the counterpart to the GRINYA. <br />
<br />
GRINYA = goods received invoice not yet approved. <br />
INVOICE RECEIPT =  invoice received but goods not yet matched and approved. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps, <br />
bye, Juli</div></div><hr />

<br />
1st entry when u match would be the reversal of Invoices to be received a/c which u define in tdinv8150m000 for the combination of Purchase-Receipt<br />
the entry goes like this invoices to be received debit    Registered Invoices credit, this is the account which u define in Ledger Accounts by Supplier group (tfacp0111s000)for Invoice Receipts.<br />
<br />
After u approve the invoice which is part of matching and approving through Maintain Transactions Using ur TT P40 again the system reverses the Registered Invoices A/c<br />
and finally credits the Supplier Control A/c which u define in Ledger Accounts by Supplier group under Control Account.<br />

<br />
if 22202 is your account for the &quot;invoices received, but not approved&quot; then you have to insert in the field tfacp005.leac with the following kind of transaction &quot;10 invoice receipts&quot;. <br />
<br />
Session is tfacp0111s000.<br />
