<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milsykor</div><div class="date">3rd March 2004, 13:52</div></div><div class="posttext">We are faced with following situation in Finance :<br />
<br />
These documents are for one customer XXX:     <br />
                                                       FC                            HC<br />
XXX 20030001 	 USD 	-75 515,80	-72 036,03<br />
X01 20030001 	 USD 	 75,515.80                83 383,04<br />
X02 20030002 	 EUR 	-11 347,01	-11 347,01<br />
<br />
XXX is payment, FC - foreign currency and HC home currency.<br />
X01-02 are sales invoices.<br />
<br />
If we match this payment to the outstanding invoice the system will issue a currency adjustment of the difference between EUR 83.383,04 and -72.036,03 which is exactly the remaining EUR value of voucher X02 20030002. <br />
The payment vouchers (in this case XXX) will not allow matching of other currencies than the payment currency (in this case US$) - so anytime we invoice a customer in different currencies and he pays all together in one currency we have the problem.<br />
In this case we would match (voucher XXX 20030001) US$ 75.515,80/EUR 72.036,03.  On invoice X01 20030001 there would be no open value in US$ but a minus value in EUR which could then be matched with the invoice in EUR<br />
<br />
Do you any idea how to fix it ? (We dont want to see them in open entries)<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">7th April 2004, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Your example is not clear, for the US$ value of XXX is equal to the US$ value of sales invoice X01. However, I am assuming that the underlying problem here is that you receive payment from a customer in a single currency but the invoices  they are paying are in more than one currency.<br />
<br />
We have come across this before .<br />
<br />
Things to check;<br />
a) Check that your currencies are set up correctly from the generic unit tables through to the finance parameter tables.<br />
<br />
b) Are you using the appropriate transaction type?<br />
<br />
<br />
OK how to fix problem you have now: I cannot say this is an elegant solution<br />
Create a transaction that clears the remaining balance of the payment in the payment currency, your contra posting can be any account although it is likely you will choose a currency account in the P&amp;L. Now create a transaction that pays the invoice in the invoice currency and post the contra to the same account as the previous account.<br />
<br />
You will have cleared the unallocated payment and the invoice, there will also be a currency difference (based on the currency tables) in the contra account you used.<br />
<br />
Hope this is of help, P</div></div><hr />
