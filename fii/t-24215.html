<br />
Our accounting department would like to take a flat file from our Bank containing payments with a Baan invoice number, and apply the payment in Baan.<br />
<br />
I have looked around and I cannot find a standard Baan session to do this.<br />
<br />
I was wondering does anyone do this today in Baan IVc.<br />
<br />
I figure I have to create a customize session but can this be done safely.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

in your basic package TF you must normally find the menu &quot;mtfcmg2007m000' in this menu you have all the session needed to do that.<br />
<br />
If more information needed do not hesitate to reach me following this forum<br />

You will need to implement EBS. We are doing this for 4 years. All you need is to update tfcmg500, tfcmg502, tfcmg503 table and Baan will take care of from there. It is available in IVc3.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lakmisoftware</div><div class="date">8th July 2005, 20:18</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use EBS module to import the file and it will update the tfcmg tables related to EBS. Usually your bank file consists of header and detail. If you have a unique identifier in the file for detail line. Then in the master data session of EBS you can configure the field values with field length.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">13th August 2010, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">So If I could take an xml or csv file, use EBS in import it into Baan, Baan will reconcile the checks? Right now accounting once a month has to manually look at each cleared check and then update it in baan. Before, with the old bank that we used, we had a file that was somehow sucked into Baan and it was taken care of automatically. <br />
<br />
Any ideas? Newbie here so bear with me on this. Trying to understand the process. <br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
