<br />
We have a situation where we have applied a payment against a invoice but a few dats later find out this is incorrect. Instead of reversing this through a credit note we would like to know is there a function where we can journal the receipt to the correct client.<br />
<br />
Thank</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is reverse entry (like an undo) using tfgld1295m000 that may work.<br />
or <br />
you can do a negative cash appication.  Just like you are applying cash to the customer invoice just do it with a negative amount.  The system may warn you that the invoice is fully paid but you can ignore that.  As soon as you process it the invoice balance will return.  You can then apply the same cash amount to the correct invoice.  Note the transaction type used for cash application must allow negatives.</div></div><hr />

And when you receive actual payment for the wronged invoice, you may change the details accordingly, keeping the same document.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dont you think this is loss control. any one can open the fully paid invoice whenever require...<br />
Is there is anyway out to permanently close the invoice once it is fully paid?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan doesnt allow journals to be posted to supplier or customer accounts. So either back out the wrong transaction by using debit/credit note and create the whole transaction again or use table maintenance to remove the wrong record.<br />
<br />
To remove fully paid invoices is a part of Archiving. And normally Archiving is done as per the company policy and also the data load on the tables.<br />
