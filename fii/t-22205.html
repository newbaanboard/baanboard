<br />
    We have a situation where we have to pay a minimum deposit(advance payment) to purchase goods before even the goods have been delivered to us. How do we handle this in baan 5c? What are the areas affected, Logistic and finance or finance only?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">16th November 2004, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is just financial as there is no logistical activity until later on.<br />
<br />
This would indicate posting an advance/unallocated payment to the supplier account.<br />
<br />
However the exact method may be affected by how the order for the goods been raised? Is it through Baan and if so is it a stock item, or a cost item?</div></div><hr />
