<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">petey1</div><div class="date">29th March 2012, 22:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We need to invoice per load, not shipment, and was wondering if anyone out there has attempted an action.  The idea is this would create one invoice for the load that we can give both the freight forwarder and the country that we're dealing with.  We cant do shipments because our workers would be processing other shipments as the previous load is put into the container.  I wanted to give them a session where they enter the load and it produces a standard invoice.<br />

thanks in advance for any advice.</div></div><hr />
