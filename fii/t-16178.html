I need to use financial statements to show consolidated information between two companies. The companies have the same ledger account and the same fiscal periods. But, the consolidated company has another fiscal period.<br />
For example, the financial companies have fiscal period since December to November, and the consolidated company has a fiscal period since january to december. Then, the information is the same in some months, but not in November and December, because of the close of the year (profit and loss financial statements)<br />
<br />
Please, advice...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

references , u should be able to cater to such consolidation . Period <br />
shift correction takes care of year change (in case of Nov/Dec).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TonyAubuchon</div><div class="date">6th August 2004, 03:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option is to create columns for both fiscal years in the subsidiary companies and put in the fiscal periods that pertain to each fiscal year (example: 2003 7 to 12 and 2004 1 to 6 to get a full year's worth of data.  The next step would be to create a third column that will add the first two together.  The last step would be to define the layout code to only print the third column.  This in effect gives you the ability to cross fiscal years on the report and report the information that the parent company needs.<br />
<br />
If you think of it in the context of an Excel spreadsheet, you have created a couple of &quot;hidden&quot; columns and are printing the calculated numbers only.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.<br />
