<br />
<br />
We are importing sales invoices and credit notes using exchange, but have come across a problem regarding credit notes.  Both are using unique transaction types S01 and S02, defined as sales invoices, and credit notes, respectively.  <br />
<br />
Sales invoices have been setup with the original invoice number, thus no need for the baan document numbers.  No problem importing sales invoices.  Credit notes however, have been setup with document numbers.  Upon importing they are populating tables tfacr400 and 401.  <br />
<br />
When we post the invoices, am getting error message <br />
&quot;Statement  Layout not found&quot;.  Any clues why this could be occuring?</div></div><hr />
