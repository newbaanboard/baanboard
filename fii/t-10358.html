<br />
We use pcs projects for registering the repair of goods from our customers. Using sales orders with the project for collecting and delivering, and production orders for repairing the goods. Invoicing the sales orders is done with amount of zero.<br />
<br />
All this, sales and production and pcs project, will result in integration transactions for finance. One of them will be the work in process, which should be zero when all activities have been done. However when checking work in process using session tfgld5400m000 for pcs projects, a lot of results will be shown for projects which already have been delivered back to the customer.<br />
<br />
Could anyone help me with the following:<br />
- which integration transactions are generated on which moment regarding work in process?<br />
- if there is no stock left for the customized item, how can there be work in process?<br />
- if production is completed, there is still work in process?<br />
- some projects show a result of Â€ 0.01, how can this be set to 0?<br />
<br />
Our ledger account shows a too high amount for wip, so i'm urgently looking for an explanation. Thanks.<br />

<br />
Can you please tell me if your parameters are set for Estimated or Actual costing?  There are different transactions that occur depending on this setting.<br />
<br />
One thing to bear in mind in either situation:  if labor or material has been charged to the top level project (via a PCS/Operation Cost or PCS/General Cost or Purchase/General Cost integration), rather than being charged to a production order related to the project, then this time and/or material will sit in Work In Process until the project is closed.  This is true even if all goods have been delivered and invoiced.  The key is that the project must be closed.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Parameter is set to estimated. All material cost and labor cost are filled from production using backflushing. Some projects are not closed yet.<br />
<br />
All sales orders, delivery and returns, have been invoiced. Production order is closed too, so I do not expect any WIP?<br />
<br />
With best regards,<br />

It is not so easy to tell you in a few words what triggers the WIP transactions. There are paremeters and so on. You should consult somebody and take a few days to look deeper in the problem. I tell you this because I am a consultant for Finance Baan and know that it isn't so easy as it likes.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a consultancy Baan partner you can always try our Company (CSC Computer Sciences), in the Netherlands you can ask for me Ronald van Beek). <br />
<br />
Wish you succes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Klaas, what generally generates WIP reducing transcations is the &quot;calculate project costs&quot; session (don't remember the session number right now). It is important to understand that in some situations - depending on the parameters - the WIP is not cleared when all the goods of a project are sold. E.G. you can have costs like surcharges that are by project and not by item. The WIP will then be cleared if you *close* the project, so closing projects is absolutely essential! If you close a project, &quot;calculate project costs&quot; will run in the background, but with the adjusted parameter that it's now running for a to-close project, and it will behave differently trying to book out everything that is still in WIP. If your WIP is still unequal to zero after closing a project, you are likely to have an error in your integration table setup.<br />
