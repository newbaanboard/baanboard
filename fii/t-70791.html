<br />
In session tfcmg2103s000 (Reconciliation of Receipts/Payments), when trying to change “Payment Document Status” from “Open” to “Complete” it is not even allowing us to place the cursor. <br />
I have already checked in table tfcmg100, tfcmg111, tfcmg112, tfcmg113, tfacp200.in all tables document status and amounts are updated correctly.<br />
but earlier this document is reconciled and then reverted to open. does it cause the error? if yes in which table do we have to correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
Raghava.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Above issue is resolved now. To solve this issue, we had only one possibility we have removed previous reconciliation documents (completed and rejected entries from tfgld106,tfacp200 Net impact is Zero) for this advance anticipated document.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
Raghava.</div></div><hr />
