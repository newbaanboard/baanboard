<br />
In Baan IV , I have some problem to register an unallocated payment from a parent customer , and to match it to  a child invoice  ; <br />
<br />
I was thiniking it was possible,  when at the client level session we link a finance parent - <br />
<br />
but when I try to match the unallocated receipt , no child invoices appears <br />
<br />
<br />
If anybody has an opinion on that point , thanks a lot <br />
<br />

For example we have customised our &quot;Customer Statements&quot; and &quot;Reminder letters&quot; in such a way that when you give the parent code, the child info also gets printed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check that you are using the correct transaction type with the right combination of &quot;Main session and Next session&quot; in the transaction type.<br />

ERPLN looks at it as nothing was paid against the child.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
