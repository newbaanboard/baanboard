<br />
The user already prints report of Group depreciation results in tffas2401m000. After print and checked, there are few records that the Brought Forward Accumulated Depn from June 2005 are not tally with amount in Accumulated Depn As At Last Year in July 05. Hence, the amount are not tally in the Finance GL Account.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Fixed Assets Group: OE<br />
FA Code: OE2004262<br />
Accu Depn for June 05: 37.13<br />
Accu Depn As At Last Year in July 05: 38.93<br />
Diff: (1.80)<br />
<br />
The amount in Accu Depn As At Last Year in July 05 should be the same as the amount in Accu Depn for June 05 coz the amount is a brought forward value.<br />
<br />
What should I do?<br />
Which table I need to look for to do the amendment?<br />
Please advise.<br />
Any idea or suggestions are very much appreciated.<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
