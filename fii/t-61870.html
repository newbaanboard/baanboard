<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katiekelley</div><div class="date">2nd February 2012, 15:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Everyone,  What is the best way you have found in 4c4 to issue sales order in company 100 and have it create the AP in company 200 based on receipts?  This was one company and due to location change (1 is now in Mexico)for part required 2 finance companies that are different legal entities and a buy sell between them.  Would an EDI or some kind of intercompany business partner work best if accounts are setup to offset instead of cash? <br />
Thanks <br />
