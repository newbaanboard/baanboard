<br />
BaaN Iv c4.<br />
We are nearing the year end and  are facing problem regarding lots of difference between the Inventory valuation and the Finance Ledger for each month end (31st to be exact). <br />
<br />
What could be the reason for this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Most important is the mapping issues.  What is the basis of your inventory mapping.  Check if you have debited/credited the right inventory accounts for the right item group/financial supplier group/cost price component/warehouse.  For example, we have mapped based upon the combination of warehouse &amp; item group.  Item group 80 is semi-finished goods, item 40 is Finished goods and the rest raw material.  Hence we have mapped the respective inventory accounts for the respective group.<br />
<br />
If the items are created under the wrong item groups or wrong items are issued from wrong warehouses, the finance entries go to wrong accounts and the inventory figures shown in inventory report may not tally with the GL.<br />
