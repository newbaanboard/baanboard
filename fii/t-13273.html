<br />
We are using cash management for customer receipts with the step for anticipated. If a receipt is processed in July 2003 (for eg.,) and after that if a transaction batch is opened in June 2003 for reconciliation, the system allows this receipt made in July 2003 to be reconciled in June 2003 batch. This has been creating problems in finding the anticipated as of a particular month. Is there a way so that the system stops or gives a message while reconciling if the reconciliation batch date is earlier than an anticipated receipt date.<br />

Please help!!!<br />
