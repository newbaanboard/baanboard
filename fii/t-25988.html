this error is typically forced by the following situation:<br />
The ledger account xxx.xxxx has set Dimension 2 as mandatory in the chart of accounts. In Integration the system is not able to match a value for Dimension 2 depending on your setup in options by integration element.<br />
So check the integration option in the Sales Invoice against the setup in options by integration element and Integration Relations by Elements.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

The problem being occured on 3 sales orders with same item code. However this is not a newly create item.I had tried to use tfcor1218m000(Generate missing addition to intergration transaction) to recover the error but it doesn't work.  Please advise.</div></div><hr />
