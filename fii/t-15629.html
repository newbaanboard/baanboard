<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">10th June 2004, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I am slightly confused on this financially.<br />
<br />
Situation:<br />
<br />
Project A <br />
Cust. Item A (various material and labour to WIP totalling 100 bucks)<br />
<br />
Project B<br />
Needs item that is Cust item A<br />
<br />
Solution:  Do a PRP Warehouse Project to Project Trans<br />
<br />
From my understanding: Inventory and Costs are transferred to the other project.<br />
<br />
What is happening:  <br />
<br />
When I transferred it, I would assume that the PRP Warehouse transaction that would Debit WIP and credit a clearing account.  However, it creates a PRP Warehouse Revenue transaction for 0 dollars.  The target project has a PRP Warehouse Material Cost transaction for 0 dollars.<br />
<br />
I rolled costs on Project A. <br />
<br />
It debits COGS for 100 bucks and credits WIP. Which seems ok because it is going out of WIP to the other project.  <br />
<br />
Currently, there is 100 bucks sitting in WIP.<br />
<br />
But when I close the project, it moves the WIP back to COGS.<br />
<br />
Nothing happens to the target project.  It has a SO with a separate item that has been shipped and invoiced (the transferred item was in the BOM).<br />
<br />
Problem 1:  Why is the PRP revenue transaction at 0 dollars?<br />
<br />
Problem 2:  Am I wrong in assuming that with a PRP warehouse transaction, the costs would move too?<br />
<br />
We have patches up to Feb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan user</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the costprice of the items transferred via PRP warehouse order?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isabouri</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure that the &quot;Transfer between TI projects based on Cost prices&quot; is set to yes in PCS parameters (tipcs0100m000)<br />
<br />
If it is set to no it will use the warehouse price (which you will find on your PRP transfer session) for the transfer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't know about that parameter and how it works with the cost prices.  I am assuming that this is the &quot;Actual costs&quot; on the customized item?<br />
<br />
i am going to check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I have verified that the parameter is yes.  I have recalc'd the projects and the source project has a cost price of 100 bucks and the target project has a cost price of 0 dollars still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isabouri</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Was it yes all along or did you change it to yes?<br />
<br />
If it was no at the moment of transfer, there is nothing you can do about this transaction but going forward you should be OK.<br />
<br />
Give it a shot in your test environment, you should see that it works<br />
<br />
Revenue 100$ in transfer from project<br />
Material cost 100$ in transfer to project</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 23:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried it in my standard test env, but I keep getting an error &quot;invoice data for Invoice X cannot be written to finance&quot;.  The environment's data is messed, so I have to sift through that first.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip.  I'll probably be coming back to this soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">15th June 2004, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I got it to work, but only after first closed the production order on the source project and calculated cost price by project with Project Revenue expected set to 0.<br />
<br />
It will transfer at 0 if a) the revenue expected flag is set to yes and sales order is not delivered, which is the case with many items.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug?</div></div><hr />
