Basically the Recon.Grps are meant to give detailed information/comparison on logistical movements and financial transactions. Therefore the whole integration is split into groups (Recon.Grps). Taking Group Inventory/1 is meant to get all informations for inventory transactions from both views (Financial and Logistical). It is essential to use the Recon Elements (5 is the most one can use per grp) to give you even more informations (here I should think typical Elements would be WH, Item Group, Valuation Grp). These Elements should be setup BEFORE you go live (though the elements can be changed afterwards - of course time consuming). <br />
<br />
If you do setup all the available groups that you need (not all are always needed) then you have got a very good start into LN Finance. Be aware that Reconciliation is the bulk of reporting, compared to prior versions Triton, IV and V many reports have changed or vanished.<br />

When you making Purchase Order with the PO lines included cost item. The cost item will be printed in PO Invoice as well. Is there anyway to not included in the PO invoice. I am trying to make a way so the import item can be traced back for its landed cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">22nd May 2008, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Indrabata,<br />
<br />
there is no way of excluding the cost item from the PO Invoice, this would need a customization.<br />
