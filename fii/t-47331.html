<br />
in our Baan IVc4 we set up in Tax codes by Country <br />
Amounts to be posted = Net, rate=14%.<br />
<br />
When I enter an invoice with amount 100,- (to be net) it calculates 12,28 tax amount and in the second form (where to enter the ledger account) there is entered a net-amount by default of 100-12,28.<br />
<br />
I expected to have 14 tax amount and 100 (net) on the account.<br />
<br />
Where is my mistake, please?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess you are referring to a purchase invoice in tfacp1110s000.<br />
In that session the amount which you are entering is always a gross amount.<br />
<br />
gross.amount = nett.amount + vat.amount + late.payment.amount<br />
<br />
So in this session (and the sales counterpart session), an exception is made that not the tax code determines how the amount has to be interpreted. Because by definition in tfacp1110s000 the header amount is a gross amount, one could argue that only gross tax codes can be used. However, this apparently was a too big restriction, and would force users to create 2 tax country/code combinations if they normally only use the nett variant. <br />
<br />
This way of working of tfacp1110s000 works perfectly in a country where the invoice is leading in the VAT calculation. But for example in the US the user himself is responsible for the correct VAT calculation and sometime gets a purchase invoice without any tax. In that scenario the user does not know beforehand the gross amount and has to use the following workaround.<br />
1) Use on the invoice always the tax calculation on line level.<br />
2) Leave initially the invoice amount as zero.<br />
3) Enter all lines in tfacp112s000.<br />
4) When getting back in tfacp1110s000 the system informs the user about the amount with which the invoice is unbalanced.<br />
5) Enter this amount on the invoice header.<br />
<br />
There is a requirement that the user should be able to user nett amounts in tfacp1110s000, but that is still not handled.<br />
<br />
