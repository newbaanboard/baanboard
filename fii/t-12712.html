<br />
Someone created unallocated receipt transaction in the system and then he noticed that bank account is not correct, He deleted this transaction before finalization. He wants to create new unallocated receipt transaction with same sales invoice in the same batch. But, sales invoice does not appear for this customer. Because, invoice  already assign old unallocated receipt transactions in tfacr200. How can I get back the old transaction in tfacp200.How to solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You describe a bad situation.<br />
<br />
It sounds to me that after making the unallocated receipt transaction this transaction was linked to the specific invoice.<br />
<br />
The result of that transaction is a posting in tfgld102 and tfacr200. The sales invoice is not longer open.<br />
<br />
It is not possible to delete an unallocated receipt is this receipt is already assigned to an invoice. Before deleting the invoice the assignment transaction should be deleted. If the assignment transaction was deleted the invoice becomes back open.<br />
<br />
I think that the following happens. The unallocated receipt is deleted which was not blocked by the system for reason of the existing assignment with an invoice. The software is maybe not up to date and that can be the reason why this happens.<br />
<br />
Now the unallocated receipt is removed but the assignment transaction is still available in the tables tfgld102, tfacr200 and tfgld018.<br />
<br />
You can only solve this situation by table maintenance and you can only do this if you have enough experience in this work. <br />
<br />
Maybe the solution is to log a case to the baan support centre and a support analyst is able to remove the mess.<br />
<br />

I think that you are right,We still use old version and can be the reason why this happens.<br />
Thanks for your help.I will open the case to the Baan Support centre.<br />

<br />
This has everything to do with the sessions tfcmg2105s000 and tfcmg2106s000. In the past years these sessions are maintained several times. After each bug fix a new bug popped up. There are lots of dependencies and at the moment of maintaining one of these sessions you must exactly know what you are doing. <br />
<br />
Currently the sessions are more or less stable and therefore it is important that you are working with up to date software.<br />
