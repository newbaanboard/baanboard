<br />
When material is issued on a production order the system generates the following entry<br />
<br />
Combination of Production and Issue<br />
<br />
DR Work in Progress<br />
CR Inventory<br />
<br />
When material is issued on a project related production order the system generates following entries<br />
<br />
Combination of Production and Transfer<br />
<br />
DR Inventory (Negative Amount)<br />
CR Project Delivery Interim Account (Negative Amount)<br />
<br />
Combination of Production (SFC) and Material Cost<br />
<br />
DR Work in Progress<br />
CR Project Delivery Interim Account<br />
<br />
What is the logic behind these entries? Also, I don't understand why system is generating entries with negative amounts for certain combination of transaction origin and financial transaction.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate if someone can throw light on this issue.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

To avoid the creation of negative debits and negative credits you must set the field Negative Amounts Allowed in the Maintain Transaction Types to &quot;No&quot;.  This will then turn negative debits into positive credits, and negative credits into positive debits.  This should be set this way for all integration transaction types.</div></div><hr />
