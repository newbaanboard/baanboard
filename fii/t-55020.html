<br />
We have no issue to create sales order and invoicing for manufactured items.<br />
 <br />
Our company has formed a new project department to cater for project activities assigned by our parent company.  In order to monitor project activities by project department, my company asked IT department to come out with solutions on how to bill any services done by the new department.<br />
<br />
One of the requirement of project department is to invoice our customer by progress basis. e.g 1st payment = 10%, 2nd payment = 30%, and final payment is 60%.  We also need to include retention amount about 10% of our project cost.<br />
<br />
Here, i would like to seek advise from  expert on how our ERPln can help us to provide solutions to cater requirement by our company.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your solutions and advise.</div></div><hr />
