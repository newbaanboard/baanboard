<br />
There is a session tfgld1406m000:(Print Finalized Transactions By Ledger Account) in General Ledger Menu ---&gt; Month End Closing --&gt;<br />
<br />
And there is a ledger account xxxxx-00 (Unit Price Variance) in Finance. <br />
<br />
In this Report when I selected this ledger account, I see the <br />
<br />
Period / Document Invoice No / Document Date Dimension/Ref Supplier/Currency/Amount/Amount (Debit) and Amount(Credit)<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The Document Invoice No are not unique(its the number from the batch).<br />
Is there any way to identify the original document.<br />
The purpose is to trace the actual amount for each document.<br />
With this report, its hard to find the actual invoice (I guess!!!!!!)<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Can anyone give me idea how unit price variance account is created in the system ? (I guess by non-matching payment) and is there any way to trace back the actual document, actual amount, actual quantity by suppliers for each of the document?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance guys.  <br />
<br />
Actually the Finance Module in Baan IV (Account Payable, Account Receivable,General Ledger , Financial Statement, Financial Budget, Fixed Asset, Cash Management)<br />
are confusing for me (I don't have strong Account Background).<br />
<br />
It is a great help for me is anyone can give me some idea.<br />
<br />
Thanks. Have a nice day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">30th March 2005, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">we also have this problem from time to time, particularly with our auditors at year end.<br />
<br />
This is not easy in my experience and if any one knows a smarter way please let me know, but you also need to look at the integration displays/reports.<br />
<br />
Neither display or report will give you exactly what you want but there is enough information, such as purchase order number, to track down the required original document. Reports can take a long time so choose display if you can and leave reports for long listings.<br />
With the purchase order number you should be able to identify the difference and invoice from report tfacp1430m000 (accounts payable/transactions/reports)<br />
<br />
As I say it's a bit messy and awkward but its the only way we have found so far.<br />
<br />
<br />
With regard to how the transaction is created:<br />
If there is a difference the transaction is created at the time of matching the invoice to the order. The settings should be within the integration parameters.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
