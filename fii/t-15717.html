What happens if we remove that step from the order type (would that change anything financially or prevent us from something?)  I have been having difficulty finding out what that specifically does in the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">19th June 2004, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">This step can be removed since it has got no affect on finance at all. It is often used to have a &quot;final step&quot; before orders are processed and written to order history. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">20th June 2004, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">It true that removing Print PO Invoice would have no effect financially but by removing it, you would no longer be able to change prices after PO receipts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">20th June 2004, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">but only if POÂ´s are processed, not just because the step is missing...<br />

<br />
Thank you for your responses.<br />
<br />
Kaibou can you explain your last comment in a little more detail?  Are you saying that if you do not have Print Purchase Invoices as an order step you can still change prices on PO lines after PO receipts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">27th October 2005, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">This project was placed on the back burner for a while, but now i'm nearly complete.  I've found that as long as the Process Delivered Purchase Order session has not run, the users are able to use the Maintain Prices/Discounts After Maintain Receipts to change prices.  <br />
<br />
What I've done is create a session that looks for PO receipt lines with:<br />
tdpur045.spur = 9 (ready for process delivered purchase orders or at deleting line) <br />
tdpur045.stsd = 3 (AP has matched and approved the line) <br />
tdpur045.pmsk like '%y%' (so that it excludes lines already processed by process delivered purchase orders)<br />
and then use AFS to selectively process delivered purchase orders only for those PO's.<br />
<br />
Now all we have to do is create the new order types (removing the Print Purchase Invoice step) and start using them.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all of your help.</div></div><hr />

The only built in way to do it would be through table field authorization<br />
