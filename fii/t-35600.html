<br />
We want to implement transfer pricing between departments, but the trasnfer price will be different from the cost price. This is to create a profit oriented company structure. We think about Single Finance / Mulit Logisitc, and having a supplier / customer relationship between the departments. The problem with this solution is that it has a lot of doublle handling, and without yet testing this solution, there will be a need of making internal PO, Internal Invoice, Matching internal PO, Closing POInvoice (because no payment is done), closing internal Sales Invoices... sounds combersome, <br />
==&gt; does any one have an idea if Baan has a good way to do this? Does<br />
==&gt; does anyone do trasnferpricing between departments, if so how?<br />
<br />
any help will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
Immanuel</div></div><hr />

Single Finance/Multi Logistics.  You are correct it does create a lot of double handling with purchase orders to, sales invoices back, and purchase invoice matching between the two companies.  I'm interested in knowing if anybody does this in ERP LN and uses the Goods Transfer Relationships to achieve transfer pricing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how do you close the issue with the payment? <br />
You wrote that you match the invoice, and after that how you close the invoice, to take it out of Open Entiries?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
