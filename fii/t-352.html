<br />
When matching invoice with purchase orders, we get old &quot;completely matched&quot; invoice onto the list also, i have looked in table tdpur045 and found field tdpur045.stsd, which is different for those records in question. <br />
<br />
I tried to change one from &quot;matched&quot; to &quot;All approved&quot;, and it dissapeared as it should, but this is my question: <br />
<br />
Is it alright to change the status from &quot;matched&quot; to &quot;all approved&quot; ???? <br />
<br />
When does field tdpur045.stsd change from &quot;Matched&quot; to &quot;ALL approved&quot;???? <br />
<br />
It doesn't change anything anywhere or does it??????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan user</div><div class="date">2nd November 2001, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to make a distinction between matched and approved and all approved. The status matched means that you have matched the orderline amount with the invoice. Even when the amounts are not equal, the status of the invoice is matched. In other words matched doesnÂ´t mean that the amounts are equal, but tells you only that the invoice amount is compared with the orderline amount. When the status is matched, you cannot change prices &amp; discounts in the order. Approved means, that the orderline is matched with the invoice and the difference between the amounts ( zero difference or certain difference below the allowed price differences) is approved. The invoice is now ready to be processed and paid. The status all aproved means that the entire order is matched with the invoice and difference in amount (again zero difference or certain difference below the allowed price differences) and the invoice is ready to be processed</div></div><hr />
