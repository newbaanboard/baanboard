<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpchheda</div><div class="date">13th February 2014, 06:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, We are importing Sales Invoice from script in tfacr400/401. Then we are posting it to non finalized. This process we are following since past 6-8 months and it was working fine. <br />
But when this month I have imported around 2000 invoicing, they got placed in tfacr400/401, but when using session tfacr4411m000, a batch is created, showing all the invoices in tfacr400, for that particular month. A copy of file.txt is attached herewith for reference. But when I tried printing the batch result from session tfgld1401m000, almost half of the invoices are not found in that batch. when i look batch in session maintain sales invoice, the status of that invoices are &quot;Printed&quot;.<br />
Further more I tried to post that invoices - one-by-one, separate, it again created a batch no., but then no invoices in that batch.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest the reason for the same.<br />
<br />
I am still on BaanIV C4, with SQL 2008.</div></div><hr />
