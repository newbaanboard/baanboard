<br />
Does anybody have documentation on how to set up and use the BAAN IV Service - Vertex integration?<br />
This is an implementation of b40_c4 Service in the Midwest.<br />
Please also let me know how your experiences are with this integration and if there are still people out there we can get to help us out if need be.<br />
Thanks a lot for your help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Baan does have an installation guide available from the knowledge base.<br />
<br />
To calculate tax on a service invoice the customer has to be set up as taxable and the items issued must have a tax code. The key to the correct taxability is to map items or item groups to a Vertex product category. This is done in the Maintain Product Tax Category Matrix. The important step is to ensure that the Vertex TDM is complete.<br />
<br />
I have found a couple of problems with the service module. First cost items may not tax correctly because you cannot specify a warehouse. This can cause jurisdiction issues, particular in Texas which is an origin state.<br />
<br />
Also had a problem with New Mexico. Confirmed with Vertex that this was an issue with issolated to Vertex 1.3 and is fixed in the 2.0 version.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have any more questions</div></div><hr />
