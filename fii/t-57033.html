I thought Calc Currency Differences was used to revalue the home currency and Exchange Gain or Loss was to revalue the additional currencies, which it does but depending on the currency you enter the transaction in, Calc Currency Diff will revalue either.  Why would you ever use Exchange Gain or Loss then?</div></div><hr />
