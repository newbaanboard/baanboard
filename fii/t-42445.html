<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hdquestions</div><div class="date">2nd October 2007, 20:43</div></div><div class="posttext">We are making more and more wire transfers and direct payments to our suppliers. At the moment, we process and print a cheque and then cash the cheque manually once the bank has approved the transfer. Is there a way to skip all that and just having a paper print out to be signed and then go match the payment of the invoices paid? <br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimbacon44</div><div class="date">3rd October 2007, 04:05</div></div><div class="posttext">you should be able to set up a new payment method, ie wire, print out the remitance advice and send to your bank,  You will not use anticipated payments on this, since you want to credit cash immediately.  You will have to set up the information for each supplier for the bank to be remitted to and their account number.</div></div><hr />

By using this, you may enter minimum details to close open entries after receiving confirmation from bank/business partner.</div></div><hr />

Any additional information you may have would be greatly appreciated. We are unfamiliar with the BAAN cash management module.<br />
