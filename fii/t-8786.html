Currently in our environment, all 5 dimensions are active in the group company parameters, however in Maintain Dimensions, only the first 3 have values.  With this setup, the system allows the user to put in the first 3 dimensions, but does not allow access to the 4th or 5th.  <br />
<br />
We have been using this setup for years, but now we want to open up the 4th dimension for use.   I just have to add a dimension code for dimension 4 in Maintain Dimensions, but I first wanted to know if anyone has tried this.<br />
<br />
Does it affect the history?  Are there special rebuilds that must be run?<br />
<br />
As an added bonus, we have 3 different group companies, but the 4th dimension will only be used in one.   Does anyone know if this will fly?  Or do the other group companies have to follow suit.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

I've been dealing with your dilemma too. In fact the use of one new dimension did not require any rebuild. <br />
It will be named in all companies that belong to the group where you named it, but no &quot;damage was done&quot;.<br />
Dont forget to define which accounts will use it.<br />

You can enable a new dimension, but you got to note couple of points here:<br />
<br />
1. Your existing dimension history will still remain same.<br />
2. However, I beleive there are some correction sessions which you can get from Baan which would even correct the existing history.<br />
<br />
More importantly, this change will be affected for the group company to which the financial company belongs to.<br />
<br />
If you have multiple group companies, then this change will NOT reflect in other group companies. Because, regarding multi-site implementation, the only rule of the game is with in the group company, all the financial companies should have same number of dimensions.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps/<br />

<br />
It is not enough if you just maintain new dimensions.  You have to specify the usage of the same, in chart of accounts also.  So far you were not using the 4th &amp; 5th dimensions.  Hence, the usage of the same must have been specified as &quot;not used&quot; in all accounts, I suppose.  Now, if you want to open the new dimensions for use, you have to set the flag for these dimensions to either &quot;optional&quot; or &quot;mandatory&quot; in the respective chart of accounts.  <br />
<br />
You can set it to &quot;mandatory&quot; for a ledger account only if no history presents for that account.  Otherwise, the system does not allow you to do that, because the earlier transaction would have already been recorded without this new dimension.  In that case, the only option available to you is to determine the 4th &amp; 5th dimensions for each of the history transactions in the respective ledger accounts, and input the dimensions for those transactions through GTM (may be, some baan program must be available for this... check out with BaaN.)<br />
<br />
However, if u want to set it &quot;optional&quot;, you can go ahead and do it without any hassles.<br />
<br />
This new setting does not affect the other groups.  But within the same group, it depends whether you have shared the chart of accounts and dimension tables across the companies or not.  If you have shared the same, this will affect all the companies within the same group.  If you have not shared, it will not.<br />
<br />
You can check the sharing status of these tables tfgld008 &amp; tfgld010 in session &quot;Display logical tables&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help you<br />
All the best</div></div><hr />

<br />
        We are about to change an existing Dimension and adding a new one , the questions we have are:<br />
<br />
1. Will it affect the history?<br />
2. We will need to rebuild?<br />
3. Will we need to apply some correction sessions?<br />
<br />
       And also is it possible /advisable to change an existing dimesinon?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Coming to ur specific query.<br />
<br />
1. Will it affect the history?<br />
          - Past history will remain as it is . Future will work as per transactions user enters.<br />
<br />
2. We will need to rebuild?<br />
          - Not required<br />
3. Will we need to apply some correction sessions?<br />
           - There are not Baan program to the best of my knowledge. U may need to write one if u plan to override Baan logic.</div></div><hr />
