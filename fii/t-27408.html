<br />
I print out all the bank accounts to do reconciliation every month. <br />
After year end processing, I found that all the other currencies bank account untally.  These is because of the GL revaluation done for last year December based on a document on this revaluation from the printout of Finalized Transaction by Ledger Account. <br />
<br />
The GL revaluation is done using &quot;normal JV&quot; transaction type.<br />
If this revaluation is not performed then the amount in the Finalized Transaction report is tally with my bank statement.<br />
<br />
 <br />
The GL revaluation for year 2005 will also affect my current financial year (2006). Please advice how to tally it with our Bank statement? What steps need to do.</div></div><hr />
