<br />
When we activate a mapping scheme, it takes about 8-10 minutes to activate.  Does this seem long to anyone?  Or is that what we can expect?  It is a test server, but other sessions and processes seem to run with adequate performance.  We are testing LN Fp3.  We have solution 220606 installed.  I would just like to know if anyone else out there testing with FP3 has the same issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I have seen this myself in FP1 on a test server.  When we went to production server the time improved to about 1-2 minutes to activate.    The activation hits a number of tables.</div></div><hr />

It is also partly dependent on how many integration document types are used, as well as number of ledger accounts and dimensions getting mapped.</div></div><hr />
