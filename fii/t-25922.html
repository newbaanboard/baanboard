We want to change the method of booking PCS cogs and revenue.<br />
Up untill now, we only post when closing the PCS project, but now we want to change that, so we post every time delivery has been made.<br />
<br />
We tried to change the field that controls this (on form 2 on the pcs project), but we dont seem to get any postings on existing projects with old deliveries when running tipcs3250m000.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what controls this area, or does anyone have suggestions on what to try?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
