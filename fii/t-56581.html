<br />
First thing you need to check is that all the latest patches are loaded into the system.<br />
<br />
For reconciliation:<br />
1. Check in the integration transactions, whether the Inventory accounts are used in other reconciliation group apart from Inventory.<br />
2. Antedating transactions need to checked.<br />
3. Once the above two steps are done, then you can try reconciling the inventory integration transactions(present in warehousing package) with Integration transactions.<br />
<br />
If all the above steps are executed, then i am sure that you will get the reconciliation done.<br />

<br />
First check if the Inventory Ledger account is blocked for all manual transactions. If not, then there is a possibility that some non-integrated transactions could have gone into the GLD finalised tables which are not reflected in the sub-ledger (meaning Inventory valuation).<br />
<br />
We had a few cases like this.<br />

<br />
Is the integration setup properly done to show the changes in inventory?</div></div><hr />

you have to look into your mapping scheme setting, based on my experienced your problem is only caused by wrong mapping scheme setting. You must understand how to set mapping scheme for inventory transactions in ERP LN. after you modified, you can remap and post again to get the correct amount in TB/GL.<br />

<br />
1) first review your inventory a/c, make sure no manual journal included.<br />
2) check your mapping scheme. Inventory a/c is not used for other integration document.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help.<br />
<br />
Good day,<br />
