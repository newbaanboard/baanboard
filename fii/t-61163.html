We are trying to clamp down the security of the file that is being uploaded so the users do not have the ability to manipulate the file prior to the upload.  <br />
<br />
The problem is that the user has to have write permissions to create the file.  And the upload process is basically a Windows file selector.  So the user must also have the drive mapped to the file's location.<br />
<br />
How do other companies handle this part of the process and the security?</div></div><hr />
