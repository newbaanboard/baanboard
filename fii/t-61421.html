<br />
I have a problem with batch that is in status 6(finalized) and finalization run status 4(finalized succesfully)in tfgld100. It has 2 documents out of which one got moved to tfgld106, status 'Finalized in tfgld101 &amp; posted to finance. Another document is still in tfgld102 with status 'Ready' in tfgld101<br />
<br />
If there was only one document i could have re-set the batch status to finalize it again. but one document posted &amp; other got stuck in tfgld102 in same batch under same Run number which are finalized.<br />
<br />
Can you please help me how to resolve this situation? in B4c3</div></div><hr />

You should first try for restart finalization. If it dosnt work then you need to change the batch status in tfgld100 and tfgld101 and put the batch in new finalization run number.</div></div><hr />

           Thanks for your reply. Meanwhile what i did was i created a new batch &amp; linked the Journal document to the new batch in tables where ever it needed. i deleted the orphan record in tfgld101 with status 'ready'. I finalized the new batch &amp; it completed successfully. i modified the tfgld101,102,018 tables to modify the Document's old batch with new batch. <br />
<br />
any how Thanks for your suggestion.<br />
<br />
I appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

if you have been able to delete the transaction and use new batch it is well and good as it will not require modification from back end. However in case of integration batches etc where batch can not be deleted we dont have any option but to use the same batch.<br />
