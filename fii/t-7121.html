     <br />
I have a problem about terms of payment, e.g. payment period = 10 days, I want to calculate the due date from receipt goods, but system only provides two methods immediately or end of month. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can't calculate due date based on receipt date.<br />
<br />
you may however customise your receipt printout to print due date as per TOP on the PO + receipt date.</div></div><hr />

Could you understand the reason why Baan system can't support the payment period base on receipt date?<br />
I have met several times key users want to use the function. So I think it should be normal function. But ......<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

   Our customer faced the same dilemma last time. We finally ask the customer to register invoice in AP as soon as receipt is made (hence document date=receipt date). This enables them to calculate due date based on receipt date.<br />

Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />
