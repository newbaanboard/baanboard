<br />
 Assets acquisition through Accounts Payable Module using Transaction Type of Purchase Invoice (Category Cost Invoice), the liability of Asset acquisition is accounted for and Asset accounting by linking the same with the Asset manually maintained in FAM Module through &quot;Assets&quot; (tffam1500m000) session. <br />
 <br />
However, the problem is when the above steps are done, the current quantity and current amounts gets doubled ie.for eg from 1 nos to 2 nos. &amp; from say Rs. 5000 to Rs.10000 value for asset recorded, which is manually can be edited before capitalisation.  <br />
 <br />
I am unable to maintain the assets booking using &quot;Assets&quot; (tffam1500m000) session from ACP Module as the field &quot;new&quot; is disabled in the &quot;Assets&quot; (tffam1500m000) session  in FAM and only find &amp; select option is available. Hence, i first maintained manually Assets from FAM Module with status as entered.<br />
<br />
Kindly help me on the above issues.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
The problem is resolved now, while maintaining the Assets record Assets (tffam1500m000) session in FAM Module, the value has to be kept 0 &quot;Zero&quot; which not mandatory field, with this the Asset number is generated without value and then through Accounts Payable Module, the aforesaid asset record to the ledger wtih option &quot;Investments&quot; &quot;Purchase Invoice Transactions&quot;tfacp1120s000 session, the amount is updated in the FAM Module. In this manner the recording of double amount and current quantity is avoided manually.<br />
