<br />
Do we need to close all the production order in order to close the period? <br />
When I try to close period, it says &quot;Not all the production orders closed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">12th July 2004, 11:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Closing of financial periods does not usually look at open production orders.  I don't remember ever seeing a message like that.  You need to make sure that all integration transactions are posted and that all batches are finalised before closing a period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">royal_buddy2000</div><div class="date">12th July 2004, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">this is not required that all the production order should be closed, but it is required that all the integration transactions should be posted in finance for which order processing is done, i.e, for sales order pdso is done , for purchase order pdpo is done, and for production order which are complete, closing should be done.</div></div><hr />
