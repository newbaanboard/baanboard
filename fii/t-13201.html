<br />
Finance data copied from one company to another. While comparing the trial balance  between the two companies, there is difference in the same ledger a/c of the two companies. On verification it is found in one company that tfgld201, 205 is displaying non-finalized amounts though they are already finalized in both the companies. The finalized DR/CR amount  contains the non-finalized amounts also. The are no non-fnalized transactions in both the companies. Rebuild Ledger/Dimension history sessions also run but didn't help. Is there any correction programme or aliter is it thru GTM only??? If so what all tables???<br />
<br />
Tks.<br />

Perhaps you should run tfgld3410m000 first - just in case...<br />

Tks for the reply. I had already deleted as a test case for one a/c and the balance is showing correctly in both the company's. The difference is in number of accounts. I thought if their is any correction programme it would reduce my work of killing individually in each a/c.<br />

Tks once again.<br />

After copying the finance data, did you run the tfgld9000 correction programs to fix the company number field in various tables? If not, perhaps that's the reason the rebuild doesn't work as expected. Get the latest version of the rebuild session.</div></div><hr />
