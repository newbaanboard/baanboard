Im using Baan IVc4, since 1999, And I have the following customizations on gld:<br />
. Payed IVA to report to SAT.<br />
. Retained IVA to report to SAT.<br />
. Purchases for each supplier to report to SAT.<br />
<br />
On inventory,<br />
. Different kind to Inventory valuations.- FIFO, LIFO, last price.<br />
<br />
As you can see most of them are in GLD/CMG modules.<br />
<br />
. I can recommend you to work with SOLCOM, they have a lot of old consultants since Triton, and his knowledge are very good.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

The only obligatiory, and not covered by standard baan, is the reevaluation of the inventory. This is due the SAT modifications done the last year.<br />
<br />
The other information, can be covered using several reports and consolidating using excel or something like that.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />
