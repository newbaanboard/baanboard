<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VishalMistry</div><div class="date">3rd May 2018, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Everyone,<br />
<br />
I was just exploring what entries are passed in Baan Finance from PO receipt to invoice matching and approval.<br />
<br />
I did one cycle myself and analysed entries and the document is attached. It is as given below:<br />
<br />
PO Receipt<br />
     Dr. Interim transit<br />
     Cr. Invoice accrual<br />
<br />
When Invoice is matched<br />
     Dr. Supplier registered invoices<br />
     Cr. Supplier control account<br />
<br />
When invoice is approved<br />
     Dr. Invoice accrual<br />
     Dr. Supplier registered invoices<br />
<br />
My question is that Invoice Accrual and Supplier Registered invoices both are squared off (once debited and credited). But when will my raw material account will hit? (get debited because I am purchasing raw material).<br />
<br />
What I mean is when interim transit will credited and actual account will be debited?<br />
<br />
Can someone explain with example the Financial flow from Purchase receipt-&gt;Invoice matching-&gt;invoice approval?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Vishal</div></div><hr />

There are 2 postings happening at the same time.<br />
<br />
1. Interim vs. Invoice Accrual (Purchase transaction)<br />
2. Inventory vs. Interim (inventory transaction)<br />
<br />
So basically it is Inventory vs. Invoice Accrual - the rest is what you already mentioned.<br />
<br />
Best thing to see what I mean is to print all transactions for any PO and you will see what I mean. Another option would be to look via the reconciliation transactions which shows you the counterpart of the PO transaction and vice versa.<br />
