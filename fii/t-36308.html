<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">29th May 2007, 05:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Open Item Balance is the balance of either the A/R (tfacr200) or A/P (tfacp 200) subledger.  Some people call it either the creditors balance or the debtors balance.<br />
<br />
You are comparing it to the balance in the G/L (tfgld106 and tfgld102) to ensure that there are no differences as the they should always be in synch.</div></div><hr />

What to do to correct it, if they are not equal.<br />
I did ran the Print control account checklist for a ledger account, and i see that there exists an open invoice in tfacp200 (in fact that invoice is already deleted (tfgld018 shows it as deleted) but the amount 255 has already posted to control account. <br />
How to correct this.<br />
Moreover, the open Item balance shown in this report is not equal to the opening balance in the print supplier balances by company for this financial supplier group.<br />
<br />

<br />
U need to correct the records manually to eliminate inconsistency which led this differences like <br />
1. run tfacp/r2245m000<br />
2. change /delete of records (ledger,dates , period , amount,d/c,groups etc)  in table through gtm</div></div><hr />
