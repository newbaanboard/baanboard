How to verify integration transaction posted from distribution module.<br />
As we know in one day there are huge transactions to verify.  As of now, we rely on Distribution people.  Is there any method for Finance to verify ?<br />
<br />

Quite frankly that is only partly usable - at least how our people use to compare data. We had to do programmings on these tables so that now we have an overview on order basis (sales order, po, warehouse etc.) and by ledger account. But you could still try to use the above mentioned programms and see for yourself.<br />

<br />
then I would like to know what exactly you need to see ? You could simply run the integration reports or create a crystal report over tfgld410ff - that is what we did before. Please be more specific about the data.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks again.<br />
We already customize the report tfgld1406m000 with additional business partner code, and also change format of Print Integration Transaction into flat format so that we can easily export to Excel to verify, this is not enough.  I think we should need another additional information so that all movement in stock is equal with GLD. This information should present how the inventory moves and how it ties with GLD.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

<br />
you could try to run reports over tcfin100 which gives you full detail on the required informations. The alternative would be to install new SP in order to use the sessions I mentioned first. Apart from that it will be difficult to get the necessary informations.<br />
