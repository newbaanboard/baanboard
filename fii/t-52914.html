I have not been this problem before. <br />
<br />
Could someone pls. advise me how to find out the variance from which item? I have more than 20k items of part number. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amealo</div><div class="date">3rd July 2008, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Several Causes can Exist. You must Review that transactions of Integration without entering do not exist or with errors in the GL. you must review the programs of correlation of countable integration each warehouse and to compare against the countable accounts that are generated. <br />
<br />
There is information that is key for  a good help: <br />
<br />
- Number of Warehouses that you are valuing ?<br />
- Modules in BaaN that you are using  ( Orders , Manufacturing etc. ) ?<br />
- Kind of Items that are you Valuing ? , Products to sales?  , To Purchase? , to manufacture ? , to use in Back-flush ? any?<br />
- What differences  in units are between Stocks Valuation session and whinr1410m000 Session for the same Warehouses and times ?</div></div><hr />
