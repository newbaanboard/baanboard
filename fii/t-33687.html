<br />
I'm trying to understand the link between Open entries (tfacp200) &amp; Purchase Receipts (tdpur045) :confused: . I know that we have a Order number field in open entries. How do we get to know the position/receipt to which an open entry corresponds to? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate if anybody could shed some light on this..<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I think you are asking the usual question and the usual answer is table tdpur046. But I am not sure this answers your question.<br />

These sessions are installed after SP13 (I think).<br />
<br />
The first session of the GRYNIA sessions makes an extraction of all the data linked to your GRYNIA account and put it in table tfacp135.<br />
<br />
With the other sessions you can maintain and print de relation between purchase invoice and purchase receipt.<br />

<br />
Once you approve your Receipts, then it will create an open entry in table tfacp200..<br />
<br />
You can see that in table tdsls045...after maintaining receipts the tfacp200 wont be updated...But after approving it tfacp200 should be updated...<br />
<br />
I hope it may help you to understand the link between tfacp200 and tdsls045..<br />
<br />
Bye<br />

The transaction code mentioned by earlier post will help you to find the balance.<br />
<br />
There relationship btw acp200 and tdpur45 and tdpur46 takes more than a few sentences to explain.<br />
I would suggest that you use the report mentioned by earlier post.</div></div><hr />
