<br />
After client ran Close Year Provisional, Trial Balance Report in the new year has opening balances in P&amp;L accounts equal to of the ending balance of the accounts in the old year.<br />
<br />
I took a quick look and confirmed that the gld history tables for the new year now have opening balances in all accounts, including P&amp;L. The opening balance of P&amp;L accounts is their ending balance from the old year. I only spot checked but balance sheet accounts appear to have correct provisional opening balances. Opening balance of the retained earning account has been updated correctly (equals unclosed ending balance of prior year plus net P&amp;L).<br />
<br />
This is an old system (Triton 3) and may not have all patches that had been available. But it hasn't been &quot;updated&quot; recently and to the best of the client's knowledge, provisional close never had this result before.<br />
<br />
I'll dial in this weekend and look in greater detail, but I wonder if anyone has encountered this before. <br />
<br />
Fiscal year has 12 periods (no correction period), fiscal year runs July to June.<br />
<br />
Ideas? Suggestions? Anyone else remember Triton 3?<br />

Are u sure that a user has not changed the P&amp;L account type into Balance Sheet in table tfgld008 before running Close Year Provisional?<br />
To correct this you have to delete all records for the new year in tfgld203 and tfgld204 and run Cloese Year Provisional again.<br />

Thanks. I wish it was that simple. It appears to have effected all P&amp;L accounts that had an ending balance in the prior year -- and all of these are in fact still categorized as P&amp;L accounts.<br />
