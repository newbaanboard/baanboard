I hve a situation where in during production process, some materials are used for testing purpose and later on destroyed and also if the batch does'nt pass the quality check. How to book these cost to finance. I could not find any link to finance in QMS. Is JV only the way???? or Inventory Adjustment with reason code????<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
There is no link from QMS to Finance. <br />
<br />
1. If quantity is rejected by QMS, you will get a materials usage variance becuase raw materials would have been consumed for producing x quantity whereas actaul production will be x- rejections.<br />
<br />
2. In case you can identify what quantities are likely to be used in quality testing, you can arrange them to be issued out of a different warehouse. then by using integration definitions together with Schedule for automatic tranasctions in finance you could track these to a different ledger account<br />
