<br />
I have set the tax field to &quot;NO&quot; in tcmcs0136m000 since no tax is applicable and also assigned sales ledger account(interim) in form2.  While posting the Sales Integration transactions getting error message:<br />
<br />
&quot;cannot define ledger account (sls:tdsls6000/tcmcs036)&quot;<br />
<br />
I assigned a dummy tax account in tcmcs0136m000 in the field sales tax account and again posted the transactions. Still getting the same message. Why is system asking for a sales tax a/c when tax field is set to NO? What could be the problem?<br />
<br />
Which table is tdsls6000? <br />
<br />
Any help is much appreciated.<br />

1. I encoutnered &quot; open item present , cannot post to finance&quot;<br />
    when for some reason duplicate lines for the same sales invoice<br />
     were created in integration transactions.<br />
     The first set was posted to finance and now when trying to<br />
     post again the systemm issued this error.<br />
     I had to manually delete the redundant lines from all<br />
     integration tables. <br />
     (I could not find out the reason !!!)<br />
<br />
2. Tax field in sales order header should have been set to &quot;No&quot;,<br />
    before printing the invoice.<br />
    When this is done the system will not search for tax account.<br />
<br />

<br />
Tks for u r reply. I still get the below error msg even when I set the tax field to &quot;NO&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;cannot define ledger account (sls:tdsls6000/tcmcs036)&quot;<br />
<br />
The tax field in sales order header is set to &quot;No&quot;, before printing the invoice.<br />
<br />
For TO - Sales &amp; FT - Revenue, the system is posting correctly. But for TO - Sales &amp; FT - Sales Invoice, no entry is generated  &amp; getting the error msg. Sales invoice is printed as per the order steps defined. The Customer is not getting debited and the interim sales a/c is not getting credited. If already open item is present it shd be reflected in tfacr2520m000, but no record is present for the particular customer.<br />
<br />
Still wondering which table is tdsls6000.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">9th December 2002, 12:52</div></div><div class="posttext">What are the vat code and country code you entered the data for in tcmcs0136m000?<br />
<br />
For your question aboud tdsls6000. That's not a table, it's an include file (function) responsible for getting the right sales invoice and vat accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tks for u r reply. <br />
<br />
Since no VAT is applicable in Dubai I hve defined  for country code AE (United Arab Emirates)  vat code as No Tax.  I hve removed the dummy sales tax account assigned earlier and posted fresh integration transactions. Still getting the same error for TO - Sales &amp; FT - Sales Invoice. Is it mandatory to give vat a/c though Tax is set to &quot;NO&quot;.<br />
<br />
As per the  help..... In case of sale for project (standard or customized item) entries for invoice analysis are:<br />
<br />
1) Dr     Int.Sales a/c    <br />
    Cr     Sales turnover a/c  <br />
<br />
2) Dr     Accounts receivable a/c<br />
    Cr     Int.Sales a/c (by tax code)<br />
<br />
The second entry is not getting generated ... may be due to error.<br />
