<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">23rd November 2001, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is some information on various enhancement requests that we gathered at the BWU fall conference. We are working with Baan support and development on addressing these issues. Feel free to send over any feedback. Perhaps we could also start a new thread on the discussion forum to post enhancement requests</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abennett</div><div class="date">27th November 2001, 19:39</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be nice to have the ability to reverse a journal that had been entered in error. (Not a reversing journal)<br />
<br />
This functionality existed in MANMAN X which was a clone of Triton many years ago, so why it was never put into Baan, I don't know.<br />
<br />
It would appear to be a simple job to program.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what about the legal situation in your country?<br />
<br />
Such an option is illegal in Germany - how could Baan implement this function for a software that should cover global requirements?<br />
<br />
I often thought about localisations and I regret that ERP is claimed to include them all. From my point of view it coureses more trouble than it solves. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">28th November 2001, 05:10</div></div><div class="posttext">from what i understand of the functionality in 5.2, there will be the ability to in effect reverse out the erroneous batch, but it will do so by creating a reversing batch, and not by simply undoing and deleting the original batch. To simply delete the error batch  would probably not be the best from an audit trail perspective either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">invensys user</div><div class="date">28th November 2001, 09:29</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan ERP there is a function to reverse batches. It is in fact an old correction program written by Baan for a specific customer.<br />
I'll try to look up the function and put it on this board.<br />

I believe one of them is tfcor0314 - (this one was created to fix some problems we had initially in 5.0c). The functionality coming in 5.2 is standard functionality and not a correction program.<br />
<br />
For tfcor0314 - the baan solution # is 105710<br />
