<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I am starting to work on a project that will integrate a small sister company into our Baan system.  <br />
<br />
Lets call us 'company A' and our sister company 'B'.  We have the same customers, but different products.<br />
<br />
One of the requirements is that the customer statements by printed by organization.  So that a common customer will get 2 statements, one from company 'A' and one from company 'B'.  Our customer statements are a custom Baan report that I wrote.<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to use one Baan company and separate the activities by warehouse \ user.  By default Baan will put all the invoices for company 'A' plus all the invoices for company 'B' on the customer statement.  I can not figure out how we are going to handle 'splitting' the transactions, so I can print one statement for company 'A' and one for company 'B'.<br />
<br />
I thought about separating the data by looking up the sales order based on invoice number, and then looking up warehouse, and then looking up which company each warehouse belongs to.  The problem with this approach is that misc. credits do not have a warehouse, so I would not be able to separate them between the companies.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to proceed ?<br />
Thanks,<br />
John</div></div><hr />

And rather than try to link back from ACR to the Order and grab the warehouse you'd be able to know quickly by the financial document.<br />
<br />
Any misc debits/credits created in finance (non-order related) could have unique transaction types/series too - allowing a breakout....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">27th July 2007, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I had not thought of that.<br />
I am liking that idea a lot.<br />
I would add a field to the 'Financial Transaction Types' table, to indicate whether that transaction type was used by company 'A' vs company 'B'.<br />
<br />
Then when the user prints statements, they would pick either one company or the other.<br />
<br />
That could be very slick.<br />
I will workshop that idea with my users.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

what you had thought is probably the one that you can act upon, else as you can also use the functionality of parent customer Finance.<br />
what you shld do is that you have to create 2 diferrent customer codes each one for your ware house ( your co concept) and link both the customers as parent &amp; child in finance. And finally you could always have a customer statement as per your ware house and also a consolidated one. <br />
