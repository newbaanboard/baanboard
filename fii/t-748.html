<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I received a request to revamp a general ledger chart of accounts.  There currently are 7000 account numbers with fewer than 300 active.  We would like to renumber accounts and clean up the mess (inherited from implementation).<br />
<br />
We're running Baan IVc4 and are not planning for an upgrade to V for about another year or so.  Therefore it is not desirable to do this as part of a Baan V upgrade.<br />
<br />
Has anyone attempted (succeeded?) in revamping a chart of accounts within Baan IV before?  How did it go, what were the pitfalls and did the Controller and CIO keep their jobs when it was all over?<br />
