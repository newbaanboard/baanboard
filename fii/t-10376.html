<br />
I would like to set a Payment method with which we wouldn't have to go through the Anticipated payment process.<br />
<br />
Could anyone advise me of the exact set up for such a payment method?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
In the session, Maintain Payment Methods, (tfcmg0140m000) on form 2 under Ant Payment/Receipt Steps set both of them to No.  This will eleminate the anticipated step and take the payment straight to the cash account.  If you have chosen to use a check master, that will need to be set-up also for the bank relation and payment method.<br />
