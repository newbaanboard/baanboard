<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blanchap</div><div class="date">2nd March 2020, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
is there any process that would change the mapping in inventory and wip transaction accounts session (tdinv8150m000) ?<br />
<br />
it's the third time that i need to remap data inside that session.<br />
when i run print user history for that session, i get no data found.<br />
<br />
nobody has access to this session (i think).<br />
going crazy a little with Finance. :eek:<br />
<br />
any clues?</div></div><hr />

you could turn on Table Audit.<br />
Baan cannot change integration mapping on its own. someone would have definitely changed it..<br />
another point, if you observe that on some particular transaction the entry has gone to some other account / dimension. then may be it is coming from the specific logistic transaction. For e.g for Cost Item Purchase Order, the posting data is coming from PO Lines session....please verify....</div></div><hr />
