<br />
We have an interm account for our COGS account that has a balance in it and just printed this report in session tfacr1432m000 and have a balance on the report that is different then on the G/L History.<br />
<br />
When working with some of the orders dating back to 2000 I see that if a purchased item is being sold and the standard cost changes from the time of issue to the time of invoice a variance is left in the account.  I beleive the same thing is occuring for a manufactured item but I am still checking on this.<br />
Cost Items do not seem to be a problem since we maped them to expense accounts.<br />
<br />
I wanted to know how others are using this session or it you have any workarounds to this problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
Doug</div></div><hr />

I'm not a big finance person, but I think you are talking about the GRINYA (Goods Recieved, invoice not yet available or some such), where there is specific accounting solutions and new sessions in Baan to handle them.  Try a search on these boards and an Baan support site for GRINYA, and you should find some docs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">30th December 2002, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the input. I am very familiar with GRINYA in AP but the GTBI (Goods to Be Invoiced) is in AR.  Same Idea but they don't have the Financial report, Logistical report or checklist as well as all of the finalization/archive sessions.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moshe Almog</div><div class="date">31st December 2002, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
I know of a problem concerning not clearing the COGS account.<br />
The function that creates the clearing transactions is<br />
tdsls4223 - Process Delivered Sales Orders.<br />
<br />
It computes the COGS value by getting the cost price of the item from the cost price master data (ticpr300) that is relevant to the delivery date.<br />
This is usually OK, but if you happen to compute a new cost price for the item, later, but still on the same day of delivery, it does not fetch the same cost price which was used at the delivery moment, but the new one.<br />
<br />
By the way, I do not see why the cost price is not taken from the delivery table itself (tdsls045).<br />

That is what I am finding is hapening.  For example inventory issued at a cost of 1.00 on the 10th, roll up done and invoiced on the 11th. but now the cost is 1.25, this is leaving a variance in the interim account.<br />
<br />
I guess I will need to do journal entrys until we get it fixed. A correction program would be great for this problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">himanshu</div><div class="date">2nd January 2003, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi!<br />
<br />
the variance being discussed here is standard functionality and correct as per accounts..<br />
<br />
while making deliver <br />
<br />
ITR Debit <br />
Inventory Credit<br />
<br />
While matching...<br />
<br />
Customer Debit<br />
ITR Credit...<br />
<br />
Now in case invoicing is at higher value an extra entry would come in<br />
<br />
Customer Ac Debit<br />
Variance  Credit.<br />
<br />
The entry would also come in finance integration transactions as <br />
<br />
Variance Debit<br />
Inventory credit..<br />
<br />
Now problem occurs when the varaince account in integration and ACR are different... so entry may be required to be passes between the two variance accounts ....<br />
<br />
But .. the net Inventory / ITR / Customer A/c effect are correct....<br />
<br />
Hope this Helps.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Himanshu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">3rd January 2003, 00:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got an update on my case from Baan.  They have a situation with Maintain Deliveries (tdsls4120m000) that say's:<br />
<br />
If the cost price for an item is changed after the order has been released, but before the delivery has been maintained, the new cost price is picked up and sent to finance through the integration.<br />
<br />
They also have a correction program for this, but it's still in testing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">himanshu</div><div class="date">3rd January 2003, 06:40</div></div><div class="posttext">well but thats the correct functionality ... in case f ftp item the inventory should be hit with latest cost price.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moshe Almog</div><div class="date">5th January 2003, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Himanshu,<br />
There is a problem in Baan functionality as I explained in my previous answer and I understand from Doug that it is being fixed now by BaaN.<br />
<br />
The Invoices To be Sent account should be cleared with the cost price (FTP) that was last on the delivery moment and not with the last of that day,  which was computed after the delivery.<br />
