<br />
is it possible, and if so how, to set up different finance companies for consolidated reporting?  We have 6 financial companies: 100 - 105.  We want to report financials for a combined 100 with 101, 102 with 103, and 104 with 105.  Let's say we would use new companies 200, 201, and 202 for that purpose.  We then want to add another level of consolidation by reporting financials for 200 and 201, e.g. in company 300, with a third level of consolidating 300 and 202.  Any ideas about how to accomplish this?  I'm hoping for a simple solution such as sharing certain tables.  Your input is appreciated.  <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I wonder why you would setup so many companies just for reporting purposes whereas this could be done within a very flat structure. When you are talking about consolidating companies I guess you mean just to accumulate data but do not mean &quot;real&quot; consolidation ?! Please do give some more information on that subject.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">23rd April 2008, 21:59</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason is in part due to the legal setup of those companies.  They require their own balance and P&amp;L sheets.<br />
I think you're right about what I want in terms of consolidating.  It is essentially the accumulation of all financial transactions from the operational financial companies should to the higher level/consolidating company.  When it comes to reporting, the consolidating company should show the accumulated result from the companies underneath.</div></div><hr />

for that purpose only tables need to be shared e.g. tfgld201 - 206 - the rest is more or less reporting. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">4th June 2008, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, that's what I thought.  But how do I share tables to consolidate on multiple levels such as this?<br />
<br />
Level 1: 100 - consolidation company for companies 201 and 202<br />
Level 2: 201, 202 - 201 being consolidation company for 400, and 401; 202 for 402 and 300<br />
Level 3: 300 - consolidation company for companies 403 and 404<br />
<br />
<br />
                                100<br />
                                /   \<br />
                            201    202<br />
                            /            \<br />
                      400 401   402 300<br />
                                             \<br />
                                         403 404<br />
<br />
(the tree structure is not displayed as designed for some reason but I hope you get the picture)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">4th June 2008, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The table sharing should be like all companies referring to group company. In Baan IV (think in all versions ) , the hierarchical consodiation is not possible . <br />
<br />
However it's  very easy to get whatever numbers u need in whatever format u want with some report customization .</div></div><hr />
