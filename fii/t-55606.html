<br />
while booking Purchase Invoice, getting the error message : &quot;Order Lines having Different Purchase Types&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">20th April 2009, 22:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't encountered that before but in LN 6.1, the control account by Financial Business Partner Group is specified by combination of Financial BP Group and Purchase Type. (See attachments.)<br />
<br />
The Purchase Type can be specified in the Order Line Detail. (See Attachments.)<br />
<br />
If different lines on the PO have different Purchase Types, it would not be possible to match and approve these on the same supplier purchase invoice because LN expects the ledger control accounts to be different, even if the specific ledger control accounts by Purchase Type are coincidentally the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leerkes</div><div class="date">21st April 2009, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">For FP1, to bring some Japanese requirements, into the standard, the concept of Multiple Control Accounts have been introduced.<br />
It is now possible to use different AP control accounts for the same BP. You can do this by entering the purchase type on your purchase invoice. However, you can still have only one control account per purchase invoice. <br />
This means that if you enter an order in tfacp1110s000 and there are orderlines which have different purchase types, then the system will not take one of them, but falls back on the default purchase type from the BP group. <br />
It is therefore only a warning message. It might be that you only match those orderlines which have the same purchase type to that invoice. If you don't do that, then you will also during matching get the same warning message.<br />

Thanks for the explanation.<br />
<br />
I incorrectly assumed from the original post that it was a hard error, not just a warning. I would expect that if you have set up ledger accounts by Financial BP Group to book to different accounts based on Purchase Type, you would normally want to invoice &amp; match the lines separately. So it is very good to know that the system will process using the default purchase type as that may not be the desired outcome.<br />
