<br />
We are studying the possibility of implementing BaaN in our subsidary in Italy.<br />
Is BaaN Finance used in Italy or do most of BaaN Customers use a separate financial software ?<br />
What are the main localizations in itl0 ?<br />
<br />

<br />
Why don't you post this in the Forum Italiano?<br />
There our Italian speaking members are active.<br />
Since you are planning to do this in Italy I am sure you can find somebody in your company to help you with the translations.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">2nd September 2003, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the main localisations are around protocol codes in finance, to assist in generating the legally required journal reports. You should investigate if this meets your requirements, some additional customisations may be required in that area.<br />
<br />
We also encountered some issues where standard Baan functionality was met with resistance from local accountants;<br />
They seemed to be very reluctant to use credit notes and they had some problems with statutory accounts (which may be addressed by the standard dual accountancy functionality in Baan V but they are using Baan IVc.<br />
<br />
I agree with Edwin, get some local advice since not many people outside Italy understand the Italian rules and regulations.</div></div><hr />

The Italian localization (mainly on finance and trade issues) is certified by Ernst &amp; Young and it is in use from 1993 (Triton 2.x) and there are many customers in Italy.<br />
To know what are the parts implemented you can contact the BaaN Italy.</div></div><hr />
