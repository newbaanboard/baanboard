<br />
I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions as to how to eliminate the &quot;Purchase&quot; &quot;Result&quot; transaction that occurs upon purchase receipt when there is a difference between the standard cost and the PO price.  Besides making the PO price equal to the standard cost, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to make this happen?  We are using Baan IVb, and as far as I know, there is no parameter to turn off these results.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your feedback.<br />

Purchase result is generated whenever there is a difference between order/invoice price and standard cost price.<br />
What is possible to do is to book purchase result in a manner that allows purchases to reflect invoiced amounts...<br />
Example:<br />
Item A<br />
Purchase Order Price/Invoiced Price USD 11<br />
Standard Cost Price                          USD 10<br />
<br />
Bookings:<br />
Purchase Receipt:<br />
Debit: Goods Purchased                                           10 USD<br />
Credit: Goods received to be invoiced by Supplier    10 USD<br />
<br />
Purchase Result:<br />
Debit: Goods received to be invoiced by Supplier      1 USD<br />
Credit:Goods Purchased                                            1 USD<br />
<br />
This way u will have a total booking for goods purchased of 11 USD and 11 USD for Goods to be invoiced by supplier<br />
<br />
Hope this will help.<br />
Regards,<br />
Pedro</div></div><hr />

Can you elaborate a little bit more on your suggestion?  I guess I am still confused about how this would stop the purchase result from occurring during a purchase receipt.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

This will not stop the purchase result from occurring...but u would be able to book it in an unharmfull way...The only way to stop purchase result from occurring would be to ensure that all purchase orders and invoices would have the same price as the standard cost price of the item (which is almost impossible).<br />

Have a better control on the operations of the organisation by frequent updation of standard cost. Also, during creation of item data, insist for the correct purchase price to be used.<br />
