<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">15th April 2010, 11:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
We are on single logistics and multi finance setup.<br />
<br />
We use to transfer inventory from one warehouse to another across different entity using transfer(manual). For this, we setup the entity-to-entity relationship and select the commercial price as good transfer.<br />
<br />
When we use session warehouse order session (whinh2500m000) to create the transfer(manual), we get what we expected. That is, the transfer price (as in whinh490) was extracted from the price book.<br />
<br />
However, when we create the same transfer(manual) using session Easy Warehouse Order Entry (whinh2202m000), the transfer price seem to be different in table whinh490.<br />
<br />
The invoice price in central invoicing module are same for both case.<br />
<br />
Can someone advise ?  We are on Baan 5C <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

- What is wrong in whinh490: the price (whinh490.pric) and/or the amount (whinh490.amnt)?<br />
- During generation of the transfer order in whinh2202m00, do you have the &quot;Process Warehousing Order&quot; selected?<br />
- Is the price in the &quot;Warehousing Order&quot; (whinh2500m000) filled? <br />
- The order which is created via whinh2500m000; does it have the shipment confirmed automatically (as soon as the advice is picked)?<br />
- If you use a warehousing order type in whinh2500m00 which does not have the confirm shipment as step, are the price/amount in whinh490 correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">16th April 2010, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply. Please see answer below.<br />
<br />
- What is wrong in whinh490: the price (whinh490.pric) and/or the amount (whinh490.amnt)?<br />
<br />
Ans : whinh490.pric is wrong. whinh490.amnt is also wrong because it is calculated from whinh490.pric. The calculation itself is correct.<br />
<br />
- During generation of the transfer order in whinh2202m00, do you have the &quot;Process Warehousing Order&quot; selected?<br />
<br />
Ans : Yes<br />
<br />
- Is the price in the &quot;Warehousing Order&quot; (whinh2500m000) filled? <br />
<br />
Ans : Yes when the order is created using whinh2202m000. No when the order is created using whinh2500m000.<br />
<br />
- The order which is created via whinh2500m000; does it have the shipment confirmed automatically (as soon as the advice is picked)?<br />
<br />
Ans : No, I need to confirm the shipment manually. <br />
<br />
- If you use a warehousing order type in whinh2500m00 which does not have the confirm shipment as step, are the price/amount in whinh490 correct? <br />
<br />
Ans : The price still wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">16th April 2010, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Price/amount: ok - indeed price is the problem.<br />
<br />
In case the shipments are confirmed manually, the correct price is retrieved. But with automatic confirm shipment (either via whinh2500m000 or via whinh2202m000) the wrong price is retrieved.<br />
<br />
It seems a bug to me. I expect that in your process not all relevant warehousing order (header or line) data is current during the automatic confirmation of the shipment.<br />
<br />
I think you'd better log an incident at Infor.</div></div><hr />
