we newly implemented service module in ERPln and are having issues printing service invoices. The invoices split into multiple for a single service order.<br />
eg. a service order has 2 labor lines and 3 material lines.when we print an invoice for this order. we get two invoices(2 numbers) 1st prints the labor lines and the second prints the material lines. i checked the setting and cannot find any place where this is set up.<br />
What decides this....and where can i go change it if needed. I need a single invoice for a service order for an activity(period).<br />
In the invoiceing methods i set it to aggregate on activity. If i use order or None it still splits but in an even weird way. Like some labor and materials together and the rest on another invoice.<br />
Please advise .</div></div><hr />
