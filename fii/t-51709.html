I want to use a cheque to do an anticipated payment without a connection to a supplier or invoice.<br />
<br />
When I use a transaction type including the program tfcmg2116s000 &quot;Maintain anticipated payments (details)&quot; I can choose the &quot;payment type&quot; = Journal, which normally should be used to do just a ledger-transaction on the bank-account without link to ACP (that is exactly the result I want to achieve).<br />
<br />
But even when I enter as payment type &quot;Journal&quot; the system demands a supplier-number. Why? How can I avoid that? a setting in the payment-method?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

As far as I know, this operation can´t be done. The payment should be linked to a customer in order to keep tack of the payments and reflecting it on the Financial module.<br />
<br />
Why do you want to print a cheque without supplier?<br />
If you want to do it, then print the cheque outside of baan and register it on the accountability as journal batch.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
thank you for the reply...<br />
... but, on the other hand, I would like to spend some trust in the person who programmed this session: why to provide the option &quot;journal&quot; when it is not working? and even a help-text is existing which tells me exactly the result I want to achieve (please do not laugh now :-) so I search the mistake in my settings of the parameters and not in the Baan-software.<br />
<br />
To use the cheque outside Baan is a workaround of course, but then I do not have the concept of anticipated payments that I can reconcile afterwards when the bankstatement is arriving.</div></div><hr />

 select onetime supplier code for this filde bcz this jounal transaction didn't link any ACP table or any supplier report. Previously we use this method for cheque payments for journal transaction in Baan IV c4</div></div><hr />
