We still need to do bookings on this period, so the period must be re-opened. How do I re-open the period? Does someone know the exact things this session tfgld1206m000 does when closing a period definatively?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">22nd August 2007, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I quickly gave it a look meanwhile, it seems to me that all the session does (in big lines) is making sure that there are no open (non finalized) transactions/batches for the selected period, and that p&amp;l are in balance. If all ok, then the status in tfgld107 is updated. I did not see any other table/data updates in the session. <br />
<br />
Can someone confirm this to me? If so, I could just reset the status in tfgld107 through GTM...<br />

I would go in the GTM and set the status in tfgld007 from &quot;definitely closed&quot; back to &quot;closed&quot;. Then the user can reopen the period normally by using the application.<br />
The checks that you mentioned are done by the system when you try to set the period status to &quot;closed&quot;, too, not only in case of &quot;definitely closed&quot;.</div></div><hr />
