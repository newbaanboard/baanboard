If you provide more detailed information, maybe people on the board will be able to help better</div></div><hr />

<br />
While composing, the payment documents are grouped based on currency, payment method, bank, payment date etc. I suppose, in one such group predominantly credit notes are selected due to which this happens. If you can remove a big amount credit note(bank OUB) in the payment batch, the payment will run without any error. Or try to adjust the payment date or increase the composing limit and then process the payment.<br />
<br />
You can search the Baan support knowledge base with keywords payment AND negative amount. You will get ample explanation regarding the composing functionality and how to adjust when the negative amount error appears.<br />
