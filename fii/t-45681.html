<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">10th December 2007, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">We need some advice how to change the way we use currencies (mainly Canadian and US currencies, with some Euros thrown in).<br />
<br />
Our accounting department wants to be able to use different currency rates for balance sheet and P&amp;L accounts. The balance sheet accounts should use a fixed, end of month rate, while the P&amp;L accounts should use more of an average of rates throughout the month. <br />
 <br />
Currently we only enter one rate at the end of each month.<br />
 <br />
Accounting would also like to roll standard costs (which is done every month) based on the average rate.<br />
 <br />
Some ideas we have had:<br />
Does anyone have any experience with Baan's multicurrency extension? Would it help with this?<br />
 <br />
If not, we are thinking of creating a table similar to Maintain Currency Rates (tcmcs008) that would hold the P&amp;L rates. We could then write reports that use the rates from this tables and use these to create journal entries for the differences. <br />
 <br />
For standard costs we are thinking of just changing the purchase rate to the P&amp;L rate, rolling the costs, then changing the rate back to the balance sheet rate. <br />
 <br />
Has anyone else faced this problem? How have you handled it?<br />
 <br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">12th December 2007, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">We use multi-currency extension and I don't think it would help with your requirement. You still only have 1 standard cost (albeit stored in 3 currencies) and exchange rates are stored 1 per currency pair per date.<br />
It is quite common for P&amp;L transactions to use average rates and balance sheet, end of month ones. However, you don't know what the average is until you get to the end of the month. So I think you have a choice of entering rates in more regularly (so each P&amp;L transaction could use the &quot;actual&quot; rate) and then balance sheet accounts may need to be revalued at month end using the month end rate.<br />
You can only run (i.e. store) standard cost once per day so maybe you could do that the day before end of month (e.g. 29th June) using the average rate at that point in time, that would be near enough.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a bit.<br />
