<br />
plz check these session (tfgld4126m000 &amp; tdinv8150m000) for your problem &amp; if it's not maintained over there.<br />
<br />
then maintain the proper data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">4th March 2009, 14:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Prior to checking both the above sessions, you might want to check Maintain Integration Elements {tfgld4120m000} for the existence of a purchase integration element and subsequently Maintain Options by Integration Element {tfgld4121m000}.. <br />
This integration element created in the former session is then defined as the debit/credit integration element in session Maintain Transaction Types by Transaction Origin {tfgld4126m000} for the combination of &quot;Purchase&quot; (Tran Origin) &amp; &quot;Result&quot; (Fin Origin)<br />

I have rechecked all finance modules and everything seems in order. Could someone help pliz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">13th March 2009, 19:54</div></div><div class="posttext">You are on the right track but may not have fully understood the solutions offered by finamp &amp; sukesh75. BTW, you’ll probably get faster responses next time if you post your follow-up (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=55333) in the original thread.<br />
<br />
For your transaction (Purchase / Result) the integration setup involves the following steps &amp; sessions:<br />
<br />
1) Maintain Inventory &amp; WIP Transaction Accounts (tdinv8150m000) – in this session you map the transaction to the debit &amp; credit ledger accounts<br />
2) Maintain Integration Elements (tfgld4120m000)<br />
3) Maintain Transaction Types by Transaction Origin (tfgld4126m000) – in this session you map the integration transactions to a Transaction Type and to Integration Elements that will be used to map dimensions to the debit and credit lines of the transactions.<br />
4) Maintain Options by Integration Element (tfgld4121m000) then one of the following:<br />
4a) Maintain Simple Integration Relations by Range (tdfgld4122s000);<br />
4b) Maintain Simple Integration Relations by Element (tdfgld4123s000).<br />
The above sessions define rules for mapping logistic data elements to dimension codes.<br />
<br />
Sample screen captures are attached.<br />
<br />
When you run post Integration Transactions to Finance Transactions (tfgld4201m000), the system looks to the tables populated by the setup sessions to look up ledger accounts, the transaction type &amp; series, and the Integration Elements. If the ledger accounts have optional or mandatory dimensions, the system then applies the rules that are defined in Options by Integration Elements (and its sub-sessions) to the logistic data and attempts to define a valid dimension code.<br />
<br />
As the two earlier replies said, your initial error message (“No integration element defined”) indicated that Maintain Transaction Types by Transaction Origin had not been not been defined for Purchase/Result. <br />
<br />
Your current error message “Cannot define dimension code for dept, Mandatory” indicates that:<br />
• The system has identified a valid ledger account and the department dimension is mandatory for that account.<br />
• The system has identified integration elements from Maintain Transaction Types by Transaction Origin. <br />
• The logistic element(s) that you elected to use to map to Department dimension in Options by Integration Element did not map to a valid dimension code following the rules you specified in Maintain Simple Relations by Element or by Range. <br />
<br />
To resolve, review the mapping that you have set up in Options by Integration Element and the sub-sessions, look up the logistic data from your failed transaction, manually apply the rules to indentify the source of the error, then correct the mapping. You may find it easiest to look at the actual logistic data logged in the integration tables tfgld410, tfgld415 and tfgld418.<br />
<br />
If you have reviewed your mapping rules and feel that they properly map to a department dimension code, make certain that the dimension code is not blocked and that the code is valid for the account as specified in Dimension Ranges by Ledger Account (tfgld0109m000).<br />
