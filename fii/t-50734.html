<br />
Situation:<br />
Local base currency is MXP.  We have 2 banks, one that is in the US and one in Mexico.  The US bank has US dollars (USD) and the Mexican bank has Pesos (MXP).  The concern is with the US bank.  If you have 100 dollars in the US bank and the exchange rate changes, you still have 100 dollars even though your base currency is MXP.  How would you reflect that?  You would not want your dollars to revalue in your US bank.  <br />
<br />
We have other questions but this is the main one.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is correct. You will sitill have 100 USD but, lets say exchange rate 11.00 MXP per USD. Then in MXP the system will register 1100 MXP. This is due to multicurrency environment. The system will mantain both values.<br />
<br />
If at the end of the month you reevaluate your bank, and the exchange rate is 12.00 MXP per USD, on USD you still have 100 USD but in MXP the system will adjust the MXP value doing a credit of  100 MXP to the bank  and debt for 100 MXP to the LOST&amp;GAIN Exchange Account.<br />
<br />
If you donÂ´t reevaluate, the old values will remain.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
