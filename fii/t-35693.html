<br />
We have noticed many Integration Transaction with Zero Amount. Since the integration tables are huge in size and grows very rapidly, therefore,these transaction with Zero Amount looks an overhead in the table and doesn't have any financial impact. Also, it is very difficult to maintain these very large tables.<br />
<br />
Is it recommended to remove these transactions from Integration Tables ? What would be the impact if these transaction are removed from the system? <br />
Is there any baan standard program available to remove these Zero amount transactions.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate if anyone can share his experience in this.<br />
