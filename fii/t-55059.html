<br />
Run tfgld3410m000 for april 08, this session will show you documents with differences.<br />
If you find a document with problems you can modify amounts in tfgld106, then run &quot;rebuilt history&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil124</div><div class="date">17th February 2009, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried tfgld6403m00, tfgld3410m000 and tfgld 3203m0000. Further the ACP/ACR/CMG/INT are finally closed after rebuilding ledger history /dimension/rebuild history from opening balance/transaction, therefore, I cannot open the period already finally closed.<br />
<br />
But since in closing trial balance of last year there was no difference so i have compared the closing balance of trial balance of Last period of 2007 and opening Trial Balance of current year April 2008 manually. On comparing i found that for 3 transaction the decimal point is showing the difference of 0.01 each therefore, I changed the values in tfgld203 and tfgld 206 for those items and its finally resulted in closing the GLD of all periods and closing of Year also without any further error. And also no error found in TB's.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />
