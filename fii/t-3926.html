We are planning to use TAX functionality (Not using external tax provider). We are planning to use Baan standard tax functionality. Everything works fine. When I post the Invocie it is failing to find one dimesion for the line that needs to be taxed. <br />
I have maintained the Tax set up provided in the common table for Destination tax. DO I need to maintain some integration element for tax in finance?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Is parameter SLS in tdsls6100m000 on Yes for Invoice details, then you have to set up a Combination of Sales - Invoice - Revenue inv.details.<br />
<br />
If the system asked for a dimension it is because the account is mandatory for that dimension, perhaps you have set up all records in tfgld4126m000, but not in tfgld4121m000.<br />
