I send my buyer 100 pcs of item A. He says I made a misake and he got only 90 pcs.<br />
I make another sales order line with -(minus) 10 pcs, recieve this 10 pieces in my inventory and release this order to invoicing. When I make the final invoice I get two invoices - one for 100 pcs and another for - 10 pcs. I would like to have this only on one invoice! <br />
<br />
Thank you for any suggestions!<br />

Wouldn't it be better to put the 10 on backorder and then set the backorder to 0?</div></div><hr />
