The supplier payments run processed as normal but then due to space issues the BACS file couldnt be created.  Everything looks o.k. in Baan except we dont have the file.<br />
<br />
Any ideas or suggestions how to resolve.  I know we cant rerun the payment run.<br />
<br />
Thanks  Dave</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note I'm on Baan IV so there may be a solution in V.<br />
<br />
Anyway not much help as an answer this but when we had this problem we got around it by writing a report that we then exported to a text file and then manually added the BACS header.<br />
<br />
Would your BACS software support any sort of direct text import ?<br />
<br />
Good luck <br />
