<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ser_solace</div><div class="date">7th April 2011, 05:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a future user of ERP-LN, and a roadblock our team is encountering is that there seems to be no way to separate the FX rate to arrive at a sales price in local currency and the FX rate used to translate foreign currency revenue back to USD.<br />
<br />
For example, if we create a default price book in USD, and if we create a &quot;Pricing FX Rate&quot; exchange rate type and set this FX rate type in the Sold-to Business Partner, then this will convert our USD price to the local currency price when selling to this Business Partner.<br />
<br />
However, what unfortunately appears to happen is that the same exchange rate type is also used to book to the general ledger A/R instead of a Finance controlled FX rate.<br />
<br />
Our &quot;Pricing FX Rate&quot; might be fixed for an extended period of time to stabilize local prices to customers.  We will absorb FX rate risk for some time.  However, we need to translate using a different market FX rate for booking to the general ledger when the transactions occur.  <br />
<br />
Is this possible to setup at all?  Or is LN incapable of doing this and only one rate can be applied?</div></div><hr />
