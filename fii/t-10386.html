When I am trying to select Supplier Invoice with Purchase Invoices and selecting the sales invoices in the session select invoices for payment the following error is generated &quot;Default payment method of supplier not used&quot; against the sales invoice.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
This problem can be avoided by using maintain payment advice and selecting the sales invoice. However I found it is easier to settle supplier and customer invoices (where amounts are equal) using direct debits and making a direct debit for 0 since payment for 0 is not allowed.<br />
