U can use only Production (INV) / Receipt and Production (INV) / Issues only for production orders entered through warehouse orders .</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe the program version on the demo server is older than the version on the other system.<br />
<br />
See the description for solution 150087 on the Baan support side.<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The warehouse is not being filled in the Integration Financial Transactions for a &quot;Production SFC / Production Result&quot; type transaction.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
It is considered standard functionality that the warehouse is not filled in the Integration Financial Transactions for a &quot;Production SFC / Production Result&quot; type transaction. The help text for &quot;Production Order Data&quot; has been modified to show only the project field (the warehouse field information has been removed) for &quot;Production SFC / Production Result&quot; type transaction. <br />
<br />

SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
How to activate field warehouse for transaction origin production SFC and financial transactions production result,surcharge &amp; operation cost? The field warehouse is activated for other financial transactions except these three. <br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
It is standard functionality that you cannot use warehouse for production SFC result,surcharge &amp; operation cost.<br />
For these transactions there is no direct link to a warehouse and therefore it is not possible to use warehouse.<br />
<br />
For example it is not possible to use warehouse as criteria for operation cost due to the following reason:<br />
The warehouse on the order is where the finished product will be placed. The operations within a production order may not be linked to the same warehouse as the manufactured item, they may be linked to the components. There is not a clear link between the operation costs and the warehouse either. The operation costs are written from hours accounting and they are not linked to a warehouse.<br />
<br />
For the combination of Production and Production result the following key elements are available:<br />
- production order data (contains the key element project)<br />
<br />
For the combination of Production and Surcharges the following key elements are available:<br />
- production order data (contains the key element project)<br />
<br />
For the combination of Production and Operation Costs the following key elements are available:<br />
- production order data (contains the key element project)<br />
- project data (contains the key element project and financial customer group)<br />
- service package data (contains the key element package part and service type)<br />
- employee data (contains the key element employee)<br />
- work center data (contains the key element main work center and work center)<br />
- machine data (contains the key element machine)<br />
<br />
For other transactions warehouse can be used as there is a direct link to a warehouse. For example the issue is linked to a specific warehouse (the goods are picked from this warehouse).</div></div><hr />
