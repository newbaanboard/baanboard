<br />
For  advance payments as well as for purchase invoices,the session tfacp2240m000 calculates the currency differences.The transaction must be finalized ,otherwise Baan doesn't calculate currency differences.I don't know for the other transaction that you mentioned.<br />

<br />
We used transaction type &quot;Cash&quot; to insert a vuncher for unallocated payment,unallocated receipt,advance payment and advance receipt.<br />
<br />
In session tfcmg2100s000,we choice &quot;unallocated payment&quot;,or &quot;unallocated receipt&quot;,or &quot;advance payment&quot;,or &quot;advance receipt&quot; in the field &quot;type of transaction&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now I don't know how to calculate currency differences for them.<br />
<br />
Do you know that?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
We also work as you do and the currency difference is calculated by the session tfacp2240m000.<br />
You need to have some settings in  Maintain acp parameters(see attachment) and also in Maintain financial supplier group(tfacp0110m000)-see attachment.<br />
As I said earlier the transaction for which you want to calculate curr diff must be FINALIZED.<br />
What version of the Baan are you using?</div></div><hr />

<br />
IÂ´m wotking with the version Baan IV c2 and we can not writte currency difference for unllocated/advance -payment or receipt. I think that the second parameter en ACP is for those check how are in transit (Anticipated documents not advance payments)<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

BaanIVc4+sp4<br />
<br />
In the session tfacp2240m000,if zoom to tfgld0553s000 in the field &quot;transaction type&quot;,transaction category is only &quot;purchase invoices&quot; and &quot;purchase credit notes&quot; can be displayed</div></div><hr />

I think it's about service packs.We also had this problem 2 years ago and the accounting department must do the currency differences manually.But we have now service pack 18.I don't know what SP repair this problem but it could be somewhere between SP 4 and SP 12.</div></div><hr />
