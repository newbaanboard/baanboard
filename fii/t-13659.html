<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">19th November 2003, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on 5.0c and running the Cost Price Calculation, ticpr2210m000, and then running the Actualize Cost Prices, ticpr2220m000. We have about 450,000 items in our item master, and about 1/3 of these items will have a cost price change.  We have tried running these both wide open and narrowed down to specific item groups. We have seen the Cost price calculation take approximately 3 hours, which is probably ok given our volume. However, the Actualization session is running for 40-45 hours, which seems to be extremely long. Has anyone else seen long run times for cost actualization? Has anyone come up with any alternative ways of handling this type of volume?</div></div><hr />

There is actually a solution, 134080, for 5.0 that fixes the actualization processing time..</div></div><hr />
