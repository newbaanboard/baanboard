<br />
The purchase receipt transaction should have also created a transaction on the intercompany account in the related company. So if you consolidate the trial balance of both the companies the intercompany account balances should total to zero.<br />
<br />
You can not pass manual entries on an inter company accounts. The credit balance in the intercompany account in the current company indicates that amount is payable to the related company.<br />

<br />
If you want to change the balance of a/c A001 in company A, then you have to create an inter-company journal entry between company A and B, so that its corresponding effect is also reflected in a/c B001 in company B.<br />

<br />
kindly enter your account setup in session tfgld0515m000 to have your inter company relations between A and B, in this way system will automatically do the journal on both companies.<br />
