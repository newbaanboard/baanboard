2.	After getting the above error we found some Sales orders for which invoicing was pending cleared these. Posted the integration data. Still the problem was there. <br />
3.	We have checked data in tfgld 410 418 416. <br />
4.	For some orders the data in 418 shows posted whereas in 410 there is no entry for posting.<br />
5.	For the relevant period I do not need the data but the volume is much.<br />
What to do please guide</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have not mentioned the error message, however looking at your text it looks like the error is that not all integration records are posted.<br />
<br />
Well mate for that Baan has a correction program otfcor0615, run that for the periods you are not able to close and Baan will reveal the primary index of the integration transactions that you can check in table tfgld418 which are not yet posted. Reason I am asking you to check in tfgld418 is that you will find out the order number immediately in that same form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gorgonna</div><div class="date">3rd March 2007, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">That session looks the following:<br />
1.	Integration transactions check status in tfgld418 (in tfgld410 is not important), it doesnÂ’t have to exist transactions for that period in tfgld415 and tfgld416. If exists post them.<br />
2.	All Fixed Asset transactions  for that period have to be posted, check that in tffas020 table.<br />
3.	Check batch status in tfgld100 and tfgld101, check batch with open or ready status<br />
4.	Check not finalized transactions in table tfgld102<br />
5.	If you  are closing the last period in the year ( 12 or 13)  all profit &amp; loss accounts should be in zero.</div></div><hr />
