<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">waltmanb</div><div class="date">8th November 2001, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We would like to use the standing order functionality for rent/lease payments. I have been testing standing orders &amp; have found that when selecting invoices for payment, the system does not select standing orders. The only way I was able to process a payment for a standing order was to manually insert the order into a payment batch. If that is the functionality then our only choice is to contiue to keep an excel spreadsheet for lease payments.<br />
<br />
Is there a parameter that we need to change in order to have standing orders included with the payment selection or is that the way it works?</div></div><hr />

<br />
for standing order payments create  a supplier as a one time time supplier and maintain a standing order and pay him.<br />
u can use the same code for future payments and all the supplier history is recorded for that payment<br />
<br />
hope this answers ur query</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that you refer to session tfcmg4220m000, right?<br />
(Sorry I am not in the office so I can't look in my system but I think this is the session you select the standing orders with)<br />
<br />
Do you use this one for the selection?<br />
<br />
Do you use Baan 4 or ERP? What is the latest solution you have?<br />
