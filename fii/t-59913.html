<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">25th January 2011, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">How would I set up three financial companies - 100, 101 and 102 - in ERP LN so that I can create separate Balance and P&amp;L reports for 101 and 102, and a consolidated report for both 101 and 102 in company 100?  Company 100 is essentially a holding company for consolidated reporting with no AR/AP or cash management, only the occassional journal entry.  I suppose I make 100 the group company (correct me if I'm wrong).  Which tables should be shared?  Thanks for your help in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th January 2011, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Recommended table sharing is well documented in Baan help . Mainly master such as client,supplier , company data , ledger , dimension , mcs data and ledger history table need to be shared . For more specifics baan documentation is  quite helpful.<br />
<br />
If multi-company setup creates / introduces any difficulty  in your desired functionality, cosnolidation can still be done in reporting very easily and is not a big problem.</div></div><hr />
