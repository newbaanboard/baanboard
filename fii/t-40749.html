IÂ´m facing this issue:<br />
1.- CMG prints a cheque for a determined supplier.<br />
2.- The supplier not make effective that cheque.<br />
3.- How to cancell this unpaid cheque?<br />
<br />
I know that I can done using several techniques: by cash batch, or by gld module, etc.<br />
<br />
But my issue is, in the master check table (tfcmg100) the cheque will always appear with paid status. How can be manage this?<br />
<br />
Thank  you in advance.</div></div><hr />

There should be a transaction type defined within the Bank Relation (tfcmg0110m000).    <br />
<br />
Rejecting a cheque requires the same steps as clearing a paid cheque (reconciliation).  This assumes that your payment method was set with an anticipated step.  In Payment Methods (tfcmg0140m000) you should see a field 'Document Accepted/Sent' under the heading Anticipated Payment/Receipt Steps.  Hopefully this field is 'yes'.   It would be highly unusual for cheques not to be set this way.</div></div><hr />

To add to that, there is one point mentioned in the first post: Paid status of the Cheque.  Cheque status will become paid only when it is reconciled.  If the cheque is already reconciled and the reconciled batch is not yet finalized then only user can do something about it.  User has to change the reconciliation status from Complete to Open first.  Then the cheque will become anticipated.  Now user can reject the cheque by changing the status from Open to Rejected.<br />
