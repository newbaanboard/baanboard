<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 23:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running into a problem with supplier reliability reports in Baan.  We receive large containers during the month and at month end, that may not be able to be received in a timely manner which causes us to improperly determine reliability.  We are thinking about back dating our receipts to eliminate this problem.<br />
<br />
Currently at month end (last day of each month) we stop working on that month's items, we print all of our financial valuations and use them to tie back to the G/L.  I know from the past for example that when we back dated hours accounting our WIP figures were out due to this.  It also create integrations that caused us problems.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what this new change will cause and wanted to know if anyone has had this come up or any ideas on what to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />

<br />
If you backdate a receipt and the GLD module for that period is still open, it will create an integration transaction in that period.  <br />
However, if the GLD module is closed (ACP, ACR, and CMG must be closed first) then you can safely backdate the receipt.  The integration transaction will then post into your current period.<br />
<br />
We too have experienced the situation where we have run our balancing reports prior to closing the modules, only to have additional transactions come through that cause the reports to no longer tie to the GL.  <br />
<br />
FYI, if your GLD and AP modules are still open, and AP is matching invoices relating to receipts in the open period, you will get additional transaction related to this function (purchase receipt transactions if pricing is changed, or purchase result transactions in the case of purchase price variances).  BaaN functionality tries to post any pricing changes or variances in the same period as the original receipt.<br />
<br />
Backdating receipts can be a dangerous but sometimes necessary animal.  :) <br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
