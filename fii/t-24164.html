hi<br />
<br />
We had customers having few problems with their old production orders which have been closed. Most cases users noted that there are still inbound or outbound order line not completed, but production order is already closed.<br />
<br />
My questions are :<br />
<br />
1) if user were to re-set the production order status from 'Closed' to 'Completed', what are the impact on finance integration, assuming all the ledger had been completed? Is there anything need to be considered?<br />
<br />
2) also impact on finance when user do a production issue or receipt for production orders which was from previous year?<br />
<br />
really appreciate some inputs as I am more in the mfg and distribution line.</div></div><hr />
