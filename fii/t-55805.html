<br />
What is the best way of finding corresponding logistics transactions when working in tf?<br />
<br />
Finance users have been struggling with problems like:<br />
1) transactions booked to wrong account. How to find other related transactions that need to be corrected as well? <br />
2) Is there a report that shows the document no. and company of origin? Finalized Tranasactions reports don't give the full picture.<br />
3) Is there a way of listing integration transactions by account no.?<br />
4) What is the best way of printing integration transactions with references to the corresponding logistics transactions?<br />
<br />
These problems have slowed down reconciliations and end-of-month activities and contributed to finance staff working more overtime since Ln was implemented in January. <br />
<br />
What is smart way of retrieving information related to integration transactions?<br />
<br />
<br />

   In my opinion <br />
1) The Problems come from the Inventory Transactions, Rite?  <br />
     You can to the Inventory transaction (In Logictic manu) and select the Orders and See a Inventory TRansaction Doc. No. <br />
   Then If you finded its. and you want tocorrect its, You will used the session Re-MAp Integration to correctit easy. <br />
2) The standard reports cannot support these requirement should to Customized or Used the other tools to provides. <br />
3) The Standard report you can print the Integration Transation by accounts.<br />
4) I suggest to add on the other tools to provides the additional requirement with out the standard provide. <br />
  Any way the reconciliations you not wait only month end the users must every day or every week to Accept / Final and Delete its. because the history very improtant to your data base spec. <br />
Any information Please let me know. <br />
