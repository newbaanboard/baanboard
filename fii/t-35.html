As far as I can see it is a pretty basic ledger, with limited functionality.<br />
I would be grateful if anyone who has gone live with Baan, could give me an idea of a user's daily process. Do they use the Reminder Diary? Which session is best for interrogating customer line items while on the line? How do you drill down to invoice details?<br />
Has anyone used any third party software?</div></div><hr />

There is some functionality to the AR Module. we run b4c3.  It works in conjunction with the Common Data and Sales Modules. You have to maintain a list of employees in common data module to assign them to a group of customers.  This enables more concise use of the Reminder diary.    You set Credit Limits and block orders ( shipment / or order entry) at the customer master / sales order parameter level. You can use collection letter templates and set the customer master to tell the system when to generate said letters.  You can also set the level of 'severity' for each consequetn collections letter. To See Invoice Details -  Go into AR/Open Entries/ Inquiries / you are given a number of ways to display invoice data.  once you select a way to view the invoice then click the invoice in question, go up to the special drop down menu,select display sales inv. receipts, click the  <br />
receipt you want, go up to special AGAIN, and select display receipt details. whew! good lord! <br />
It is really helpful to get your hands on an Accounts Receiveable Module description. I'm not an AR professional and I've heard those I support wish for more functionality from Baan.  Unfortunately not many shops have used what Baan available to them in the first place.</div></div><hr />

I'm banking on writing some decent reports on Crystal. As for the on-line enquiries, we'll have to live with them, but I'm somewhat concerned how they'll look with 30,000 line items !</div></div><hr />
