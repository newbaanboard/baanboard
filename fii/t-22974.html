IÂ´m using Baan IV c2 mcr. My company wants to implement CITI Direct cash management. To do that, the implementation team, wants to know if Baan supports the data formats: swift mt940 and peeling 1024.<br />
<br />
Anybody knows if this version of Baan support it? or <br />
what kind of formats can be used instead of?<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

Were you able to implement Swift MT940?  anyone else have any information pertaining to Swift MT940?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Well no response from the group and our support in Mexico, told me that it will be a major customization. So we abandon this integration.<br />
<br />
Good luck for you.</div></div><hr />

I've been looking at the specs for MT940 and it appears conveluded, and I can see the customization recommendation as EBS is set up for fixed width only.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I am in the process of completing an implementation of EBS at a Baan IV customer, and the results look very promising. I'm starting to appreciate the work that BaaN has done previously already here, but there is much to improve in the standard logic, which is unsatisfactory to put it mildly and simply useless at times as well.<br />
As such, the EBS-logic has been enhanced in such a way that it supports MT940 Structured as well as (an extraction of) the SEPA-specific tags included in the SWIFT MT940 Structured file as well as the useage of IBAN.<br />
Changes have been kept as small and isolated as possible, but do require changes to the standard (without these, forget about successfully implementing EBS using MT940 in Baan).<br />
Next step would be to improve the matching capabilities based upon the Remittance information sent in the SEPA message.<br />
I intend to implement more intelligent logic, or use fuzzy logic to improve the success ratio of the assignment/matching process.<br />
<br />
By the looks of it in LN, the situation is quite similar in the sense of the added value but also the limitations of EBS, and SEPA/IBAN at least is missing, and possibly also the majority of MT940 support.</div></div><hr />
