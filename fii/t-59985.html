<br />
Even though we have done some testing. But it is found that system is not showing any tax code with category = Withholding income tax in session &quot;Bank Transactions - tfcmg2100s000&quot; and &quot;Payment Advice-tfcmg1501m000&quot; . Due to this, we are unable to deduct withholding tax while making advance payment.</div></div><hr />

Withholding tax/social contribution is only applicable for purchase invoices/credit notes.<br />
<br />
In FP7+the functionality of Withholding tax on advance payments will become available.<br />
