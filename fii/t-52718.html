I have a user that needs to do a summary on some P&amp;L Drop ship customers, and she needs to not pick up one of the customers.  For example, if she needs P&amp;L customers 80 to 89, but needs to skip 83 how would she do this?  Would the mask field help?  I cannot find what it is for.  The people who were here before just told her never to use the field, but they never could explain why.  I'd like to know what it is for so that I can explain it to her.  <br />
<br />
I'd also like to know how she can do a summary of P&amp;L, but skip one customer.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

  She need to set up an fst for a group of branches.  As an example, she want to pick up a group of 10 consecutive branches but she doesn’t want to include the seventh branch in that group of ten.  And she is wondering if this “Mask “ field can be used to exclude that seventh branch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marwest98</div><div class="date">11th June 2008, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I have figured out so far.<br />
<br />
Once you have entered specifig ranges of dimensions, you can also use the mask for smaller selections.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
$ - the number to be selected should end in the character preceding the $<br />
^ - the selection must start at the first character<br />
* - the preceding character must occur one or more times<br />
[5-9] - the character to be selected must be between 5 and 9<br />
[579] - the value of the character to be selected must be 5,7,or 9<br />
... - the dots indicate the number of characters<br />
<br />
This works fine if you have dimensions like this and you only want to select a few:<br />
899011<br />
899027<br />
899031<br />
899042<br />
899135<br />
899168<br />
899281<br />
899292<br />
899315<br />
<br />
to select 899031 and 899281, I would type ^....[3-8]1$<br />
to select 899135 and 899315 I would type ^...[13]*5$<br />
<br />
However, my dimensions are <br />
PRE039<br />
pre040<br />
pre041<br />
pre042<br />
pre043<br />
pre044<br />
pre045<br />
pre046<br />
pre047<br />
pre048<br />
pre049<br />
pre050<br />
pre051<br />
pre059<br />
pre068<br />
pre073<br />
pre074<br />
pre075<br />
pre076<br />
pre077<br />
pre081<br />
pre082<br />
pre083<br />
<br />
so, I need to skip pre051.  I can't figure out how to get all the others, but skip pre051.<br />
<br />
Help!!!!!</div></div><hr />
