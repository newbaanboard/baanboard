<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">servicegirl</div><div class="date">12th December 2003, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We are setting up an international subsidiary (in a separate company) with MAUC as the inventory valuation method.  We were testing some scenarios and noticed that inbound activity that was not on a purchase order (such as cycle counting and return sales orders) pulled the standard cost and not the last purchase price as expected. <br />
Can any of you tell me your experiences with using MAUC as a valuation method and what I should expect? <br />
many thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

thanks for the reply, what did you guys do to work around this <br />
- customize the software, <br />
- work MAUC offline (we have to report back to the states in std cost anyway) <br />
or live with the calculation knowing it may be in error??? <br />
it would be great to get this information for our discussions here. <br />
many thanks again</div></div><hr />

MAUC stands for moving average unit cost (i think) <br />
anyway, it is an inventory valuation process that averages out the cost of the good (based on receipts) for reporting purposes.  current European reporting requirements do not allow LIFO for costing, only moving average or FIFO is allowed.  FIFO is not favorable for this firm, so we are taking on weighted average. <br />
just trying to find out people's experience with their use of the process since my own experience is not what is expected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You forgot to tell that MAUC is used in Aerospace and defense industry as well.<br />
<br />
In the other hand, I think that you have a bug in your system. The inbound activity for return orders or cycle counting inventory is pulled with the last MAUC calculated.</div></div><hr />
