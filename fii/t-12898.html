<br />
 I do not want to see advance receipt transactions in session Tfacr2420m000 (Print Aging Analysis by Customer). I want to see only receivables. Is it possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
I have the id√©e that this is not possible but it sounds not logical too. <br />
<br />
In an aging analyses report it is important that you have an overview about the status of a customer. The open invoices and the paid amounts by the customer. You can only have this overview if you can oversee all transactions.<br />
<br />
I think that it is correct that you can not select only invoices in your aging analyses report.<br />

Attached you can see a screenprint of this session from Baan Vc</div></div><hr />

I know that you are right.We can see customers with open invoices and receipts etc.. in the aging analysis report.<br />
So what we did,<br />
<br />
We get to take into account this report according to transaction type which is used for invoices,receipts or another else transactions in the system.<br />
<br />
There are transaction type of selection in this report<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Mr. Jaap in saying that if u get an output without advances, the balances of customers is not correct.<br />
<br />
However, even after knowing this if u want to go ahead the following will help you;<br />
<br />
Go to the session &quot;ttadv2100m000&quot; and select the session &quot;tfacr2420m000&quot; and then on the 2nd page click on &quot;Reports&quot; which takes you to the sub-session &quot;Maintain Reports&quot; and select the 1st report &quot;tfacr242011000&quot; and copy the same to your current VRC for making changes.<br />
<br />
In the session &quot;Maintain Reports&quot; click on the button &quot;Layouts&quot; and the layouts are displayed. Here you find &quot;Detail.30&quot; and &quot;Detail.31&quot; relates to unallocated and advance receipts. Input &quot;0&quot; (zero) in the field &quot;Output expression&quot; and this will suppress the unallocated and advance records in the report.<br />
<br />
If you want to undo the changes and go back to the earlier report just delete the report you had copied to the current VRC and then the standard report will be available as before.<br />
<br />
Try the above. I hope this will be of help.....<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />
