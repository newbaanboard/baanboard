<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jwray100</div><div class="date">7th September 2007, 00:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We are adding a mfg process at our facility that will be a subcontract operation we perform for one of our sister companies.  For various reasons that I won't go into we have decided to use the sister company's ERP system to handle the information flow in this operation.<br />
<br />
However, we need to invoice the sister company out of Baan based on a data feed from the sister company's ERP system that contains item and qtys shipped info.  There will be no sales order or shipping information in Baan.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to create a standard invoice in Baan using just such a data feed.  Maybe using EDI or Exchange script functionality to push the data feed into a Baan invoice without the other logistics data to back it up?<br />
<br />
We did something similar previously when we wanted to get invoice data into Baan from one of our divisions that was not using Baan, but in that case the other division was creating the invoice in their ERP and we just wanted to get the receivable into Baan.  So it was all on the finance side in Baan.<br />
<br />
The current scenario hits both.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">7th September 2007, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried the Invoice option under Finance module where you could create an invoice based on a customer without any logistic data tie up. It should be under ACR Menu under Invoice Control, i guess...<br />
 <br />
If you could investigate further into this module as to which all tables are getting hit when a finance invoice is created then you could even create an exchange script for this later on...<br />
 <br />
Hope this helps..<br />
