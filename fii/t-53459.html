<br />
I have a customer who works with two different BaaN companies. Now one of the companies will buy all the assets of the other, all financial movements will be performed through a single company. Once this merger will be done, the client want to have a report of consolidates balance and consolidated profit and loss, and one that reflects the movements of what were the 2 companies separately. <br />
<br />
In principle we thought doing so through the dimension 1, but we are checking that for certain accounts and transactions when moving accounts automatically, the system default as charged everything to a code of dimension, not lets you choose from over a code. <br />
<br />
Someone has any idea how we could mount? Many thanks for the help and greetings,<br />
