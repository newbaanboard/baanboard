<br />
How is the new Budget Control module in FP7 different from Static &amp; Flexible Budgets under Financial Budgeting System of fp7 &amp; earlier FPs<br />
<br />
Has anyone simulated this new functionality, pls share details.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaibou</div><div class="date">5th September 2011, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally spoken the Budget Control is only meant for non-profit organizations such as schools, universities &amp; civil services with no revenues. It is linked to..<br />
Requisitions (PUR)<br />
Purchase Orders (PUR)<br />
Rejections &amp; Returns<br />
Warehouse Issues (internal movements)<br />
Purchase Invoices (ACP)<br />
Cost Invoices (ACP)<br />
Journal Vouchers (GLD)<br />
Standing Orders (CMG)<br />
Bank Journals (CMG)<br />
<br />
The problem in my point of view is that the budgeting can be done on any level without having effect on top level. Assuming that you have setup a hierarchy of 1 Million then this has got no effect on lower level budgets - no interaction between levels.<br />
<br />
The budget itself can be reviewed and is distinguishing into:<br />
<br />
Budget	Released	Commitment	Encumbrance	Receipt Expense 	Expense	Available<br />
Budget<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now I cannot see any benefit for the sort of companies I know</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ask your Infor reps for a demo and let us know what you got from it.<br />
<br />

Any person telling differnt does not know the origin. Try for yourself and ask a consultant rather then a rep.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">27th November 2011, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">The module was added to address known functional gaps with Encumbrance Accounting that is used in non-profit and govermental agencies - so that Infor could better position LN for that market.   <br />
<br />
For the traditional install base it might help with some specific requirements such as controlling expenditures for capital goods as you can monitor and limit what is enterred in requisitions and purchase orders.   But I don't know if that I would implement the module just for that single purpose.</div></div><hr />
