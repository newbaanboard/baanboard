<br />
We have problems to configure integration scheme for a test server on FP3 because we don't have yet the skills for. Can we change the company type to &quot;logistic&quot; in order to not to be blocked ?<br />
And after; when it becomes possible for us; change it to &quot;both&quot; ? and complete  finance configuration ?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, do not switch a pure logistic company, all of a sudden to a both company, in which you probably also switch on &quot;Finance implemented&quot;. You will have a lot of open orders, which only create financial transactions from the date on which you turned the company into both, which will lead to balances on integration accounts, which should not be there.<br />
<br />
If you have finance implemented, then indeed you need an active mapping scheme, to create any logistical transaction. However, this is not too difficult. You can just create a mapping scheme, with just one document type and map it with a default account. Check it and make it active, that should not be too difficult. Of course remember, that in the end you need to make a good mapping scheme, because all the integration transactions which are being created from that moment onwards, need to be mapped to ledger account/dimensions and need to be posted. But, like I said earlier, any active mapping scheme will do, even with just one document type, mapped to a default ledger account.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TebbyTan</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 03:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the setting under sales Parameter (tdsls0500m000) and purchase parameter (tdpur0100m000) -<br />
<br />
Log Financial Economic Transactions set to NO<br />
<br />
This setting will not stop the logistic transaction also will still have the financial transaction post to the integration table, but will not post to finance until the mapping scheme is setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will only stop the &quot;On Order&quot; postings while registering the orders, if you go further in the process, like receiving/shipping in warehousing, you still need an active mapping scheme. So like I said the easiest way is still to create a simple mapping scheme with just one document type and map that to a default account. Check it and make it active.<br />

Finally we decided to keep company as &quot;logistic&quot; in ordrer to continue with user's training for logistic. We will create another server for &quot;Production&quot; in which we will make correct integration scheme.</div></div><hr />
