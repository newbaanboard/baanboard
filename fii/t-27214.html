Version: LN6<br />
Session tfgld6201m000 ( Close Year provisional)<br />
<br />
The opening of retained earning account is coming as wrong. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is the first time closing is done in this company and opening was entered in the 11 period using Opening Balance transaction type. So the P&amp;L accounts have opening also.<br />
<br />
Now the retained earning balance is coming as Balance of Transactions for the year but doesn't consider Opening.<br />
<br />
As I understood , normally P&amp;L accounts don'e have opening balance thus standard program would be considering on Balance of transactions for the year.<br />
<br />
Eg. Opening = 100<br />
      Debit    = 60<br />
      Credit   = 40<br />
<br />
Thus , Correct Balance  =  100+60-40 = 120<br />
<br />
While the system balance = 60-40 = 20.<br />
<br />
Please advise if someone has faced this issue before...<br />
<br />
<br />

One possible solution could be - first reverse the op bal of the P&amp;L accounts using Op Bal transaction type, re-enter the op balances in P&amp;L accounts on first day of period 11 using normal journal. Now, standard report / process would consider these op balances as normal transactions and the closing bal would be calculated accordingly.<br />
