<br />
In this session, we have selected a Bank Relation and are trying to use the &lt;Special&gt; drop down menu and select tfcmg0146s000 session to view the &quot;Maintain Posting Data by Bank / Payment Method.&quot;<br />
For some of our bank relations, we get the error &quot;No Steps Defined for this payment method&quot;. tfcmg0146s000 never displays on the screen. it only displays infromation for some of the Bank relations but not others.<br />
<br />
The thought is somewhere along the way tables were copied and some hidden table or something never got copied over or duplicated.  Our financials seem to work OK and we've edited account info att he GTM level, just strange why some of these don't display properly ..<br />
<br />
Digging throught he dbslog file, it touches on a number of tables just before the error pops up, namely :<br />
<br />
cmg006<br />
gld008<br />
gld011<br />
cmg003<br />
cmg001<br />
<br />
I don't see anything missing in these tables.<br />
<br />
the ledger acct seems to be there.<br />
bank relations are there, <br />
payment method is there<br />
Anticipated ledger acct rec acct is there<br />
ledger acct in chart of accounts is there ....<br />
Transaction type is there ...<br />
Contra acct is there ...<br />
Parent is there<br />
Payment / Receipt method is there ....<br />
And finally, the bank relations are there <br />
<br />
I don't understand what 'steps' it is referring to. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions what this may be referring to ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please check the steps defined in the payment/receipt method.<br />
<br />
To define the posting data, atleast one step should be defined in the payment/receipt method.<br />
<br />
The steps for payment method are decument received, document accepted/sent.<br />
<br />
The steps for receipt method are document sent to bp, document accepted by bp, document sent to bank.<br />
<br />

<br />
The problem ended up being in tfcmg003 table . The flag that sets Document Accepted/Sent. tfcmg003.ps02<br />
<br />
Change through GTm to Yes and it's OK now ...</div></div><hr />
