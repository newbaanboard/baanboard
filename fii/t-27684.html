<br />
BUT we have a one Parent with 5 child customer linked. Parent customer is responsible for everything. So if we put the total credit limit for ALL the 5 customers at the Parent customer level, will it work by checking all Five customer balances checks against Parent customers limit OR  is there any workaround setup to accomplish this. Waiting ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know is this functionality not available in Baan IV.<br />
We made a heavy customization to process with parent customer credit limit and also CMG data.<br />
