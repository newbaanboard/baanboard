I have the following question about this session.<br />
I have set the parammeter to &quot;Required, Calculate currency differences&quot;<br />
I have captured transacctions of year 2005 and posted in the period 12 of that year. <br />
I tried to calculate the currency differences with this session and nothing for period 1 of year 2006 and noting happens.<br />
<br />
This was done at test environment so I checked the tfgld203 and tfgld206 tables and I realized that in the live environment there are some registers that in our test environment doesnÂ´t so I inserted that registers in both tables. Run again and it worked good.<br />
<br />
So, my cuestion is. Why these records were missed? do I missed some procedure?<br />
I also ran the close of the month.<br />
<br />
Any idea will be appreciated.<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />
