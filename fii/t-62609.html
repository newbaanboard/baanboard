I'm experiencing a problem where the term of payment in the purchase invoice is not the same as of purchase order or supplier master data. In a normal procedure, when user added a new purchase invoice into BAAN, the term of payment should be defaulted to the supplier master data's term. But a number of purchase invoices get a different payment term instead. We've checked that the problem is not because of the user's input error (as we had set the payment term field as display field in the session tfacp1110s000). Does anyone ever encountered this kind of problem? Please help. Any solution is greatly appreciated.<br />

But the problem i'm facing is the Payment Term in Purchase Invoice. Should the user did not change the Payment Term in Purchase Invoice, the defaulted Payment Term would be the Supplier's Master Data Term right? But somehow BAAN give another Payment Term different from it's Master Data. And this only happens for a few Purchase Invoices. Please advice.</div></div><hr />

User would have entered an invoice for a Supplier X and saves it (header). Immediately he realises the supplier should be Y. He just changes the supplier and saves. He does not tab thru. Because of which the default fields are not refreshed.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply. I'll look into your advice. But is there any other ways that could result in this problem which is not caused by user error?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katiekelley</div><div class="date">17th July 2012, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">It could also be timing if the master data was updated the field is only populated at the time it is created and any change to master data after that point does not change anything already created.  Hope this helps.<br />

Thanks for your reply. Do you mean that changing the master data term after it is created is useless as the Purchase Invoice will still get the master data term at the time it is created instead of the modified one? If this is the case then all the Purchase Invoices with the same supplier should yield the same result. But strangely though, out of all the Purchase Invoices with the same supplier, only 1 or 2 would have this problem. Sometimes this problem didn't happen at all for that particular supplier. Please advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you got any solution to this issue.  Our problem is the system is picking up  supplier master payment terms instead of  purchase order payment terms.  We wanted the system to pickup the purchase order payment terms (each order is having different terms) instead of  suppliler master payment terms.<br />
<br />

<br />
Currently I'm still haven't come up with the solution. But based on my observation after researching on the program script, the system should pick the supplier master payment terms. If you wishes the system to pick from purchase order payment terms, then I think you need to customize the session that did the process. I hope someone in here could answer my plea and yours soon.</div></div><hr />
