<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emcandrew</div><div class="date">11th June 2003, 00:01</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Common Data set-up for Supplier there is a check box called subcontracting on one of the forms.  If this box is checked, Baan requires additional set-up for the subcontracting functionality.   Make sure the box is unchecked and future invoices will process correctly. <br />
<br />
However, the current invoices will need to be corrected as the subcontracting functionality on them will not be able to be changed.  Best way to do this is to debit memo it  out and then re-entered as a manual purchase invoice.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
