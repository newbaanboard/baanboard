<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francisco Díaz</div><div class="date">17th July 2007, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anybody can explain me why in LN when we enter a pruchase receipt in foreign currencies, the system uses two different exchange rates? It uses one for the debit transaction (the exchange rate is the one valid on the reception date) and for the credit transaction it uses the exchange rate defined in the Purchase Order.  is there any parameter to avoid the use of two different exchange rates? We need this transaction to use the same exchange rate in the debit and the credit lines. It does not matter if this exchange rate comes from the P.O. or if it comes from the one valid on the receipt date.<br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
In LN the receipt is splitted up in two receipt postings, one is the Warehouse receipt and the other the purchase receipt. We thereforre now have one extra interim account. The warehouse receipt transaction has to do with the inventory, so it will take as rate date the date of the receipt and the internal rate type. The Purchase Receipt has to do with invoice accrual and in LN the invoice accrual account is now always posted with the purchase order header rate information and as transaction currency the order currency. Because of this the invoice accrual account can now be revalued with session tfgld5201m000.<br />
This is how it has been designed and you cannot change this. Because this new interim account can be hit with different rates, you will see additional gain and loss postings. This gain and loss account is new in LN in the GLD company parameters.<br />

Thank you very much for your clear reply.  Here in Spain because of legal accounting requirements we do not post warehousing transactions, so I think using tfgld5201m000 will help to have a correct balanace in ionvoice accrual account. I will make some tests to solve this issue.<br />
