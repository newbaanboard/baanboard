<br />
As per my understanding you have consumed the inventory from consignment (Not Owned) W/H, against which a Consignment Payment Order is generated.<br />
<br />
Now if you want to make this Consignment Payment against that particular vendor from whom you replenished the inventory, you have to allocate that Not Owned W/H to that particular vendor.<br />
<br />
I mean to say, that you have to make vendor wise Consignment(Not Owned) W/H.<br />
Hope this will solve your issue.<br />

1. Create a new warehouse with warehouse type as &quot;consignment (not owned) &quot;<br />
yes, but you should link the this WH with the specific Business Partner (Supplier).<br />
2. Create Purchase Order type for both &quot;consign replenish&quot; and &quot;consign payment&quot;<br />
Yes, this step is correct.<br />
3. Create a Purchase order and receipt stock to consign not owned warehouse<br />
Yes, but use the 'consignment replenish' order type you created in Step 2.<br />
4. Transfer inventory from consign not owned warehouse to own warehouse<br />
no, this step is totally wrong.<br />
5. A consignment payment Purchase order is created and receipt to owned <br />
warehouse<br />
no, this step is totally wrong. It is not necessary to do this step.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your feedback. <br />
I am wonder if step 4 and 5 are not required. How should I issue material in ticst1501m000 ( material to issue by production) because this session do not accept consignment warehouse?<br />
<br />
Regarding Step 5, consignemnt payment is create automatically upon on hand being transfered out from consignment warehouse. The purposed is for making payment to supplier. If this step is eliminated or wrong, what is the correct steps?</div></div><hr />
