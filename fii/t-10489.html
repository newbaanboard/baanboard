<br />
What is the purpose to run this session??? to make the table tffst150 correct ????<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">24th June 2003, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The rebuild session is tfgld3206m000 and should only be run when there is no one working on the system.  This session rebuilds your history totals from the ledger transactions(tfgld106).  The trial balance print values from the history totals.  This will at least ensure that your trial balance report is correct. <br />
<br />
Did you run the select financial statement values before running the financial statement?  This could also be a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something else to consider....<br />
<br />
Be sure that all of your ledger accounts and dimensions are linked to a statement account via session tffst1104m000.<br />
<br />
If you have missed the setup for a ledger account/dimension, your financial statements will not agree with the trial balance.<br />

<br />
Yes,I ask the end user,they do run the  &quot;the select financial statement values &quot; before run financial statement.<br />
<br />
Financial stement take the value from tffst150, so if I run &quot;rebuild  ledger history&quot; will it update the tffst150 to the correct amount since my trial balance is correct ????<br />
<br />
<br />
Is the sesssion num (tfgld3206m000) correct? I got no tht session.But got tfgld3201m000 .<br />
<br />
Additional info : when user do finalized,system show all the batch already finalised ,but in table tfgld109 ,the run number 18 (the num they run which is integration )show 'ready',so we manually chg it 'finalized successfully' since all already finalized.  is this effect the report,is yes,what action I should take ???<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks alot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">25th June 2003, 09:58</div></div><div class="posttext">tfgld3201m000 will do the same job.  It will not update tffst150, that is updated when you run select financial statement values.  <br />
<br />
If tfgld109 status is wrong then there could have been a problem with the finalisation.  Make sure that all the transactions were actually finalised.<br />
<br />
As Linda said, it could also be that you are missing some ledger accounts so check that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already run the session &quot;rebuild ledger history&quot; session.<br />
But I run &quot;rebuild opening balance/histoy from transaction&quot; instead of rebuild ledger history ( because other user suggest better use this)<br />
.Due to my May account got problem,so I just run from month 5 to 5.<br />
<br />
after do this .my financial statement become correct ,BUT my balance sheet become wrong and TRIAL BALANCE's opening balance all become zero.<br />
<br />
MAY I KNOW WHAT IS WRONG?<br />
HOW TO MAKE MY TRIAL BALANCE OPENING BECOME CORRECT ???<br />
<br />
thanks alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">30th June 2003, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">If you rebuild your ledger history (tfgld3203 or 3206, they do the same job in a different way), all relevant records are removed from the history tables (tfgld20*) and rebuilt from your transaction history tfgld106 (and from tfgld102 I think).<br />
If you have closed your previous financial year that's ok. But if you have only provisionally closed the previous year, this causes a problem since the provisional year end only writes the opening balance totals to the tfgld20* tables but does not create a transaction. As a result, the rebuild will wipe out your opening balance and does not rebuild it since there is nothing to rebuild it from. You will have to re-run the session to create a provisional opening balance yourself to correct this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hpng98</div><div class="date">30th June 2003, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Sir.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">30th June 2003, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the company parameters in finance to see what the current fiscal year is. If that is last year, then you haven't closed the year yet.<br />
<br />
Go to finance/general ledger/year end processing and read the help text for the sessions involved. You will have to run close year provisional (tfgld6201m000 I think, I haven't got access to Baan at the moment.<br />
<br />
If you haven't done a year end before then find someone on site who has and get all the latest patches from Baan. Provisional year end should run ok, but the final year end may not.</div></div><hr />
