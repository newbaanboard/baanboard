<br />
I have printed the various tax analysis reports and none Net amounts  seem to agree with the Sales accounts in the general ledger.<br />
<br />
Does any one know of a reconciliation method to compare the total taxable sales on the ledger account against the Tax analysis reports.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">28th January 2003, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We have experienced this problem also.<br />
<br />
For us the biggest cause we found to be manual postings to the GLD tax accounts. In the main this was due to bank &amp; cash transactions being bulk posted from an analysed print out at the end of a month.<br />
<br />
As a precaution we have now blocked the GLD tax accounts from manual postings. Although not essential it forces you to use a tax code for all relevent postings.(We still have one account for manual adjustments)<br />
<br />
Also don't forget that the tax period is separate to the fiscal period. So it is possible to have a transaction showing in a different tax period to the fiscal period. (This could come about for a number of reasons.)<br />
<br />
Our reconciliation is very straight forward:<br />
We export the tax report and GLD tax accounts to an excel file. Compare reports and investgate the differences.<br />
It depends on your company policies and your tax authorites but knowing the reason for the difference maybe enough.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you get started.</div></div><hr />
