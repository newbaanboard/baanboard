<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nicolas</div><div class="date">19th July 2004, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We want to book income and expense(mainly cost of goods sold) from projects depending on the category of the item that is being sold. These categories(not a Baan concept) result from an aggregation of item families (over 200 families are classified into 5 categories). Now, this booking cant be made into ledger accounts via integration parameters, as only classification allowed for material cost is by cost component of the item (and we understand that means of each single component). We are not interested in booking by the components features, but by the final items. Can this be done with dimensions based on Main Item Family? Would the material cost of all components of an item be booked to the same dimension code because their main item is the one that is being sold and it is the same for all of them?<br />
