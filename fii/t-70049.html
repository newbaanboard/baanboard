<br />
We are creating cost purchase orders to buy flight tickets for employees. We want to track the expense that we do for each employee. (And would like to fill the employee dimension for such ledger entries)<br />
Currently there is no place in the PO where I can maintain the employee code.<br />
<br />
Any idea of how this is handled in Infor LN.<br />
<br />
Warm Regards,<br />

<br />
Please check which process your are following:-<br />
1 - Cost item with normal Item Group - Maintain Employee Dimension mapping in mapping scheme<br />
2 - Cost item with Cost to be specific Item Group - Use Employee Dimension while doing Match &amp; approve process.<br />
<br />
I think this will help you to resolve your issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pillai.ganesh</div><div class="date">8th June 2017, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear All, Thanks for your input.<br />
We were able to meet this business requirement by following the below steps-<br />
1. Dimension 3 is Employee dimension in our system.<br />
2. Purchase Order Type – “COS” was created in the system. The setup was done such that only cost items will be allowed on the PO with this PO Type.<br />
3. Cost Items which were used to book expenses where assigned a separate Item Group.<br />
4. Now that we had a new &quot;Purchase Order Type – COS” and  “Cost Items” with appropriate “Item Groups” connected to them; we defined the Mapping Scheme to set the Default Ledger based on the “Purchase Order Type” and “Item Group” Combination.  In the session &quot;Mapping Scheme&quot; (tfgld4573m000)  we made a ledger mapping set-up for the integration transaction &quot;Purchase Order / General Costs&quot; (IDT = 10001045). <br />
5. Now when user creates a Purchase Order of “Purchase Order Type – COS” and fills one of the newly created items in Purchase Order Line.  In Finance tab of session &quot;Purchase Order Lines&quot; (tdpur4101m000); ledger account would have automatically populated based on the mapping scheme and then user will have to select the employee id in dimension 3. <br />
This is how we can track the expenses employee wise on the ledger.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TebbyTan</div><div class="date">26th June 2017, 08:05</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Can try to use the Item Group with Cost to be specified, when invoice matching finance can define the expenses with employee dimension.<br />
2. For cost item, system allow to key in the expenses accounts/dimension during PO, can directly allocate the cost during PO entry.</div></div><hr />
