<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimbacon44</div><div class="date">1st October 2008, 01:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Factoring is where your supplier has sold their receivables to a bank, when you pay the supplier invoice (instead of remitting to the supplier) you send the check to the bank.<br />
<br />
On the receivables side, you have sold your receivables to a bank and your customer will remit to the bank.<br />
<br />
Normally the sale to the bank is at a steep discount.  Also depends if the receivables sold are with or without recourse.<br />

If you need further information, let me know and what you are considering doing?</div></div><hr />
