<br />
We have few of suppliers created with a wrong Financial supplier group. Most of them are active.We want to rectify them and I assume that one way to do this is through GTM. The other way is to perform manual transaction to make the outstanding of these suppliers Nil and change the status of these supplier as inactive and finally create new supplier code.<br />
<br />
I just want to know which one is the best way, Is there any other option to rectify the same. <br />
<br />
What would be the impact If we change the Financial suplier group in the supplier master through GTM. Would it make any serious impact to our standard reports or Control accounts ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Once at zero I personally would be happy to use GTM to change the group, and have done so in the past</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">19th April 2010, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally u need to settle all open items , make invoice balance 0 and then system allows u to change the supplier group through front end . <br />
<br />
If however this is not possible and u do it backend , relevant tables to check/correct are tfacp500 , tfgld102 , tfgld106 for all open periods and then rebuld the ledger history tfgld3203m000 .  As a check whether the corrections are right or  wrong u can use tfacp2415m000 to check the control account checklist which will should incorrect corrections . Ideally  do with an expert help from IT / finance and with proper backups .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sharry66</div><div class="date">20th April 2010, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The two different methods you suggested are correct. and I can see no other option but those given by you.<br />
<br />
I would not do myself the change of business partner group from GTM, neither would I advice to do so since, with the change in the business partner group, (normally) your controll accounts are also changed.<br />
<br />
Thus earlier open transactions that are there in the system with respect to the earlier business partner group will be bearing the old control account. and after changing the BP Group through GTM, new Contol account will be applicable leading to the mismatch of the control accounts.<br />
<br />
also, the Integration transaction mapping may also be based on the business partner group and some transactions may lie in the interim accounts. with the change of the above through GTM these interim accounts will never be balanced.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell change of business parter through GTM is not the advisable solution unless we are sure that there is no open transaction with relation those business partners in Finance as well as logistics. which may have impact on the standard reports / Control accoutns as well as integration transactions.<br />
<br />
Another option you can look forward for is blocking of the business partner code and creating a new code for same business partner with correct BP Group.<br />
<br />
Hope this will answer the query.<br />

True. GTM changes may be error prone . But at times in order to confirm to reality / compliance norm / business requirements etc , that may be a goog option under expert guide. e.g. there may always be some open item for the supplier and there will never be a case that the group can be changed and blocking too may not be possible. . <br />
<br />
I think the best judget for propriety GTM is the user himself/herself to assess such circumstances . One can only highlights risks / table info etc to mitigate / eliminate potential risks .</div></div><hr />
