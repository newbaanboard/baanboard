However, our Customer Balances (tfacr2424) does match.  We have identified the Customers in AR and Cust Balances that do not match and further identified the transactions.  However, in the same batch, some transactions work, others are causing the AR report to be off.  The transactions that &quot;work&quot; are done the exact same way as those that do not.  Can anyone offer a reason or fix?<br />
Thanks,  Lee:(</div></div><hr />

Does anyone know if there is an AR rebuild (similar to the GL rebuild?)<br />

just an idea: when you run tfacr2420m000, did you set the entry &quot;Include anticipated payments&quot; to &quot;yes&quot;?</div></div><hr />
