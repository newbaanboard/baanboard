<br />
I am trying to write a crystal report, which will get me the trial balance figure on a few ledger accounts. What tables do I use fro this. Is there any table that gives it directly. Or do I calculate this from the tfgld106 table right from the begining of the financial year. Or do I use the ledger history table in some way?<br />
<br />
Could someone provide pointers here please<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

If you are not dealing with dimensions you must use tables tfgld203 for the opening balances and table tfgld201 for the monthly transactions.<br />
If you look at these tables you will see that you have to add amounts in home currency. Table tfgld201 has a field for debit amounts and a field for credit amounts, but table tfgld203 has only one field, depending on the sign you will have a debit (+ sign) or a credit (-sign).<br />
Hope this is useful.<br />
