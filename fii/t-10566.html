<br />
i am facing a strange problem. I have made a JVR and processed it. Now it is showing as Non-finalised in tfgld102. However, if i see tfgld106 then it shows this JVR as finalised there. However, This transaction was fianlised.<br />
<br />
I checked the tfgld102 table for this JVR and found that &quot;update at end of session code&quot; field is coming as empty.<br />
<br />
as this is showing as finalised and non-finalised both, should i remove entries from tfgld102.<br />
<br />
or i have to remove it from somewhere else also.<br />
<br />
Please Advice.<br />

If it is a recurring journal then the batch should stay in tfgld102 as well so that when you execute the transaction next month the system know what value to pass the journal for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veyant</div><div class="date">30th June 2003, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">It is recurring transaction. The batch under which it was generated was finalised. so i beleive the transaction should move from tfgld102 to tfgld106 and tfgld102 should not have that transaction if the batch is finalised. as it is showing entry in both tfgld102 &amp; tfgld106 it is confusing.<br />

The initial Recurring transaction stays forever in tfgld102 to serve as &quot;model&quot; for the ones to come.<br />
Don't worry.<br />
