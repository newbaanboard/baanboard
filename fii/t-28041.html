<br />
I encountered a very strange problem with the trial balance. Here is an example:<br />
<br />
At the 3rd of August I have printed the trial balanace for July for some accounts and of course I got the closing balances. <br />
<br />
<br />
When I print the trial balance today for the same period and accounts, the amounts of the closing balances have changed. <br />
<br />
Our chief accountant told me that he has run &quot;Rebuild Ledger History&quot; but I don't know if it was tfgld3201m000, tfgld3203m000 - I will ask him and post the information later. <br />
<br />
My question is: Do you know a way to detect what the rebuild of the ledger history has changed?<br />
<br />
Thanks + Greetings<br />

This has worked for me to find those just appearing transactions that hang in the background.</div></div><hr />
