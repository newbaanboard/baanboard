<br />
Currently we are exporting a TB report for the following problem:<br />
<br />
We want to have a financial statement that list the months across the top and accounts down the side. i.e.<br />
<br />
<br />
 ---------          Jan  Feb Mar Apr<br />
Sales<br />
Wages<br />
Admin<br />
Tax.<br />
<br />
Previous systems have been straightforward for this type of report but Baan does not seem so.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A) is this possible?<br />
B) How do you set it up? (assuming its a yes to A)<br />
<br />
Thanks in anticipation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">9th January 2004, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many ways and tools to do it . However I would talk about FSt solution only assuming u wish to work with FST module of Baan and know good about FSt.<br />
<br />
1. Create report layout in FST tffst0101m000  with 12 columns<br />
2. Assuming this report has only profit and loss account , set 12 columns in FST tffst1101m000 with formula a-b (debit trans - credit trans) and variable period reference with shift correction period different for each of 12 column to match calendar month<br />
3. Select values for the full calendar year .<br />
<br />
Good amount of work but will give you the report u need . <br />
<br />
If u need rolling 12 month (last 12 months) , it can come  with variable period shift correction . However u have to compromise with column heading (as 1 ,2 , 3 etc ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mentioned other methods were available to acheive the result.<br />
<br />
Do any of these other methods use the interface or are we talking changing code etc?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">9th January 2004, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are the options.<br />
<br />
1. Interfaces with Baan as told by u.<br />
2. Creating a new program to do this.U can get a report in Baan to do this.<br />
3. Creating an ODBC connection SQL  tables tfgld201/ tfgld008 and get the same in MS Excel and creating a Pivot table through a macro.<br />
4. Writing an SQL query (ttadv3180m000)  in Baan on these tables tfgld201/tfgld008 and export the same to Excel and use Pivot table for that purchase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
else you can go for Access data base using query/Olap/Pivot table create the pivot table(one time exceise) and refresh whenever you required.<br />
(Fast and easy method,table knowledge required)</div></div><hr />
