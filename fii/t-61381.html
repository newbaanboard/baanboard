<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">david7</div><div class="date">25th October 2011, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
 <br />
I was asked to build a report that will show the Open Items (for each supplier) that is very similar to the original report that comes out from tfacp2421m000 session.<br />
 <br />
Basically what I need is to go over all the open Items per suppliers and sum them up (in all avaible currencies).  So for each supplier, I will have all his open items, and the total.<br />
<br />
Can any one guide to the tables and logic? I prefer to write my own report since they will ask me to put many other customized information in.<br />
 <br />
Thanks,<br />
 <br />

<br />
If you're totally new to Baan reports then it maybe advisable to get hold of some sort of documentation that gives you a decent overview. To put totals on reports generally you use after.field section in the layouts and then make the field a total field within the layout.<br />
<br />
In respect of the session tfacp2421m000 our system has a standard report with a total by supplier.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
Cheers Neal</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not new to Baan Reports. The request here will include a dozen of field that will not fit to the Baan IV's editor. That's why I need to write the whole report from scratch. <br />
<br />
I will be writing it in a regular script, with regular SQL and writing the output to a text file.<br />
<br />
That's why I need to understand the logic of this specific report, which tables are involved and how to calculate it.<br />
<br />
Can you help me in this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
No I'm sorry I don't know the report that deeply i'm afraid in respect of the SQL etc. I was intrigued by this part of the comment <br />
<br />
&quot;request here will include a dozen of field that will not fit to the Baan IV's editor. &quot;<br />
<br />
Do you mean that you are being asked to print several fields that exceed the maximum number of lines per layout ? <br />
<br />
You could print several layouts ie. detail.1, detail.2 etc. Or are you doing this already ? <br />
<br />
If you have too many fields have you tried using arrays ?<br />
<br />
Apologies if you've been through this route already but I've always managed to find a way with the Baan standard reports in these situations. However maybe my users are just easily pleased.<br />
<br />
Good luck with it.<br />
<br />
Cheers Neal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">david7</div><div class="date">27th October 2011, 11:15</div></div><div class="posttext">No I mean I want to have 50 columns! One next to the other! The Baan reprot has a limit of 255 Character, and I have more than that in each row.<br />
<br />
This report, should be read in another system. So I bounded to its template. I can not change the looks, add lines or columns other than what they want.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how does this report work? What tables are involved?<br />

It never ocuured to me you were going across. If it helps it looks as if most of the data comes from tfacp200.<br />
<br />
Cheers Neal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">david7</div><div class="date">27th October 2011, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it sounds like tfacp200.. but I have been told that there are a lot of logic invloved, and not just summing up the numbers..<br />
<br />
Can someone explain the logic?</div></div><hr />

Then you are able to read the logic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi David,<br />
<br />
I'm on ERP LN, however I think there should not be a big difference in tables in BaaN IVc4 as well.<br />
<br />
For Open Invoices, not paid fully : The main table should be tfacp200, can write logic for all the invoices with value 0 in balance field (tfacp200.balh). then in the report sort the report with supplier code, currency, invoice no. And Like Neil said, for totals, use &quot;Total&quot; function on after.field section<br />
<br />
For 255 chars issue, may be you can try creating a file.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />
<br />

<br />
So, is that all? if tfacp200.balh = 0 then I should type it?  Can you elaborate more on this field? Are there any exceptions?<br />
<br />
I heard there is a special treatment for anticipated and other types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">david7</div><div class="date">7th November 2011, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see that in some cases the tfacp200.balh &amp; tfacp200.balc = 0 but the item is still opened. I can see it is still opened fromt he Baan print session, and also if I some the &quot;tfacp200.amti&quot; it does not add up to zero, it will have the same result as the Baan report. <br />
<br />
Why aren't the tfacp200.balh &amp; tfacp200.balc updated? I got only 2 cases out of 1000!<br />

Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

There may be some currency differences which may need to be written off. <br />
<br />
Also Balc /balh are updated in header records only and not in child records.</div></div><hr />

I am writing the report from scratch. So there is no &quot;layout&quot;. What I need is all the open suppliers with their balance in 3 currencies.</div></div><hr />

Hi Hitech,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
How can I know what to cut off and what not to?<br />
<br />
For those specific suppliers, balc/balh was zero in all record although it is still open and it appears in the native Baan reports. Do you know why?</div></div><hr />

Thanks again for your help. I really appreciated it.<br />
1) I do not have this session in my Baan IV! Is there an alternative?<br />
2) I should exclude &quot;fully payed invoices&quot;. How can I recognize those who where fully paid from this table (tfacp200)?<br />
3) Thanks. I will add will try to add this logic.</div></div><hr />
