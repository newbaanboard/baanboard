<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bnbhatt</div><div class="date">3rd February 2010, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems booked invoice is deleted using GTM as once the booked invoice document is matched and approved can not be deleted from front end by user. Approved document also can not be deleted. If batch is still not finalised you may re-insert the same document using GTM in the tables from which deleted earlier.</div></div><hr />
