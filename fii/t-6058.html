<br />
Could anyone put me on track for solving this problem ?<br />
(Our financial wizards are on holiday leave and I'm not at ease in the tf module)<br />
<br />
Session tfcmg2103s000 (Reconciliation) runs into an error<br />
saying that the reconciliation procedure was aborted.<br />
I guess I have to reset some status somewhere but where and how ?<br />
<br />
Any help is welcome.<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

<br />
there is a correction program to reset aborted reconciliations - but<br />
this one is very complex and may only be run by Baan Support staff. (so you should discuss this with your local support center)<br />
<br />
Do you have the actual solutions for tfcmg2103s000?<br />

<br />
We had to change the status of the bankmutations in order to proceed with 'hung' reconsiliations. <br />
We finished the bad reconsiliations and then reversed them and deleted the bankmutations to clean out any intermediate tables. After that we could proceed normally.<br />
<br />
case closed.<br />
Thanks for the suggestions.<br />
<br />
Kind regard,<br />
