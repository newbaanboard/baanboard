<br />
Does &quot;Baan IV&quot; have PC-Upload Ability ? With PC-Upload I mean that you have the ability to load prepared journal entries for actuals in EXCEL, directly into Baan IV using that EXCEL file in the format of .txt or .csv ?? This would save lots of time because you eliminate all manual typing work in Baan IV itself.<br />
<br />
Baan IV nor SAP have that upload ability in its standard version or package, but I know that it is possible to program it in SAP both for actuals as for budget. Is this possible in Baan IV as well ??<br />
<br />

Similar to Oracle, Baan does have 'staging tables' for the import of data to create JV Batches.  Tables tfgld213, tfgld214 and tfgld215.  We have used them many times.  If you are handy with scripts, you can write something to parse and import into those tables, or if you prefer exhange, you can use the JV Import Exchange Scheme, released by Baan, search on the Support site for solution #155541<br />
<br />
Once the data is in those tables, you run the standard session:  Import Journal Voucher Batches by ID Number (tfgld2215m000) to get the Batches created in the General Ledger transactions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th December 2004, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">There are examples that come with the Baan client - these use Excel macros to update Baan.  I have used Excel macros to run Baan sessions in the background - putting the information to the session.  I did this using an API function server - there is a forum dedicated to this.  So I think you can do what you are asking with Baan and the Baan client.<br />

Great idea - the solution of migrating from Excel to Baan using api's is also good to get the data into those staging tables.<br />

Can you merge the posts?</div></div><hr />

I am trying to import payroll entries from an excel file and I found this thread very intresting. I created the Exchange Scheme in solution 155541 as Lisa mentioned and it seems it created the scripts. So now, how will the excel file will look like? Do I need to have all the fields in tfgld213, 214 and 215 ?  Can anyone send a sample of the excel or ascii file to import using exchange scheme JVIMPRT?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been a LONG time since I've actually run this, just ran searches and I don't have a sample file anymore.   I do think you need the data for all 3 tables, but the sequence numbers are generated from the conditions.  You can send out of Excel in .csv (Comma Separated) format.  The support site says:<br />
<br />
&quot;Last tips, many times the customers ask for the ASCII file, how prepare the ASCII files. Is very simple, the customer know what table need to import, however the customer have to insert a few records in the table and create a exchange process to export, then export when the process finish the customer have a example of the ASCII file, and how need to prepare the file with the same format and position.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which means, put data into those tables, create an export that has the same setup as you import and run the export.  This should be a sample file..<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
