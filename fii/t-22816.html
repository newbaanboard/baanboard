<br />
BaanERP has a very elaborate job costing method. But if the client is in such disorder, implementation of job costing is not only tedious, but will result in dubious cost accounting and financial statements. Process costing has always been an easier way to do cost accounting, especially for companies without integrated computer system like ERP. Is there somehow any way to use process costing conveniently in BaanERP? The only ways I can figure out about doing it are all not as simple and straightforward. Thank you very much<br />
