<br />
We have issue in  &quot;Maintain Purchase Invoices (tfacp1110s000)&quot; while matching and approving a purchase invoice,  system is picking up the payment terms from supplier master file  instead of purchase order.  We have each and every purchase order created in different payment terms which are different from  supplier master terms.  So,  the purchase order payment terms should be picked up from Purchase orders  instead of master file terms.  <br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, the default that you describe (terms come from supplier master, not from P.O.) is standard Baan IV functionality.<br />
<br />
The issues from the perspective of system design are that:<br />
<br />
(1) Whether entering a cost invoice or an invoice matched to PO, the terms are specified at the invoice header level and the invoice header is saved before you can enter ledger details (for a cost invoice) or matching details (for a PO-related invoice).<br />
(2) Even if you enter an PO-related invoice, the system is flexible enough to let the invoice be matched to receipts from multiple POs. So in theory the PO receipts that are matched do not necessarily not uniquely determine the terms of payment.<br />
<br />
This is a common issue because payment terms on the PO should override default terms on the supplier. The best low-cost solution is to ensure that the AP process includes review/lookup of the terms on the PO.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to hear from anyone who has designed a customization to look up terms from the PO on the invoice header.<br />
