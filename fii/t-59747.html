Second:<br />
*Simulated Purchase Prices shuld be maintained manually via the session of 'Simulated Purchase Prices' (ticpr1170m000);<br />
*Current Purchase Price is the value in the feild of 'Purchase Price' in the session of 'Item Purchase Data' (tdipu0101m000), and it is also input manually;<br />
*Latest Purchase Price' is calculated by the system of the latest appoved purchase invoice price. The calculation is trigerred via the puchase invoice approval in Finance;<br />
*Average Purchase Price is also calculated by the system. It has two modes to be calculated. One is averaged the new purchase price with the total purchased quantity, and the other one is averaged the new purchase price with the inventory value.<br />

<br />
As far as I know, there are no User's Guides for costing.<br />
<br />
However, the on-line ERP LN Help for Calculation of cost/valuation prices for standard/customized/STO items gives a good explanation.<br />
<br />
You can also look at the these Infor365 ERP LN Support Briefing Videos:<br />
<br />
 Standard Costing<br />
 Valuation Cosing<br />
