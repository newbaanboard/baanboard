<br />
I'm having the following problems while attempting to do a year close. Any help would be greatly appreciated: <br />
<br />
1) In Session &quot;Maintain Period Status&quot; the Adjustment Period (Period 13) is missing in FY04 (it is present in Session &quot;Maintain Periods&quot;). I would like to add this period, but I just want confirmation from you that if I click on insert and click yes to the pop up question &quot;Generate Period Status Record&quot;, the system will add the Adjustment Period, and won't undo the status of the previous periods.<br />
<br />
2) In session &quot;Automatic Balancing of Profit and Loss Account&quot; the message &quot;Invalid Period for all Modules pops up, when tabbing through field Fiscal Period and through field Tax Period. Why?<br />
<br />
3)What are the implications of the dates of Tax Year not being in sync with the Dates of the Fiscal Year (from May04 onwards) in Session Maintain period Status?<br />
<br />

<br />
1)	By inserting a period status for period 13 it wont undo the status of the previous periods<br />
2)	Once you fix the question no. 1 this will be resolved<br />
3)	Tax year can have different dates then the fiscal year. Both are independent.</div></div><hr />
