<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 00:57</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;Extra Days after Due Date&quot; field in the Customer Master can be used in calculating a Cash Forecast (in CMG). The intent is to let you add known or expected delays in receiving payments to the Due Dates of the customer's invoices. A negative number means you expect payment before the invoice due date.<br />
<br />
There is similar functionality on the supplier side to let you quantify for cash forecasting how you plan to &quot;stretch out&quot; your payments suppliers. Or whether you plan to pay your supplier early. (No need to take a poll on how companies use this one!)<br />
<br />
Specifications for the forecast calculation determine whether the cash forecast actually uses &quot;Extra Days after Due Date&quot;.</div></div><hr />
