<br />
i'm looking for a report that will give me all Purchase Orders that was recceived but not matched in Finance.<br />
<br />
Does such a report exist in Baan?<br />
<br />
If not, what (or where) is the flag that define a PO matched?<br />
I can query tdpur045 for the receiving part but i need to validate if it was matched or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
You can use session tfacp1430m000 (Print Purchase Receipts). It is displays output with receipts details and invoice details. For Order with invoice quantity and invoice amount is zero that purchase orders are not matched in finance.<br />
