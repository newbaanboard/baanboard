<br />
For the purchase side, you can set up Tax Codes by Country, tcmcs035, 36, 37, and that populates the correct taxes.  Finance side, you can assign a default tax code to the supplier, and book the rest of them as variances, directly by Ledger account, and dimensions (for cost centres).<br />
<br />
Best wishes</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a possibility to use multiple tax codes on a purchase invoice linked to purchase orders.<br />
First of all, you need to set up a tax code - for example &quot;L&quot; - Tax per invoice line (tcmcs0137m000 and tcmcs0136m000; there is no need to declare a tax percent in tcmcs0132s000 or tcmcs0135s000).<br />
Next, in ACP parameters, set tax code &quot;L&quot; in field &quot;Tax code for tax to be specified&quot;.<br />
When you will enter an invoice which has multiple tax codes, you must put tax code &quot;L&quot; on the invoice header, then set &quot;Level of tax calculation&quot; as &quot;Transaction line&quot;. On pressing &quot;Continue&quot;, the system should go directly to subsession Maintain Tax Transactions (tfacp1112s000), where you may specify for each invoice line a tax code and the net and tax amounts. If the session is not started automatically, you can find it in Maintain Purchase  Invoices (tfacp1110s000), in the &quot;Special&quot; menu.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
