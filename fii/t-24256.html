<br />
<br />
I am facing a strang situation with baan here...<br />
<br />
The open entries for specific financial group (not including the anticipated or any other accounts) = 4,000,000<br />
<br />
the check list for that control account = 4,000,000<br />
<br />
print finalized data for this account ( including non finalized) = 4,000,000<br />
<br />
print the finalized data alone = 3,600,000<br />
<br />
print non finalized data alone = 400,000<br />
<br />
Now print trial balance for this account = 600,000  :eek: <br />
<br />
we've discovered that this problem is present in a specific period only, which is the first period in our fiscal year..<br />
<br />
also this problem is in all control accounts..( suppliers and customers)<br />
<br />
we have tested the data in both tfgld106 and tfgld102, it is all correct...<br />
But in tfgld205 or tfgld201 it shows the bad amount...<br />
<br />
the rebuild do nothing for this issue, also reorganize tables.. nothing..<br />
<br />
it seems that not all transactions from tfgld106 or tfgld102 is fully tramsfered to the ledger accont totals, and history.......<br />
<br />
<br />
any help appreciated</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">10th June 2005, 09:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure that you run either tfgld3203m000 or tfgld3206m000.  These rebuild from transactions, while the others just rebuild the parents history data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have used all the rebuild sessions including tfgld3203m000 and tfgld3206m000 and there is no difference..<br />
we are sure that no one works in finance while we rebuild..<br />
<br />
I am not sure what is the session tfgld4150m000 is ???<br />
There is tfgld4150s000 which is integration para, but I think it has nothing to do in this problem....<br />
<br />
I am using Baan 5.0c..<br />
<br />
Please note that this problem exists only in control accounts, and only in the first period of the fiscal year, if that can help..</div></div><hr />

If not maybe you have to do a provisional year end in order to have an opening balance again.<br />
<br />
Might Help.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

thanks marcel..<br />
<br />
The previous year is already final closed...and there is nothing we can do about it..<br />
<br />
the last thing we tried is to restore an old dump and see what happens,, but the same problem exists...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">11th June 2005, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Think some GTM is done inconsistenty like <br />
1. Deleted  transaction has sequence 99 in tfgld102, somebody may have changed that. <br />
2. GTM in opening balances - tfacr/p500 .<br />
3. Change of customer/supplier at transaction level<br />
4. Change of supplier/customer group at master level through backend<br />
5.The print for non-finalized session may have some (which session u use to print non-finalized transaction , have u printed this for all batches).  GTM</div></div><hr />
