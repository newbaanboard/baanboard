<br />
We would like to change our Base Currency (Home Currency) from USD to EUR.<br />
<br />
What's the procedure to follow? Could the same procedure be applied as for the Euro Conversion? <br />
<br />
Thank you for any piece of information.<br />

<br />
The euro conversion was a specific situation. In this situation all transactions, as there are ledger postings, invoices, budgets, integration transactions, etc. etc., are translated too the euro by fixed exchange rates but with the triangulation calculation rule too. <br />
<br />
Currently I do not have the idée that I oversee all consequences of this action (using euro conversion software for a change from USD to EURO). I have the idée that it is wrong to do this.<br />
<br />
I think the best advice is to create a completely new setup and transfer the balances (ledger, open invoices, fixed assets, budgets, etc.) to the new setup. I think this is the quickest way to solve your problem. The only problem with this is that you lost history data for immediately use. You can always enter the old system with the USD figures.<br />
<br />
When you try to use the euro conversion software than test this carefully. Be aware of the following: If you need support from Baan for reason that something went wrong, than it is possible that Baan is telling you to pay the costs of the support activities by yourself. You are using the functionality wrong.<br />
