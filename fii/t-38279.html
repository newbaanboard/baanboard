<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cchretien</div><div class="date">28th June 2007, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using Infor ERP LN FP3.<br />
For posting COGS PCS parameters are Post against actual cost<br />
We place a purchase for a PCS item for EUR 95.-<br />
We receive this item and use it in a PCS production order.<br />
After this component is used in the production order we receive the purchase invoice from the vendor for EUR 94.- This generates following transactions, configured according to the Info Financial Integration Mapping document and to the User's Guide for Financial Integration<br />
and Reconciliation Transaction (U8967BUS)<br />
	Purchase Order / Price Variance for EUR 1.-<br />
o	Debit 	Invoice Accrual - PO Receipt				+1<br />
o	Credit	Interim Variance - Purchase &amp; Production		+1<br />
	Warehouse Receipt / Variance Adjustment<br />
o	Debit	Finished Goods						-1<br />
o	Credit	Interim Variance - Purchase &amp; Production		-1<br />
	Warehouse Receipt / Value correction<br />
o	Debit	Finished Goods						+1<br />
o	Credit	Inventory Correction					+1<br />
All these transactions are OK<br />
When we close the project (after processing all other required steps), a transactions PCS/Additional cost of good sol dis generated for the EUR 1.- price difference.<br />
According to user guides, it should be configured<br />
o	Debit	Cost of Goods Sold						+1<br />
o	Credit	Covered General Costs						+1<br />
<br />
Which in fact increases the COS while it was a gain.<br />
In our opinion it should be :<br />
o	Debit	Covered General Costs<br />
o	Credit	Cost of Goods Sold<br />
<br />
Did someone experienced this situation<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance and best regards.<br />
