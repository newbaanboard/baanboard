In our scenario, we gave money to a supplier who purchased expensive equipment to manufacture our product.  In addition to that, we pay a monthly sum to that supplier over a 2 year time frame.<br />
We want to amortize the initial as well as the monthly payments as part of standard cost.  Any ideas how to handle this situation?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't tried this but i think it should suit your scenario<br />
