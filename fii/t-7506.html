<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nicolas</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Certain cash receipt amounts are never fully matched to invoices for various reasons (duplicated entries, the client has paid an excess amount). They should be written off, but tfacr2240m000 will only take sales invoice / sales credit note documents into account, not cash receipts. ¿Is there another way to get rid of such amounts? I wouldnt want to do it via fictitious documents entries such as fake invoices or cash receipts with reversed sign.<br />
<br />
Every advice shall be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm afraid you'll have to use something like a 'fake return receipt'. You consider not using &quot;fictitious documents&quot;, but what do you call a receipt that does not represent the real value (like erroneous or duplicate entries)? Maybe you should consider them 'fake' as well and reverse them in the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kps_menon</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">You are correct...In short ,only way to tackle a fake/wrong/dummy  entry is to use another fake/wrong/dummy entry... or GTM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't you book these variances to the sundry costs field as you are posting the cash?  <br />
<br />
That way you can write-off the variances to whatever account/dimension combination you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kps_menon</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 20:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi ,<br />
  From the question it appears to me that the cash receipts are recorded under unallocated/advance receipts account .(which i think must be already have been finalised).So the only way is to allocate it to some dummy invoice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">6th November 2002, 00:16</div></div><div class="posttext">One other consideration -- although you may not like the idea of &quot;dummy&quot; invoices/documents, they provide a very clean audit trail that lets you see exactly what happened to the cash (or fake cash) that was recorded in favor of the customer. <br />
<br />
Just decide on a standard procedure (transaction type, series, ledger account, boiler plate text or something obvious in the customer order # field) that will make these items stand out<br />
