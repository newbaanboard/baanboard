<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazeem</div><div class="date">3rd September 2002, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to transfer ACR and ACP open entries from one Baan company to another. <br />
<br />
It can be done by manually transferring each invoice, with a lump sum transfer of the balance or I beleive data migration using tools.<br />
<br />
Is there a standard mecahnism in Baan which will allow this transfer. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

In the latter case, is this a multi-site (multi-finance) situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">3rd September 2002, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Form the query , it seems it's one time requirement. In that case a program can be written to copy acp200-3/acr200-3 records with <br />
balc / balh 0 before a certain date . Or for that matter , entire tables can be copied to other company. And GL  balances also have to be correct (No entry can be made in control account ).<br />
You may also have control account checklist differences for the open items so copied.You may also opt for remove fully paid invoices before carrying out this exercise.<br />
<br />
If there are lesser open items , then I would suggest that manual entry is the correct approach.<br />
<br />
If you need this to be on a regular basis , u may use transaction origin 'External package' in tfgld410 and financial transaction as 'sales invoice' / 'purchase invoice' and post it as normal invoice transaction.</div></div><hr />
