<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Our company in Germany is looking to use an Internet payment/approval system supplied by their bank. Part of the process involves creating a DTAUS export file from Baan. <br />
<br />
How do I create an export file in the format specified by the bank. I have attached a file which gives an example of how the file should look. There is also a document explaining the format but this is too big to attach, if it would be of any help I can email the file (500k zipped) direct.<br />
<br />
I've looked at session tfcmg5104m000 but I'm unsure if; a) this is the correct session to use and b) if I can generate a file in the desired format.<br />
<br />
Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
tfcmg5104m000 is for the opposite way, from bank to baan. <br />
<br />
You have to install a payment method in tfcmg0140m000 with tfcmg1260s000 where the report is in the dta-format. <br />

<br />
As Juli says, you'll have to customise the report format of tfcmg1260s000 to suit the needs of the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 12:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
<br />
<br />
Maria, that is not really correct, because for the session exit a german report layout for DTA. So first check e.g. nr. 16, and then if it doesn't fit, then you have to customise, but usually it is ok. <br />
<br />
Bye, Juliane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info Juli.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your quick replies.<br />
<br />
So you saying that the payment method is set-up in tfcmg0140m000 and the tfcmg1260s000 is the subsession that will create the output.<br />
<br />
I am not a Finance person and I know that my finance person may not have a very good idea on how to set-up this session. Some fields are straight forward to complete. But others I'm not sure about, report groups on form 1 and then most of form 2. <br />
<br />
Can you please give any advise on using this session. <br />
<br />
<br />
Juli, what do you mean by first check nr16?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Juli is refering to report number 16 which is attached to the session.  It is specifically for Germany.  This will also be the report group that you use on form 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
Form 2:<br />
<br />
Composing Option = Invoices<br />
Composing Limit = 99<br />
Composing Action = Remittance<br />
Number by = Documents (but this depends how you wnat to do it)<br />
Use Check Master = No<br />
If you want to allow foreign currencies then you'd set that up and depending on your business you would can set the Payment/Receipt Steps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the Attachement shows you the report groups I am talking of. <br />
<br />
When you installed the payment method, don't forget to maintain also Posting Data by Bank and Payment Method. <br />
<br />
Bye, Juli</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Germanicus</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello pjohns,<br />
<br />
for the German DTA you need to insert a payment method in the cmg master data but not with session tfcmg1260s000 but with tfcmg1261s000. There is also a report available. But the question is: do you use Baan 4 or Baan 5?????<br />
<br />
For Baan 4 you need to implement the German Localisation, in Baan ERP the session tfcmg1261m000 (I think it is m000 in ERP-sorry but I am at home now so I can't say it exactly) is available in the standard. Are you familiar with the German &quot;Bankleitzahl&quot;?<br />
<br />
If you can tell me wether you use Baan 4 or ERP I can tell you more next week (when I am in the office again).<br />

<br />
We are using Baan 4c4.<br />
<br />
Funny you should mention tfcmg1261s000 as I saw that in the list of sessions for Payments/Reciepts and wondered if I should be using it instead of 1260s000.<br />
<br />
If I can see tfcmg1261s000 do I still need the German localisation?<br />
<br />
In answer to your question - Are you familiar with the German &quot;Bankleitzahl&quot;?  The answer is not one bit, but I think I'm about to........<br />
<br />
I'm glad Baan can output a DTA file, when I read the technical documents the bank had sent to me I was very lost!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help so far I look forward to your reply in the week.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Germanicus</div><div class="date">4th February 2002, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi again pj,<br />
<br />
so you are using Baan 4. O. K. I will have a look if you get a correct DTA when you use the Standard (no German localisation) but I don't think so because of the &quot;Bankleitzahl&quot;.<br />
<br />
About the &quot;Bankleitzahl&quot;: it is something very special in Germany - each German Bank has a specific number code (known as Bankleitzahl).<br />
Every Bank can be identified via that code (don't mix it up with the swift code!)And it is always used for cash transactions within Germany.<br />
<br />
The Bankleitzahl is numeric and consists of 8 digits. The Bankleitzahl of the &quot;Pay From Bank&quot; is written in the A- record of the DTA and the Bankleitzahl of the &quot;Pay To Bank&quot; is needed in the C- record.<br />
<br />
By the way: In Germany we use the shortcut &quot;BLZ&quot;<br />
for Bankleitzahl. I will make a test on my machine and let you know the results.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Germanicus</div><div class="date">5th February 2002, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi pjohns,<br />
<br />
you should be able to get a correct DTA when you use session tfcmg1261s000 with the report 1 which is the &quot;Disketten - Begleitzettel&quot;<br />
<br />
The &quot;Disketten - Begleitzettel&quot; must be delivered to the &quot;Pay From Bank&quot; (in Germany we use the word &quot;Hausbank&quot;) together with the file (disk).<br />
<br />
To get the Bankleitzahl in the DTA you need to set the BLZ from the &quot;Pay From Bank&quot; and of the &quot;Pay To Bank&quot; as address code!!!<br />
<br />
In Baan 4 it is functionality that the addess code is written in the DTA - so you need to set the BLZ as address code. (In ERP the functionality is a bit different.) Please try it in your test environment.<br />
<br />
One more thing: Do you plan to do foreign payments also(from Germany to other countries)? <br />
<br />
If so you will get in trouble without the German Localisation - because there would be specifications necessary that are not covered by the standard.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
I will now have to sit down with my Finance guy and try and get this working.<br />
<br />
We will be sending the file to the bank by email and not diskette does the tfcmg1261s000 session care where the output file is placed? <br />
<br />
If I have problems do you mind if I get back to you?<br />
<br />

<br />
session tfcmg1261s000 just creates the file. It is a different story on which way you get it to the bank ... (but e-mail should be o. k.)<br />
<br />
If you have problems you can post a question in this forum but I can't look at it in regular time frames. If you need urgent help - you should register a case at your local Support Center (are you supported by Baan Support Ede NL?). <br />
<br />
It is possible that my colleagues can help you - if not they can assign your issue to the German Support Center. And then there is a 95 % chance that you get me as Support Analyst. Then I can check your DTA for errors.<br />
