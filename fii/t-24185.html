<br />
I am not able to obtain the cost test in Baan<br />
<br />
The cost test in the acounting general is:<br />
<br />
initial stock + net purchase - final stock = acount Cost balance<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

All your purchase goes directly to stock/project in the balance sheet, and the cost (and turnover) is recorded as you sell/close projects. In this way you get a result directly, and this is the prerequisite for being able to report immediately after the period ends.<br />
If you still want the &quot;cost test&quot;, you have to construct this yourselves in a creative way.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">14th June 2005, 11:40</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not possible unless you create a customised report which goes by each item and thus sums up into the total inventory value of the company. You must consider all the possible types of transactions (like purchase receipt, production receipt, sales issue, service issue, etc...) while constructing this report. The report for one item can be checked with the print inventory transactions by item for quantities.<br />
To pick the standard cost, the report must consult ticpr300 as on the transaction date.<br />
If carefully developped, this can meet your requirements.</div></div><hr />
