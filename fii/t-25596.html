<br />
1. Will it possible that for one production order it would generate both Production  / Operation Cost and Production / Completion (operation cost)?<br />
<br />
2. Am I right Production / Operation Cost will only generated if Hour Accounting is implemented?<br />
<br />
3. Is it common practice to map the Production integration with details cost component? <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

backwards, your points:<br />
<br />
3. financial value of transactions based and splitted in cost price components.<br />
First of all, you should check CPR module, sessions of &quot;Maintain Cost Price Componens&quot;, &quot;Mt. Operation Rates&quot; and &quot;Mt. Cost Price Calc. Codes&quot; (menu: Cost Accounting / CP Master Data)<br />
You can learn basics via these master data.<br />
<br />
Cost price component maybe the most important base: this object defines the type of the cost, e.g. operation or material cost component.<br />
<br />
2. HRA module is always implemented with manufacturing modules so you should set up HRA master tables as well - although later you can run SFC module without using functionality of HRA. You can report hours from SFC module, with backflushing method.<br />
Be careful how BAAN calculates actual operation costs sent to finance:<br />
Rates for reported operation costs (machine and labor) are taken from CPR module or from HRA, depending on HRA param. &quot;Actual Operation Rates&quot;.<br />
So, BAAN will calculate with standard rates defined in CPR or with Employee/Machine rates, defined in employee master and machine master.<br />
<br />
1. Do you mean transaction types?<br />
   Operation Cost transaction is booked when operation (hours) is reported.<br />
   Completion (Receipt) booked when you report prod. order completed (inventory receipt of finished goods). Each transaction can contain Operation cost component.</div></div><hr />
