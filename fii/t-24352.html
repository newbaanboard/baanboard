<br />
The following is the use of supplier payment in cash management as stated in the Baan cash management documentation...<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
The payment procedure:<br />
<br />
The payment run covers the entire payment procedure. This procedure runs<br />
from the time purchase orders are due as open entries in the Accounts Payable<br />
(ACP) module to the time the invoices are cleared when the bank statement is<br />
received and the payments are reconciled. The standard-payment procedure<br />
requires you to perform the following steps:<br />
<br />
1 Set up the payment method and the bank relation.<br />
<br />
2 Specify the ledger accounts to which anticipated payments must be posted<br />
for each payment method and bank relation.<br />
<br />
3 Link a payment method to each purchase invoice.<br />
<br />
4 Select the purchase invoices that are due.<br />
<br />
5 Audit and process the payments.<br />
<br />
6 Send an electronic file or the printed bank orders to the bank for notification<br />
purposes.<br />
<br />
The results of the payment procedure are:<br />
<br />
1 The open entries file in the Accounts Payable (ACP) module is cleared.<br />
<br />
2 All open amounts of purchase invoices are set to zero.<br />
<br />
3 The payment document is linked to the purchase invoice.<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
Please refer to document  &quot;UP116A US&quot;<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
<br />
I don't know if it is allowed to upload this document or not, but you can find it at the baan online support..</div></div><hr />
