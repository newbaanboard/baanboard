<br />
The server has not been shutdown for more than a year, and only the NT services for baanlicensing, logicservice and sharedmemory are stop and restart as well as MSSQL everyday.<br />
<br />
After the restart, there are many reports are no longer print out correctly, such as supplier &amp; customer aging, PO , Finalised Trans by Ledger a/c and many more.<br />
<br />
One example,  supplier aging analysis report which suppose to print the supplier name for each supplier follow by their invoices details, but now the supplier name only appear once in each page, even though there are more than one suppliers on same page.<br />
<br />
I have looked at those reports, and those report layouts (ttadv3131s000) with before.fields and lattr.break in the Output Expr are affected.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help will be very much appreciated.</div></div><hr />
