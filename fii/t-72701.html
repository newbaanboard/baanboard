We accidently paid a supplier twice in cash management (they only got one actual payment). First time as a One-Time supplier and second time as an established supplier. The check is in paid status. is there any way to cancel one of the checks? <br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Appreciate your help.<br />

It has already affected GL. It means your supplier has encashed both the check. So only way to do is raise a debit note.</div></div><hr />
