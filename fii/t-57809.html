I have a purchase order that has 2 items.  Both items had a price change, yet they were handled differently on tfacp240.  Both items had a price change on the same day and were both received the following day.  tfacp240 for one item has the original price and the other has the new price.<br />
tfacp240.oamt<br />
Does anyone have an idea about how this can happen?<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />
