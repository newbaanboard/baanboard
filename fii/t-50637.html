So when goods are booked in (issue) or out of production (receipt) it is not possible to have financial bookings? Also delivering a produced customized item (on a sales order) does not result in a financial booking?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, for customized items this is not possible.<br />
<br />
Also delivering a produced customized item (on a sales order) does not result in a financial booking?<br />
<br />
Delivering a customized item will trigger PCS/Cost of Goods Sold integration transactions, however, dependent on some parameter settings, these may not have a 1:1-relationship with the item sold.<br />

From this point of view, it is the same in Baan V and LN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's not. At least in LN you get receipt and issue transactions for *customized* items, so you get transactions within WIP. You don't get them in Baan IV.</div></div><hr />
