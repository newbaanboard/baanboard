<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">19th January 2005, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I am on BaanERP 5c. I want to impose the Credit Limit restrictions on Supplier. I see the field in &quot;Invoice From&quot; role of the BP. It doesn't seem to have any effect when I create a Purchase Order for much higher value than what I have given as Credit Limit. <br />
<br />
I would need to block creation of new Purchase Orders and subsequent Purchase Invoice for the supplier when the Credit Limit is exceeded. Also if this can be achieved, will the Order be blocked in case the Origin is through Enterprise Planning by means of Transfer of Planned Purchase Order. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">19th January 2005, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">The field that store &quot;Credit limit&quot; in &quot;Invoice From&quot; role of a BP is tccom122.crlr. I did a Pattern search for the field name across packages and it returned few scripts that has this field - tfacpdll0051, tdpur4501, tfacp2521,  and DAL of tccom122. And even in these scripts there is no validation against open orders/invoices. just DAL of tccom122 checks if Credit limit is set below zero.<br />
<br />
From what I have studied so far, the field is just a fancy item on the session's form and serves no real purpose. Please let me know if someone has a way to achive the requirement of enforcing credit limit restrictions on a supplier.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">19th January 2005, 13:28</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to look at Purchase order parameters, there you can specify whether the order must be blocked, or if you just want a signal to display a message for the user.<br />
<br />
You must also look at the order type for the order.  There is a place on the order type to set up the step at which the order must be blocked from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">3rd February 2005, 08:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I did check Purchase Order Parameters and there is no field that can block PO based on Credit limit. But Sales Order Parameter has the functionality.<br />
<br />
I did some more research and would safely conclude that:<br />
<br />
On the purchase side, the credit limit is used for display only in such sessions as tdpur4501m000 and ftacp2521m000 (plus a number of reports within ACP). This allows monitoring on a manual basis, so there are no automatic warnings or blockings that will enforce credit limit restrictions on a supplier within standard ERP in relation to exceeding the credit limit in purchasing. <br />
<br />
The reason for no enforcement of restriction on a supplier within ERP is that the supplier is granting the credit limit and they will set their own terms on enforcing credit limit restrictions.</div></div><hr />
