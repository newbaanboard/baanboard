What do we need to do to fix this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 08:24</div></div><div class="posttext">U have specified some accounts in tdinv8150m000/ tipcs8150m000 for purchase/receipt-material costs -results , which does not exist in tfgld0108m000. U can check the ledger account in tfgld4510m000 also for the related purchase order / project .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emgnde</div><div class="date">20th April 2004, 20:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We matched line 21 completely. Then approved. We put in acct# 205-0900 (Registered Invoices). We get error message Ledger account in integration table not found. <br />
<br />
For your reference:<br />
PO Line item 21 shows Cost Price Component = CSO, Warehouse = NPW. We added this warehouse and cost component for Transaction Origin=Purchase, Financial Transaction = Receipt in tdinv8150m000. This account is already in tfgld0108m000. <br />
<br />
What are we doing wrong? <br />
<br />
Screenprints have been attached to this post to show what we did.<br />
<br />
Picture 1  Matched completely line 21<br />
<br />
Picture 2  Approved<br />
<br />
Picture 3  Entered in ledger account. Is this the right account to use?<br />
<br />
Picture 4  Got error message Ledger account in integration table not found<br />
<br />
Picture 5  This is what PO line #21 looks like<br />
<br />
Picture 6  We added the account here to see if we wouldnt get the error message Ledger account not found in intergration table but we still get it.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
I think you have to add the Transaction Origin=&quot;Purchase&quot; with the Financial Transaction =&quot;Result&quot; in tdinv8150m000 for that warehouse and Cost Price Component. Then it should be possible to approve the invoice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">21st April 2004, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">As pegasus suggested do u have purchase / result mapping in tdinv8150m000 . For ftp valued items . invoice approval generates purchase/result only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emgnde</div><div class="date">22nd April 2004, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">We have added Warehouse NPW, Cost Comp. CSO for Purchase/Result in tdinv8150m000 (see attached screenprint), but we still get the error message. Do we also have to add something in &quot;Maintain Project Transaction Accounts Table&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pegasus</div><div class="date">22nd April 2004, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">If the purchase order is related to a project then you have to add it there as well. Otherwise I don't think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emgnde</div><div class="date">22nd April 2004, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">By adding Cost type= Materials, Trans Origin=Project, Financial Trans=Hard Pegged Invoiced (PO), Warehouse=NPW to the Maintain Project Transaction Accounts Table fixed the problem. <br />
<br />
We just need to have a better understanding of transaction types and where they are used. Do you know where we can get that information?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for all of your help.</div></div><hr />
