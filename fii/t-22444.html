thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Now the payment batch is under the non-finalized transaction and the amount is already debited in the Bank account and credited in 2 accounts (the trade creditors account and non-trade creditors account).<br />
<br />
<br />
If I delete the batch from the table, is it possible the quantity in the 3 accounts won't be deleted?<br />
<br />
<br />
What I want to do is change the payment date in compose payment so that the payment term will be in October rather than September.<br />
If it is possible, I don't want to delete any information, just change the payment term only.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your info.<br />
