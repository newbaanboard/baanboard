I was doing the last final close for period 12 and 13, right before close year, and then the &quot;total debit/credit do not balance&quot; occurred.  I did find that the <br />
A/P ledger account was off .03 cents between the first amount and the second amount in the tfgld203 and tfgdl206 files so I changed these and the level totals.  I can now close the year with no errors (but when I try to finally close then the error occurs and when I run the debit and credit differences only report, it finds no differences. I have sql's on both 203 and 206 files and there is no differences there. Also the balances in 106 I find no  transactions that have a difference between the amounts.  Only using one currency.  I can't rebuild history because I have already past that step. <br />
<br />
What exactly triggers that message? What files and transactions are being processed in the final close?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions will help.  Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had same problem in past then when we analysed we came to know that there is problem in tfgld106.amth. <br />
<br />
In one document amount stored .02 for debit and .015 for credit because of that system was not able to close the order.<br />
<br />
You have to identify the document and change the value .015 to .02. This will solve the problem.<br />
<br />
Please check.<br />
<br />
with regards,<br />
