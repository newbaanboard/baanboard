<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">25th October 2005, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on Baan IVc4 SP13 (Going to SP15 in November).<br />
<br />
Our Finance department has a new AP Manager and apparently the old AP Manager did not document anything related to the clean-up of the GRINYA Accounts, nor did that person do much to clean up smaller amounts remaining on the report...  IT to the rescue(?).<br />
<br />
I understand the concept of what the GRINYA Account holds and how it gets there and how is should be relieved from the account.  But am not clear as what the whole 'Accepting Values' is and the new manager is especially interested in the Global session hoping that they will be able to clean up a great deal of PO's with it at once instead of one at a time.<br />
<br />
Attached is an example of what remains on our &quot;Print Receivable Invoice Specifications - Financial&quot;.  We have many, many PO's with this same scenario (&lt; $.05 balance).  <br />
<br />
Is there a way to remove all of these at once using the Global Acceptance of GRINYA session?  Is that what that session is used for?<br />
<br />
I've come across a correction program tfcor1240m000... what is this used for (and just as important when should it be used over the 'standard' procedure).<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!  I'm currently trying to wade through the &quot;User's Guide to Analyze the Invoices Receivable Account&quot; (U7515D US), but I don't seem to belong to the 'target' audience for which it was written (or I'm thick in the head - which could very well be the case).<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you accept, finalize and archive these orders, they can be eliminated. But the global acceptance session does not have any 'tolerance' and hence it will accept everything, if you select 'debit and credit balanced' =No. In that case, you can use the correction session to make the balance zero, where you can give tolerance. Remember, the correction session creates entries in GL. <br />
<br />
Also, did you run the session print invoice specs-financial, with full specification = 'yes'? If so, at the end of the report you will get the difference between transactions and ledger history. It must be zero. <br />
<br />
As far as GRINYA module is concerned, everything is done at the interim table tfacp135. No entries are created in the GL(not tfcor1240m000). Archiving just deletes the records from the interim table and puts a flag in table tcmcs095 with the year and period. Once you archive, you cannot select the records before the archived period. But at any point of time you can redo the GRINYA reconciliation by resetting the archive period in table tcmcs095 and start reconciliation from the beginning. So, experimenting is not a problem. <br />
