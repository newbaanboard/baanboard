<br />
I'm interested in doing this from a performance point of view but I also want to transfer the ledger balances into the history company so that I have the ledger balances with the transactional history behind it.<br />
<br />
I think I need to run tfgld6206m000 and tfgld6205m000 followed by the sessions for removing fully paid invoices.<br />
<br />
I'm talking to support re: patches and more info but if there's anybody out there who's done this some feedback would be useful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">12th June 2002, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">first run remove fully paid purchase invoices tfacp2250m000 and  run remove fully paid sales invoices tfacp2260m000 the gld106 recordeds will not transfer if the reference exists in tfacp200 or tfacr200.<br />
<br />
then run tfgld6205m000 <br />
<br />
I think it is better not to run tfgld6206m000 instead dump tables<br />
tfgld201 202 203 204 205 206 import to archive company, you can then still see the old balances in the live company rather than moving them to the archive. <br />
<br />
Also the setting in maintain group company parameters for store data for x years determines how many years of past data can be archived.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I strongly recommend that you have the latest Baan solutions loaded for Year-End.  There is a general solution for this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback,<br />
<br />
Yes Juli I do mean archive Sales / Purchase invoices as opposed to deleting them.<br />
<br />
Good tip on dumping the tables Darren I really do need to see the balances in both companies and I believe that tfgld6206m000 removes the history from the original company. The only downside to this approach would be that these tables also contain data for years that isn't archived as yet.<br />
<br />
I certainly intend getting the latest sols for these sessions from support before continuing.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

Or setup an exchange export and import scheme and put a condition script on either export or import to ignore  the ones you don't want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did it went well?<br />
<br />
Could you please share your experience?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 16:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
Yes I did successfully archive for tfgld106.<br />
<br />
I think once I'd got the latest solutions and understood how the sessions worked it went very well.<br />
<br />
Basically I just ran tfgld6206m000 followed by tfgld6205m000.<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head the prerequisties for running these sessions were that the year in question had to be finally closed and I also adjusted the Store Data for x years parameter in the group company parameters to get the session to run.<br />
<br />
These sessions are also the last ones I run in my archiving strategy as they stand a better chance of archiving the maximum amount of data.<br />
<br />
If you require any further details please let me know.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you very much for your quick reply.<br />
<br />
Do you remember if you have archived Integration Transactions (tgld41X) before archiving tfgld106?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Ant√≥nio Domingues</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I actually ran tfgld4210m000 twice.<br />
<br />
On the first run I tranferred to history and then I ran the session from the history company to remove them.<br />
<br />
On the second run I printed the report to a file.<br />
<br />
I would suspect that it's not really necessary to run the session twice but I removed them to the history company and then waited for a couple of months before finally removing them.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Thank you very much, it was very kind of you.<br />
<br />
Actually I'm looking for someone who had experienced archiving tfgld106 without having archived integration transactions before. I would like to know what's the real impact of that.<br />
