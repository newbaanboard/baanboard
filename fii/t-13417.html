Currently we are using pre-printed checks and running them through our printer and printing the check remitance copy as a copy of our check.<br />
<br />
I would like to know what it would require to make the conversion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">28th October 2003, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually our office in the US is printing MICR font on the check which is being printed directly out of Baan. I did the basic setup, the fine tuning has been done on location.<br />
<br />
We had to buy the micr font, code it in the report. The micr font should be installed on each pc from which check are going to be printed. Since the bw settings are stored in the registry you have to configure it on each workstation. The link between the font used in the report has to be created by printing a preview, right click the line that should be printed in micr font and link it to the windows font.<br />
<br />
You have to fullfill a lot of requirements but it's possible to do it directly out of Baan. <br />

I have made several customizations to the AP check report layout.   One of my clients prints the MRC line using the special font described in the previous post.   They also use only a single part check that is 8 1/2 by 11.   The report is layed out in three parts.  The  invoices paid is on the top third, then the check, and the invoices are repeated again on the bottom third.   There is a perferation between each third.   They send the top two thirds to the supplier, and keep the bottom third for their records.   This way they could elimate the two part form.<br />
