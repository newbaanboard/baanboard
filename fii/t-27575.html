<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aliceK</div><div class="date">24th July 2006, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for answering<br />
I understand if the same account is used in the same session (tfacp0111s000 maintain ledger accounts by customer as control account, but there is used totally different account and also in acr the account is not used as control account...<br />
still the problem remains.:&quot;account should not be a customer/supplier control account&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there some other place where same account could be defined as control or smth? or could  it be just used  in some stage as control acc accidentally and changed afterwards and baaN doesn't allow it to be used anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">28th July 2006, 09:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the account was once used as a Control account and then changed. <br />
Please have a look by ttaad4500  for table tf gld 008 on the account. There you find a sign, how many times it was used as control account. <br />
