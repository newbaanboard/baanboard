<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jwlebec</div><div class="date">26th July 2002, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I plan to use the fixed assets module. But I would like to know what the best grouping of the assets I have to set up.<br />
I see two possibilities.<br />
I create main groups and groups according to the kind of assets I have and I do not pay attention to the depreciation method they have.<br />
Or I group the assets according to their depreciation method (straight-line, double declining...).<br />
<br />
What 's the best way?<br />
<br />
I am also a little bit confused by the fact that I can only use one depreciation method for posting to Finance. This will not clarify the maintenance.<br />
<br />
If anyone has a clue It will be kindly welcome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its better to group assets and form main groups based on the characteristics and common features of ur fixed asset. also you have another level of grouping Parent Fixed Asset wherein u can define a Fixed Asset and attach it as a Parent Fixed Asset.<br />
<br />
For depreciation purposes, master can be maintained for group level and asset level as well, based on the needs of the organisation. <br />
<br />
For posting depreciation transactions to Finance(GLD) there can be only one depreciation code which should be effected at the FAS Parameter itself.<br />
<br />
Using this code one can define specific depreciation methods and systems at the group level and fixed asset level which are part of the Depreciation b-oject in the FAS module.<br />
<br />
to conclude it is advisable to group assets based on some common characteristics and not to confuse with Depreciation as its taken care of by a separate b-object.<br />
