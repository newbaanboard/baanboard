For instance, if price for item A is 50(tax included, rate is 17%), quantity is 1000.<br />
When user entry PO, have to convert the price to net price (that is 50/1.17=42.735), then user will entry price at 42.74, and the order total amount would be 42.74*1000*1.17 = 50,005.8<br />
differ from contract = 5.8<br />
And if invoice from vendor is still 50,000, then there would be different in incoming  tax, and IR/GR.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to record price inculding tax?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
