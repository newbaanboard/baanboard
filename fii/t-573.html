<br />
I haven't come across anything like that.  What would the reason be for loading invoices in this way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We are looking to interface employee expenses. We have a workflow application that records and authorises these. As the data is already there (in an access database), it seems pointless to get our AP clerks to reenter it in Baan.<br />
To be honest, the Baan Vendor Invoice (Cost Invoice) entry is not ideal for expenses as the clerk has to know the appropriate account codes.<br />
You can use transaction schedules but without a multiple line option it's all a bit nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 12:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you thought of using API to create a solution to this?  API allows you to make use of existing session functionality to load data into your system.  It will do all the necessary error and reference checking for you which is simpler than try to code this into exchange scripts.<br />
<br />
There are a few threads on this in the Tools forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once I implemented a module interfacing a commision system <br />
with Baan Finance (Baan IV). It uses a very flexible way of doing the integration, with finance people able to map from the &quot;logical&quot; types of costs (as defined in the external software) to the respective ledger accounts. There are two integration tables that are filled from the external system and a session that will book the data from those tables to finance. (Similar concept as the Baan integration Logistic/Finance). All gld and acp tables are<br />
filled correctly. Some slight adjustments may be necessary, but I <br />
think this module is basically exactly what you need. I still have (and own) the code. I am working as a freelancer Baan consultant. <br />
<br />
Please feel free to get into contact with me, if you're interested. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />
Uli</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, I was just after a quick and dirty solution to a problem in an area (Baan Exchange) that I am capable of using.<br />
More difficult applications will be handled by development people we have access to that will write Baan OpenWorld BOI's.<br />
This will just cost us more.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A Chakrabarti</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 09:20</div></div><div class="posttext">For Employee expenses, we have done it by the following steps:<br />
<br />
- File conversion to convert data to appropriate format as per requirement in Baan.<br />
<br />
- Use Baan exchange to populate tables required for importing Journal Vouchers into Baan.<br />
<br />
- Use Import Vouchers session in Baan<br />
<br />
- Finalise the batch<br />
<br />
For Vendor Invoicing, you will have to develop a customised session to import the data.<br />
<br />
For a one-time job, the efforts for above may not be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Surely the import vouchers session is for importing journal entries only i.e. General Ledger. How does one populate the ACP tables?<br />
<br />
I'm probably completely misunderstanding what you're saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Amlan means that the Import Journal vouchers session will work correctly if you only loaded info into the ledger.  To load invoices which affect creditors you'll have to create your own session.<br />
<br />
Seeing as you're not keen on developing anything new, I think your best bet is probably Baan Exchange.  I suggest you enter an invoice manually and see which tables it updates.  You can then use that information to create your exchange schemes.  Your transactions will most likely affect the following tables.<br />
<br />
tfgld100<br />
tfgld101<br />
tfgld018<br />
tfgld102<br />
tfgld107<br />
tfacp200<br />
<br />
There may be some that I have missed in the list, but these should take care of the main ones.  It may take a few goes to get it working 100% eg. references correct, but I'm sure it can be done using some condition scripts along the way to catch any obvious errors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My advise would be what advised by Maria .. go for API as this will update all the required tables.. Moreover it is not difficult to use anyways....<br />
<br />
Give it a thought...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">8th January 2002, 01:18</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, I  might just go for it.<br />
Thanks for the advice and list of tables.<br />
<br />
It might be a while before I get around to it, but I'll let you know how it goes.</div></div><hr />
