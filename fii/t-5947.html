<br />
I have a problem when running tfacr2240m000 write off payment differences.<br />
<br />
when I try to run this on a invoice that has a invoice balance of 0 but a HC balance of 0.01 I try to write off this small difference but when I run this session it comes back and says no data, could this be because the balance on the invoice is 0.01 on the HC and the invoice balance is 0?  <br />
<br />
do you know a workaround? is there a rebuild session? I have already run tfcor0261<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

I am sure I checked that first but I double checked it and found it was a currency diff!<br />

The reason may be as follows:<br />
The program does not create Crr. Dif. if it is &quot;Zero&quot; in all currencies.<br />
It decides about an amount being &quot;zero&quot; by comparing it to<br />
a tollerance tcmcr.tole that is computed via <br />
tcmcr.dll0001  and tfgld.dll0061 and depends on certain currency<br />
and domains definitions.<br />
Usually it should return 0.001 so 0.01 will not mean zero, but if it happens to return a bigger amount than 0.01 is treated like &quot;zero&quot; and no C.D amounts are created.<br />
