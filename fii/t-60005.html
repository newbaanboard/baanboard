My problem is <br />
Account ppl are doing month end closing,when they post for sales record, no error..but when they print non finalized report, one invoice is not exist.<br />
<br />
so I check &quot;display integration transaction by project/order&quot; ,the order for above invoice is exist, but only have  financial transaction = &quot;issue&quot; with status=&quot;posted&quot;.<br />
