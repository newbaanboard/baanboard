<br />
If you have set up your company with Cash Flow concept, you should be able to print the cash flow transactions and cash flow statement using the cash flow reasons that were setup.<br />
<br />
The output of the cash flow, you can use the session Cash Flow Transactions (tfgld1523m000). Click on Print icon in the session and you will be given a choice of what you want to print. In order to print the Cash Flow Statement, you will need to setup the statement format first.<br />
<br />
As for the Sources of Earnings, I am not sure what is the usage yet.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps on the function of cash flow.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
