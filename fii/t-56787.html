<br />
We have a big issue with a full update of Sales Statistic. It has been running for 3 days now. It has 10 milj records and we have not archived since 2002and is still running. <br />
<br />
My question:<br />
<br />
Is it possible to just update year 2007-2009 and not all years?<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions as we need to print our sales reports`<br />
<br />
If we deactivate sorts. What kind of problem can this cuase on out buisness?<br />
<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />

Why not archive - you can still print reports from the archive company if you need to?  You can deactivate sorts, but then reports that use them will not work - but you can always reactivate them later and that will take a long time if the tables are big.<br />
<br />
Do you really have to do a full update?  Perhaps you should also have a look at your server processor, memory, and disk performance.</div></div><hr />
