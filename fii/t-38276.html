<br />
I have to customize a report for overdue amount for the customer. Baan std report does not serve the purpose  how i can make that report which tables i have to use and the logic also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">29th June 2007, 06:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The main table will be tfacr200.   <br />
<br />
First off you'll want to select only records that tfacr200.tdoc is empty as this will exclude the various linking transactions.    Then a business decision is necessary to select what document types (tfacr200.trec) you want to include/exclude<br />
<br />
Then select any records where the balance is not zero: tfacr200.balc &lt;&gt;0.  You might consider not only printing the balance but also the original amount (tfacr200.amnt)  And you should always print the currency code (tfacr200.ccur)<br />
<br />
And lastly you want to pick only records where the due date is earlier than the current date: tfacr200.dued<br />
<br />
Once you have the overdue records you'll probably need tccom112, tccom100, tccom130, tccom139 to get the business partner (customer) and address details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The better condition for checking whether the balance is zero or not will be<br />
tfacr200.bala - tfacr200.balc &lt;&gt; 0.<br />
<br />
Because, there is always a chance that cheque has been issued and not yet reconciled.</div></div><hr />

I guess u need to calculate the same instead of using balc &lt;&gt; 0 condition  for all records less than upto date. U may need to use discount 1+2+3 , payment different , currency difference  , LPS  etc also in considering payment received .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madan.meegada</div><div class="date">19th July 2007, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">The Request is that when the Baan Standard Report do not serve the purpose.  Standard Report is Aging Analysis Report only I guess.  Anyway the suggestion you gave is also fine.  We can customize the Aging Analysis Report</div></div><hr />
