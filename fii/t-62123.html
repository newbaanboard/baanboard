<br />
We are in the process of evaluating Infor10 ERP Enterprise (LN) 6.1 FP7.<br />
<br />
I am focusing on the LN processes around customer cheque payments, banking and matching to bank statement.<br />
<br />
Typical business processes are;<br />
<br />
1. Customers sends cheques to the account receivable department with remittance advices.<br />
<br />
2. A cash receipt batch is created in the system and <br />
<br />
3. Individual receipts are created (within the receipt batch) and allocated to the invoices in the system <br />
<br />
4. Cheques are sent to the bank with one deposit slip attached<br />
<br />
5. Electronic bank statements are uploaded to the system. <br />
<br />
6. There is one credit entry in the bank statement representing the cheques deposit from step 4<br />
<br />
7. The bank statement line is matched with the cash receipt batch. Subsequently individual cash receipts within the receipt batch are all matched.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if there are LN functions to accommodate step 2, 3 and 7 above? <br />
<br />
Regards<br />

This is certainly possible, in the cash module you can enter a receipt batch with receipt lines. Alternatively you can enter remittance advices manually or import via flat files. Adding receipt lines afterwards is of course possible.<br />
In the reconciliation process, which is standard LN, the bank statement lines can be reconciled against the receipt lines line by line or batchwise. Bank statements can also be imported via flat files and matched automatically via predefined matching criteria.<br />
If you need more information let me know.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
