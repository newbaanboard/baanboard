<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eric12</div><div class="date">1st July 2010, 12:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a company outside EU, selling and working inside EU countries.<br />
Due to this, the company has several VAT registration in EU countries. This results in the demand for EU reporting, even though the company is outside EU.<br />
The VAT is handled through the setup of tax code by country, but how about the Intrastat and Sales Listing?<br />
Can that be handled in Baan (Baan IV)?<br />
<br />
Anybody tried something similar?</div></div><hr />
