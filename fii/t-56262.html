<br />
Fiscal period change are generated when period on a  document line differs from batch fiscal period  (in order to keep batch balanced in all period ).<br />
<br />
Interim closing is an B/S account to which all P&amp;L balances at year end gets transferred :)and P&amp;L a/cs become zero .</div></div><hr />

The Interim- Statutory and Compliment  for the moving balance ofthe difference periods. <br />
The ledger account used for unbalanced transactions with transaction lines from two different periods.<br />
I think these clearly for you..<br />
