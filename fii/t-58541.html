<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medtun</div><div class="date">2nd June 2010, 19:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I entered all the parameters specified in Help in order to create delivery notes. <br />
I also created an &quot;invoicing request&quot; that allows to use delivery notes. <br />
Every thing seems to be ok : each time goods are sold and shipped, i gets a delivery note document with its own number.<br />
The problem that is when i wants to create invoice for the sold quantities, i cannot find any delivery note to convert. <br />
I can find sale orders and i can create invoices for them. But i can't find any delivery note. although the fields for delivery notes are activated.<br />
<br />
Have you already faced this problem ?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
