<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">21st February 2006, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a similar issue. We needed to know the link between a receipt and the corresponding invoice and order details. I have created a session for this purpose. The user enters a receipt document number and upon tabbing the corresponding invoice number and order nr + pos. are displayed on screen instantly (fetching of data based on tables tfgld106 and tfacp250).<br />

If anyone finds it useful, I can post the source.</div></div><hr />
