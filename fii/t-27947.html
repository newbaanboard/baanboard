Sine it is primarily a Finance and Logistics(Sales &amp; Pur) business I was wondering if there are any special reporting requirements for NEtherlands or Euro (other than VAT tax) that is different from US reporting.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any information to help in planning the finance company set-up.<br />

About VAT: not sure if you will use Baan4 of Baan5, the Intra EU VAT logic is not available in BaaN4</div></div><hr />
