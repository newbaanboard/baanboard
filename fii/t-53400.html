   Our Post Integration job reported an error yesterday when it reached the combination Purchase Order-Result. The error was..<br />
Table tfgld008000 does not exist.<br />
Cannot continue..<br />
After terminating the job and checking the Integration Transaction by Project/Order it was found out that for one particular Purchase Order, the combination of Purchase Order-Result was picking 000 as Fin Company and 0000-0 as the Fiscal Year/Period. The Purchase Order-Receipt combo for the same order got posted but the Result part got stuck because of the wrong Fin Company and Periods. <br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me why this would have happened? <br />
<br />
The same combination got posted the day before without any hiccups and there has been no changes in the integration setup.<br />
<br />
To rectify this, could we use GTM to manually feed in the correct Fin company &amp; Period and then post again? <br />
<br />

Check the table for other records with company 000 and change them with GTM<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">20th August 2008, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
   Its not just the fin year or fin company but other crucial information like supplier, dimensions, ledgers etc are missing from the Integration table for the above mentioned combination... Finding the reason was part of the knee-jerk reaction... Its the rectification thats high on the list...<br />
<br />
Apart from tfgld410, is there any other table i need to look into or do any modification to rectify this problem?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">20th August 2008, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Update..<br />
<br />
I filled up the missing information in tfgld410, 415 &amp; 417 for the above mentioned combo and now a new error is being thrown back..<br />
<br />
Read Row Error 506 on tfgld007000 <br />
Error 506 Table does not exist <br />
Cannot continue...<br />
<br />
..gld007 is Period Status table and i can see the fiscal year &amp; period 2008 -08 is set as Open for ACP, ACR, CMG &amp; GLD in this table...<br />
<br />
Have i missed out on updating any table other than whats already mentioned? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">21st August 2008, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">..Final Update.<br />
<br />
Resolved the situation as i missed out on one other table tfgld418..<br />
So in all, i had to manually update gld410, 415, 417 &amp; 418 and the collective fields that needed to rectified manually included Fin Company, Fisc Year/Period, Tax Year/Period, Supplier Code, Reference, Fin Supplier Group, Country, Area &amp; Line of Business<br />
<br />
