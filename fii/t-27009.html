We have a facility in Mexico that will be issuing checks, but will send the invoices to our Corporate headquarters in Minnesota for approval.  How do we set up an authorization system in Baan to prevent checks being printed without the proper authorization?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">3rd May 2006, 20:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you fully defined which staff (US or Mexican) will perform various parts of the AP process?  Who is going to enter the invoices into Baan, match them, approve them, pay them through the system?<br />
<br />
<br />
One possibilty, based on the information you provided is that you could set up a new Bank Relation and a new Payment Method specifically assigned for the Mexican invoices.  That way you could have you US staff select invoices for payment by that Bank Relation/Payment Method combination (Mexican specific), review invoices for payment and then generate the checks using a check printer set up to print at the facility in Mexico.<br />
<br />
Your Finance department should be able to provide answers to the above questions, that may help with a solution.</div></div><hr />
