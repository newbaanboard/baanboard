When using this tax code in a sales invoice line, it calculates the tax amount considering the discounts based on the terms of payment selection.<br />
My users in accounting say this is a bug. Are we missing something in the setup of the tax code? or how other companies handle this?<br />

<br />
It's not a bug, the correct calculation depends on local tax regulations, some countries differentiate between early payment discount and late payment surcharge in the treatment of tax on sales invoices.</div></div><hr />
