I noticed the due date calculation for supplier invoice is based on the invoice date. Can it be based on the receipt date (tdpur045.date) ?<br />
<br />
Supplier sometime sent invoice to us even before they delivery the goods. Although our finance department can't approve the invoice, but then we actually made payment too earlier when the goods ia finally deliveried.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you want is that after matching to the receipt(s) the due date on the invoice is being recalculated and that is functionality, which is not present.<br />
Also here you can have problems, because if an invoice is matched to multiple receipts, what receipt date has to be taken then, the oldest receipt I guess?<br />
<br />
This recalculation of due date after matching is something that definitely not all users would want, so it should be parameter driven. Anyway it is not present (yet).<br />
