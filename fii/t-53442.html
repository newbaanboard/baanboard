We have made one Sales Order through maintain sale order  (tdsls4101m000) of Qty 4306 for the value of  RO.3616.453 in favor of  ”FACTORY CASH SALES” instated of “SHOW ROOM” (where originally should be made)   We have the practice of activating  SALES CONTRACT  for all customers &amp; accordingly, the value of the material is automatically generated. Whereas, for the Factory cash sales &amp; Show room sale, no Sales Contract is made &amp; the person making the Sale order should manually select the price for them.<br />
<br />
In order to correct the same we made MRN against same qty and the concerned person  forgot to enter the value of qty which resulted ZERO value in the MRN.<br />
<br />
Then, So as to correct the value of SALES FIGURE we passed the SCN (sales credit note) for RO.3616.453 manually through accounts to reduce the value of SALES <br />
but stock value is not reduced. In Sales Order History by Customer and Items session report (tdsls5401m000) and itmswise cost component on sale session report (tdsls0451m900) the value of the said qty is not effected.<br />
<br />
As per Trial Balance(tfgld3402m000) sales values is showing RO. 54132.046. &amp; in Sales Order History by Customer and Items session report (tdsls5401m000)  the value shows RO. 57,857/195 and Itemwise Cost Component on sale session report (tdsls0451m900)<br />
Is Showing invoice value RO.57,748.500 <br />
<br />
We are getting difference is 3616.453 in both the sessions <br />
SALES ORDER HISTORY BY CUSTOMER &amp; ITEM <br />
ITEMWISE COST COMPONENT <br />
<br />
How can we correct this difference?   <br />
For your information, We made the correct SALES ORDER in favor of SHOW ROOM to the above exact qty &amp; value also subsequently.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and looking forward to hearing help from you in this regards.<br />

<br />
In my opinion,  you should have created a Sales Return Order instead of Sales Credit Note.<br />
