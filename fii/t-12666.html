<br />
Does anyone out there no the difference between the following integration transactions. (Baan ERP Version 5B)<br />
<br />
Warehousing Valuation Retroactive Val Adjustment<br />
Warehousing Valuation Value Correction<br />
Production Price Variance<br />
Production Efficiency Variance<br />
<br />
I understand the difference between Retroactive Val Adj and the Value Correction. However up until now I have not seen any of the other two transactions being processed in our system.<br />
<br />
Any information would be gratefully accepted.<br />
<br />
Thanking you in anticipation<br />

Both types of variances are posted (if non zero) when you close a production order.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply. I am aware of how the manufacturing variances price and efficiency are calculated. My problem is that I not sure if Baan is doubling up with transactions when it creates the other two transaction types.<br />
<br />
Do you know what the difference is between the four transactions?<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
<br />

<br />
Attached you can find a document with the answer in it for the latest two transactions.<br />
<br />
Currently I'm searching for the first two.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaap Roos</div><div class="date">25th August 2003, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">The following formulas are used to calculate price and efficiency variances. <br />
Price variance = (estimated price  actual price) x actual quantity<br />
Efficiency variance = estimated price x (estimated quantity  actual quantity)<br />
Calculation variance = Production results  Price variance  Efficiency variance</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
&quot;Warehousing Valuation Retroactive Val Adjustment&quot;<br />
&quot;Warehousing Valuation Value Correction&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I have noticed that these integrations transactions occurs when you execute the session &quot;whina1516m000 Inventory Variances&quot; (Maybe there are differences between PO and Purchase Invoice or maybe the variations in Production &quot;Add.Calc. Office Variance&quot;). The reason of this process is because you want to assume the differences in the cost of the item.<br />
<br />
If you don´t  have used the inventory, the system only creates one of the two transactions (I think the 2nd), but if you have used any quantities, the system creates the two integrations.<br />
<br />
You can set up the integrations; you can adjust the inventory and the uses of the inventory in differents ledger accounts using these 2 Intregration Transactions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please do your test.</div></div><hr />

Thankyou for your reply and very useful information.<br />
I will read the contents of the document and post my observations to this site.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">27th August 2003, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Find attached a fairly large document that explains the inventory variances. It has been supplied by Baan.</div></div><hr />

Thankyou for the document it helps to explain some of the questions that I have had. I am in the process of setting up a number of costing related test scenario's to ensure the correct integration mapping is put in place.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

<br />
It is my understanding from doing some substantial testing that the system generates a number of financial variance related transactions.<br />
<br />
In particular the Warehouse (Val) Value Correction &amp; Retroactive Val Adj transactions appear to be duplications if you have mapped the following variances.<br />
<br />
Production Price Variance<br />
Productiin Efficiency Variance<br />
Production Add Calc Office Variance<br />
<br />
I have found that for manufactured items the Warehouse (Val) transactions are not necessary. However if the item is a Purchased item then mapping is required.<br />
<br />
It should be borne in mind that are costing system uses FIFO.<br />
<br />
I hope this is of help to someone.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
<br />
Norman</div></div><hr />
