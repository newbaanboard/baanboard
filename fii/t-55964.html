<br />
Does anybody has a clue how to undo a Sales Order with the status &quot;Awaiting definite invoice&quot;? <br />
<br />
We like to do this without putting credit notes into the system, so bassicaly we generated an outbound and released it we can create a return order for that Sales Order but still the status wouldn't change. Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
