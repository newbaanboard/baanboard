<br />
we are in a single logistic and multi finance company and use the entity to entity relations in order to create invoices between different entities. In the integration mapping scheme &quot;sales invoicing (intrac.)&quot; the accounts can be setup for these sort of invoices. Unfortunately it is not possible to destinguish between intra- and intercompany invoices as both sort of invoices do pick the accounts from the above mentioned setting. But of course it is a differnce if invoices are send from one entity to another within the same financial company or if there are transactions between entities belonging to 2 seperate fin. companies. At the moment I am using the same account for income and COGS by using different integration elements - but that seems to be only the second best solution. I would be very interested how other companies are handling this sort of situation.<br />
