<br />
Are the input parameters set correctly ?<br />
<br />
For example is the year, user login code, batch numbers, fiscal/reporting periods, set so as to select the batches needed.<br />
<br />
Are you able to select the batches using  Select Batches for Finalisation?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">7th February 2005, 07:53</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Terry,<br />
yes, actually i've set all the required parameters correctly (year, company, batch number, transaction entry date, fiscal period).<br />
<br />
The problematic batch can be selected using session tfgld1210 (Global Selection of Batches for Finalization).<br />
<br />
Anyway, the batch don't showed up in Select Batches for Finalization.<br />

<br />
Check out the run number (you can to so in tfgld100)<br />
<br />
Go to this run number and try to finalise it again. If there is any error try to fix them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">8th February 2005, 03:02</div></div><div class="posttext">hi mprakash,<br />
actually the batch cannot be linked to any run number because as i mentioned before, the batch don't showed up in session Select Batches for Finalization.<br />
So, the batch still hasn't any link to any finalization run number.<br />
<br />
In table tfgld100, the Batch Status = Ready, Finalization Run Number = 0, Finalization Status = 1 (Free), Select = 2 (No).<br />
<br />
Anybody please help...... :( <br />

What is the status in tfgld101 ? Note this table may have more than one record for the batch depending on how many transaction types there are in the batch<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rcitra</div><div class="date">8th February 2005, 06:46</div></div><div class="posttext">hi Terry,<br />
i look in table tfgld101 and the value in field Transaction Type Lockin  is 1 (Free)  :eek: . Should I modify (via session ttaad4100) the value of this field to 4 (Ready) so the problematic batch can be finalized?<br />
<br />

Check if the batch number you have problems with is present in gld106.<br />
If it is a manually created batch, you can try to enter the transaction type via maintain transactions, and then exit. If everything is ok, the gld101 status will change to ready.<br />
If it is an integration batch (or other automatically created), you can use the same approach, but you have to change the field &quot;Batch modifyable&quot; from no to yes. Then you can enter the batch manually. Of course you don't change anything in the transactions......<br />
<br />
In this way, you get the system to check, wheter it is ok, or not. Safer this way, and it only takes 10 seconds more.<br />
<br />

    You will check transactions record on thair batch that had transactions or not and try to check all of transaction type on batch that have no record transactions or not</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanmanindia69</div><div class="date">9th February 2005, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Richard,<br />
<br />
Transaction type batch status &quot;free&quot; in tfgld101 can mean any of the following:<br />
1.  A transaction type was inserted in session maintain transactions (tfgld1101m000), but transaction was not actually made.  Thus the transaction type is empty without any transaction in it.<br />
<br />
2.  The transaction is not balanced.  Possibly the user might have left it half way.  Or a system transaction itself might have a rounding off error or any such error.<br />
<br />
3.  Everything else is correct but the system has not updated the status to &quot;Ready&quot;<br />
<br />
Obviously possible solutions could be:<br />
<br />
1. First check if the transaction type in the said batch contains any transaction.  Just go to session tfgld1101m000, double click the said transaction type to enter into it.  Empty inside? come out and delect the transaction type record.<br />
<br />
2. If this was not the case, print non-finalized transaction for that particular batch and type, and see each document contained in it.  Look for any unbalanced documents.  Unbalanced?  Analyse the reason and accordingly rectify in tfgld102 thru. session ttaad4100<br />
<br />
3. If this was also not the case, and it is a pure case of system not updating the status, go to tfgld101 and rectify the status to &quot;Ready&quot;<br />
<br />
Please note, GTM correction should always be the last resort, and only when you are sure of the reason and inter-relation of the field with the other table/fields.  Otherwise, GTM corrections may lead to a lot of complications.<br />
<br />
Tell me if this helped you<br />
<br />
All the best + Cheers<br />

i did some checking as you've suggested, and found that our case is neither no.1 or no.2. So we can confirm that it's a pure system failure in updating the status.<br />
<br />
I did the GTM correction (table tfgld101) and the batch now can be finalized.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.  ;) <br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Richard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I forgot to tell one thing.  Even for the last case also, GTM correction is not required.  Just enter into the transaction and come out... the status is automatically changed to &quot;Ready&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, now the GTM change is done, no issue.  All the best.<br />
<br />
