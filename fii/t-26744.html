<br />
I have problem with the integration transactions for production order. I want to know:<br />
<br />
What is the significance of the session &quot;Integration transaction by Project/Order&quot; (tfgld4510m000)?<br />
<br />
What is the significance of transaction type &quot;Receipt&quot; in the above session and in which situation &quot;Receipt&quot; transaction should be generated? <br />
<br />
I have some case where &quot;Receipt&quot; transactions are generated with &quot;Issue&quot;, &quot;Subcontracting&quot; and &quot;Completion&quot; transactions but in some cases the &quot;Receipt&quot; transaction is not generated but other transactions are generated. I tried to figure out the difference but didn't get any clue. Is it depends on type of item used in production order, related to the financial company and/or enterprise unit of Warehouses and/or Business partner, or something else?<br />
<br />
Please, if someone explain the significance of the session, importance of transaction type &quot;Receipt&quot; and conditions when &quot;Receipt&quot; type transactions generate.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Every activity in logistics and manufacturing need to  be reflected in the financial status of a company. In BaanERP, the financial transactions that should result from activities in logistics and manufacturing are visible through the Integration transaction by Project/Order screen.<br />
<br />
When Manufacturing Order (MO) is lacking Receipt financial transaction, it simply means that no finished good is yet reported to have been produced by the said MO<br />

<br />
Paul, I totaly agreed with you. But, the problem is for some production order &quot;Receipt&quot; transaction is generated and for some production order only &quot;Issue&quot;, &quot;Subcontracting&quot; and &quot;Completion&quot; transactions are generated, however we are using the same session &quot;Report order completed&quot; (tisfc0520m000).<br />
<br />
I want to know:<br />
<br />
 What are the parameters that make this difference (BP, item in PO, warehouse etc)?<br />
 Is there some other session(s) that we can use to generate the &quot;Receipt&quot; transactions if it is not generated through the session &quot;Report order completed&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
MRF</div></div><hr />

The Production Order Receipt financial transaction should only be generated when the finished good (FG) reach the warehouse. Depending on the setting in your environment, the Report Orders Completed may only be the interface at which your production operators report the qty of FG they've produced. When that's the case, then the PIC for the FG warehouse must also separately report in BaanERP that he/she has received certain qty of FG from the production floor. He/she can do this through the normal Receipts screen. When things are all OK, then the qty reported by the production operator should match with qty reported by FG warehouse staff<br />
<br />
In short, Report Orders Completed doesn't always mean that the FG is in the warehouse already<br />

<br />
Again I am totaly agreed with you. Let me explain a bit so you can understand what I actually the situation. <br />
<br />
The session &quot;Warehouse order&quot; (whinh2500m000) shows two transactions against the purchase order, one is &quot;Issue&quot; and other is &quot;Receipt&quot;. Can I asume that the finished goods is received in the warehouse? The receipt transaction in finance (Integration transactions by project/order) is not generated. <br />
Now my question is, is there any possibility to generate the receipt transaction in finance (Integration transactions by project/order) if it is not generated but the Receipt transaction in warehouse order is generated ?<br />
<br />
I hope the situation is much clear.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

You should've told us earlier that you're asking specifically for production orders with subcontracted operations, not ones with merely normal operations. Anyway, here's a little explanation. It requires you to know cost accounting (I'm not sure which department of the company you're from. If you're from cost accounting sub-dept, then you should know these)<br />
<br />
Now, depending on which operation is subcontracted out of so many, the journal entries required will be different. <br />
<br />
If the one you subcontract is not the final operation in the series of production operations needed to produce the FG, then the journal entries should be:<br />
When receiving semi finished good from subcontractor (Subcontract type):<br />
Dr WIP department A (for example)<br />
Cr    AP accrual<br />
When reporting that the semi finished good is being passed to the next operation (Completion type):<br />
Dr WIP department B<br />
Cr    WIP department A<br />
<br />
However, if the subcontracted operation is the last production operation needed to produce the finished good (i.e. output of subcontracting can be sold right away to customer without any additional internal production activity), then the journal entries should be<br />
When receiving semi finished good from subcontractor (Subcontract type):<br />
Dr WIP department B (for example)<br />
Cr    AP accrual<br />
When FG is received in the FG warehouse (Receipt type):<br />
Dr Finished Good inventory<br />
Cr    WIP department B (for example)<br />
<br />
Hence, the Receipt transaction type doesn't always appear when subcontractors send you their output. You can read in the on-line help what each transaction type suppose to represent. And it requires you to know your production operations too (always good thing to know if you're in cost accounting sub-dept)<br />
