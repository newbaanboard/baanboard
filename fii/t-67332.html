<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ubhat12</div><div class="date">10th February 2015, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">We have made goods received advice,generated PIJ,finalised the batch transaction etc and paid the party by e-payment and ledgers debited and credited as usual.After some time  the bank statement came informing that  e-payment failed due to account closed.Thus the bank statement is presently un reconciled.<br />
Now party has submitted different account code.So how to make the payment again and how to reverse the previous entries and balance the ledger?one of my colleagues suggested that we make RBI's RTGS transaction or cheque payment .will it not create duplicate entries in the ledgers?How to reverse the previous transaction?Please help<br />

if anticipated, you can reject transaction &amp; make new payment against same invoice no.<br />
if Direct, you have to create debit note / credit note for invoice payment.</div></div><hr />
