<br />
i am comparing with the selective vendor with tfacp2421m000(ageing analysis) there is mismatch in balance amount. between standard and customised session<br />
<br />
what is the logic derived tfacp2421m000 ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you should run the session tfacp2245m000 (Recalculate Invoice from BP) session in simulate mode once, and then see if there is any discrepancy in the balances for the open invoices.<br />

<br />
I agree with Saroj Comments and want to add following points:<br />
1. What other fields you are considering. If you are using balh then you should not use any other field like discounts, payment difference, currency difference etc.<br />
2. For report you should use advance and unallocated type of payment also if in ageing you are considering advance/unallocated payment too.<br />
3. If anticipated mechanism is being used then the logic should be modified accordingly.<br />
<br />
I hope this will be useful.<br />
With regards,<br />
