<br />
We want to use single asset no. for one &amp; more than one qty, let suppose two quantities &amp; both are distributed in two different segments each(like one segment in &quot;X&quot; &amp; another is &quot;Y&quot;).<br />
<br />
Now through Manual Sales Invoice Data, we want to sell out one qty. As I know we can select asset no. &amp; we can put qty also in manual sales invoice , my requirement is I want to sell out &quot;Y&quot; segment asset distribution line, then How can I select asset distribution line in manual sales invoice data? . Because system automatically picked “X” segment because of ascending order sequence.<br />
<br />
If we use Assets Disposal session in there we can select distribution line also, but the FAM transaction generated by this operation is not satisfy our requirement,in this Assets disposal A/c debited of Fixed Asset Integration-Disposal option through Integration Document Type FAM_PROC , instead of this a/c we want customer a/c should be debited by sales amount. <br />
For giving effect in customer a/c if we want to pass debit note transaction then system not allow credit Asset Disposal a/c because of fixed asset integration a/c nature , if we select asset no. in order to complete transaction then after finalized of debit note transaction system automatically generate FAM disposal transaction. This process cause double effect.<br />
<br />
So Manual sales invoice data is best, only problem is, there is no option to select Asset Distribution line.<br />
Is there is any other method, so please guide to me.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<br />
1. Raise the Manual Sales Invoice wherein you Credit an Interim account. This will affect the control account<br />
2. Pass Manual Journal Entry Debiting the Interim account and crediting the asset disposal account. At this time you select the asset which you want to select with the correct segment from the asset distribution lines.</div></div><hr />

i used this workaround to handle your issue:<br />
1. Used Asset Disposal session on FAM module, select correct distribution line and select suppress journal entry option also. with this selection, there will be no journal entries created during asset disposed processing.<br />
2. Used Manual Invoice data to create AR and Invoice without any integration to FAM module, don't forget to modify the mapping scheme for this kind transactions (credit ledger account on Manual Sales Invoice/Revenue Analysis - 10082802).<br />
3. Creates Journal Voucher entries to update your Fixed Asset, Accumulated Depreciation,Gain/loss asset disposal, credit ledger account resulted from no.2 processing accounts based on Asset transaction book inquiry session.<br />
<br />
hope, this will help you...</div></div><hr />
