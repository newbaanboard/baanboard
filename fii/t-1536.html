<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">28th March 2002, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a user who is attempting to change the setup of a ledger account within tfgld0108m000 - Maintain Chart of Accouts. They are attempting to change the second dimension to mandatory and the system returns the error message tfglds0487 - &quot;Empty dimensions found for this ledger account&quot;<br />
<br />
The ledger account in question does have transactions against it but a balance of zero. Am I correct in thinking that the system will not let us do this because there are transactions present or do we have a problem with our dimension setup.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">28th March 2002, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan support sent us the following regarding this problem.<br />
<br />
Dimensions are activated on ledger accounts with the status of either Not Used, Mandatory or Optional. When a dimension is originally activated as not used, it can only be changed to optional, not to mandatory. The reason as to why you can't change it to mandatory is because the ledger account has a balance in history. <br />
Work around: A recommendations to create a new Chart of Accounts which mimics the other account but uses the other dimensions. These two accounts, having the sub-level 0, can be pointed to a parent witch will allow the full report capturing through the parent without losing the data integrity. Another option is to create a new chart of accounts and block the old one to prevent its use. Changing though the table is not recommended because this too results in data integrity loss.</div></div><hr />

I suspected that would be the case if only the warning message was a little more precise.<br />
