<br />
I was originaly taught that when setting up integrations, purchase receipts should be set up for all types of items, inventoried or not.<br />
<br />
Also, it was explained to me that only inventoried items should have a purchase results, thus posting to a purchase price variance account.<br />
<br />
Today, my integrations are not posting.<br />
<br />
Problem 1) An item was posted (none inventory) in purchase receipts, but it did not post to purchase results.  Do I need to add a non inventory item to purchase results.  If so please help me understand why?<br />
<br />
Problem 2) An item is not posting to purchase receipts (error is cannot define account), BUT the itegration has been set up.<br />
<br />
I checked the &quot;Maintain Inventory &amp; WIP Transaction Accounts&quot; and that item group is there for Purchase Receipts by all the correct cost price components.<br />
<br />
If anyone can help, or offer advice please reply or email me.<br />

I had a similar error working with integrations.  It turned out that I had to use session tfgld109m000 Maintain Dimension ranges by ledger acount.  The range was not set correctly for the account I wanted my transactont to post to.  <br />
hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The dimension ranges per ledger account are normally created when you create a new ledger account. Did you copy it using the table maintenance session - that might explain why the dimension range is not there.<br />
<br />
The results are posted when you process delivered purchase orders; thus not at the moment of receipt. Did you process?<br />
<br />
Next you talk about the integration (WOH) setup for Purchase/Receipt. Did you also set up Purchase/Result?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">larkin_jack2</div><div class="date">19th April 2002, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked the dimension ranges, and all is OK.<br />
<br />
Purchase orders have been processed.<br />
<br />
All items that are material items, or purchased items have Purchase / Result integrations setup.  <br />
<br />
The problem is that the items that are coming through when received are cost items.  If these are cost items, why does a purchase result need to be setup?<br />
<br />
I was thinking, maybe in purchasing when the item was setup that it was copied from a material, or purchased item, and then changed to a cost item.  This could possibly affect some tables??<br />
<br />
If this is the case, how do I correct it.  Do I push through the integrations, even though they are incorrect?????<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdruijter</div><div class="date">26th April 2002, 14:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I think it goes like this;<br />
<br />
On a pur.order several items are entered including a line for a cost item ad price EUR 100<br />
<br />
This order goes via integrations to finance and a pur.invoice is received and maintained in finance<br />
<br />
On the invoice the line of the cost item is stated as EUR 120 and after negotiation this is the price agreed upon by the purchase person. <br />
<br />
So on matching order vs. invoice a partial match is made for the quantity (order = invoice), but price = EUR 120<br />
<br />
No additional posting in finance is required, but for instance last pur.price in the item file is updated to EUR 120 for that item. <br />
<br />
This difference of EUR 20 is posted from distribution to finance (via the integrations) to finance as a purchase result.<br />
<br />
So there u go. Therefore this result posting option should be set up.<br />
<br />
i hope this helps.<br />
<br />

<br />
The file will be very helpful.<br />
<br />
I also have another integration question if that's ok!<br />
<br />
I have an integration error which just arose.<br />
<br />
The error is a Purchase/Receipt! &quot;cannot define ledger account&quot;<br />
<br />
Steps Followed:<br />
<br />
1) I look at the item first and check to see if an integration by that item group was created, and it has.<br />
<br />
2) I than checked to see if the cost price components matched, and they did<br />
<br />
What should I do next?</div></div><hr />

Sounds ok to me. If there is no need to split results on regular items and cost items, u could also create an integration rule in the integrations scheme on the highest level (so not on item- or item group level). In that case all non specified integrations transactions of any purchase result will be posted on those legder acc. specified on general level.<br />
<br />
Maybe this xl sheet is helpfull.<br />
<br />
good luck.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">2nd May 2002, 08:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello mdruijter, <br />
<br />
but be careful with a general integration scheme. <br />
OK, you don't have any error in the integration log. But perhaps a lot of mistaken accounts. <br />
In the error log you notice when something is wrong, but to control each time the accounts produces much more work. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mdruijter</div><div class="date">6th May 2002, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Off course! U R absolutely right regarding that matter. I could not agree more on that. One should be very aware of that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">7th May 2002, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - <br />
<br />
Is it possible that somebody has changed item information between the time that the item was received and the time that you reviewed the item when fixing your integration error?  I have had that happen to me. <br />
<br />
My purchase receipt integrations for non-cost items look at a combination of warehouse and item group in order to drive them to the correct ledger account.  I have come across situations where a user will create an item with an invalid warehouse/item group combination and put the item on a PO.  When the item is received, the integration that is created will be erroneous.  However, the item data gets corrected before I look to see its setup.  It looks as though it should post, but is erroneous.  <br />
<br />
In the tdpur041 table, you can see the item group that was on the item at the time that the PO line was created.  <br />
<br />
You can then build a &quot;temporary&quot; integration, post the transaction, then delete your temporary integration setup.  <br />
<br />
Also, I agree with Juli that creating one general integration for your purchase result transactions can be dangerous.  If I've learned anything about integrations, it's that the more specific you are in their setup, the less journal entries you'll need to make later to move costs to correct accounts.<br />
<br />

Hope this helps - if you'd like to discuss this in greater detail, please contact me<br />
