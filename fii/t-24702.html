<br />
1.  The Transaction Type is CAU (Link unalloc receipts to).<br />
<br />
2.  I was linking unalloc cash receipt. During this process I decided not to<br />
     link the receipt and went back in the Transaction Type to reverse my<br />
     adjustment and that's when I ran into trouble.  The system (Baan) will<br />
     not allow me to reverse the process. Therefore, I cannot close the batch<br />
     for month end because my ending balance does not match.<br />
<br />
Do you have a quick fix!<br />
<br />
Tks!<br />

Dear Gail<br />
<br />
Please go to Maintain Transcation tfgld1101m000 and select desired Batch <br />
and T/T. Also find from customer name and you will find the &quot;Display invoice assinged advance/ unalloacted receipts&quot; and you select desired data (Assingment document) and select the same and go forward for chnage the data value as desired - data will change which you have earlier entered . Example - if you assinged earlier Rs. 1200 with a invoice RS. 1250 or may be same amount and you got a new document no. for assingment.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Hope you would find in order.<br />

<br />
I followed your instructions and the system still does not allow me to reverse<br />
the transaction as previously reference in my first e-mail.<br />
<br />
A pop-up box tells me (Sign of remaining amount &amp; sign of unallocated/advance amount cannot be different.<br />
<br />
I think and let me know if you agree that the system if lock behind the scenes  and that is why I cannot reverse the transaction as explained<br />
earlier.  Because there is diference between the credit/debt. I cannot close the batch.  The CAU transaction is set @ free and it should say ready.<br />
<br />
Tks!<br />
