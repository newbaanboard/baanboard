I'm trying to set up some ledger account with the &quot;Business Partner Balance&quot; option. This is a really fine feature, but what I have discovered is that when you  close the financial year (provisionally o finally, it's the same), the opening balance for each business partner is not created. <br />
For instance, you have an account whose balance is 1000.00 EURO, distributed as 600.00 EURO for BP1 and 400.00 EURO for BP2 in financial year 2006. You run session tfgld3530m000 for financial year 2006 and you can see the distribution.<br />
Then you close the financial year 2006 (session tfgld6201m000 for provisional, tfgld6201m000 for final) and run session tfgld3530m000 for financial year 2007: now you have an opening balance for each BP of 0.00 EURO.<br />
A case is already been opened at support...<br />
Does anyone has some suggestion?<br />
bye.<br />
