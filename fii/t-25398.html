If any UK Baan customers are also requiring this functionality please can they reply to this thread or private message me.<br />
<br />
See the following links for information:<br />
<br />
http://www.new-cis.co.uk/<br />
http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/new-cis/cis341.pdf (provides a good summary)<br />
<br />
From a brief reading the following functionality seems to be missing from Baan IV:<br />
<br />
<br />
  Ability to store these details for each sub-contractor:<br />
<br />
  Unique Taxpayer reference (UTR)<br />
  National Insurance Number<br />
  The subcontractors status as verified by HMRC, as one of:<br />
<br />
  Gross payment<br />
  Payment under deduction<br />
  Unregistered (deduction must be made at a higher rate)<br />
<br />
  Verification reference provided by HMRC<br />
<br />
<br />
  Ability to store the standard rate of deduction, and the higher (unregistered) rate of deduction.<br />
<br />
  Storage of the value of the material component of a subcontractors invoice during the registration of a purchase invoice. The CIS deduction must be made on the value of the invoice less any material costs.<br />
<br />
  Produce statements for sub-contractors detailing payments and deductions made, on either a monthly basis or with payment. The verification reference provided by HMRC must be on these statements.<br />
<br />
  Provide reporting for monthly return to HMRC of payments made to sub-contractors, with details of the subcontractor, subcontractors reference, gross payments and any deductions made.</div></div><hr />
