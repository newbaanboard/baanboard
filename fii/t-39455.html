<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">20th July 2007, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I really need a quick help. I have a question in Finance. When we match the Bank payments file with AR invoices in Baan IV system using EBS (electronic bank statement) then in few cases, the payments amount is more than 100 %. It happens.<br />
<br />
Ex: Invoice amount = $200, Received amount is $500. So when we do manually receive the check, there will be a balance of $-300 against the invoice which is fine for the company. BUT during the EBS automatic matching process, WHAT tolerance (Amount &amp; %) should I define (may be in CMG parameter) so that it goes through and does not rejects. Waiting ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madan.meegada</div><div class="date">23rd July 2007, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Set the Payment Difference Tolerance in CMG parameters in such a way that it will accept the overpayment as a form of payment difference.  For example: If the invoice amount is 200 and received amount is 500.<br />
<br />
Set the parameter Higer than inovice amount as : 300 in CMG parameters.<br />
<br />
Then while doing automatic matching...select the parameter...Use Payment difference tolerance for matching.<br />
<br />
System will match this record and post the remaining 300 to payment difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">23rd July 2007, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your mail Madan. BUT here the difference in terms of AMOUNT is $300 &amp; in terms of % is 150 %. So what should be the % &amp; Amount setup for Lower &amp; Upper side in CMG parameter.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you mentioned that remaining $300 will goto Payment difference BTU we want that as an Over-received amount and the Invoice balance will show up as -$300. So it will Debit Bank and Credit AR account more by$300. How this can be done ??? Waiting ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madan.meegada</div><div class="date">24th July 2007, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Set the Higher side of Payment Difference based on your need.  But please keep in mind that it can impact other transactions where you dont want to give the payment difference.  Lower side of payment difference tolerances are no way related to our problem.  It doesnt matter whatever they are.  <br />
<br />
Coming to overpayment.  As per my knowledge, over payment is not possible through EBS.  It should be booked as any deduction.  If there is any remaining amount on the invoice, even if you do manual matching, the status of the EBS batch will be converted only.  In case of overpayment, there will be remaining amount (negative).  So as per my knowledge, overpayment can not be done through EBS.<br />
