<br />
As I understand it, in Baan4c4 when we setup taxes on purchases for Purchase Orders, they appear on PO and Purchase Invoice, however, they don't appear on Integrations Form 4 (Tab2).<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get such taxes post thru integrations such that they can be finalized in Finance, just like sales taxes are.  Or is this standard Baan functionality that the tax will be applicable till you match &amp; approve in AP.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tax is due when you receive the invoice, not when you raise the purchase order, and you have to post the tax as it is on the invoice, not as Baan calculates it on the order. Apart from rounding errors, quantities and prices on the invoice could be different from the order.<br />
<br />
You could in theory post an accrual for expected purchase tax when the goods are received, but Baan doesn't do that and I cannot see why you would want that. If you want an estimate of the expected tax then take the value in your GRNI account and apply the average purchase tax rate.</div></div><hr />
