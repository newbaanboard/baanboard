<br />
i have a problem with some extra UE vendors (China and Oman) the bank doesn't accept the payment doc. XML without IBAN, but for China and Oman the IBAN does not exists.... i have also found that in the session tfcmg0540m000, if i open the details of a record, there are some checks to use bank account or IBAN. However, in the correct method of payment (SSF) for foreign customers, there are already selected the correct entries but the customer say to me that is still incorrect. The BP that i'm testing is correct, because it has a bank account and the code BIC/SWIFT but no IBAN...<br />
I think this option should work..but not, the bank still return the error.<br />
<br />
can anyone help me? It's urgent.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance to anyone.</div></div><hr />
