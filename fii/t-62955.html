<br />
After the year close/ Month end we are getting integration errors while posting the transaction for Production SFC to production Result.<br />
Error msg is &quot;Cannot Define Dimension code for Dim 2 , mandatory...&quot;<br />
We have mapping from Item Group and Project, Item group is mapped with Dim,<br />
On ledger dim range is full, but still we have errors,<br />
<br />
Please let us know where the setup is missing....<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
Check whether someone has changed ledger account for the said transaction combination, if not then check whether anybody has made dim2 mandatory for the ledger code.<br />
<br />
Look for any change in integration setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanravi</div><div class="date">10th October 2012, 09:05</div></div><div class="posttext">identify the specific line in which you are getting the integration posting error.<br />
check what is the CPC or nature of it like material or operation costs, etc.<br />
when tfgld4510m000 you can find those details. based on it you can make the dim2 mapping using Item group if it is material or CPC if it is operation costs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the ledger the dim is Mandatory... as of now, do you want me to make it optional and then try to post the transaction.<br />
<br />
Will it post the transaction...<br />
<br />

<br />
Please check whether someone has recently made changes in ledger master setting dimension 2 as mandatory, if yes then revert those changes. You can trace old field value using 'Audit Trail' if activated earlier.<br />
<br />
If no change found then check your integration setup for missing link.<br />
<br />
I am advising this assuming that prior to month end your system was working properly for the same transaction combination.<br />
<br />
Dhanyawad!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you that there was change made in the ledger or the dim has made mandatory now... but now if we have to post the transaction to that particular dimension.. what additional setup we would have to do so that it will post to that particular dim...<br />
<br />
intentionally we want the transaction should get posted to dim 2. <br />
<br />
Yes prior to month end it was working properly...<br />
<br />
Please advice...<br />
<br />

<br />
Check type of line for which you got this error e.g. Dr, Cr or both.<br />
<br />
Now seek record in session tfgld4126m000 for combination of 'Production(SFC)/Production Result' to get 'Integration Element' for erroneous type (Dr. or Cr.)<br />
<br />
For this  'Integration Element' check data in session tfgld4121m000(Maintain Options by Integration Element) and maintain missing relation for dimension type 2.</div></div><hr />
