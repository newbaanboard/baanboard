<br />
I need help on the the following problem.<br />
<br />
I am trying to archive fully paid sales invoices to history company using the session tfacr2260m000. While doing for a particular customer,  it gives error  as  <br />
&quot;Fatal error  606 - Reference does not exist on tcmcs003600'.  <br />
<br />
Original company is 666 and the history company is 600.  I dont understand why the system looking for reference in  warehouse tables as we are trying to do archive finance invoices. Am I missing any particular step as required ?<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards.</div></div><hr />

References between tables apply in the archive company as much as in the live.  If you have already done that and you are getting the error, it implies perhaps that someone has done some GTM which has not been followed through.</div></div><hr />
