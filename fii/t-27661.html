<br />
Is it possible to  have the same feature but only for invoice with selected transaction type ?<br />
<br />
I tried to find this functionality but without succeed.<br />
<br />
The reason we need this functionality is because our finance department do create dummy invoice which we are not going to make payment. This dummy invoice is to match with the purchase receipt (which supplier has not invoice us) from  PCS project so that the project can be put to &quot;Closed&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, blocking code from business partner does not help us.<br />
<br />
Anyone else can advise ?</div></div><hr />

You can block / unblock individual invoices when u make the purchase invoices. <br />

<br />
Your suggestion is a manual way. <br />
<br />
I wish to do it automatically. Meaning, whenever user create an invoice with transaction type, say A11, then the invoice is automatically blocked for payment.</div></div><hr />

I guess it will be a very minor customization. We have done in our case. We normally pay our supplier in advance as they are import purchases. When we receive the PO, we create a manual invoice and then we block it so that it doesn't come for payment. Its pretty minor customization.<br />
