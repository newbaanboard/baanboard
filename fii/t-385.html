I know it can be done manually with another journal entry but I wanted to see if Bann has a correction program that would reverse the original entry.</div></div><hr />

I would think it is safer to rather do a manual journal to reverse the transasction.</div></div><hr />

While it can be a lot of work to manually create a journal to reverse the error, at least you then have a more complete audit trail of what happened instead of simply unfinalizing the batch. I believe there are correction programs from Baan but they are intended more for reversing a batch if there was a defect or other software issue and not a situation where data was entered incorrectly.</div></div><hr />
