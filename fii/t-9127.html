<br />
How can we assign an element selected in integratin option 1 to more than one dimension. When we try to assign it to a different dimension  it says record already exists. I am using method --by elements. System does not provide field for the dimension range to be assigned though it provides for the Item group when method selected is -- by range. Only one dimension can be assigned in this method also. I wish to assign one item group to more than one dimension.<br />
<br />
ex: Integration option 1 Item group. Priority 0. Same Item group to be assigned to two different dimensions.<br />
<br />
If I select integratin option 2 as Main Item group and assign the other dimension will the system post the same item group to both dimensions? <br />
<br />
Any help highly appreciated.<br />

<br />
What session are you using?  Maybe if you give an example it will help us to understand the question more clearly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you use tfgld4121 to assign values to dimensions you have to treat each dimension, with its priorities, independently from the other dimensions !!!<br />
In tfgld4122 and 4123 you can assign values regarding only the Dimension / Priority that you checked in tfgld4121.<br />

<br />
Tks for the reply. I am using sessions:<br />
<br />
tfgld4120m000, tfgld4121m000 and sub session tfgld4123s000 wherein I am assigning the values.<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
I have a consumable item say Diesel under Item group Fuel which is used for cost centers-- Plant, Admin and Farm. (3 Dimensions).<br />
I wish to post  this item under the item group to all the three dimensions.<br />
Similarly I have other expenses which need to be assigned to the three dimensions.<br />

<br />
I think that you did not understand my answer.<br />
<br />
It is not a problem that has a solution.<br />
<br />
This is the way the system is designed by BaaN.<br />
Each dimension has to be dealt with independently.<br />

<br />
I have been doing this for several times and there is no problem. But now I have a situation where I have to assign one item group to more than one dimension. I was looking for any work around since BaaN does not allow it in normal course.<br />
<br />
Tks for reply.<br />

<br />
You can not use the same element twice for the same dimension code. This is because Baan will not be able to identify what  amount is posted to each dimension. In the example given by you if diesel is to be debited to Farm, Plant &amp; Admin how can BaaN determine what amount is to be posted to each dimension. If you have a situation that you must do it, I suggest that you include such item in the 'Cost' group under your ACP paramenters. If you have any problems please call me up on 6-5289101 or 0504827091<br />
