<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">30th September 2005, 07:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm starting to learn Baan Finance in more detail. One thing that strikes me first is that it has a peculiar architecture. Table structures, user interface are just so different than typical accounting software. Baan Finance has central entry screen for ALL kinds of accounting transactions, the Transactions screen (tfgld1101m000 in BaanERP). However, I think by trying to provide this, Baan ended up with &quot;unique&quot; accounting package design. Some might like this feature, but I'd compare it to trying to have a central screen in Baan Manufacturing package where ALL kinds of manufacturing transaction north and south can be recorded right there. Now that would mess up the architecture of the manufacturing package.<br />
<br />
I'd say that Baan Order Management, Warehousing, Manufacturing has generally excellent architecture for their core modules. I like how good business process seems to be central philosophy in designing the architecture in these modules (some parts of the new Warehousing design I don't like, but generally it's very good). But story seems to be a little different in Finance (which is, by the way, leaning very heavy toward accounting department functionalities than finance). It works, but it's just &quot;different&quot;<br />
<br />
I happened to come across to our Baan  Timeline (http://www.baanboard.com/node/1707) and noted that there it says Triton 3 Finance had major problem. What was the problem? By the time I graduated from uni, BaanIV is the one being sold on the market. So, I didn't have chance to play around with Triton.<br />
