<br />
So I'm banging my head against the wall to figure this out,  I've tried several different combinations, but nothing seems to be working correctly.  Anyone have an idea?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
have you tried creating a payment terms (tcmcs0513m000) with 15 days payment period and due date calculation is end of fifteen days, then attached this payment term to your bp master data. for every invoices you will create in tfgld1101m000 transactions system will automatically compute 15 days displayed on due date field in the session but this date can be modified as 30th and 5th of the month if document date is not on the exact numbering based on 15days payment term.<br />
<br />
if the above term not fits for you, you may try using fixed payment days, in your case you may used 5 and 30 of the month setup on same payment term session.<br />
