<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manumt</div><div class="date">28th August 2013, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan is  allowing us to invoice more than the “limit”  that is set in the Customer Master. We have found numerous times when the Invoice amount has exceeded the “limit”, someone in Finance had gone and increased the “limit” without telling anyone? How can we block this from happening anymore ?<br />
Also , Baan is checking credit limit only when placing distribution orders, which is fine but it doesn’t check credit limit when creating sundry debtors invoices.. is it possible for an invoice to be raised if the limit is not sufficient?<br />
<br />
Please assist</div></div><hr />
