In The General Ledger the value of the stock is higher then the value of the stock in logistics (Stock value per article: tdinv6230m000). What can be the reasons for this. All our integrations seem to be ok. And all our bookings can be put through from logistics to finance. What can be our problem???:mad: :confused: :eek: <br />
<br />
Please advice....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 20:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Few areas to look for : Check out how the inventory is mapped to GL<br />
Lets say, its mapped using item group and some transactions happed (lets say receipt)<br />
Subsequently chnaged hte item group. Inventory valuation in logistics will pick this up however GL wont (as in GL transaction already happend in the past)<br />
<br />
In our company we always have differences like that...</div></div><hr />

Then you need to follow this process for getting the accurate information. (I am assuming that you are not using &quot;Real time&quot; transaction posting)<br />
<br />
1.	Run the integration posting at midnight (create a batch job to run at 12.00)<br />
2.	Run the inventory valuation report at midnight (create a batch job to run at 12.00)<br />
3.	Next day morning clear and post only the error integration records<br />
4.	Finalize the entire integration batches.<br />
5.	Now compare the GL balance with Logistic report.<br />
<br />
If your integration is perfect then the above step will give you a minor difference</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. The cost price calculation code;<br />
2. The Ledger mapping for the integration tranaction type 'Purchase/Result'.</div></div><hr />
