When I tried to remove document (assigning unallocated payment) system gives an error: Authorization of approval not allowed. I do this via session: tfcmg2131s000 (Assign Advance/unallocated payments to Invoices).<br />
It's applied to only one document, but I need to remove it.<br />
I have enough permission in tfacp0150m000 (maintain tolerate price difference by user).<br />
I hope somebody know solution.<br />
Regards<br />
Anna</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">21st January 2002, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's an authorization problem you could also try tfcmg1100m000 - Maintain Payment Authorisations or change the super user in the cmg parameters to your own log in.<br />
<br />
We are on c3 and had a quite a few problems with the cmg sessions until we updated this area with various solutions.<br />
<br />
We don't actually use the session you are using so I'm afraid thats the only advice I can offer.<br />

<br />
I don't recognise the message?  Has the invoice that you are try to remove the allocation from been approved already?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">annpaj</div><div class="date">21st January 2002, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I tried tfcmg1100m000, like Neal suggested. I have never seen this session before, so I added my log in. But it didn't helped.<br />
<br />
Maria<br />
Document that I try to delete is a link between two bank documents (both of them have the same amount, but opposite signs: negative and positive)<br />
<br />
Ex.<br />
First document: 50 EUR<br />
Second one: -50 EUR<br />
<br />
Our finance linked them by mistake.  <br />
There are not linked to any invoice.<br />
Neither bank documents, nor link document required no approval.<br />
<br />
I have no idea, where the problem is?<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
Unclosed file is a screendump with a message.  <br />
What I did (step by step):<br />
1. tfgld1101m000 (Maintain Transactions)<br />
         -select batch with linking document to delete, <br />
         - transaction type: cash, main session tfcmg2131s000, next session: tfsmg2106s000.<br />
2. enter supplier number<br />
3. select document that was linked (bank transaction), continue<br />
4. (tfcmg2106s000), field &quot;Write of&quot; change from Automatic to No, Continue<br />
System displays message (see file)<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
This message is caused by the standard program(tools), it seems to be a authorisation problem or a field is being filled with a value that does not fit in the domain range of the domain for that field.  Maybe you should check with Baan Support on this one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">annpaj</div><div class="date">25th January 2002, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
Knowing your opinion about problem I made some tests.<br />
<br />
What I noticed:<br />
Even if I logged in as baan (super user, in every sessions and modules has full authorization) error occurs.<br />
<br />
Problem apply to bank document - advance payment with minus amount.<br />
If I have two bank documents: advance payment (standard, with amount &gt;0) and a second: advance payment with minus amount, system doesn't allow to linked them. In this case message mentioned above occurs.<br />
<br />
Advance payment with minus amount is a result of returning advance payment by supplier.<br />
Maybe this is a problem. Supplier returns advance money, how to book it? Or how to link two bank documents with the same amount and different signs?<br />
<br />
