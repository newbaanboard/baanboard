<br />
Ours is Corrective, but of late, this seems to create more errors than it fixes. In the last 3 instances, installed solutions did not necessarily fix the problem, but DID create new ones, some quite serious</div></div><hr />

We typically do 1, maybe 2, service packs a year.  At the same time we do on occasion install some individual solutions. As it is various was not a choice on the poll.  And sometimes it seems like with the pre-req's required you might as well do a complete service pack installation.<br />
<br />
And I also agree with David.  There is not a guarantee that the recommended solution will fix a given problem.  We have had one solution fix a problem and then the problem re-appears with a service pack.  Not the best patch management.</div></div><hr />

Agree. The poll should contain something like &quot;mixed update strategy&quot; option. But as this option is not available you can select the one which fits best for you (common update strategy).<br />
<br />
For us it is difficult to keep the system up to date because of many customizations. The process of updating the customized components including testing is quite complex...</div></div><hr />
