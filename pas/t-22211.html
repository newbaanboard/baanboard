<br />
With the availability of Linux porting set for Baan, I would like to know how users feel about using Open Source Database (especially PostgreSQL or MySQL-MaxDB) for Baan.<br />
<br />
May not be strong at heart to try out at the production server, but at least, are you guys interested in using open source database at least in the development server (to save some bucks $$$$).<br />
<br />
PS: SAP already supports the MySQL-MaxDB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">1st November 2004, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">No problem, even for production!  The beauty about open source is that support is actually better than some &quot;closed source&quot; packages.  And if you encounter a problem, somebody will most likely already have found it, and have a work-around/bug-fix for it as well! I wouldn't use any beta versions for production though!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would I spent the time and effort to get to know MySQL/PostgesSQL and their baan related problems, if I can not use it on th eproduction server?<br />
<br />
What good is a test system on MySQL, if I need a second test system with oracle for the real acceptance tests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">5th November 2004, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">They said Development, not Test :)<br />
Of course, test should be a duplicate of production, including DB. But many companies have a developement environment that is separate from test.  In that case, paying the license for a real DB may not be the best option, especially if everything is thoroughly tested on Test before going into production, as it should be.<br />
<br />
Also, may want to get your feet wet with it!  At the SSA conference they made it clear that they were going to support MySQL and even bring back BISAM, all to reduce the total cost of ownership, which they are making great strives for.</div></div><hr />
