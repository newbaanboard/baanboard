Just happened that we are having headache with one of our client which uses SQL Server, and want to know how many people share the same headache with that M$ product (see Is SQL Server any good?). Thanks in advance for taking part in this poll. Have a great day!<br />

Now, here, with the votes in so far, SQL Server powers just under 30% of Baan installations. Moreover, someone already includes Great Plains as big 5 ERP this year. Seems like MS, from business point of view, has really got very firm foothold in several corporate software market segments. That should make Bill Gates happier (and richer)<br />

Hi Paul, <br />
<br />
I think we all now, that these kind of rankings are to be taken with a lot of sceptisms. SSA is regarding themselfs as number one in the midmarket manufacturing industries. If you define your market correctly everybody will be number 1 in his niche. Great Plains is hardly used by anyone outside of the US, actually Microsoft is not really marketing it outside of the US. In Europe it is all about Navision and Axapta.<br />

SQL Server's Baan market share is down to 23.53 % vs Oracle's 66,67 %. Oracle outnumbers SQL Server 3 to 1 in Baan space so far in our poll. That'll still make Microsoft smile though, since 23 % market share is still pretty good in business point of view<br />
