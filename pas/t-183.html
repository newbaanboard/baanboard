<br />
An affliate ours ask abt the use of anit-virus s/w on Baan NT Servers. They have many developers who mapped the baan directory on their PCs. Having been afraid of a virus attack what you are opinions of installing Anti-virus s/w on baan servers as a safety measure and what are the impact on baan apps. I've got to know from another site that after installing anti-virus s/w it affected their baan operations. If this is true, pls view your comments. Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">18th September 2001, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done about a year tools support at a customer site who had a ERP5.0b installation on NT. They turned the virus software off because of the worse performance it caused. However they used the Baan server only for Baan and no one had access to the server or could map drives. <br />
<br />
For servers that where used for more than Baan and on which people mapped drives they wouldn't take the risk and used the virus software. However those installations had no more than 15 users so the effect of the virus software on the performance was less.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">18th September 2001, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I would keep my Baan servers and closely connected PC's (developer's/users) away from any public internet. Put them on an internal LAN behind a robust firewall and install the Anti-virus software on the PC's only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">20th September 2001, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Since many Baan sites will use a shared directory for download/uploads from and to Baan (for example, writing a text file out from a report to download to Excel);  and because there are viruses that propogate via any mapped drive; I believe that you should run virus scanning on your Baan NT server.<br />
<br />
However, do not run this constantly as this will adversely effect performance.  I would schedule a scan of the disk once per day (at 4:00 AM for example) when the system is lightly loaded.  Also, every PC in the environment should have good real-time virus scanning tools.<br />
<br />
Consultants that work on Baan systems should be sure to scan any laptop before plugging it into the network if they do not have up to date virus scanning software.  And, before inserting any diskette into the Baan server, it should be scanned for viruses as a disk that is &quot;erased&quot; (del *.*) still can have sector 0 boot viruses.  <br />
<br />
In conclusion, practice safe computing.</div></div><hr />
