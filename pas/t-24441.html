<br />
Time again for some voting and to recapture one of the most popular polls ever on this forum: What operating system (OS) are you using mostly?. We did this poll first 4 yours ago so it would be interesting to see how the numbers have involved since then. I have added/removed choice options as appropriate.<br />
<br />
Note: this poll is about the OS your Baan server is running on, not about your client or desktop OS. You can choose multiple options if you have more than one server and different OS'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
although (thank heavens) I didn't need it any longer, the option 'other unix'  should be added.<br />
<br />
Splendid idea to have this poll again.<br />

I added the option. I would say the first very preliminary but pleasant surprise are the Linux numbers :)</div></div><hr />

It is Unix 11i UX and Windows 2000</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, this is good news. Since there were no new linux-specific discussions on the board lately, I assumed that not many people were seriously planing to change their OS.<br />
What a joy to see that I was utterly wrong.<br />

It would appear that everyone treats the two like Baan IVc4 runs exactly the same on both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's like lighting a match in a powder room.<br />
<br />
Unix is better. as usual.  ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st August 2005, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea - opinion only portion:  Unix is better.  Windows is fine though for smaller implementations, and much cheaper :)<br />
<br />
Also, it's a bit scewed - if you combine windows implementations:  2000, 2003, and not the UNIX ones to get a full picture of UNIX vs. MS.  If you combine the Unix numbers up there, Unix is by far beating out MS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 22:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Voted.  But might be unfair, since I'm not actively using Baan at this stage. ;)<br />
<br />
Pat, would it be possible to create a two-dimensional poll?  O/S and database combination?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Nico,<br />
<br />
Don't think so. The max options for any poll is 20 and that would not be enough to cover all OS-DB possibilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">2nd September 2005, 19:11</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been a few years since I paid attention to a poll like this.<br />
<br />
Just a few years ago it was 50% HP, 30% SunOS, 15% AIX and 5% NT.<br />
<br />
Now it looks like we actually have a majority of Windows and Linux environments and big UNIX is loosing turf fast.<br />
I'll have to assume that this is representative for the 'outside world' as well.<br />
<br />
Shocking...interesting...amazing.<br />
<br />
GO LINUX!</div></div><hr />
