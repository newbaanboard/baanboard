<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">17th August 2001, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">From Baan I can say that:<br />
<br />
NT OS installation use mostly MS SQL. Then Oracle/Informix in more or less equal parts.<br />
HP-UX installations use mostly Oracle<br />
SunOS installations use mostly racle, then Informix<br />
AIX installations use mostly Oracle, then DB2/Informix<br />
AS400 uses DB2/Oracle<br />
Others systems are very unusual, but mostly use the cheapest solution (like Informix?)<br />
Free OS, like SCO/Unixware usually use TBase or a remote commercial DB running on other UNIX/NT OS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">17th August 2001, 12:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Being a consultant (and in a previous life, user), I come across many different versions. The most common one I work on is either NT with SQL or HP-UX with Informix. Of course, these both have the benefit of being cheaper that the usual mix and that also comes into play with the choice *see other forums for view of expense over choice*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">17th August 2001, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to remember hearing once that something like 53% of installations are on Oracle. Not sure how accurate this is. I think that over 50% use Oracle but not sure how many exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">17th August 2001, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see if our poll comes up with similar percentages :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">17th August 2001, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Humm... most of the Baan installations are for small/medium companies, way under 100 concurrent users (read NT+SQL mostly). This can afford a stop of everything to do a MS backup...<br />
<br />
Big companies (more than concurrent 100/200 users?) use robust and with added backup/restore functionality databases (read &quot;Oracle&quot;). This ones are usually 24x6/7 online.<br />
<br />
So, if you count the installed base of Baan, the first one will win, but if you count the number of users, probably the second one will win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerhard</div><div class="date">17th August 2001, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">There are still a lot of customers running older Baan software from Triton 3.1 to Baan IVc4, that are using Baan Base (tbase). From the german customers using a RDBMS about 65 % use Oracle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lwatson</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">We use MS SQL 2000 w/ Baan 5c and 300 users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 18:45</div></div><div class="posttext">at present Oracle has 55% so my early prediction wasn't too bad.<br />
We'll see how things develop - the few votes cast so far hardly count for valid statistics! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 08:19</div></div><div class="posttext">This is from a newsletter I received, regarding the statistics gathered by BWU [Baan World Users]:<br />
<br />
1. What versions of Baan are being used ?<br />
      4%   operate on a Triton version of Baan<br />
    54% operate on Baan IVC3 or earlier<br />
    31% operate on Baan IVC4<br />
    11% operate on Baan ERP <br />
<br />
2. What databases do Baan sites utilize? <br />
    Oracle tops the list with 51% of our membership<br />
    Informix follows with 21% representation<br />
    SQL with 13%<br />
    MSSQL with 8%<br />
    Tribase with 5%<br />
    DB2 with 1%<br />
    Exchange with 1%   (this is used also :eek: ?)<br />
<br />
3. Ever wonder about multi-site ? <br />
    52% of the organizations that responded are Multi-Site<br />
    34% are Multi-Logistic<br />
    43% are Multi-Financial</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">superman</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">The poll should allow more than one vote. We use Oracle in production and tbase in development</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">The poll only allows one vote to avoid that the actual outcome becomes too unreliable. The idea is that you indicate which technology you used most or which is used in your main environment, ie. production environments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DavidS</div><div class="date">11th September 2001, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps some polls could allow only one opportunity for each user to vote, but allow multiple selections to be made at that time if appropriate, a sort of proportional representation system as opposed to a first past the post?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">11th September 2001, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The poll option on the bulletin board is not one of the core strenghts, it is more of a gimmick or add-on. So bear with the limited functionalities of it :) Currently, multiple votes are not supported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DavidS</div><div class="date">13th September 2001, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, never mind...it works well enough as it is and I'm sure it isn't beyond the wi of most contrbuters here to determine which answer is most relevant for them.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DavidS</div><div class="date">13th September 2001, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">:eek: That should read &quot;wit of most contributors&quot;, which I today seem to possess very little of!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">14th September 2001, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">It is human to make typing errors but you maybe you have not noticed the option that you have to edit your own posts!</div></div><hr />
