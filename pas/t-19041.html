We require their network passwords to be changed every 3 months which keeps them out of Baan until they re-save their password so they don't bother anymore.  It can also be a security issue if they leave their computer unlocked.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps it should have been &quot;Has your organization setup system level controls to prevent users from saving their passwords?&quot;<br />

I am realizing now how difficult it is to word a poll or survey to get accurate results</div></div><hr />
