ERP LN reporting was change some times ago. You can use BIRT or MS Reporting Service from Infor. <br />
Also you can use solution from some partners. For example, we use HiDox - very good solution.<br />
<br />
mig28mx, you fully right. SL have poor Finance, Warehousing and Order Processing versus ERP LN. And if you will see LN FP7, you can see, that LN Finance is more powerful, than in FP5 or FP6.</div></div><hr />
