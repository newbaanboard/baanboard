Let me know if I missed a version :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are currently running 4c3 in the UK, Europe &amp; Israel and 4c4 in Scandinavia. However we are currently upgrading and hope to be running 4c4 in all locations by October. Other Bio-Rad sites are running mainly 4c4 but France is currently implementing 5.:)</div></div><hr />

Not sure when we are going to move to 5 but it will happen sooner or later. Our latest upgrade has taken us to service pack 7 but we are now working on loading sp8 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">8th January 2002, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 59 responses as of today and 47 on the Desktop survey<br />
<br />
Could a statistically qualified person &quot;calculate&quot; the confidence factor in these results. ?<br />
<br />
A Baan source told me last year that 40 % of sites were still on Triton. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Frank,<br />
<br />
That is a good question. If you had asked me that 10 years ago I probably would have been able to answer that question and give you a good confidence interval. Now I would have to brush up on my university Econometrics course before even attempting it! Yet from what I do remember, I would say that the current sample size is too small to run any valuable statistical queries on it. <br />
<br />
There is also the aspect of determining your survey/question goals. If we for instance would be looking at the distribution of Baan versions on the level of a customer/site, then picture this hypothetical situation: <br />
<br />
Acme Inc. has 290 Baan users. Company management think Baanboard.com is a great site so it asks all of its Baan users to register and vote on the various polls. Let's assume 130 employees do so and deliver their vote. Now  - unfortunately - Acme is still running on Triton 2.x so we have 130 people voting for the Triton 2.x option. <br />
<br />
Total amount of votes are 220 at the time we want to make a statistical report of it. That would mean that we have 59% of 'customers' using Triton 2.x according to the poll! In reality of course the raw data is massively skewed and needs correction.<br />
<br />
I think the significance of the polls on the board don't go any further than the board itself. It's a nice gimmick though :)</div></div><hr />

Am I right in thinking you went from SP8 to SP9 ?<br />
<br />
Are there any &quot;recommended&quot; patches to load after SP9 ?<br />

<br />
No, we went from 7 loading 8 &amp; 9 at the same time. As far as recommended patches I'm not sure. I suppose you would just add patches weekly till the next sp release.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sturla</div><div class="date">25th January 2002, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think this statistics is representative for the Norwegian Baan marked.<br />
It's about 30 companies running Baan in Norway and they use following versions:<br />
<br />
Baan 5.0c     1 (1 new implementation running),<br />
Baan IVc4     &gt;20 companies<br />
Baan IVc1-3  3-4 companies<br />
Baan IV a,b   2-3 compaines<br />
Triton            I have heard about 1, but I'm not sure<br />
<br />
More than 70 % are on 4c4. Less than 4 of them plan to migrate to 5.0 this year.:confused:</div></div><hr />

Can you please add BaaN-Reger the latest BaaN release to the list. We are working on that version.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th April 2002, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, since this thread got moved up anyway, I'll throw my 2 cents in on statistics and the percentage of Triton people out there.  There is still a lot of them out there, and only Baan would know about them.  They are the type of people that get a working product and NEVER want to touch it.  It works!!!  Why upgrade or change?!?!?   Maybe they had bad upgrade experiences, or maybe they customized so much it is not cost effective to upgrade.  So, those type of people have probably been stable for years, and don't have as many questions or need of consultants.  They won't be on these boards as much as those with newer versions, and generally the consultants on these boards will not have them as clients.  Always exceptions, of course, we had to upgrade someone from Triton 2.2 :) within the last year.<br />
<br />
It is a classic statistical problem, your polling audience is already biased towards later versions.</div></div><hr />

You are right with your observations. And as all statistics, these polls have to be brought back to their proportions!</div></div><hr />

We've installed SP6, but have found some issues.  Has anyone gone all the way to SP11 or have most people stopped somewhere between SP6 and SP11?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">6th May 2003, 07:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it will be the the thing of some interest to know the history of migrations from one version to the other(s).  Some companies still using baan version from the very beginning of implementation  and some tend to upgrate. Maybe it's useful to look at such kind of statistics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">1st August 2003, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">If only there was a way to make sure only one member from a company voted, and to get all Baan's customers to vote!  That is the only way to make these stats worth more than interesting!<br />
<br />
In another thread Patrick mentioned that Baan's management has chosen to ignore the BaanBoard.  Could somebody try to get SSA's management interested?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">1st August 2003, 11:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Baan knows these statistics better than anyone. They keep records of all validated software. Still do 2.2 validations too.<br />
<br />
A pol on migration paths... would be nice... but how to do this... should be multilevel poll:<br />
<br />
Started with version (mandatory) in YEAR:<br />
Then migrated to: (optional) in YEAR:<br />
Then migrated to: (optional) in YEAR:<br />
Then migrated to: (optional) in YEAR:<br />
Then migrated to: (optional) in YEAR:<br />
Then migrated to: (optional) in YEAR:<br />
Then migrated to: (optional) in YEAR:<br />
Then migrated to: (optional) in YEAR:<br />
Current version (mandatory) from YEAR:<br />
<br />
I am not sure if this can be done...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">1st August 2003, 11:36</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be very difficult. Your poll options must be fixed so that includes YEAR and VERSION. And if you need provide an option for each possible combination then it will be unworkable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">1st August 2003, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I was afraid so... Would have given nice graphs though... Maybe it should be done in freeform text in a separate thread.<br />
<br />
Every now and then graphs could be (manually) generated from the data in the thread.<br />
<br />
Actually... I wonder how many BaanBoard users could span their companies use of Baan software from their own experience. It is good to do some investigation on that topic if you are not aware when your company started to work with (early) Baan software. Why? Just for the sake of historical awareness.<br />
<br />
Polls like these do tend to get outdated though. When a year is added, one can get an idea on the age of current implementations of versions. Do not forget that even BaanIV is not old software, because still active maintained.<br />
<br />
Would it be a good idea to start a poll like this:When was your current Baan version implemented at your site? 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 1992 1991 1990 before 1990</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">1st August 2003, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">No, because it will still require people to fill out the software version. And all people can do in a poll is make a tick at one or more options.<br />
<br />
For this kind of information you would need a survey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">1st August 2003, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, version information would be handy... but for the sake of POLL limitation, the age of an installation would be nice to know too. A survey is not an option, i presume...</div></div><hr />
