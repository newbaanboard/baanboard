<br />
In my spare time, I started building a stand-alone, direct query tool for Baan.  It is a Windows based application, and uses TCP/IP messaging and qptool to execute the queries, and thus is database independant like Baan itself.  When starting the program, the data dictionary of Baan is scanned and stored.  Thereafter, the program displays a query tool like the one found in Crystal and other packages, with drag-and-drop.<br />
<br />
With this poll I would like to find out whether there is any interest for such a tool.  I will then dolly it up, and make it available as a shareware utility program.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lots of users in the UK are talking about a company called Cyberscience - who are apparently replacing Crystal and Safari as the report-writer of choice for Baan???<br />
<br />
If there is something they DON'T do, maybe that's your opportunity?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">27th October 2004, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea is still somewhere in the cupboard...<br />
<br />
The idea is not to build a reporting tool, but just a tool to do adhoc queries.  If possible, I will try to make it comparable with MS Query, so the results could be imported/stored in Excel.  The idea started when I was doing a lot of data analysis, using ASCII dumps and importing it into Excel, which is not the best way of doing things...<br />
<br />
Well, for 14 people I might just pull the idea out of the cupboard, and actually make it a project.  More voters/comments?</div></div><hr />

After you posted this thread, we have had Nasdaq come up with a product already :). Also I wrote something up that I use from within Excel using standard windows libraries - based on the ideas you posted in this and one other thread.</div></div><hr />

After you posted this thread, we have had Nasdaq come up with a product already :).Hmmm... Will have to look into it... Any links?<br />
<br />
Also I wrote something up that I use from within Excel using standard windows libraries - based on the ideas you posted in this and one other thread.Hey man! Good for you!  Is this the BaanXL?  Or some other tool?  Where can I find it?  Seems to me I really have to stay in touch with the board more...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bamnsour</div><div class="date">28th October 2004, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you ~VAMSI for pointing to our product BaanMate.<br />
<br />
BaanMate is really a powerful tool for accessing the Baan Database. It works in the meantime with Oracle ODBC and SQL Server, and in addition, uses QPTOOL to access any Baan Database include T-Base, Informix, DB2 or any other.<br />
<br />
It is a really friendly tool. It allows you to work with the Baan Data Dictionary instead of writing queries with company numbers and 4 digit variable names.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the link for downloading an evaluation copy http://www.nazdaq-it.com/utilities.php?prod=baanmate</div></div><hr />

<br />
The tool I wrote is not available to the public - atleast not at this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dear OTN Member:<br />
<br />
SQL Developer (formerly Project Raptor) has hit a nerve: It's been downloaded more than 100,000 times since the first Early Adopter Release in late December. <br />
<br />
Now in production, SQL Developer (which is available on Mac OS X as well as Windows and Linux, BTW) makes basic database development a visual experience; it offers all the benefits of the command line along with a slick GUI (based on the same stack as Oracle JDeveloper), and it's free. Get more information at oracle.com/technology/sql-developer.<br />
<br />
Refer to the - Oracle SQL Developer, Pricing FAQ (http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/sql_developer/files/pricing_faq.html)<br />
<br />
Oracle SQL Developer Cost Questions:<br />
<br />
Is SQL Developer free?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Will the production version be free?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Oracle SQL Developer Support Questions:<br />
<br />
Is the production release of SQL Developer supported by Oracle Support?<br />
The production release of SQL Developer is supported by Oracle Support for any customers with support for the database they are using SQL Developer against.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">6th April 2006, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing still needed... (IMNSHO :D)<br />
<br />
This tool will show the tables names and fields as they exist in the database, not? Thus, wish I could modify it to read the real table and field names from the Baan data dictionary...<br />
<br />
Just a thought! ;)<br />
<br />
PS. Since I have not been working with Baan for a couple of years now, this project is still shelved...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">18th April 2006, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I just posted something related to this topic in the german board.<br />
Summary: With some shell and awk scripts evaluating some bdbpre-dumps of certain tools tables and of course the files in the data dictionary, I managed to get a pretty good tool to <br />
a) create sql scripts and data files to create and fill tables in any DB (tested and running with mysql so far) and<br />
b) compress and translate dbs.logs to reasonable small and human readible protocols of Inserts/Updates on Baan tables<br />
I will be happy to share these scripts with you.  <br />
I am afraid that some further scripting will have to be done for installation routines and suchlike, the state of these tools atm requires some knowlege of shell programming, awk and last not least Baan to get them to run.<br />
<br />
regards and complements to this excellent board<br />
<br />
Norbert</div></div><hr />
