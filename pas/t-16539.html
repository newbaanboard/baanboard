  We are still in the process of upgrading.  Plan is to go live with all of our companies Labor Day weekend.  We are still running into data conversion issues as we are testing.  If you would like our current conversion doc, I can send it.  However, I can't say it is bullet proof.<br />

Any information or experience would be greatly appreciated. We are just putting together the outline plan, but detailed info so far appears thin on the ground.</div></div><hr />

     We are working through a conversion method with an outside vendor and would appreciate any thoughts.  A Baan export/import will take too long due to several large GL data tables, looking to do this though Oracle tools instead.  Your doc would be most helpful.<br />

<br />
I can send you the document however, we are having the same issues that you are having.  Because we are going to move to a new version of Informix also, we have been told that there is really no way to cut down our time.  Right now it is taking us 10 hrs to convert one of our larger Baan companies.<br />
Please e-mail me if you would still like our document.<br />
