Yes, add it please. Hope this will not distort much  the whole statistics :)  I think it is distorted now, since Sun users (like myself :cool: ) had no option other than to select other UNIX.  But maybe in the end we can simply add SunOS and Other UNIX?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">6th July 2003, 01:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You could consider making it multi vote... since the poll is just a poll anyway. And like on our site we have all kind of Unixes from Linux (with the old portingset) via HP10.20 - 11, AIX 5.2, 4.3, SUN, etc.... just for test and reproduction etc reasons.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, most of our systems are not live...<br />
Thanks for adding SCO. Of course I agree on the fact that the company misbehaves nowadays, they were however rather good in the creation of a Unix on Intel platform which appeared to be an idea that brought Unix to a bigger world (although it is nowadays more Linux than SCO).<br />
<br />
I only know SCO as being supported by Baan, not knowing what versions/releases they support. So for me it is any product of the Santa Cruz Operations company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">6th July 2003, 01:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Multi-vote is a good idea only once voted you cannot vote again. It's really a matter of creating the poll correct at the beginning. After that, there's only so much you can do to 'fix' it. (aka GTM)</div></div><hr />

<br />
SCO has bought Unixware from Novell sometime in the 90´s, and the two unix Familys from SCO are two seperate products. There exists also two separate Portingsets from Baan for these os´s.<br />
<br />
In the Unixware 7.x series their have combined the best of both to one product. We have run Baan live on Unixware 7.1.2 (OpnenUnix 8) with the Baan Portingset for Unixware 2.1.2 and it runs very well. <br />
<br />
By the way, I have voted in 'other unix'... and I´m not an SCO fan, but satisfied with Unixware.<br />
<br />

If the poll would be more meaningful to the Baanboard members, I don't have a problem with the poll being reset and additional flavors of Unix added.  I also apologize to all of the Unix folks that were &quot;left out&quot;.    <br />
<br />
The ultimate &quot;goal&quot; of my poll was to determine the percentage of Unix users vs. Windows users.  The company I'm working for is looking at moving to the Wintel environment, and as much as we hate to give up HP-UX for stability reasons, I believe the almighty dollar will win in the end.  Kudos to Microsoft marketing!<br />
<br />
I must say I found it interesting that another poll I submitted indicated that 88% of the Wintel users run their test environments on separate servers.  I'm about to post a thread to inquire into why this is the case.  Is it that the cost of a second Wintel server is not cost prohibitive, as it is many times in some Unix environments?  Or is this configuration the result of users being concerned about OS and database software being patched too frequently (too many service packs, too often).  I'm not sure, but I have my suspicions.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, feel free to reset the poll, and I appreciate everyone's input.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
