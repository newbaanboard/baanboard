<br />
As announced a good while ago, we did some hardware and software upgrades. One of the goals was to speed up things a little bit. We replaced our old 5k rpm disks with 7k rpm models and as a last intervention - for the moment - we installed the PHP Accelarator (PHPA) last night. With all these changes we would like to get some feedback on how you perceive the 'performance' of Baanboard today?</div></div><hr />
