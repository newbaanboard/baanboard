it has mechanism to create user profiles manage multiple environments accessablitiy via internet etc. also being developed in j2ee technology it supports query based reports which help us to create custom report with rich gui(really nice looking instead of 4GL reports).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also webtop does not support the general table maintenance (by now) and the execution of sql query.<br />
<br />
But for the standard user it's good but I quote Andy, slow.</div></div><hr />

It has lot of features compared to traditional worktop. Webtop will have good ambience and also you can have filters at the session level itself. For the first time when you open the session you may feel like it is little bit slow. Infact yes, for this first time it is little bit slow as the form or session will be loaded for the first time; so it will take some time. But when you open the same form or session for the second time it will open immediately.</div></div><hr />

i think most people here are aware of the initial caching of the sessions in webtop (although in LN FP5 this is no longer necessary) but even when they are cached the sessions are still slow in operation compared to worktop</div></div><hr />

I think the approah that a ERP vendor should take is zero user interaction for many functions like Order Entry, Shop floor, Planning. A person should never be sitting in front of ERP system except decision making. All the operational functions should get automated, thus elminating needs of things like web interface etc.. I see the work done by person sitting in front of PC to be non value adding- it only adds cost to the process.<br />

We moved to Web UI over Thanksgiving.  <br />
Baan 5c<br />
Current Version 8.6; Build RQ0098<br />
When users resize the columns in sessions, they aren't saved.  The next time they open the session, the columns revert back to the default or worse - columns are so close together they can't see all the data.  May consider going back to using the client.  Have incident open w/ support, but nothing so far.  Is there a Save &amp; restore Windows Defaults setting for Web UI?</div></div><hr />

We just installed the new build - RQ105 for Version 8.6.  It is saving the column sizing for each user!!!  Our users are much happier now!  :)<br />
<br />
Another issue is that normal users can't create Advanced Filters while Super Users can.  The option to Add Row (select fields) is not available to Normal Users.  Is there a setting for this somewhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sherry1</div><div class="date">12th May 2010, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">A web desktop or webtop is a desktop environment embedded in a web browser or similar client application. A webtop integrates web applications, web services, clientâ€“server applications, application servers, and applications on the local client into a desktop environment using the desktop metaphor. Web desktops provide an environment similar to that of Windows, Mac, or a graphical user interface on Unix and Linux systems. It is a virtual desktop running in a web browser. In a webtop the applications, data, files, configuration, settings, and access privileges reside remotely over the network. Much of the computing takes place remotely.</div></div><hr />

Reminds of what I read in Wikipedia about webtop.  ;)<br />
<br />
I think webtop, or in general browser based systems, are the future.<br />
<br />
 You don't have to install this buggy clients on every system any more.<br />
 Meanwhile nearly everyone knows the general handling of a browser.<br />
<br />
and so on.</div></div><hr />

Java turn cycle around and wait for long and long time...slow , we using both webtop and worktop... webtop is good for user when they want to search information. (easy filtering) and some nice feature like conditional formating , but when work with process session like generate order planning , generate project stucture , some kind of process/update session or print session like print finalization ,.. Webtop is bad , Java turn cycle around for long and long time...   Worktop is quite good for this kind of session. <br />

somebody needs to enter data into erp before decision making aspect comes into picture. Having data entry automated is possible but not feasible for all scenerios :)<br />
<br />
Also think about this , if you have 1500 users using baan, and u need to update the client on their machines vs just updating webtop version on the server.<br />
