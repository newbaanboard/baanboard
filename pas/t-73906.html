I would like to see a correct appreciation for skills and experience from the people who pull the strings.</div></div><hr />

I have seen experienced folks only rely on resources. In that regard If they are not performing &amp; being a Senior in the brigade what are they bringing? In that case Younger people should get a chance.</div></div><hr />
