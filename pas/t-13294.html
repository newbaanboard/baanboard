<br />
I am wondering how many people are interested in a Warranty Management &amp; Tracking Sytem that will assist their Service organization being more effective.<br />
Currently this feature is not available in standard BAAN IV Service and BAAN V Service and I have noticed that customers have build their own systems a while ago as a customization.<br />
It may be that a standard solution is more appropriate now that will be web based, supports XML standards to allow integrations with dealerships to handle proper warranty claim reimbursements by an OEM and an integration to a PDM system to close the loop for Engineering from the Service organization.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please take 10 seconds and participate in this poll.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
