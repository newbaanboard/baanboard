<br />
What would you do without Baanboard?  We want to know.  Revert to Baan Support?  Use other Internet Forums or Newsgroups?  Do you care?! Or could you not live with our little Baan community? :)<br />
<br />
Your feedback is very much appreciated as always.<br />
<br />
Any other questions or feedback please let us Boardmasters know. Have fun on the board!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just very interesting topic of vote. Indeed, what point should i select?:)<br />
Going directly to GBS - but i have no account there, only our contractors do. So point number 3 is the most close variant.</div></div><hr />

Given the fact that the North American BWU organization is going through both a financial as well as an indentity crisis Baanboard is only picking up more steam and doing even more for its members. <br />
And the best thing is...it's free! (unless you donate of course).<br />
<br />
Keep the Vision,</div></div><hr />

BWU going through a financial crisis? Wouldn't say they are in such a bad spot judging from their latest balance sheet... The things we do for nearly no money...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">22nd July 2003, 02:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked the punch line from the BWU Newsletter -<br />
<br />
Being a BWU Volunteer also means<br />
<br />
· Commitment  To a term of at least one year;<br />
<br />
· Participation  In monthly scheduled teleconference calls;<br />
<br />
· Input  Into the program content of BWUs Fall Workshop.<br />
<br />
The Bottom Line?  Join and youll make your companys VOICE TO BAAN louder.<br />
<br />
Seeing the thread - Baan on Linux (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=23&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=1) I can only say we need an amplifier now so that BaaN guys would hear customers needs/requirements... :p</div></div><hr />

But maybe even better, since we should send our requests to Baan like a broken track on an LP, repeating the same question over and over again... :D</div></div><hr />
