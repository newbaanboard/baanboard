I added some fields to the 'print integration error log report' which made it much easier for them to correct the errors without IT's help.<br />
<br />
The fields where :<br />
<br />
 Item<br />
 Item Group<br />
 Warehouse<br />
 Customer \ Supplier<br />
 Cost Price Components<br />
 Amount<br />
 <br />
<br />
Which were all part of the integration records.<br />
It reduced the time spent fixing Integration Errors by 80 - 90 %.<br />
<br />
You might want to do the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">8th March 2004, 22:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm only asking because traditionally our Finance department has been the one responsible, since the posting of the integrations direcly affect the general ledger.  There has been some turnover and they want me to do it.  I'm supposed to be the 'back-up', but I know where that will lead since the person currently responsible does not like doing it.<br />
<br />
I will keep your changes in mind.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

In my view it should be a finance responsibility. The main reason is that they are the ones that will suffer the consequenses when the errors don't get fixed. Nobody else (including IT dept.) cares really. They may need help of course, but ultimately it should be their responsibility to check for errors and make sure they get fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">9th March 2004, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Although in practise it doesn't happen, I too am in the opinion that this is a finance-department responsibility. In fact at our company, they will come to the it-department once a problem occurs, just because they wouldn't know how to fix them, but still finance does the checking in most cases...</div></div><hr />
