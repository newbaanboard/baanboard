<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">9th March 2005, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't say much about Citrix. The last time I worked with it was several years ago. Back then I found it annoying (slow, copying &amp; pasting didn't work etc.) but that was one of the first versions and I guess that has improved by now. <br />
<br />
If I log in remotely to a customer system it's almost always with Cisco or MS VPN. The only problem I have found is that downloading data directly from Baan to Excel with the OLE interface takes hours do do and is not feasible via VPN. But that is something most companies don't use and otherwise using VPN is  without any problems and should work well for a remote office. <br />

u can directly use baan system thru remote location either thru VPN/ Citrix, no problems at all, we are using the BaaN thru VPN, its performance is also very good.</div></div><hr />
