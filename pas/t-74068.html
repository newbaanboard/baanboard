Does BaanBoard need a new forum entry for Questions related to Extensions / ION Interfacing: BOD and BDE?<br />
<br />
* Why Bother, nobody reads here ...<br />
* Just drop all the questions in the http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=8 Tools Development forum<br />
* Extensions are a different ball-game: they need a new forum entry<br />
* ION Interfacing - BOD and BDE is a different ball-game: they need a new forum entry<br />
* Just create two different forums and see what will happen...<br />
* What are you talking about? Something new? Leave things as they are!</div></div><hr />

Seems to be where people migrate to for posting.</div></div><hr />

There is no mention of ION, or am I missing your hint? Oh wait, you refer to this SIG (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=83)! I never read SIG's... will check on that one.</div></div><hr />
