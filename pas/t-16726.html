Very interesting poll. I am very curious to see the results!  :)</div></div><hr />

Can you please add a option: like to use it but is not yet available for my release? (There is on 7.1d.xx version yet)<br />

<br />
could you change my vote plz? (from test to live)<br />
We just went live last friday .... if anybody is interested to learn how smooth it went, feel free to ask *g*.<br />
I've been tuning IT-systems and programs for nearly 20 years now ... but I never ever was adressed by users like that (.. asking on the phone what happened to the system, whether it was not doing anything at all ... it could not really be working this fast) .. until last friday. <br />
Admittedly this has more to do with the HW than the OS, but the costs for this project would have been enormously higher if it weren't for linux.<br />
<br />
So, a nice week to all of you ....<br />
 <br />
wishes a very very happy<br />
<br />
Norbert</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot change your vote individually - well I can but I am too lazy to mess around in the database :) - but I adjusted the total votes accordingly.<br />
<br />
So how smooth did the operation go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">15th November 2004, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pat,<br />
<br />
thx for asking *g*<br />
I only wanted the count changed anyway, thx for that too.<br />
<br />
We have a lot of scripts running (printing to email, fax and awk-scripts and suchlike), so that took some planning and testing. Also there are some nightly jobs dumping data towards a mysql-database, an edi system and a sap finance system. These had to be prepared too (dirs and permissions and users). I wrote some scripts to create printers and users on OS level.<br />
ttaad300 was changed with an awk-script to use the approriate printer commands.<br />
The connection to some workstation (WfW *g*) printers controlled by niprint was the hardest task, we managed that by adding them as samba-printers.<br />
<br />
We did some test conversions, which was very easy as we create bdbpre dumps for backup reasons every night anyway.<br />
We decided to switch on a thursday, as on friday the users work shorter hours and in the worst case (having to go back to the old system) there would have been less work for them when forced to repeat their work, also we thought that a weekend would give us time to work on probs if we encountered any.<br />
So we did night shift on thursday and waited for things to happen on friday morning ....<br />
But all there was was some reports with an empty first page (when 'top margin' was different from zero) and some permission-probs for file-transfer users ....<br />
That's what there was to it really .... smooth as smooth can be.<br />
I can only encourage each and everyone to use linux, the change was really straightforward.<br />
<br />
regards<br />

<br />
Great to hear it went so well! I am always pleased to hear positive news from the Linux corner ;) What Linux/kernel version are you running by the way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">15th November 2004, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pat,<br />
<br />
thx, we have a suse enterprise sls8 with sp3 running here, kernel version 2.4.21.<br />
One hint btw at this point ... to whoever wants to be the next in the club:<br />
<br />
barcode printing was buggy ... took us some hours to find this (weeks ago at our first test) ..... on our SINIX (Siemens Unix) in the barcode scripts 'echo' was used to prompt escape-sequences .... WELL .... with linux  you have to use 'echo -e' if you want octal code 037 echoed instead of plain string containig  '\037'. *g* <br />
<br />
I don't know who will be reading this thread, but I wouldn't be surprised, if many companies could afford the new hardware for such a project simply by canceling support payments for the old box.<br />
We have a HP server here with 4 hyperthreading 2,5 ghz cpus and 5 gig memory .... performance increase compared to the old box 1000% at least.<br />
(yes .... it is running 10 times faster ... dialog/jobs ...) <br />
<br />
Thanks SSA, good decision to release this protingset, shame only that we had to wait for this compilation job for about 6 years.<br />
<br />
regards<br />

<br />
The 'echo -e' problem is one of the reason why I prefer KSH and its 'print' command. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm glad to see that there are 2 more sites live with unix .... I would be interested to know who, or at least the country ..... <br />
I knew of another company here in germany ... we were second I believe.<br />
<br />
Btw ... No. of new problems/errors until now since the migration to linux: Zero<br />

some more questions: how many users , which database you are using, how large is the database? <br />

<br />
we are still using tbase with 90 users. But as Juergen wrote, oracle shouldn't be any problem at all, we are already thinking about switching the DB to get the CPUs from idling all the day *g*.<br />
Size is about 15GB (.bdt and .bid files), but this is a very tricky number ... when all is said and zipped (bdbpre+gzip), hardly 1GB remains .... put these tables into oracle and about 50 GB (?) will be used.<br />

<br />
I've been tracking the development of the Linux porting set quietly for some time.  It's good news that we're seeing some success stories.  Much more so are are those posting raving reviews.<br />
<br />
So, I'd like to offer a question along the same vein as the poll.  Those of you who are running a Linux porting set (live, test, demo, etc), please let us all know what platform you moved from and the platform moved to.<br />
<br />
I am working on a plan to try and incorporate a linux based baan installation here at my office.  With the costs of the bigger iron being so steep, I think we can save some money by using higher end &quot;PC&quot; hardware.<br />
<br />
With these reports of 1000% increases, clarification of the architectures to and from would be extremely helpful in pusuasions.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
FT</div></div><hr />

Linux x86 Suse<br />
Supported OS version: SLES 8<br />
Supported databases: Informix 9.40<br />
Oracle 9.2, 10g<br />
Hardware: minimal Pentium-III<br />
Informix<br />
Supporting Informix requires as a minimum Suse SLES 8 with SP3<br />
Oracle<br />
Suse SLES 8 with SP3 is recommended.<br />
Reger doesnt have the Linux compatibility for us to go ahead with our plans. We are planning to move the database servers of our sandbox from HP-UX to Linux to see the cost/performance benefits.<br />
If Linux is officially supported by BaaN/SSA from Gemini/LN-6.1 and there is a significant cost/performance benefit, more customers would look forward to use it.</div></div><hr />

Does anybody have any experience with obtaining &quot;partner licenses&quot; or something like that from SSA?</div></div><hr />

With this policy I would say: no chance to become a partner or get any support. They only want to have 10-12 resellers and/or partners in germany. No freelancer, no small partners. But they've told to think about this. Hope it's better in US.<br />
