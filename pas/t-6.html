A lot of fun and a good experience. Probably why I'm still working in the Baan field now!:)</div></div><hr />

I am well aware that our application has its shortcomings, but<br />
functionality-wise, show me a better one.<br />

Baan ERP has good points compared to other ERP (i compare to JDE and Peoplesoft FDM, don't know SAP, O. Application). Manufacturing is very gread, finance integration is really powerfull and easily configurable (believe me...take a look to peoplesoft finance integration : you are able to do 20 % of baan is able and with a lot of more headache).<br />
<br />
But general ergonomic is very poor. We are mandatory to completly redisign sales order entry because it take 5 times more that our actual system to enter an order (and more time than in Triton 3.1). This ergonomic problem is present on many parts (specially in distribution and finance) : too much screen, too much click....<br />
<br />
Other strange thing : it is not possible to use a lot number that end by numeric!! We have done a big modification about that.<br />
<br />
The list can be long....<br />
<br />
I like baan ERP, I think it's really better than Peoplesoft FDM and JDE.  But functionnaly there is alot of things to improve.<br />
