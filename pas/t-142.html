<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DavidS</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to say that having found this forum through a posting on the Baanfans website, that this site knocks Baanfans into a cocked hat! It is more focused on issues relating to Baan and not bogged down with political machinations and by various parties who seem to have a personal agenda airing their greivances for all to see. <br />
<br />
Hopefully this more cultured level of debate (battles of the ***es excepted! lol!), along with the useful technical advice available will see this site go from strength to strength. It's a great resource. Long may it continue.:)</div></div><hr />

Found your post on the Baanfans site, Kai's baan forum and the Baan newsgroup. There is no way to miss it! (Don't remember if you did post on the britisch baan fans site, did you?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No we did not post on the UK fans site yet as neither on any country specific Baan Users Group forums. I know there are website for Dutch, German, Swiss, Austrialian etc user groups but they are all liased to BWU. Let's hope that word-of-mouth will make better promotion than any advertisement :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kai's Baan forum is a German discussion board at parsimony.<br />
I hope that the board master is not displeased when I <br />
publish it here.<br />

Would have loved to read / know the concerns that the DACH (German / Austrian / Swiss) Baan users have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">7th September 2001, 14:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as you know pat, I've done my bit with sending the message out on a few mailing lists that I have, word of mouth and platent plugging. On the Baanfans UK site there has been a few mentions...<br />
<br />
Nice to know that the battle of the s e x e s forum links have made a few people smile (even if I have taken a bit of stick for it :) ) but on the whole this is a very good site that allows technical questions and information to be shared amongst this (what was once thought small) growing community. I for one (being the highest poster) will be here regularly and hopefully be able to spread a bit of my knowledge around (once I can get into a question quick enough)</div></div><hr />
