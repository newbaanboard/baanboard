<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">3rd May 2017, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I see noticed that, however most of the time we have upgraded in place.<br />
The reason I asked the poll question was that I am curious to know how everyone is staging and incorporating additional application PMC solutions (i.e., MCDs) when going to a new Feature Pack.<br />
For example, are people adding additional MCDs/solutions into the Installable Units so the Installation Wizard will put them in along with the Feature Pack?<br />
If enough are put there then additional time will be spent during ftp from where Installation Wizard is running to the server being upgraded.<br />
Or are people making multiple passes (Installation Wizard followed by manually adding MCDs)?</div></div><hr />
