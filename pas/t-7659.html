This is about whether the user profile information on Baan, OS and database version should be displayed in each of the posts under the avatar and location info. Please refer to the following threads for previous discussions on this topic:<br />

If the poll reaches at least 200 votes, then the result will be binding :)</div></div><hr />

The more information from user profile you see the better result of using forum you have. When you see almost all blank lines in smb. profile it's difficult to understand what to speak about. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of displaying the Users Profile Entities (Baan Version, System, and Database) to the left of every post, it would be more informational if these entities were defined at a post level.<br />
<br />
Possibly by adding these fields to the &quot;Post&quot; page as optional string input fields. This way, the users could define specific version related information pertaining to their inquiry posts.<br />
<br />
Like:<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://home.attbi.com/~gfasbender/version.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
A lot of User profiles have multiple entries for the concerned fields.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How on earth did you fix up that screenshot? :) Wouldn't be easier but not impossible I think so worth considering. Let's see what the poll result is going to be and if the majority votes in favour we can assess the feasibility of this. My major concern would be that we will need some changes in database tables for this. Good tip though!</div></div><hr />

So in profile you should make it mandatory... unless empty?</div></div><hr />

By the end of next week, it may be 50.000001% Then we may have to do a 36-day long recount :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">22nd November 2002, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course we should make as much long recounts as it needs to obtain the TRUE result :)</div></div><hr />

Pat you should make some kind of &quot;HOT SPOT&quot; on the board with a link to URGENT MATTERS or IMPORTANT 4 ALL threads... put this thread in :D</div></div><hr />

Hi OmeLuuk,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.  This idea is yet another one thats been discussed in the past.  We'll revist this idea again and see what we can come up with.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I don't know if it's just me or if that's indeed the case, but don't you feel that there are less and less &quot;posts in the last 24 hrs&quot; thing everyday. Usually we could get some 3 pages of new posts per day, but it's kinda quiet lately. Maybe that's why not many people are voting. Pat/James, do you have a statistics on the &quot;number of new posts per day&quot; trend? Is it diminishing? Or are we just hitting seasonal pattern (tcmcs0116m000) :) ?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
We do indeed have similar stats. I don't think there's anything particular going on. Post-wise it is more quiet this week than usual but I would not get alarmed about that :) Keeping in mind that alot of US folks have days off this week because of the Thanksgiving, I think this is just a temporary flux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, the week's over and voting booth closed. Seems like we got a winner! So from now on, the information is shown next to each post.</div></div><hr />

I know it's sad but...<br />
<br />
Great idea , shame about the &quot;secrecy of the vote&quot; !!   Only joking<br />
<br />
But consider how many people have visited the board since the vote was initiated and compare it to the number of votes cast !<br />
<br />
They may be coming into the shop but can't see the goods perhaps</div></div><hr />

<br />
I searched the board for &quot;HOT&quot; and &quot;HOT SPOT&quot;, but nothing relevant... :(  Where is this &quot;discussion from the past&quot;?<br />
<br />
Anyway, is this idea still on the board?  How about adding a new forum in the general section, for all polls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">2nd July 2003, 23:19</div></div><div class="posttext">There isn't a 'hot spot'. Similar to that idea is creating FAQs which is something we are currently taking into account. So bear with us for a while :)<br />
<br />
Polls are and cannot be restricted to a particular forum so there's no sense to make a separate forum for that.</div></div><hr />
