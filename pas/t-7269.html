<br />
I would be interested to hear in which countries is actually Baan ERP (not Baan IV) used.<br />
<br />
So if you use Baan ERP, please fill up the following poll.<br />
<br />
To reduce the number of options, I decided on a maybe pretty european look of  the world, sorry for this.<br />

<br />
Would you now? I hope that this is not just a personal pecuniary or career interest.<br />
  <br />
To reduce the number of options, I decided on a maybe pretty european look of  the world, sorry for this.<br />
<br />
Why are you sorry in advance? Would more complete data be much extra burden for you?    <br />
<br />
I think the poll could have been useful to all users if it excluded any hint of geographical arrogance .  It could at least have an OTHER option to cater for those areas of no specific interest to the author but would make the data more valid and less ambiguous. (Middle East [Turkey Asia? S/E Europe?], Africa, Australia, NewZealand etc).   <br />

<br />
just to explain my european look: I am looking for reference customers close enough to visit. The motivation is selfish, I agree, but that was the purpose.<br />
<br />
I would not mind, if Pat would extend the whole poll to a larger number of choices.<br />
