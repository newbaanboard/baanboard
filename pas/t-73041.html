It would be great actually, we can also give support votes to another ERs<br />

Have a nice and healthy day<br />

Infor offers exactly this kind of voting in its support portal (see below).  Why do you see the need to duplicate this somewhere else?  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the screenshot. That ll help understand this poll better. Well, I thought, a generic thread on this topic will help raise awareness that something like this exists. I have seen some pretty awesome ER's which deserves votes but well, lack of awaeress is what I feel don't get people to know and vote.</div></div><hr />

I did also notice that not many people had voted in the Enhancement Request Site of Infor. But at least the Infor people see the requests there and process them according to their internal rules. If we set up our own copy here, then we will not be in direct contact with Infor!<br />
  <br />
Maybe  the solultion ist that we could create our own &quot;Enhancement Request&quot;-Forum that you asked for and discuss interesting ERs there and then ask our members to go and vote in the Infor-Site. We could also for example add a sticky thread in the forum to show the people how the actual voting by Infor can be done!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what the poll is for. Not for creating a forum/common thread for posting ER's but to share ER's already created on Xtreme, to discuss about them, to share interesting ideas which could turn into ER etc so that people can go and vote on Xtreme.<br />

I guess we are on same page now. :)</div></div><hr />

We had similar ideas in the past of co-operating with Baan company on the level 50 cases, i.e. enhancement requests but the interests simply was never there from Baan company side.</div></div><hr />
