<br />
We are looking at implementing scanners. As far as I can see, there are only 3 vendors which claim to have a Baan 5 interface for warehousing and manufacturing: Connectware, Bridgelogix &amp; Geneva Systems.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have experience with any of these on baan5?<br />
<br />
Any information would be great!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would recommend  you first try to  list exactly what aspects of data collection you will be scanning.  That way you will have a better idea of exactly where you are mapping into Baan functionality.  If you find that you will require your supplier (whoever it is) to write a &quot;new&quot; interface for your major areas then you might want to look at one of their competitors.<br />

Our product rmc3 middleware has been around forever (we were the first Baan partners in the US).   We are partners with IMEC barcode scanners.  We have stable (referencable) customers on Baan 5c, as well as a long history of B40cx customers.   I know this stuff works on Baan 5b, as I helped with the initial development there before Baan 5c came out.   <br />
<br />
Our version is scaled back from Connectware (i.e. less expensive!), but along the same lines.   We also have a full line of function servers ready to go with ours or any other middleware.  We have an awsome upgrade coming out soon that will give the user complete control over the Baan ddc and controllers, from one spot.<br />
<br />
You can look us up at www.rmcis.com.  I hate to advertise like this, but it seems like the Baan community has forgotten us - we're still here and producing great products.<br />

Shoot an email if you want any additional info.<br />

All companies listed in your poll do indeed have a solution for Baan.  I would recommend that you:<br />
<br />
1. Assemble a data collection project team, this team should provide input from all areas from receiving to shipping.  What do they need in data collection.<br />
<br />
2.  Contact each of the Vendors.  Keep in mind that all vendors will have both positive and negative responses from past customers.<br />
<br />
3.  Arrange a conference call with each Vendor and your project team.<br />
<br />
4.  Invite your top 2 or 3 choices to provide a demonstration of their product.<br />
<br />
5.  Make a team decision on whom to partner with.  Important factors in this decision should be: <br />
<br />
a) Risk - Will the vendor deliver as promised.  What is their history and future roadmap with Baan.<br />
b) How many Baan installs does each Vendor have?  Baan IV &amp; V<br />
c) Price - This should be a non event.  If the chosen vendor delivers as promised then your ROI or payback should be between 6 months and 1 year.<br />
<br />
Assure that your chosen partner plans to be involved with Baan for a while.  Assure that there are no data integrity issues with your Baan database.  <br />
<br />
I have spoken with each of the companies listed in your poll and am certain that all can provide a solution.  Who provides the best?  This can only be determined by your specific needs.<br />
<br />
Good Luck with the project.</div></div><hr />

www.am-connect.com<br />
<br />
They implemented thier scanning solution for Intermec Europe  (www.intermec.com).<br />
<br />
Great solution, very fast implementation time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hmward</div><div class="date">4th March 2002, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Zoltar, <br />
<br />
I noticed that you mentioned that you are running Baan Vb and wanting to integrate to a bar-coding solution. Our team has assisted and managed bar-coding solutions for a number of our customers, and are familiar with the data capture industry.<br />
<br />
A couple of quick questions: <br />
<br />
1. Have you considered first migrating to baan Vc before integrating to any third party system... which is as I understand it, somewhat less &quot;buggy&quot; than Vb, and is being treated by Baan like IVc4 used to be as far as focus and attention? <br />
<br />
2. Have you heard of Data Recognition? They also have a solution for Baan V which has been successfully implemented.<br />
<br />
3. Depending upon your company's size and strategic direction for the next year or two, you might want to consider adapting to more flexible technology which can address the data capture, but could also address ANY integration to Baan... whether it be for e-commerce, hand held integrations and so forth.... this could be a viable alternative for you. <br />
<br />
Please contact me if you would like to be pointed either towards DRI, or towards some of the other technologies and companies out there. I would be happy to help. <br />
<br />
thanks, <br />
<br />
Heather<br />
