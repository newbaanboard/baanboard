<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">14th October 2001, 22:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the board for the following:<br />
<br />
 Moderated<br />
 Database driven<br />
 From what I have seen so far, I think the archives will be maintained<br />
<br />
<br />
Somethings I miss from Baanfans and others I would like to see added<br />
<br />
 I really really like the threaded sytle of posting. Am actually surprised that vBulletin does not support it.<br />
 Option to post in Spanish/German and other languages with translations on the fly (machine translation).<br />
 Syntax coloring for code in Baan, just like the board supports it for PHP. Pat if you are willing to make extensions to vBulletin let me know, I could work with you. I know your no customisation policy :) but perhaps we could come with something that could work even with future releases or atleast does not break when upgrades are done.<br />
 I would like to see a Wiki (http://www.wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WelcomeVisitors) on the baanboard site. This last one might be a quantum leap for the Baan community which just got into control with a moderated forum. But if it does work, we could collectively write documentation on a lot of stuff. If you like PHP over Perl check out http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/<br />

<br />
Thanks again for the best Baan Message Forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">15th October 2001, 08:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Vamsi,<br />
<br />
You made some good comments!<br />
<br />
About the threaded style: I guess this a subjective thing. I prefer the vbulletin way. I think it will become more 'obvious' to work this way once the bulletin board reaches a sizeable volume and it becomes - more or less - impossible to 'browse' the forums without great effort. Members will rely more and more on the search and view new posts option. With that in mind, I think the message display will be more useful as it will be presented in the format of e.g. Baan support list of cases<br />
<br />
About the Archives: there is no need for archiving yet and it will be a long while to come yet before the database grows out of bounds so that archiving would be required. That's one of the reasons why we limit the attachment size. Eventually I hope vbulletin will have a proper archiving feauture.<br />
<br />
About other languages: I think this could be cumbersome one. Unless we can rely on a good and fast on-line translation service which can plug into vbulletin, I do not see this happen in the near future. Obviously, for those who would like to post non-English messages, you are free to do so as long as you add an English translation to the post yourself.<br />
<br />
About the syntax coloring: this could be a nice thing! Definatively going into our bags of ideas. We would be happy to see any PHP help come on board. Regarding the vbulletin hacks: we have installed a couple but only chosen ones which are more than likely going to be release independant or will be included as standard functionality in future releases. So there is room for debate :)<br />
<br />
About Wiki: I will have to check that out as I have no clue what it is!</div></div><hr />
