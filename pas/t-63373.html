<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">21st January 2013, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">ION is an integration framework which runs with ERP LN (fp7 and higher versions). It generates alerts via Emails using standard Business Object Documents which is quite essential at times when several important transactions needs to be tracked and the alerts regarding the same is required by the senior management or the key users.<br />
<br />
Various other facilities like triggering the workflows, LN message, document flows etc are some other concepts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was amazed to see this post. I visit Baanboard 10 times a day, but unfortunately missed this post. May be many others may not be aware of this, may be I thought questions pop up on the main screen ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is my vote. I would be glad to see a new forum for ION. Its new, its interesting, with so many new things and up-gradation's, it will be a very helpfull for the users who are implementing, implemented or are now Gurus of ION.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">30th March 2013, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like the responsive was largely positive so I am willing to give it a go and I have set up a new ION forum (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=83). You can find it under the Baan SIGs (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=21) section on the forum homepage. I have moved most of the existing posts on ION over the new forum.<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested in moderating the ION forum, then please contact me.</div></div><hr />
