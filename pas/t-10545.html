<br />
We are evaluating the market for services to integrate Baan with mobile devices. <br />
<br />
Examples would be:<br />
<br />
  - displaying stock inventory on your mobile<br />
  - accessing specific Baan sessions on your PDA<br />
<br />
The question is, wether Baan customers have a need for this. Therefore this poll.<br />
<br />
If we get enough positiv feedback, I would be more then happy to discuss more specific ideas.<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />

<br />
unfortunately the webpage of Triposys seems tobe in dutch only. <br />
<br />
But can you give me a short description, how/why your service engineers need this access method? What is the scenario and what is your benefit as a company?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">27th June 2003, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Herewith some English documentation.  It's TriOpSys' own translation, thus not perfect.<br />
<br />
The reason for my client to use it, is to have a better, (almost) realtime interface for the service guys, enabling direct invoicing, signing off by the customer, direct hours accounting, and inventory control of the stock in the service cars.  All this is now automated, and no more administrative people needed to enter these transactions afterwards.<br />
<br />
And please call me Nico! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">27th June 2003, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">there are 2 main ways of doing this, WI-FI based access or GPRS-based access<br />
<br />
we've done one the WI-FI already<br />
details at www.arcgateway.com (http://www.arcgateway.com) <br />
ideal for site-based wireless access to Baan with lots of off-the-shelf functionality<br />
<br />
the other way involves a more web-based solution, we're in the process of testing a nice solution for Baan4 covering areas like field service and field sales.  Drop me an email for more info<br />

Yes - it's a shameless advertisement!!  Ignore if you are not interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">13th September 2006, 05:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We're in the middle of implementing this. We're taking the web based approach since most PDAs (read Windows Mobile :) ) comes built in with web browser already. Webtop forms wouldn't fit PDAs' screen well, so we're constructing simple screens that connect to BaanIV via its API.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nidyar</div><div class="date">25th November 2006, 06:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We are shortly going for this in order to update the production status from shop floor. This also would reduce the errors in the data capture. Also now since todays data is entered in BaaN only tomorrow, onlie data capture will help to make it realtime. Eventually this realtime data will be accessed by customers worldwide to know the status of their orders in production. By the way our production lead time is 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />
