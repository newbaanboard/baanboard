<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mitchell</div><div class="date">12th January 2004, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently have an &quot;inventory obsolescense report&quot; which also prints a &quot;where-used report&quot;.<br />
<br />
After each item is printed on the obsolescense report, we print the &quot;where-used&quot; report.  <br />
<br />
The way I did this was within the report script - I have added STPAPI commands to call tibom1413m000.<br />
<br />
This works good except if the where-used report goes over one page.  Somehow I would like to control the printing of both reports.<br />
<br />
I have calculated remaining lines and I thought about passing this variable to tibom1413m00 - somehow calculating the number lines available to print the where-used ???<br />
<br />
Any ides on how I would do this ... I don't have source.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

The formatting of the page is wrong.  The where-used report thinks that the middle of the page is the top of the page ...</div></div><hr />

Then user the seq.* commands to read the report in and the spool.* commands to print it.  You should then be able to control the page ejects from one report.  Not easy, but sounds possible.<br />
