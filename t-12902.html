<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icke</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 19:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
lately I created an AFS for tisfc1101m000.<br />
Everything went fine, but since I installed this on another System,<br />
I got the Message '_clear.api.errors' . I know an old hat.<br />
Now I inserted the new Objects but the error still resist.(started the shared mempry too)<br />
The next step, I compared the portingsets of the Testsystem(on this system everyrthing was fine) and the Prod-system(there the error occurs) but no differences.<br />
Then I had a look on the Servicepacks.<br />
The testsystem runs with SP 5 and the prodsystem with SP 6, means, the system, where Session is running well has a lower SP than the prodsystem, there the session is not runnig.<br />
and now I'm on my wits end.<br />
any help is appreciated.<br />
Thanks in advance Jorg</div></div><hr />

My function servers work in production, but not in test.  In test we have the newer Tools objects.  I have had an open call with Baan support for months.  I would certainly open a call with Baan.<br />
<br />
You mention that you installed the &quot;newer&quot; objects, were these the same objects that are on your test server?  Is the session object the same between the two service packs? I am not sure what else you can do at this point without the support center.<br />
<br />
Since I am not an app admin - I wonder if it is possible to install a SP(maybe make note of what tools objects change), test your function server, and if it does not work, back out the SP.<br />
<br />
And I promise not to ask why test is one service pack behind production. :)<br />
<br />
Just a few thoughts.<br />

Not all of them, between service packs, are positive solutions and might have been reversed (or changed) within the next version of the standard programs.<br />
<br />
In order to have a solid solution for users, there should be some skind of test procedure, after installing new standard programs all afs functionality should be checked. This can be done using test and production server, but installed solutions should be the same. Normally this should not be that much of a problem but with the ongoing development of afs test and production should be equal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">The session mentioned in your post is a supported session so hopefully Baan support will help.  The bad news is the session I was using was not on the supported list. I was informed today that Baan support wants to close my case.  Guess I will have to find another solution for my problem. Sigh.<br />
<br />
You can check Quick Guide 1824 or solution 159836 for the supported sessions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 09:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Bit crappy about Baan not supporting all sessions!  Does this (reading between the lines) mean they do not really support AFS?  Sounds like it!<br />
<br />
Another suggestion, that worked (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10511) for me: debug the session that calls the AFS, and, using update/insert statements without saving immediately, get the form variables that you put before the insert/update.  In tihra1101 it was actually resetting a couple of them.  I fixed it by updating these fields between the insert/update call and the save call.  Could work for you as well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">11th September 2003, 11:26</div></div><div class="posttext">On Baan support site a list of available sessions is available. This in a restricted list (depending on the needs of BOW, I guess). But, based on email from support and peg, it is possible to add sessions to the list, if you can explain why (and sometimes how), supporting of sessions will be considered. Furthermore if a session is ready for BOW, it is clear that is should be ready for AFS, so changes will have to be made.<br />

Now I am just being told that this session is not supported and they want to close the case.  Normally this would not bother me, but I have yet to find a work around like on some of my other sessions - if we owned source then I could fix it.  Oh well - I will figure something out.<br />
