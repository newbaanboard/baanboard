<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">I.Benini</div><div class="date">10th October 2002, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I am trying to understand OLE with BaaN IV (some examples are mpsole.xls, findbug.xls, ecc.). I can run mpsole.xls, but I can' t run GetBaanUsers in Baan.xls. The error is &quot;Run Time error: 462. The remote computer doesn't exist or it is not avilable&quot;. The reason seems to be  the return value of Baan.Obj.ParseExecFunction(which is set to zero), but I suppose the connection to BaaN was never estabilished (the connection is estabilished through &quot;Set BaanObj = CreateObject(Baan4.Application)&quot;).<br />
 I set a default BW and during the login the hostname and the user are rigth. There aren't any other open BW. Why the error 426 ?<br />
<br />
If I click then Baan button in the MPS worksheet, the connection to BaaN is estabilished through the routine StartProcess and this works. Can I use StartProcess instead of CreatObject?<br />
<br />
Another question: I'd like to download from Baan to Execl a table (for example ttaad200, Users), then I'd like to modify something (for example ttaad200.name) and then send all records to Bann. <br />
The downlaod is something like GetBaanUsers, but this would have the same functionality of the worksheet InputSpec in mpsole.xls. Is it possible? And if I would download only users which satisfy some conditions (for example all users whose name begins for &quot;a&quot;, then all users whose user type is super user) how can I do ?<br />
<br />
I hope someone could help me.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had problems like this before.  It could be a combination of any of these - baan client, porting set, tools objects.  All of those need to be sync'ed up. I usually do not like to do this, but you may want to contact the support center. <br />
