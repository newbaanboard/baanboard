While running AFS for sales order header and detail , i am getting an error(&quot;Signal: Hold reason Credit Check applies.  Reason: Signal: Hold reason General Reason applies&quot;) with a &quot;OK&quot; button.<br />
<br />
Thru AFS i want to handle this message.<br />
But the problem is there is no message code for this message.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how to tackle this problem..kindly help me out.<br />
I have attached the screen shot of that error.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

If there is no message code returned from the AFS code then you may not have to do anything.  What happens after you say okay?  If it just continues then do you need the message?<br />
<br />
What I have had to do in the past is do some checks prior to calling my afs code to determine messages like signal code set.  Then usually I skip the processing thru the AFS code. Or I just pass a message to the user - depends on what is needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not possible.<br />
<br />
About the messages, the warnings(the ones with just one OK button) doesn't create any problem(at last I can't remember one case on LN).</div></div><hr />

For this you have to use  DAL functions to manipulate the data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what i suppose  to say, it that no message appeared. There are no interaction with them. The only case i have faced whose the AFS started a session and it had been showed to the user was in a form command which started a GBF. Just a guess but maybe that happens because of the MMT Session. You do not have total control of all session indeed. <br />
<br />
If you have the sources of the sessions. You can handle the message using the famous <br />
<br />
if not api.mode then<br />
message<br />
endif</div></div><hr />
