<br />
I have been trying to use Call Request Application on Android by Infor.<br />
It connects to ION API and uses with Infor LN. So I have setup the ION API correctly. The verification has been done and ION API is working properly now.<br />
The problem comes when I am going to use Call Request.<br />
Steps are as follows:<br />
1. Download and install the app from Google Play Store.<br />
2. Scan QR code of the app in ION API.<br />
3. Login.<br />
4. Error &quot;The requested service could not be found.&quot; right after the login and every time I reopen the app. By doing anything in the app such as refresh, search, or create new request, it will give out that error too. <br />
So basically, Call Request is not working properly.<br />
<br />
I have setup the User Profile for the user in LN. I have also installed every suggested solution in every related KB about Call Request with LN 10.6.<br />
<br />
The Monitoring in ION API only shows one incoming request, which succeeded.<br />
 GET  /infor/Mingle/SocialService.Svc/User/Detail<br />
This will come only when I reopen the application -- not every time the error shows up.<br />
<br />
Anyone got an idea for this?</div></div><hr />
