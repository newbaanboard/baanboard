I am trying to automate the process of Maintain transactions cycle (Finance) for purchase invoices using AFS by taking input from a file but the minute the record gets inserted into tfgld1102s000 which is the child process of tfgld1101s000 doesnt exit though there is absolutely no problem inthe record getting inserted and saved.I tried using the AFSLOG option also but it didnt give me anything in the error log.As the session tfgld1102s000 AFS doesnt exit the entire session gets stuck and the process doesnt continue.It does if I kill the session using the ps option and killing the process id of that session manually.<br />
There is no data problem as I am inserting valid records<br />
The same session used to work fine when we had a multifinance setup done in April 2004 but now the same doesnt work.<br />
<br />
Hope to receive a prompt reply for the same as my project work is at stake because of this<br />

If so then contact Baan and get the latest patches for AFS and the sessions, this alone may solve the problem since it use to work in April.<br />
<br />
On the flip side I have seen sub-sessions disappear after a successful insert.  As for control yes I did post some code that I developed to kill off the sessions that you can not control.  Not an elegant solution, but it did solve my problem. You can search for kill and my user-id to see the code.  In my case the session started and I could not control it, so I killed it and restarted it with stpapi.zoom.  This allowed me to control it. I am not sure I would recommend that you use this code because getting the latest patches may solve the problem.  Just a thought.<br />

Well actually i tried using suspend function of Baan IV which ends active process.Once I did that the session started working.<br />
I used it after inserting a purchase order line record.<br />
