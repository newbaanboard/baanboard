<br />
I just went through most of these threads to get some answers on the Baan OLE interface, but a number of things are still unclear to me. Hopefully someone can answer my questions:<br />
<br />
1. How feasible is it to use OLE as an interface for a sales order webfrontend ?<br />
2. Do I need to have a BW session running for the OLE to connect to, or can this be invoked dynamically through the VB code ?<br />
3. If I have 3 (web)clients entering orders, can this be funneled through 1 BW client, or will a new client be started for each webclient ?<br />
<br />
Thanks !<br />

I was never really comfortable with Baans support of the product.  Last time I talked to them they said they only support Open World, something else we would have to buy.  And then on top of that each upgrade(tools, porting set) always seemed to cause new problems.<br />
(2) No you do not need a bw session running.  I typically use a different .bwc configuration file for connection via Excel.  I save my password in the file so I do not have to keep entering it.  This way in the code I can start a connection only when I need it.<br />
(3) I think you need 1 BW license per client.  In theory a user can log into Baan, start some Baan sessions, etc.  Then at the same time run an OLE connection to use this same license.  When ever I tried something like this I had problems.  I do no think there is a way to use one bw connection to server three licenses.<br />

There is also the exchange option but this can be complicated for things like sales orders that update a lot of tables and often start different subsessions. I did an Exchange scheme to update planned supply chain orders for the SCH1 extention and I ended up having to update about 5 tables and read data out of another 10 or 12. If you use exchange you have to duplicate a lot of the session code like writing you own condition code to update free numbers etc. It can be done with exchange but yo need to be confident that you understand exactly what the session your duplicating does.</div></div><hr />
