This s/w does not require source code and can very well live with the architecture of baan. The link for info on this is &lt;http://www.fullscope.com/corp/info/qkey.jsp&gt;<br />
but this is insufficient. <br />
Please reply if any one knows about it.<br />
Regards,<br />

However, do not be tricked into believing you can do everything without source code as this product (or any others like it) will NOT let you change<br />
the BaaN session functionality.  You cannot remove a section of<br />
code (like an after.field) and replace it with new code. You can only stopped executing the code or add more code.  Where as this can be useful in adding table/form fields, more calculations,<br />
etc.  you can not modify BaaN in the same way as if you had source code.  It has been a little bit since we have use it, but I would be happy to answer any speicific questions you may have<br />
if able.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Steve<br />
<br />
P.S.  I have alos recently come across another product similiar to<br />
this called RMCis and you can contact this person if you desire more info kbarthelt@rmcis.com.  This product has some additional features that QKEY (like session combining for job streams).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OldRoper</div><div class="date">30th July 2002, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">SSBAAN stated that you cannot remove standard functionality and replace it with your own ... this is not true. There is a |#inhibit command that will allow to do exactly that. This is not recommended, the QKEY people will tell you not to do it, but the functionality is there.<br />
<br />
It is true that QKEY will not allow you to everything that a source code mod will allow you to do - but when you don't have source code this product will open the doors to many creative solutions that wouldn't be possible otherwise.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents</div></div><hr />
