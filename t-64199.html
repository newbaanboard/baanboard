<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PW@KKI</div><div class="date">18th June 2013, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">A little while ago, I sucessfully created a VB web application that passed parameters from app/web interface and created a Sales Order on BaaN IV.<br />
<br />
I now want to do the same process but intergrating to Infor10 LN.<br />
<br />
Whilst I can sort of use my current code, it fails at the last hurdle. I suspect it may have something to do with LN not using 'functions' so much.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that LN has many scripts that could maybe(?) called remotely.<br />
<br />
Ideally, what I would like is a snippet of code (Visual Studio/VB) that will allow me to 'call' an LN script to do something on LN itself.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help on this ???</div></div><hr />

What kind of script? If its 3GL, what you can do is create a session which calls a 3GL script in its 4GL script using activate(). And then you can create a VB File to launch the newly created session.<br />
<br />
Here's a way to call:- (This launches Sales Orders session)<br />
<br />
Set baanobj = CreateObject(&quot;Baan.Application.Live&quot;) <br />
BaanObj.ParseExecFunction &quot;ottstpstandard&quot;, &quot;zoom.to.menu(&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;tdsls4100m000&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;,2,&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;,0,0)&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Live is the bwc configuration file.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can get lots of threads on the board!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moving on, the other code snippit was rather cool ... that works nicely ...... but .....<br />
<br />
Let's say I want to create a Quotation Header on LN passing some data from my web page - how should i code that (my old code that I used for BaaN IV worked nicely, but on LN it doesn't!!)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />

I am jus not sure how you would call it like the above - ottstpstandard like Bhushan mentioned.</div></div><hr />
