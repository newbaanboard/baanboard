(1) Thanks Vamsi.  You gave a interesting idea.  In this version you select the printer with a version of this script and THEN it launches a sub-session which asks if you want to create a PDF file, launch word or excel. I am sorry to say it is still only a UNIX version.  Hopefully we can add other useful conversions.  Maybe a Email section or a text session.<br />
<br />
(2) Is there a way to tell if you on NT client or server?  Is that what the fix slash is for?  If so  a check could be built in that would fix the slashes for NT.<br />
<br />
(3) I downloaded Ghostscript and tested this, but since I do not know ghostscript I think something is wrong with the format.  Hopefully you or someone else can fix this.  Check the PDF file in the attachment.<br />
<br />
(4) Hope new documentation is enough for others to get started.<br />
<br />
Mark <br />
<br />
PS: Do not hold it against me if I forgot to attach something. I had to come to work, so I took a few hours and rushed through this.<br />

Hi Vamsi,<br />
<br />
I have used your solution to print in PDF and tweaked the hard coded portions <br />
to suit my environment.<br />
<br />
For an intial test, I have hard coded the start_app(.... as follows:<br />
<br />
app_id = app_start(start, &quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<br />
WHERE : start = &quot;AcroRd32.exe&quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; &quot;c:\temp\ajit.ps&quot; .<br />
<br />
ajit.ps is the file being created in c:\temp.<br />
<br />
When I run the program in debug , it starts acrobat but gives me the error <br />
message - <br />
&quot;There was an error opening this document. A file read error has occured&quot;.<br />
<br />
Would you know why I am getting this error?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time,<br />
Ajit.<br />

Open a command prompt on your local pc and try the command. Whatever works on your local pc is what you want to put in the Baan script. At first looks, I believe you are trying to open a postscript file in Adobe Acrobat Reader. To my knowledge this is not supported. Acrobat reader only supports pdf files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ajitdon</div><div class="date">21st August 2002, 21:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Vamsi, Mark:<br />
<br />
I am trying to print in PDF using Mark's version(pdfvers31.zip) for UNIX as a starting point.<br />
<br />
ENVIRONMENT:<br />
Baan Server - Unix.<br />
Client - Windows 2000<br />
Ghostscript (gs653w32.exe) present in d:\baan\tmp <br />
<br />
DEVICE MANAGER SETUP:<br />
Device - PDFIT<br />
Type - Rewrite<br />
Locale - ISO-8859-1<br />
4GL Program - otccomconv4<br />
Argument - POSTSCRIPT<br />
Path - d:\baan\tmp\ajit<br />
<br />
PROBLEM:<br />
<br />
It seems Ghostwriter is not creating the ajit.pdf file.<br />
The ajit.ps file is being created in d:\baan\tmp <br />
However, it seems that the ajit.pdf file is not being created by Ghostwriter. <br />
<br />
I am reproducing the code for function create.pdf() below :<br />
<br />
|***************<br />
<br />
function create_pdf()<br />
{<br />
        long    fp1		| File to create PDF File.<br />
        string  tmp.file1(1024)<br />

	<br />
	<br />
|Create some temp files.<br />
	tmp.file1 = creat.tmp.file$( bse.tmp.dir$() )<br />
 	<br />
|Open the temp files.	<br />
        fp1 = seq.open(tmp.file1, &quot;w&quot;)<br />
<br />
| Put Ghostwriter stuff<br />
        seq.puts(&quot;-q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE#pdfwrite&quot;, fp1)<br />
        seq.puts(&quot;-sOutputFile#&quot;&amp;local.path, fp1)<br />
        seq.puts(&quot;-q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE#pdfwrite -c save pop -sOutputFile#&quot;&amp;local.path &amp; &quot; -f &quot; &amp; local.path(1;(len(local.path)-3))&amp;&quot;ps&quot;, fp1)<br />
	<br />

	<br />
| Move these two files to the c drive.<br />

	<br />
|Move the postscript file to the client.<br />
	server2client(tmp.file, local.path(1;(len(local.path)-3))&amp;&quot;ps&quot;,1)<br />
	| Setup filename to start.<br />
	ret = rdi.domain.enum.value( &quot;tugs&quot;,1,&quot;2&quot;,app1,appl,fval)<br />
	appl = &quot;d:\BAAN\tmp\gs653w32.exe&quot;	<br />
<br />
        ret = app_start(appl &amp; &quot; @_.gs1&quot;, &quot;d:\BAAN\tmp.ps&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;) <br />
| Make sure GS is completed before launching Acrobat.	<br />
        if ret &gt;= 0 then<br />
        | not equals<br />
                while app_status(ret) &lt;&gt; 0<br />
                        suspend(500)<br />
                endwhile<br />
        else<br />
                message(&quot;Error %d encountered while starting Ghostscript&quot;, (-1 * ret))<br />
        endif<br />
|Delete old temp file.<br />
        ret = seq.unlink(tmp.file)<br />
	ret = seq.unlink(tmp.file1)<br />
	<br />
| Start adobe acrobat<br />
	appl = &quot;AcroRd32.exe&quot;<br />
	ret = rdi.domain.enum.value( &quot;tugs&quot;,4,&quot;2&quot;,app1,appl,fval)<br />
	start= appl &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; local.path<br />
	<br />
| Start the aplication.<br />
	start_app()<br />
<br />
}<br />
  <br />
|**********<br />
<br />
The problem seems to be within the code that is calling the ghostwriter. <br />
I have tried two variations:<br />
(1) | Setup filename to start.<br />
	ret = rdi.domain.enum.value( &quot;tugs&quot;,1,&quot;2&quot;,app1,appl,fval)<br />
	appl = &quot;d:\BAAN\tmp\gs653w32.exe&quot;	<br />
<br />
        ret = app_start(appl &amp; &quot; @_.gs1&quot;, &quot;d:\BAAN\tmp&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;) <br />
<br />
When using this, at this command the ghostwriter install pop up starts and I have to go through the complete ghostwriter installation everytime - still no ajit.pdf file is created.<br />
<br />
(2) | Setup filename to start.<br />
	ret = rdi.domain.enum.value( &quot;tugs&quot;,1,&quot;2&quot;,app1,appl,fval)<br />
	appl = &quot;d:\BAAN\tmp\gs653w32.exe&quot;	<br />
<br />
        ret = app_start(appl &amp; &quot; @_.gs1&quot;, &quot;d:\BAAN\tmp.ps&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;) <br />
<br />
When using this, at this command, nothing seems to happen. The debugger just goes through it very quickly.  Again, no ajit.pdf file is created.<br />
<br />
|***************<br />
In both cases, at the command that launches acrobat,<br />
<br />
[[ app_id = app_start(start,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<br />
Where: start = &quot;AcroRd32.exe d:\baan\tmp\ajit.pdf&quot; ]]<br />
<br />
the acrobat reader application is launched but it gives a pop up error message - &quot; There was an error opening this document. The file does not exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
It seems because of some problem with the ghostwriter, the ajit.pdf file is not being created.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time,<br />
Ajit.</div></div><hr />

You have a line of code in you post:<br />
<br />
ret = app_start(appl &amp; &quot; @_.gs1&quot;, &quot;d:\BAAN\tmp.ps&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;) <br />
| Make sure GS is completed before launching Acrobat. <br />
<br />
<br />
Shouldn't it read:<br />
<br />
ret = app_start(appl &amp; &quot; @_.gs1&quot;, &quot;d:\BAAN\tmp&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;) <br />
| Make sure GS is completed before launching Acrobat.<br />
<br />
Wasn't quite sure... I was just comparing your code to code I modified to get it to work...<br />
<br />
Also under Control Panel in windows I have set up the following System path:   D:\gs\gs7.03\bin<br />
<br />
so that all I have to call is:<br />
<br />
appl = &quot;gswin32c.exe&quot;<br />
ret = app_start(appl &amp; &quot; @_.gs1&quot;, &quot;c:\temp&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<br />
<br />
to run the Ghostwrite and not have to go through the entire install.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot!<br />
That was the problem.<br />
<br />
Now it works for me!.<br />
<br />
However, that is the problem - it only works for me.<br />
<br />
Will I have to install ghostrscript on all PCs that should be able to use it? Or is their an easier way to install the ghostwriter on the server (Unix for us?) or can we have ghostwriter on <br />
<br />
Has anyone tried this?<br />

However, I believe that GhostWriter has a network version that could be set up so that all networked users could access it.  We were going to look at it when we have time, but you know how that goes...</div></div><hr />

I released the code with it implemented on the local pc because I do not have a business need for it to be present on the server :). Install Ghostscript on the Baan server (it is available for all flavours of unix and windoze) and make changes to create the pdf on the server instead of the client.<br />

Good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally managed to get a working concept of the Unix installation.<br />
<br />
First of all, installing ghostscript on Solaris is no picnic. It took me several days to get it to compile and then several more to get it to compile properly.<br />
Maybe it would have helped if I actually knew what I was doing? ;)<br />
<br />
I still have some issues with the way gs is producing its PDF files, probably due to incorrect fonts or stuff...anybody here with extensive adobe knowledge?<br />
But I'll get that fixed down the road.<br />
<br />
Then Mark's code wouldn't run for me at all, vamsi's code wouldn't produce any results, so I ended up with a very stripped down version that looks like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
	domain  tcmcs.str100    local.path<br />
<br />
        | Convert the report file<br />
        tmp.file = creat.tmp.file$( bse.tmp.dir$() )<br />
        wait.and.activate(&quot;ttstpconv&quot;, argv$(1), tmp.file, &quot;POSTSCRIPT&quot;, argv$(4))<br />
<br />
        local.path = argv$(2)<br />
        | make sure the final file has a valid extension<br />
        if rpos(toupper$(local.path), &quot;.PDF&quot;) &lt;&gt; (len(local.path) - 3) then<br />
                local.path = local.path &amp; &quot;.pdf&quot;<br />
        endif<br />
<br />
	gs.path = &quot;/opt/apps/baan/gs/6.53/bin/gs&quot;<br />
	gs.options = &quot;-dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=- -dBATCH &quot; &amp; tmp.file &amp; &quot; &gt; &quot; &amp; local.path<br />
	gs.command = gs.path &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; gs.options<br />
<br />
|	ret = run.prog(gs.path, gs.options, RP_WAIT)<br />
	ret = shell( gs.command, SHELL_MWINDOW )<br />
        ret = seq.unlink(tmp.file)<br />
<br />
Notice I had to use the shell() function instead of the run.prog() to get it to work (thanks for the tip, Prashanth). If anybody has any idea why run.prog wouldn't work as entered in the above code, I'd like to hear it.<br />
<br />
Also, both Vamsi's and Mark's versions have the script type 'library' in the code. This needs to be 3GL (thank you vamsi for this clarification).<br />
<br />
I will have to incorporate some more code to move the pdf files to the right destination based on what user, etc. But this is the gest of it.<br />
<br />
Remind me to attach the Solaris make file so other poor souls don't have to go through this part of the struggle.</div></div><hr />

Glad you got it working.  As for the run.prog - I wonder if it would have the same problem I had with the sed program. Had to put some quotes around the commands.  Below worked for me and I wonder if it could be something like that in this case. Just a guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
sed.cmd = sprintf$(&quot;-c %ssed -f %s %s&gt;%s%s&quot;,<br />
                chr$(34), tmp.sed.file, return.file, tmp.sed.output.file, chr$(34))<br />
status = run.prog(&quot;sh&quot;,sed.cmd,RP_WAIT)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your contribution.<br />

The above code is part of Ghostscript command lines.  I am certainly no expert with Ghostscript.  I had to play around with the point values to get it to work.  If you convert from points to inches (divide by 72) you actually get a width of 13 inches and a height of 11 inches.  If I tried to use 8.5 high by 11 wide my headers and footers were being cut off by the conversion.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the great ideas about printing PDF files.<br />
I got Ghostscript running on a Digital Unix system, and use the selection option menu for Word, Excel, Outlook, Internet Explorer, Notepad, Wordpad and Acrobat PDF. <br />
<br />
Still there's one problem: how do I handle a Baan report over 66 lines, and 132 columns (or more)? Right now it doesn't fit on a &quot;regular&quot; A4. <br />
<br />
Here are the Ghostscript options I use:<br />
<br />
gs.options = &quot;-q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=- -sPAPERSIZE=a4  -c save pop -dBATCH &quot; &amp; tmp.file &amp; &quot; &gt; &quot; &amp; local.path<br />

I managed to solve the problem:<br />
<br />
When the user selects PDF output I added some spooling options:<br />
<br />
	if (opt.pdf = tgyenox.yes) then<br />
		spool.fontnumber = 2<br />
		spool.paper.type = &quot;PS&quot;<br />
		spool.pg.length = 60<br />
		create_pdf()<br />

    I was looking at different options available for printing PDF documents from Baan and I came across this tool called &quot;PDF995&quot; available at<br />
    http://www.pdf995.com/download.html<br />
<br />
   This tool is free and you can create PDF documents just like that!  <br />
<br />
Steps :<br />
<br />
1.  Download this pdf995 from the above URL<br />
2.  Extract the file from zip and install it.<br />
3.  This will install a printer on the local machine with name &quot;PDF995&quot;<br />
<br />
How to create PDF documents:<br />
1.  Print documents from Baan with option to &quot;Preview&quot;<br />
2.  When the document appears in preview, goto<br />
     File-&gt;Print<br />
3.  Select the installed printer &quot;PDF995&quot;<br />
4.  Give a file name when it prompts and the file will be created!<br />
5.  Good thing is this will take images/logos created for baan documents<br />
6.  Annoying part is everytime this printer device is used, their promo page appears in explorer.  You can avoid this by getting license key.</div></div><hr />

I have been trying for the past couple of days to compile the downloaded ghostscript for the Unix flavor and I have been unsuccessful.  We are on HP-UX 11.11.   I saw your message that you have been successfully using ghostscript to do the conversion for you.  Would you be able to guide me as to where I am going wrong.   As per the ghostscript documentation, I have downloaded all the ghostscript sources including the required 3rd party libraries(jpeg, png, zlib).   I did the &quot;configure&quot; first which successfully created the &quot;makefile&quot;.

ERROR:  &quot;Undefined symbol: size_t.  function prototypes are an ansi feature.  type of &quot;&lt;&lt;NULL_SYMBOL&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; is undefined due to an illegal declaration.<br />

<br />
You need an ANSI compiler. Get GCC HP has a package for it.<br />
<br />
They probably also have a precompiled package for ghostscript<br />
while you're at it.<br />
<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">2nd September 2004, 08:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Punitha,<br />
<br />
there are somethings to note: 1) &quot;undefined symbol: size_t&quot;, 2) &quot;function prototypes are an ansi feature&quot; and 3) &quot;type of &quot;&lt;&lt;&gt;&quot; is undefined due to an illegal declaration&quot;.<br />
<br />
I would like to start with 2. Obviously, you are compiling with an non-ANSI C Compiler. =&gt; If you run &quot;type cc&quot; the answer might be &quot;cc is a tracked alias for /usr/bin/cc&quot;. That compiler is okay for compiling the kernel, but not useful for most other applications!<br />
=&gt; Any other C compilers available on your system? HP-UX ANSI-C compiler such as /opt/ansic/bin/cc? GNU-C eg. as /usr/local/bin/gcc?<br />
<br />
Next is 1. size_t is normally a type definition that comes from #include &amp;lt;sys/types.h&amp;gt;.<br />
=&gt; Try the following to verify your C compiler: make a new directory. create a file test.c with the following content:<br />
<br />
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;<br />
<br />
size_t s;<br />
<br />
int foo(size_t s) /* that is a &quot;modern&quot; declaration */<br />
{<br />
}<br />
<br />
int bar(s) /* that is a kernighan/ritchie style declaration; */<br />
int s;     /* works since 1970 ... */<br />
<br />
{<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
To compile this file x.c into an object x.o, say &quot;cc -c x.c&quot;. Try this for some other C ompilers (if you have).<br />
<br />
Finally 3. Hmmh! That looks like C++, but could also be an error; &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;?. Btw. What version of ghostscript are you trying to compile?<br />

I think I'll do just that.  I'll get the complete compiler version for HP.<br />
<br />
PS: I did try downloading &quot;gcc&quot; and I had a similar problem and &quot;gcc&quot; websource had suggested that the same.  The site recommends downloading the latest patches so that there is no problem with linking, compiling during the build and also to have the complete compiler version(just as you had suggested).<br />
<br />
Thanks again Dave.   I'll do the same and post my results here as soon as I can,<br />

<br />
Yes, It does seem like I don't have the ANSI C compilation version.   I tried your sample program and I received a compilation error for the &quot;modern type or ANSI function declaration&quot; and &quot;knr&quot; style didn't have any problems.   <br />
<br />
I also did a &quot;swlist&quot; on my server and I didn't find any &quot;ANSI&quot; software set loaded.   Also I did a &quot;cc -A&quot; which verifies if I have the ANSI compilation option available and I got an error that &quot;-A option is supported only in ANSI C compilers&quot;.   <br />
<br />
I had also downloaded &quot;gcc&quot; from &quot;gcc.gnu.org(Thank You FSF!)&quot;.  But, when I built it, I got the same type of compilation error message and from what I saw on the Web, I definitely will have to get the proper compiler(just as you had suggested).<br />
<br />
So,  I am going to research and find out what patches/pkgs I have to apply to our current software list to allow ANSI C compilation.<br />
<br />
Thanks Gunther.<br />

I downloaded various versions of &quot;GCC&quot; and I still couldn't build a compiler successfully to configure Ghostscript from the source.<br />
<br />
Therefore, being on a time crunch, I chose the easier path of installing the HP-UX binaries from the software depot using &quot;swinstall&quot;.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to the HP-UX binaries.<br />
http://hpux.cs.utah.edu/hppd/hpux/PostScript/ghostscript-7.07b/<br />
<br />
Now, I have a working version of ghostscript 7.07 but I still need to smooth out a few more problems - fonts etc.,<br />
<br />
I'll update this post further after I have done with my research,<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone,<br />

Here is where I left off last year.<br />
This is the server-side version of Vamsi's code. It will take your print file and dump it in pdf format in the specified directory.<br />
If you want the pdf output to go to your local client instead, start the filename with an '*'.<br />
Starting the filename with a '@' will email the pdf to the specified address. Oops, I forgot....that part is actually not working.....yet.<br />
<br />
This will be updated soon but I thought I'd share my latest and greatest and let some of you do the work for me instead ;)</div></div><hr />

Forgot about that part. <br />
Now why on earth am I setting the page height to 12*spool.pg.length? I remember vaguely having to analyze actual font sizing methods and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Did I ever mention that my memory is mostly dysfunctional?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most times a line is about 12 pts high. Figured you must be multiplying the number of lines with number of pts per line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here are the steps.<br />
- Install Ghostscript on the server. Google for download locations.<br />
- Create a 3GL script and compile it successfully.<br />
- Create a Baan print device with arguments as specified in the thread. Ensure that the object created in step two is used in the device specification.<br />
- Print and enjoy the results.<br />

If you are still not successful, please post specific problem. Also if you are not comfortable installing software and compiling scripts, look to www.nazdaq.co.il for ready to go solutions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy Purdey</div><div class="date">20th February 2007, 13:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I came across this post when I was trying to solve the problem of creating PDF output from Baan.  I can highly recommend this software, it is really easy to install and use - there are several other useful freebies on this site as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks for putting up this post.<br />
<br />
Guys,<br />
    I was looking at different options available for printing PDF documents from Baan and I came across this tool called &quot;PDF995&quot; available at<br />
    http://www.pdf995.com/download.html<br />
<br />
   This tool is free and you can create PDF documents just like that!  <br />
<br />
Steps :<br />
<br />
1.  Download this pdf995 from the above URL<br />
2.  Extract the file from zip and install it.<br />
3.  This will install a printer on the local machine with name &quot;PDF995&quot;<br />
<br />
How to create PDF documents:<br />
1.  Print documents from Baan with option to &quot;Preview&quot;<br />
2.  When the document appears in preview, goto<br />
     File-&gt;Print<br />
3.  Select the installed printer &quot;PDF995&quot;<br />
4.  Give a file name when it prompts and the file will be created!<br />
5.  Good thing is this will take images/logos created for baan documents<br />
6.  Annoying part is everytime this printer device is used, their promo page appears in explorer.  You can avoid this by getting license key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have been using Baan ERP LN and the operating system is Unix AIX 5.3 version. We would like to have a device defined in Baan ERP LN as &quot;PDF&quot; and when any reports from Baan is used for printing and we select the device &quot;PDF&quot; we would like the output to be printed to a file in pdf format. Please let us know the procedure to do this. Since we are new to this please explain to us in simple words. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Please see the  attachement, this is what we use at my company, we are now registered with PDF 995 so we don't get the banner.<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm new too and I don't really understand what you mean about &quot;create a 3GL script and compile it&quot; and how install the scripts.<br />
I haven't the baan sources,but is it possible to do that ?<br />
<br />
Can you give me a step by step tutorial ?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd August 2011, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">See the very first post by ~vamsi it contains the source code that goes into the 3gl script.  To create a 3gl script all you have to do is use ttadv2130m000 on my system which is 4c4.  Insert a new script name, edit the file - then cut and paste vamsi's code into the script.  At that point follow the directions and read thru this thread. There are a couple of links to where you can get the ghostscript code.  I won't be much help with it since I have not touched it in years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sramage</div><div class="date">3rd August 2011, 09:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your answer.<br />
Since I have no autorization on session ttadv2130m000, no chance to extend baan for me...</div></div><hr />
