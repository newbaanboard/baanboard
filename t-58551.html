<br />
Linking the Release Outbound and Print Packing Slips sessions using AFS.<br />
<br />
Finally have the sessions running correctly, however, prior to linking the sessions, Release Outbound was typically run to a Display device, the data skimmed for errors, and then Print Packing Slips was run.<br />
<br />
What I'm finding is that the display device does appear, but then disappears when the stpapi.end.session(&quot;tdilc4202m000&quot;) call is made. (Which is pretty quick, doesn't give the user time to review)<br />
<br />
Anyone figure out a way around this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Alternatively, you can get the spool.fileout or the output file and then call the function - display.file() (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7823&amp;highlight=display.file)</div></div><hr />

I have never had a problem with this. I even just tested it again to make sure.  What SP are you on?  I know SP-27 has had some issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I put NPRao's suggestion in place, with the idea of capturing the spooled file and displaying it.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, when I was debugging it this time, the display window remained open, before it hit the &quot;display.file&quot; line.<br />
<br />
Maybe just adding the #pragma used dll ottdlldisplay delcaration was all that was needed.</div></div><hr />
