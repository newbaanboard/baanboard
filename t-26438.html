<br />
After major Baan update (from SP7 to SP18) it stopped working. <br />
<br />
I debugged it and it stops when it should end sessions:<br />
<br />
stpapi.recover(sess.opno.report,err.recover)<br />
stpapi.end.session(&quot;tdilc4208s000&quot;)<br />
stpapi.end.session(&quot;tdilc4207s000&quot;)<br />
stpapi.end.session(&quot;tihra1211s000&quot;)<br />
stpapi.end.session(&quot;tisfc0506m000&quot;)<br />
stpapi.end.session(sess.opno.report)<br />
<br />
if i kill sessions manually it ends normally<br />
<br />
thanks for help in advance</div></div><hr />

One major thing I ran into when we updated to SP17 was that not all subsessions needed to be killed.  I am not sure this is the case in your situation. On our system when you started a main session and part of it was a display session, you only had to end the main session.  I also believe in SP17 was were I first ran into all of the changes for the other warehouse management system SSA has - that also caused big problems in the receiving area.  These were the two major problems I ran into.</div></div><hr />

I've also reported the problem to our local representative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It means while u r passing stppi.end.session(), still it is not able to kill sessions.<br />
<br />
Can you pls post your code for the AFS. may be u r calling or killing subsessions at wrong place.<br />
<br />
i have done this AFS thrice for my 3 diffreent clients but never faced problem. i done it on Baan IV C4 is5 SP18<br />
<br />
pls post ur code for the AFS.<br />
<br />
