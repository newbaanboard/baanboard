<br />
We are evaluating vendors for our upcoming BAAN implementation (BAAN IV c4) and are researching RF Solutions for Receiving, Putaway, Picking, Inventory (Adjustments/Transfers/Cycle counts), Shipping, and Manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">2nd September 2004, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - I can't speak for Epic or Bridgelogix, they are our competition.   Our company RMCis (http://www.rmcis.com) has been doing Baan data collection for many years.  We have recently released an updated version of our middleware suite, giving one-spot control and visual display of the entire system to the administrators, down to the individual handheld status.  If you have not nailed down your final considerations, we would love the opportunity to show you our product as well.  We have a middleware product and all of the functions you mentioned, plus many more :)  If interested you can email my address below for more info.  <br />
<br />
Some of our clients also use these boards, I know you want user feedback and my sales pitch is not that (I'm a techie anyway, not sales, so sorry if I am not so good at it!).   Maybe they are seeing this and can share any experiences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">2nd September 2004, 21:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I cannot speak on other RF systems as we did not properly evaluate any others (USA parent company were already using Bridgelogix so it made sense to build upon what they had done).<br />
<br />
We have used BL for approx. 1 year for Hours recording, Inventory Enquiries, Cycle Counting, Report Production, Despatch process.<br />
They have been very good at adapting their software to suit our process (whilst also being proactive in questionning what and why we were asking for). Implementation was good and was done remotely from the USA.<br />
Support is good. Development is good and reasonably priced.<br />
<br />
Potential issues - occasionally we have experienced a few hours time lag for support due to time zone differences (we are in UK, they are mostly based in the USA). However, we have also had support at 3am US time, even though we haven't paid for 24x7 support! So I can't complain.<br />
<br />
The licences are not cheap (for a small company such as mine) and are controlled by IP address so this may be an issue (although they may have an alternative licensing model).<br />
<br />
Overall, Bridgelogix has been a very good supplier and have helped us significantly streamline our processes.<br />
<br />
If you want any more detail, please email me.<br />

<br />
    We implemented our RF system(Bar coding) with a company previously called DRI and now it's called instreamsystems.com Almost two years now and the customer service was great! For the RF equipments(handhelds) we went with Symbols. All the data capture goes through the BaaN DDC. Hope this help.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have chosen ARC Gateway to supply their RF barcode solution for our Baan 5.0c system.  I recommend you visit www.arcgateway.com for more information.  We have been pleased with the solution provided. We have implemented it at one site and we are in the process of implementing it at another.<br />
<br />
One of the main advantages we found over other suppliers was having support being based in the UK and the Baan knowledge that ARC have.<br />
