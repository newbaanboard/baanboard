I have created some AFS sessions in Baan IV c4 with tools SP 14. At a later stage the user upgraded to Tools to SP 16.<br />
<br />
The AFS sessions which we have been created in the SP 14 are not working now. I am not sure what exactly the problem is at the client site.<br />
<br />
In case any one has faced a similar problem and got a solution for the same, please post it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th January 2005, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Typically when we run into this situation we just call Baan and get the latest stpapi objects.  Seems to me that has always solved our problems.  I take that back, once we had to install an updated porting set with our new tools sessions.  Either way a quick call to Baan should get you what is needed.<br />

I have faced this too.<br />
<br />
I have a client who upgraded to SP17 and also upgradedto the latest porting set. Suddenly, everything...I mean 'almost' every AFS resulted in an error or a database termination message.<br />
It was erratic, sometimes slow, sometimes fast!<br />
Surprisingly, it had worked fine in a test environment! (Before you apply the SP's and porting sets, please ensure that you test the AFS in the test environment with the latest SP's and porting set)<br />
<br />
We tried getting the latest stpapi objects from BaaN and it still didn't work.<br />
<br />
We finally found that it was not the SP, but the porting set that was causing the problem. I believe the latest Porting set is 6.1c.07.3. <br />
<br />
We finally went back one Porting set and everything was fine.<br />
The only drawback is the some of the solutions in the SP may need the latest porting set. In that case, you have to get BaaN to solve the problem directly.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

I am on the latest porting set 6.1c.07.05.<br />
Does it mean I shall go for porting set 6.1c.07.02 or 6.1c.07.04? <br />
<br />
Mark,<br />
Could you please tell me the object / list of objects that are used for AFS .<br />

<br />
As per our case, try going to any porting set greater than 6.1c.07.02 but less than 6.1c.07.05. (The 02 porting set is the minimum requirement for SP's)<br />
We tried 6.1c.07.03 and it worked. Apparently it's also documented somewhere that 02 is the minimum required porting set. I can dig in and find that out if you need.<br />
<br />
Try going for 6.1c.07.03 and give me the good news that it worked!!!<br />
<br />

In our 4c4 test environment for finance we are on porting set 6.1c.07.04 and it does work for us. I have several load API function servers for this company that check out just fine.<br />

<br />
You are right 6.1c.07.04 is alright!! But we were going from 6.1c.07.02 upwards and all worked fine at 6.1c.07.03. It was 6.1c.07.05 that caused the problem.<br />
<br />
Srikanth Try out either 6.1c.07.03 or 6.1c.07.04<br />
<br />

Sorry I missed the part but less than 6.1c.07.05. And it appears I also missed a question by Srikanth.  Sigh. Rought Tuesday morning.  In all honesty I do not have a list of all the objects - one of our app admins handles dealing with Baan, my job is just to whine when it does not work.  The only files I know of for sure are in the ottstp directory and start with ostpapi.  So I am really not sure what all goes into making it work. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">6th January 2005, 10:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note on when you use BCK and upgrade your portingset from 6.c.07 to 6.1c.07.02 or higher: apparently the bshellxma default behaviour for processes like menu handling etc. is changed: these 'startup' processes would normally be supressed since you are calling baan logic remotely and there would not be a display to show the menu. Previously these processes would be supressed by default, after upgrading to 6.1c.07.02 we found that we had to add 'ottmidsleeping' as parameter to the login process.
