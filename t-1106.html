<br />
This may not be the best answer for you - but it is what I usually do.  Just to make sure that all the correct tables get updated I usually use the stpapi commands to run a Baan session to do the update.  So in my custom session I might have some function server code to use a Baan session to perform the update on the table that I want.  This gives me that &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;fuzzy&quot; feeling that all of the correct tables are being updated.<br />
<br />
Maybe not the best solution, but we do not own source code. I know by using auditing and traces we could find all the tables to be updated, but this method is quicker for me.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

I am not sure what you mean by &quot;stpapi commands&quot;.  This sounds like what I am looking for I am just not sure how to pull in off.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

You can search the tools forum for &quot;stpapi&quot; and get a lot of info.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">popeye</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if u have the source code, Function Servers is a good solution esp for complex sessions like Sales Orders  etc.<br />
<br />
Here are the advantages:<br />
1. Developer(s) need not spend time studying the logic of the Maintain session.<br />
2. Even if the code changes for the Maintain Session (customizations etc), the session using the Function Server is not<br />
affected. This is a blessing ... esp at a client where they keep adding in customizations.<br />
3. Sessions performing complex tasks can be developed in a jiffy.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages:<br />
1. Slow ... Hence I prefer to use it for process sessions where the <br />
    user is not waiting for the session to complete.<br />
2. Users get a hang of it and come up with weird requirements :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
