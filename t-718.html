created with ttstdcreatdll.<br />
<br />
When, after executing the continue process, the main session try to close the subsession tihra1211, a fatal error happen: <br />
(use of NULL pointer on '').<br />
<br />
Error happens in library tisfcdll0225, in the instructions:<br />
<br />
	if process.hra1211 then<br />
		send.to.process(process.hra1211)<br />
		signal(SIGCHLD, SIGNOIGN)<br />
<br />
However, program continues execution.<br />
<br />
Any idea? Thanks           Pietro</div></div><hr />

<br />
In our version of this library, we make sure that we set all of the process variables to 0 at the end of the tisfc.dll0225.end.upper.processes().  This would prevent unwanted process calls if, by chance, something tried to initiate them.</div></div><hr />

The last time I recall a null pointer error was when the session was trying to open a report using the Baan function open.report.  That was as far as I could trace it, since we do not own source code. It seems to me that the session did two report opens and I could only control the first one with stpapi.set.report and when the second report went to generate, the error then occurred.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is the case, but it is something I ran into.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crincoli</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks you. I solved that problem, the objects ttstpstandard and ttstpapihand were not updated.<br />
<br />
Now I have another problem: <br />
when a subsession (tihra1210s000)  execute (print.data), the program do not execute section on.choice, but go to after.choice.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestion       Pietro</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glad you solved your other problem.  <br />
<br />
What commands are you using to start the session processing?  If you are using stpapi.continue then maybe you could try stpapi.print.report.  This is just a guess since we do not own source code and I can not debug problems like you can. Luckily so far I have been able to work around the problems I do encounter.<br />
<br />
Another guess would be an update object for the session - but I do not like that answer.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

Thanks again    Pietro:)</div></div><hr />
