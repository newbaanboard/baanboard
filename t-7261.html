<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">20th October 2002, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the things that baan does well is keep a fifo list for accessing the vrc packages.  When a session is required, it searches the list in lifo sequence lifo, until it finds the session in question, or returns a session not found. <br />
<br />
My question is this:  Why cannot baan keep the directories and all the subdirectories by vrc, out of the search path, and allow me to build a single level directory set for a package combination? (do a rollup to one and only one directory), with the other directories around for maintenance or rebuilding?<br />
<br />
My vrc structure would then be kept individual directories, and in one directory, all the sessions and objects pertaining to a session would be copied.<br />
<br />
Now, instead of searching many many directories, until standard is found, we search only one level.  <br />
<br />
In the old days, disk space was $$$.  That is no longer the case.<br />
<br />
For patches and development environments, we could do our testing in easy ways too. <br />
<br />
Consider this situation (for baan4 as example) we have  <br />
stnd--&gt;localization--&gt;sp1--sp2--&gt;sp3--&gt;... sp10--&gt;customization.<br />
<br />
I would have  only one level  &quot;production&quot;, which is the merge of customization, all the sp's localizations and base.<br />
<br />
test would be the copy of customization to a test directory, and therein, the new items to be tested.<br />
<br />
Any comments?<br />

<br />
When I run a session with quite debug info I notice that most of the time spent is the DD load and query of data in the database, mostly with sessions that access tables with a huuge nr. of rows. <br />
<br />
And the OS delays are nothing compared with the network load delays... I don't think a change at OS level structure will improve performance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your ideas are worth a discussion. But I cannot completely understand your thoughts. You're discussing sessions and the way they are searched.<br />
I think there is some confusion here: RT information of sessions is stored in a table keyed on pacc and session code: so there is a copy of this record in every pacc.<br />
<br />
Since you are talking about directory searches, I assume you meant objects. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
You're idea is then to copy the objects to every possible pvrc to fill in the holes. The disadvantage of this would be that delivering a patch (or update/customization) would be a horrible job, just because it has to be copied to every possible pacc. If you work with SCM (typical in a development environment), you would have to make copies to lots of directories and synchronize lots of times.<br />
<br />
Before i continue; am i correct? is this the direction you want the discussion to go?<br />

Yes it is possible that you can sort different package VRC's into different directories and we can then do some scanning, disk space sizing etc on those directories. So we have less subdirectories in our $BSE/application directory and its easy to go into the relevant directories and do some processing.<br />
<br />
We use this feature already. Please look at the screen shot.<br />
