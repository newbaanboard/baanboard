<br />
Hi, baanboard member!<br />
<br />
In this second and also last newsletter of 2006, I would like to take the <br />
opportunity to thank all readers, posters and sponsors for their contributions <br />
over the last year. It is also the perfect occasion to wish you all a very <br />
enjoyable Christmas holiday and a very healthy and prosperous 2007!<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1) Sponsor news<br />
<br />

<br />
* AB+AC=US Ltd signed up for a 6 months sponsorship during the month <br />
of November. AB+AC=US will be sponsoring a forum category and can also be<br />
found on the main Sponsor page. <br />
<br />
About AB+AC=US:<br />
Utilizing the extensive experience of numerous technical specialists in the <br />
fields of licensing, contract management and compliancy, AB+AC=US Ltd was <br />
formed in response to a recognized need for license management tools <br />
independent of those provided by the software vendor. Our solutions assist a <br />
diverse array of organizations in driving down costs - from SME's to large <br />
scale multinational corporations - whilst ensuring compliance and fulfilment<br />
of corporate governance requirements in an environment where managing software <br />
licenses across the enterprise is increasingly complex. Two products are <br />
currently available: Sourcerer - a tool that enables Baan users to manage the <br />
existence of source code or modified objects on their system; and Exert -  <br />
a sophisticated tool that monitors the usage of any software application <br />
running on an IBM iSeries (AS/400) or Unix platform.<br />
<br />
You are welcome to visit the AB+AC=US site at: <br />
http://www.abacus.gg/<br />
<br />
Also in November, Nazdaq has extended its yearly sponsorship of the forum <br />
again and this for the 5th time in a row! We thank NAZDAQ for their continued <br />
commitment to Baanboard.<br />
<br />
About Nazdaq:<br />
NAZDAQ is a known name in the world of Baan. Their offering of Add-ons for Baan <br />
(and now for ERP LN) is an integral part of many Baan installations around the <br />
globe.  Daily, thousands of users utilize NAZDAQ tools to automate downloading <br />
reports to Excel, Word, PDF, XML and HTML and to email, fax, archive and print <br />
Purchase Orders and Invoices - in addition to many other tools that make the use <br />
of Baan more friendly.  The word on the street says that the NAZDAQ Add-ons are <br />
very reasonably priced and the work day in the customer support department is <br />
between 6:00 AM and Midnight, and in most cases, your question will be answered <br />

<br />
3) Forum news<br />
<br />
Last week the forum software was upgraded to its most recent version 3.6.4. <br />
Apart from the mandatory bug fixes this release also features some novelties <br />
for forum users. One of the nicest new features is the possibility to automa-<br />
tically include RSS feeds into the forum as separate threads. As an experiment, <br />
two RSS feeds are currently imported into a specifically designated &quot;News Feeds&quot;<br />
forum.<br />
<br />
More information on the upgrade, the new features and the RSS experiment may be <br />
found in this forum thread: <br />

<br />

<br />
4) Did you know?<br />
<br />
That the baanboard forum uses AJAX-based features? AJAX stands for <br />
&quot;Asynchronous JavaScript and XML&quot; and is a web development technique for creating <br />
interactive web applications. The intent is to make web pages feel more <br />
responsive by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes, <br />
so that the entire web page does not have to be reloaded each time the user makes <br />
a change. This is meant to increase the web page's interactivity, speed, and <br />
usability.<br />
<br />
Some of the best AJAX-driven forum features are:<br />
<br />
* editing a thread title by double-clicking on the title in the forum view<br />
* marking a forum read by double-clicking on the new post forum indicator icon<br />
* rating a thread (when submitting)<br />
* opening or closing a thread by double-clicking on its post icon<br />
<br />
AJAX-powered features can usually be recognized by the display of a tool tip when <br />
hovering over the related area. Some of the AJAX features are reserved for <br />
administrators or moderators, others are also available for regular users.<br />
<br />
If you would like to get an idea how some AJAX features exactly work on the <br />
forum, you can have a look at the following Flash demo on website of the <br />
vbulletin developers: http://files.vbulletin.com/3.5/ajax.html<br />
