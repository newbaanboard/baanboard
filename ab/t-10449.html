<br />
So, patvdv is leading with 1477, NPRao is second with 1050, and mark_h just passed 1000 yesterday.<br />
<br />
First, Thank you mark_h for all your valuable input.<br />
<br />
And, it looks it is going to be a tough competition for NPRao on the second place....<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers to all.<br />

You beat me to it! I was going to make the announcement today and you were just quicker. Shows how much everyone's contributions are appreciated. I just wanted to say a big thanks to Mark for his many and very valuable posts. He was there from the beginning and is one of our very first moderators too. Let's drink to that! :)<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

Competition...NAH!!<br />
But why CONGRATS!!?...Well, there are not too many board members having a thread dedicated to them!!;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th June 2003, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks everyone.  I will be away from the board for a week while on vacation next week and will remember to drink a toast or two(or three, or four,etc) to the board. :)<br />
<br />
And there is no competition - I am just sorry it takes me 4 or 5 posts to maybe provide a correct answer, when you pros can can provide it in one post. :)<br />

Your input has been positively invaluable as we tried to integrate barcode WMS &amp; MES to BaanERP in one of our installation. Enjoy the holiday :)<br />
