<br />
I am happy to announce that a new forum has been created on Baanboard.That's right!  Just when you thought the best Baan forum on the Internet could not get any better, IT DID. Drum roll please.  ANNOUNCING the new Code and Utilities Forum (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=33) . Never before seen on the Internet (at least by me), a new forum where everyone in the Baan world can share their utilities, scripts and tools.<br />
<br />
In the Code and Utilities Forum (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=33)  system admins, DBA's and developers can post functions, shell scripts, utilities and tools. All we ask is that you follow a few simple rules:<br />
<br />
(1) Do not post any copyrighted material.(Ex. Baan source code)<br />
<br />
(2) Please follow the templates as closely as possible. A few examples are already posted and more will follow.  Please note the licensing agreement.<br />
<br />
(3) Please continue to use the current Tools Forum as you do today for technical questions. The new forum is not meant to replace any of the other forums. So please use the appropriate forum.<br />
<br />
Feel free to ask questions of the moderators, we are here to help both you and Baanboard.  Also be patient while we work out any bugs.  Please note that you must be a registered member to see this new forum.<br />
<br />
SO COME on in and join us.<br />
<br />
A special thanks to Pat for creating this new forum.  Also a special thanks Vamsi and Gordon for creating the templates and examples.<br />
