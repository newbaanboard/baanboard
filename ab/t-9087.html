My first idea was to edit my profile, and when I opened it I was disappointed because the correct birthday was there.<br />
<br />
No big deal, but something is wrong. The profile everybody can see has another birthday than the one I have given.<br />

Huh? I am also too old for the board!!! It seems that the date is stored in a unix date counter... all &lt; 1/1/1970 is too old to measure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right :) The problem was picked up by one of our members last week and this is either a bug or a little slip in the last upgrade. The information is indeed  correctly stored in the database but wrongly displayed on the screen.<br />
<br />
Give us some time to dig into it. In the mean time, enjoy your younger/older years :)</div></div><hr />

Darn! Can you temporarily roll back the update? <br />
<br />
Not only was I enjoying being 4 years younger than yesterday, I was hoping the glitch would mean I still had time to switch funds in my 401K before the 2001 crash.<br />

For a worthwhile bribe, I'd be willing to rollback the situation in your case :D</div></div><hr />
