that will help you simplify your business processes, automate unnecessary<br />

2) Did you know?<br />
<br />
Did you know that you can upload multiple screenshots for each post with <br />
automatic thumbnailing?<br />
<br />
Each post can contain a maximum of 5 attachments. These can be regular documents<br />
and/or picture files or a mix of both. You can attach pictures or screenshots<br />
in a variety of formats but we *highly* recommend to use either the JPG or PNG<br />
format. Both formats will preserve as much as possible of the quality of the<br />
original image whilst being economical in the space they take up in our forum<br />
database. <br />
We do not allow any kind of (large) bitmap files to be uploaded (e.g. .BMP).<br />
Please convert your BMP images to JPG or PNG first.<br />
<br />
To attach images/documents to your post, go to:<br />
Edit screen of your post &gt; Manage Attachments &gt; Browse (and select file(s)) &gt; <br />
Upload &gt; Close Window &gt; Save Changes<br />
<br />
