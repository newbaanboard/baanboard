<br />
Maybe is some soon to talk about this matter, but I think is only one month for that.<br />
<br />
After that it seems that more than 2,000 users will be board members, and in my opinion this is the best place to share and improve in BaaN Application.<br />
<br />
Are you preparing some for this?<br />
Maybe a resume of one year life?<br />
<br />
Happy birthday to all us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right. It will the 15th of August to be exact. I haven't really thought about it to be honest so no plans yet. The resume sounds like a good suggestion although I would have to seriously rack my brain to remember all of last year's events.<br />
<br />
We have a nice new feature in the pipeline for our members which could be considered a birthday gift. But I am not going to tell anymore about it yet :p</div></div><hr />

That is one day the Indians on the board will not forget. It is the Indian Independance Day.</div></div><hr />
