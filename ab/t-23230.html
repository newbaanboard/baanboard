<br />
I normally use &quot;What's New&quot; / &quot;Since Last Visit&quot; to stay up-to-date. This morning, after a week of influenza, I first read my mails and had a look at those two mails that came from baanboard (and followed the links to baanboard). That must have set my last-time-accessed stamp, because now I only get three entries on &quot;What's New&quot; / &quot;Since Last Visit&quot; -- that's definitively too less for a week. I treat that as an error.<br />
<br />
Another suggestion: Would it be possible to add a &quot;What's New&quot; / &quot;Since ...&quot; an to enter a date?<br />

<br />
No, that is not an error but simply the way the software works. Every time you visit the board, your 'last-accessed time' is reset to the current time. Unless we hack the software there is no way around it.</div></div><hr />

I recognize the problem Gunther describes and also wish there was an solution, maybe 'New since last 'Mark forums Read'' or something like that.<br />
Usenet news readers also do not mark all entries as read if you just start and exit the program.<br />

<br />
You are right about newsreaders but marking posts/forums as read happens somewhat different in vbulletin. I will consider logging a RFE for this with the vbulletin developers.</div></div><hr />
