    A small bug :o)<br />
    When you attach a file and then do a preview, the attachment disappears. <br />
    Just thought I'll let you know.<br />
<br />
    BTW ... You guys are doing an excellent job.<br />
    Has made my life easier :o)<br />
<br />
    Thanks and have a good one !<br />
Cheers,<br />
Big John</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the good comments. The preview issue is unfortunately not a bug but rather a HTML limitation. Below follows the explaination of one of the vbulletin developers:<br />
Nothing we can do about this one I'm afraid. The HTML spec doesn't allow file-uploads to be kept through our 'previewing' process... <br />
<br />
We ~could~ implement a sort of fix, but it could very easily result in massive amounts of attachments building up in your temporary folder without being attached to messages... <br />
<br />
So in short, there's nothing we can do about it. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Hope that answers the question!</div></div><hr />
