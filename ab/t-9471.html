<br />
We are pleased to announce a new offering on Baanboard, ie. the  Lead Referral Program by Baan North America (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/bboffers.php?s=&amp;action=show_offerings_listing#offer3).<br />
<br />
What is this all about?<br />
<br />
The idea is to help prospect new customers in North-America by means of using the services of professionals and companies in the industry as referral partners. Referral partners are eligible to receive a 5% bonus of the lead value if approved by Baan Company. Baanboard will help promote this program.<br />
<br />
On top of that, Baanboard/Baan have agreed that any new customer(s) signing up through Baanboard will receive a discount from Baan Company for the sum of 3% of the original lead value. Baanboard effectively grants hereby this new customer 3% of its entitled bonus (5%) as serving in the capacity as lead referrer.<br />
<br />
If this all sounds to complicated to you, then read the documentation that goes with the referral program. For this you will have to request the usual email to be sent to you.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, we are glad to here them here :)<br />
<br />
This offer is for North-America only and runs from April 1st 2003 until July 31st 2003</div></div><hr />
