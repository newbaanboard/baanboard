0) Introduction<br />
<br />
Hi, baanboard member!<br />
<br />
First of all I would like apologize for the late arrival of this (first) <br />
newsletter of 2006. Times have been very busy but I hope that this rather <br />
lengthy newsletter will somewhat make up for the long wait :). <br />
For those who have not realized it but with the passing of August 15th, <br />
Baanboard has silently celebrated its 5th birthday. During these first 5 years <br />
many people have come and gone but membership counts and visits are still on <br />
the increase which is an indication that the site is in very good health <br />
thanks to all its contributors and supporters!<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1) OST SSA Baan Education Event in Nice, France [16-18 Oct 2006]<br />
<br />
Baanboard and OST are excited to announce a unique event for the European Baan <br />
community. OST, a long time member of the Baan and Baanboard community, will be <br />
hosting its Education Symposium in Nice, France from October 14-16.<br />
<br />
This educational forum will provide users of SSA Baan with the current <br />
information they are seeking to continually improve their investment in the <br />
product. Spend two days networking and sharing information with members of the <br />
SSA Baan community - it will be time well spent.<br />
<br />
For more information, please go to http://www.osteducation.com. Comments and <br />
questions are well received at our OST SSA Baan Education thread at the <br />
Baanboard site: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=28046<br />
<br />
We are pleased OST is making this investment in our community and we encourage <br />
everyone who can make it to attend. Customers who attended their US event were <br />
thrilled with the level of education received. Rendez-vous at Nice!<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
2) Sponsor news<br />
<br />
Sponsor activity has been rather busy in 2006. Another sign that our site is<br />
doing well and attracting quite a lot of attention, from both small and big<br />
players in Baan business. Here are the sponsor highlights of 2006 so far:<br />
<br />
* Hewlett Packard signed up for a yearly sponsorship during the month of April.<br />
<br />
You are welcome to visit the Hewlett Packard site at: <br />
http://h71028.www7.hp.com/enterprise/cache/82821-0-0-0-121.html<br />
<br />
* BridgeLogix has extended its running sponsorship for a full year in June 2006 <br />
thereby showing that their commitment to support Baanboard remains strong and<br />
that they see their sponsorship as a great way to put their message across to <br />
current and future customers. <br />
<br />

<br />
* In July, OST USA signed up for a 6-month sponsorship, becoming the first <br />
organization to sponsor an individual forum. OST recently additionally decided <br />
to extend their sponsorship to a forum category, also for a period of 6 <br />
months.<br />
<br />
You are welcome to visit the OST USA site at:<br />
http://www.ostusa.com<br />
<br />
* Neustro Consulting is the latest organization to join the honourable ranks<br />
of Baanboard sponsors. Neustro Consulting is since the beginning of September<br />
a proud sponsor of Baanboard for the next 6 months.<br />
<br />
About Neustro Consulting and their sponsorship:<br />
Prior to forming Neustro Consulting the team had worked together for many years <br />
at Mondi, a division of Anglo-American, the UK FTSE 100 registered company. Not <br />
only did they implement Baan IV and V but they developed an industry vertical <br />
that has many practical applications in other industries. Their expertise in <br />
shop floor data collection and bar-coding has enabled them to deliver real-time <br />
Baan implementations where Customers are confident enough to give their <br />
Customers direct access to their data through Customer Portals. Martin Roberts, <br />
a director with the company, explained why they chose Baanboard as a primary <br />
marketing source: Its clear that Baanboard is the major meeting place for the <br />
Baan community and we know that its the quickest way for our profile to be <br />
raised after our transition from in-house to an independent Consulting company. <br />

3) Forum &amp; Wiki upgrade news<br />
<br />
During 2006, the forum has seen one major and one minor upgrade. In January we<br />
upped the site from vbulletin version 3.0.6 to version 3.5.3. This upgrade came<br />
with a slew of new and improved forum features, most notably the much more <br />
efficient &quot;View New Posts Since Last Visit&quot;. More information about this<br />
and other improvements can be found in this forum thread:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=26177<br />
<br />
Recently, the forum software was upgraded again, this time to version 3.5.5 <br />
which paves the way to eventually be able to make the upgrade to v3.6.0. This <br />
is planned to happen before the end of 2006.<br />
<br />
During the month of April 2006, we also overhauled the Wiki site and upgraded<br />
to major version 4 of the TWiki software. More information on the upgrade and <br />
new and/or improved wiki features may be found in this forum thread:<br />

<br />

geeky things.<br />
