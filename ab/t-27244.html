Sometimes I need some documents that depens on thread. Some users can send useful documents for Baan. I want to examine all of them. I can see all threads but  I couldn't see only file attached threads.I think that If there is a something to provide it, it could be helpful for us. I would see all attached files order by file types<br />

Thank you !</div></div><hr />

There is no way to achieve that I am afraid. Even if it was I would not be in favour of this, after all the forum is not meant to be download site.</div></div><hr />

It was only suggestion. Sometimes finding any document can take so much time. Especially  for old documents.(Whose thread? What was the thread ? , Who did solve it ?  ... )<br />

Thanks ...</div></div><hr />
