When I search &quot;like&quot; statement, it gives me <br />
<br />
The following errors occurred with your search:  <br />
Sorry - no matches. Please try some different terms. <br />
The following words are either very common, too long, or too short and were not included in your search : like<br />
<br />
I think that search query understand it  as SQL like statement. In fact , there are lots of threads about Sql like operator.<br />

In programming logic there is no logic like you said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To avoid excessive results, some trivial words are excluded vom Baanboard Search, e.g. &quot;and&quot; or &quot;the&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like&quot; is one of those words (the reason: look at your post above). ;)<br />
<br />
It's not a bug, it's a feature!</div></div><hr />

Could you please find me thread about like operator ? There is no need lack of time for something. This is programming logic. One time I lost 10 minute to find some threads. <br />
I think that you should think twice ! or look at GOOGLE !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway you can always use Google to help you search Baanboard like this:<br />

This is thing that what I want !<br />
Thanks George</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th May 2007, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">J_hass is absolutely right. The like word is excluded by default by the forum software. However there is a way to include certain words back in and I have done this now for 'like'. The search index is being rebuild to include the new word and after that a search for 'like' should show results. Potentially alot of results!!<br />
<br />
FYI: following words are excluded from search &amp; indexing by default:<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">5th May 2007, 00:17</div></div><div class="posttext">This is good new but I think that there is a wrong in search tool. Because when I search like operator firstly it should search thread's subject . Otherwise it gives me all &quot;like&quot; statement in every threads. In my opinion , Firt priority should be thread subject and second priority should be thread contents. When I search &quot;like&quot;, it gives me almost all of thread there is no sequence. This feature should be done for baanboard. May be searching mechanisim is true but main point is subject, after that content. In google it gives me that what I want. (george's suggestion) .<br />
<br />
Thanks for your attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">7th May 2007, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that is the way the search option works and I cannot change much about that. There is a possibility to use MySQL full-text searching instead of a custom built index. However, switching to MySQL full-text search exacts a much higher load on server resources and that is not something I wish to try right now. Once we get the new server up and running we will have a good bit more power though and then we can give it a whirl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">3rd June 2007, 11:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I was searching for a particular topic which like generated 515 hits. It was showing in excess of 17 pages. But when i tried to scroll to the 6th from the 5th page, it just showed up a message <br />
&quot;Sorry - no matches. Please try some different terms.&quot;..<br />
<br />
I was just going to the 6th page...Is this a bug or a feature that i didnt know off...Its understandable if one were to be browsing like the 50th or 100th page...But here it wouldnt even go beyond 5...There were like 25 results per page..<br />
If there werent any more results after 5th, then why would it show in excess of 17 pages?<br />
<br />
sk<br />
<br />
P.S: The keyword i was searching was &quot;backup&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried the same as you both as administrator and as a regular user and each time I am able to page through all the results (&gt;450 results). Can someone else try it as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">5th June 2007, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried now it and it working well, however, I have encountered this problem once. It happened when I waited in the 5'th page (for example) for some time (15 minutes or more) and then clicked on next.<br />

Strange to say, its working now. I thought there was some restriction over the keyword &quot;Backup&quot; but then saw that it wasnt in your list..Things look ok now. <br />
<br />
12pm - 1230pm was the time when i did the search...maybe the logs could help?<br />

<br />
Good to hear it works now. I think there are a number of factors that are working here:<br />
<br />
 default session timeout of 900 seconds (15 mins)<br />
 caching of search results<br />
<br />
I have not verified this myself but I suspect that leaving a session idle for a long time in the middle of a search result could lead to unexpected results.</div></div><hr />
