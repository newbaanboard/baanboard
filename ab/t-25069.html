1) New sponsor: Qtris<br />
<br />
We are glad to announce that Qtris has chosen to sign up for a 12 months<br />
sponsorship with Baanboard.com.<br />
<br />
About Qtris:<br />
On September 1st last Qtris (located near Amsterdam, The Netherlands), launched <br />
its new website at http://www.qtris.com/ and also its BAAN2 Linux program.<br />
<br />
In the world of today IT investments and expenses are under pressure and at Qtris<br />
we believe that BAAN customers should spend their money wisely. That is why we <br />
have come up with our BAAN2Linux program. We think our program provides a faster<br />
and cheaper solution for SSA Global BAAN customers than the standard offerings <br />
that have been around for such long time, e.g.: UNIX and Oracle or Informix, <br />
Windows and Oracle or SQL Server etc.<br />
<br />
Especially those BAAN IV_c4 and BAAN V_c customers that are replacing their <br />
current hardware (including O/S and database) and/or upgrading to SSA Global <br />
ERP LN6.1 will benefit the most. Our BAAN2Linux program will show that Linux is<br />
a viable and stable platform and low-cost alternative. <br />
<br />
In case you are interested in our BAAN2Linux program and would also like to <br />
start spending your money wisely we invite you to visit our website or <br />
contact us directly today.<br />

introduction to the history and workings of baanboard.com during the upcoming<br />
BWU Belgium event. A short live demo is included in the presentation.<br />
<br />
The event will take place on Thursday, 15th September 2005 at the Faculty Club,<br />
Groot Begijnhof 14, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.<br />

<br />
So let's see...<br />
<br />
A new sponsor, great!<br />
Pat will be officially famous in BaaN circles and as such achieve B.E.E.R. status (Baan Erudite Excellence Recognition). Cheers, Pat!<br />
<br />
Noticeable: Europe still has a BWU? <br />
<br />
Noteworthy: In order for favicons to work, you must have a site (baanboard)bookmarked. If your bookmark is older than the favicon, you first have to delete your existing (baanboard)bookmark(s).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">12th September 2005, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the 'BEER' status. Maybe a Hall Of Fame would be in order, heh? Very usuful favicon tip by the way. I did not know that one :)<br />
<br />
As to BWU: no idea how the name still carries over. Guess I will find out on thursday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">13th September 2005, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Firefox/mozilla displays the favicon in the search toolbar (are you still using IE?) so you do not need to bookmark it.<br />
I think that my firefox 1.0.6 updated my favicon link also but I'm not sure...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">13th September 2005, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Only at work, off course  :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">14th September 2005, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm. Ever since the update with the new icon, when I have another web site open and I choose my Baanboard Bookmark, it comes makes a little side panel and comes up in there... very odd.   Nothing else does that...<br />
<br />
I'm using Mozilla/Firefox.  It does not happen in IE.  Anyone else have that happen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">19th September 2005, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, nobody but me :)  I found the problem.   In Mozzilla under 'Properties' for the link there is the option to &quot;Load this bookmark in the sidebar&quot;.  It's not an option during creating the Bookmark, so I have no idea how it got set, but that was the problem.</div></div><hr />
