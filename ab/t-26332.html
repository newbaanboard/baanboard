I haven't been on consistently for awhile and just noticed that I cannot seem to locate it--did it move or is it gone?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">7th February 2006, 03:07</div></div><div class="posttext">The new set up is much better.  The items since last visit (if any) are listed first amongst the unread items.  <br />
<br />
I think this setup is much better than the previous one.  I have had lots of occassions where I was effectively logged of but hadn't yet read the items and could only relog on to Todays items.  If it was a couple of days since logon I coudn't get the items.<br />
<br />
I am surprised more people haven't voted for the new setup as their preference. <br />
<br />
(Bordmaster please wait a while before believing the poll figures, the new setup is much better)<br />

The option has been &quot;renamed&quot; (or enhanced if you like) as/to All Unread Posts. See also the poll that is running on this for more information.</div></div><hr />
