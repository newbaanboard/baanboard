<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">22nd January 2002, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">A recurring problem with users posting messages that contain log file entries, pieces of code etc are unwanted smilies appearing in the message after it has been submitted to the board:<br />
<br />
e.g:<br />
Can't find object ({package=c1}F_OBJ:otisfc0505;otisfc0505) errno 2 <br />
This occurs because vbulletin automatically parses certain combination of punctuation characters into smilies. This is what the text should look like:<br />
<br />
Can't find object ({package=c1}F_OBJ:otisfc0505;otisfc0505) errno 2 <br />
<br />
This problem can easily be avoided by enabling the option Disable Smilies in This Post before you finally submit the post. The possibility to preview your post can great help in identifying any unwanted smilies and if they do occur, the user can choose the disable the smilies before submitting the post. Smilies can also be removed by editing the post afterwards, disabling the smilies in the text and re-submitting the post</div></div><hr />
