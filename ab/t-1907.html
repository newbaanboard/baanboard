<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">2nd May 2002, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently, I was typing in a post and took a tad longer than I thought I would. When I went to preview my post, it asked me my login (again) and then went on to say I do not have any current thread. I lost the entire post, as 'back' does not help either.<br />
<br />
I there a way to set longer 'time-outs' when typing posts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The default time-out on your cookie is 15mins or 900secs. This can be modified but I'd rather not do it unless a great number of people is starting to have problems. A good idea when posting is always to use the option preview post because you *can* usually still use your &lt;Back&gt; button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">3rd May 2002, 07:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
Yes, I must have been at it at least 20 minutes before I decided to 'Preview Reply'. However, I think I did not explain the problem correctly. What happened was that when I hit 'Preview Reply', the LOGIN screen came up. So, I logged in (again!). THEN it tells me there is no current thread (for preview). And I lose all my typing. After that, the 'back' button takes me back to the login screen, which is not useful. <br />
<br />
In any case, I must remember the limitation and prepare my post off-line before I actually paste it for the post.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

I will have to check that myself. In the mean time preparing your post off-line or making a copy of your text in memory before posting is always a good idea.</div></div><hr />

Instead of use buttom back 1 step, use menu option in your Browser Go To. There you will see your Reply. Go there, copy and paste in a new try.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
