<br />
First of all my apologies for closing the board for an hour or so on Thursday evening. It's not in our policy to cause 'downtime' for our members during week and working days but personal reasons and some severe security issues led me to do the upgrade sooner than expected. So in short we upgraded the forum from vbulletin version 2.2.0 to 2.2.4. <br />
<br />
There are no new features except for some minor cosmetic changes and of course for the logo!. It's our first real professional logo and we hope you will like it :) We plan to use this logo for all baanboard related stuff.<br />
<br />
Please report any problems due to upgrade directly to me.</div></div><hr />

All avatars are restored now but my apologies for the temporary inconvenience.</div></div><hr />
