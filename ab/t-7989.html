For those of us with short memories :rolleyes: how about displaying the search-criteria for the search-results? I often try various criteria for a search until I come up with one which gives meaningful results - the trouble is, after a couple of minutes reading through the results, I can't remember the search-criteria I entered! <br />
<br />
So how about something like:<br />
<br />
Baanboard.com &gt; Search &gt; Thread Results for &quot;stpapi.print&quot;TIA,<br />

Only a couple of minutes heh? You can already see the results of the last 10 searches at the Search page as they are being cached by the bulletin board system. However the nature of a cache is and should be temporary so these results will disappear after a while. You also have to take into account that a search result of 30 mins ago can become quickly 'invalidated' by new/changed posts that happened after your search action. In itself a good suggestion but very difficult to implement due to many code changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RobertB</div><div class="date">9th December 2002, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I knew you were using PHP as a backend to the Board, and you're most probably using session-handling, so the last Search-string entered by user X becomes a session variable, which you can then display for that user only...<br />
<br />
But we all know that changing code can be a major headache...</div></div><hr />
