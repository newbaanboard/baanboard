<br />
There is already a lot of knowledge &quot;harvested&quot; here on this (really great!!) board. However, the larger it gets,  the harder it is to find the relevant things.<br />
<br />
So, my question: How about a Baan FAQ? There is nothing around like that worldwide, as fas as I know. <br />
<br />
We would need to things:<br />
1) a piece of web-software that helps maintaining an hierarchically, FAQ-like structure.<br />
(Question to boardmasters: Do you have the possibility to run any freeware scripts here, or is this board part of a provider where you cannot do everything?)<br />
<br />
2) People willing to edit that FAQ - that means scanning this board for (possibly) recurring questions, sorting the noise out,  and putting those questions into the above mentioned piece of software (along with the appropriate awnsers, of course). I would be willing to be one of those people, of course.<br />
<br />
How about that?<br />

<br />
A Baan FAQ in itself is a very good idea indeed, but we will need to do some thinking and brainstorming about it first. To answer your questions:<br />
<br />
1) We have a fair degree of freedom to run scrips on the webserver. So if you have any tools in mind then let me know and I will have a look at them<br />
<br />
2) I would think that there should be at least one FAQ owner and several FAQ maintainers.<br />
<br />
PS: don't forget that that the board has a very powerful search feature :)</div></div><hr />

I don't have any scripts in mind yet but I will have a look - I just wanted to know if there is the general possibility to have it running here.<br />
<br />
The search feature is prowerful, agreed. But you need time to read through the threads. To build an FAQ, an editing process is necessery filtering the &quot;noise&quot; out of a thread, reducing it on a simple question-awnser form and organizing those &quot;Cooking recipies&quot; in some structured manner.</div></div><hr />
