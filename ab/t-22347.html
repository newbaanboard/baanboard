<br />
I would like to make you all aware that as of today I will be the only administrator left looking after Baanboard.com. My co-admin and co-founder James Gittins (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/member.php?u=2) has decided to put his attention to better causes, not in the least to his recently married wife :) I would like to thank him for all the work he has done over the years and for being half of the motor that made this site possible.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the breakway from baanboard.com!</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you are lucky on two counts: found a lovely wife and have been able to move into SAP space.<br />
<br />
If I may reflect on some advice I was given when I was getting married (just before man had set foot on the moon), &quot;...take particular care in the first few years, to not set up unrealisticly low expectation of time needed for hobbies, sports, friends, study etc and especially do not go out of your way to impress how capable you are at domestic duties...&quot;<br />
<br />
All the best for the future.  Hope to see you back here in the not to distant future<br />

<br />
Thanks for your kind comments.<br />
<br />
Yep, you may have noticed I've not been around recently, but the past 18 months of my life have been amazing, a fairytale.  So sadly yes, my priorities have been diverted elsewhere, so not able to devote the care and attention needed to maintain this site.  But I'm sure you guys will be happy for me :) Lovely wife and home, great new job (SAP!), and an exciting future.<br />
<br />
I'll always be around here for sure though.  Lucky for you guys that you've got Patrick around!  Who I must say has done a fantastic job on the recent upgrades and with the new Portal  (http://www.baanportal.com) site.<br />
<br />
Hope everyone continues to enjoy this site!<br />
<br />
