<br />
Can we have some logic like Favourites to the Baan Board forum ? Suppose if I like a coupla threads and I would like to refer them sometime in the future I would like to add them to my list of favourites.<br />
<br />
I know we have search capabilities but then mebbe Im not too sure as to what Im looking for. Also the search returns quite a few results and I dont really want to browse through each return result.<br />
<br />
Also I dont want to add this to my browser favourites coz if Im accessing the site from another pc or if I move then I loose these links.<br />

If you feel a thread should be &quot;Sticky&quot;, ask the moderators what their opinion is...<br />
<br />
You can add specific threads to your own Favorites, using the URL with the &quot;http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=&lt;number&gt;&quot; link. I assume the thread numbers will not change just like that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there are a couple of threads you like - you can 'subscribe' to those threads.  Click on &quot;Subscribe to this Thread&quot; at the bottom of the page.  Your subscribed threads can be viewed from your User Control Panel (UserCP at top of each page).  You'll also be notified by email when your subscribed threads are updated.<br />
<br />
Additionally, like OmeLuuk mentions, its also possible to have 'sticky' threads in forums - important threads for that forum can be permanently posted at the top of the forum for better visibility.  Though we like to limit this to just a few key threads to prevent distorting visibility from the rest of the forum.<br />
<br />
Patrick and I have addressed the issue of making interesting threads more visible, and we have a few more ideas in the pipeline.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, have a go with the Subscribe option, let us know if it works for you.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the valuable input.<br />

James</div></div><hr />
