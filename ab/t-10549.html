Ever thought of having a little area off to one side in the form of a 'chat room' on the BB. Obviously with all of us spread around the globe in different time zones it wouldn't be possible to chat to everyone - but there are a few ppl in my time zone that are on the board at the same time as me and it would be nice to have a quick 'catch up' session rather than post a message in a forum.<br />
<br />
Anyway have a great weekend!<br />

Yes, a good while ago we experimented with 2 types of chatrooms. Technically it wasn't a big deal but the main argument against putting up a chatroom was be that alot of valuable information that would otherwise be posted on the board would get lost in the chatroom. Reason being that it would be nearly impossible to keep track and publish of what is being discussed in the chatroom. However, we are willing to reconsider it in some or other form :) Anyone else out there with opinions on this matter?</div></div><hr />
