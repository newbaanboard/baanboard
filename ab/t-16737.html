It is taking too much time to plow through all Baan IV.x issues. Is there any way to exclude the Baan IV.x threads?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that I know of.  Not knowing the board programming difficulties, one possible solution is to just include the posters Baan version out there on the main screen with the subject, so we don't have to open them to see the version.<br />
<br />
One problem is that many posts are relevant to both, or have solutions posted for both.  There's no check box to say is this a Baan V or IV issue or both.  That may be nice, but who would fill it out right?  Only people with both versions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">8th October 2004, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">No, this is unfortunately not possible unless we start splitting up threads into different forums based on Baan versions. Lisa's suggestion is a good one but really relies on the goodwill of people to fill out their profile/entry form correctly. From experience so far we must conclude that this is by far not always the case. But I will keep the suggested ideas and questions in mind and if I get the chance to come up with an enough solution I will give it a go.</div></div><hr />
