I suppose these subjects fall currently under tools, but the fact that Baan lifted exchange out of the utilities into it's own module in BaanERP already indicates that this is really a separate subject matter.</div></div><hr />

I agree Exchange comes separate from the classic Tools menu but I am not sure if it would be worthwhile to make a separate forum for it. Still we'll stick it in to the goodie bag and think about it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">6th August 2002, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, my main objective was the Data Migration part. You know, moving legacy data into Baan, creating interfaces, stuff like that.<br />
<br />
In my experience that has always been an underestimated part of many Baan projects.<br />
<br />
I just thought of another one too....Installation and Upgrades. Not exactly my cup-o-tea, but with a 5c upgrade in the planning, something I would love to read some more about.<br />
<br />
Oh man....I'm steaming now. Of course I also have to make my keystroke quota. But then again...if I keep hitting these keys, I won't have enough idle time for my SETI processes.<br />
<br />
This is getting confusing.<br />
<br />
btw, sorry I didn't make it into Antwerp. What little plans I had were turned upside down. I did manage to get in a Duvel or two (or three...) though ;)</div></div><hr />

You need a CPU upgrade to tackle your quote/idle time problem :) I understand your arguements for the new forums. As I said, we will take them into consideration.<br />
<br />
Not to worry about Antwerp but glad you enjoyed the beer :)</div></div><hr />
