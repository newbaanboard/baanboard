<br />
a. Keyword + whether the post has an attachment or not<br />
<br />
b. Keyword + whether the keyword also exists in the attachment of the post</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both are not possible for the simple reason that attachments are not indexed, sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would it be possible to search the 'Board' by asking for posts that have any attachments? The 'post' seem to 'know' (by virtue of the 'paper-clip' icon, that it has an attachment.<br />
<br />
Recently, I was looking for a couple of documents to help me with study of programming related to BOI.  Searching with various keywords did not yield results. On the other hand, if I can get the entire list of posts with attachments, I would be more than happy to wade through the list till I can locate what I require! There would not be too many of them (I hope!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand your request but unfortunately the current version of the forum software does not provide for such a functionality. I am hoping that the upcoming version 3 will have more flexible features where attachments are concerned. Let's keep our fingers crossed :)</div></div><hr />
