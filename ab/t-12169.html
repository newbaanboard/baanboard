<br />
You probably have already noticed the new graphic in the header section of our bulletin board. So yes, this is your chance to contribute in your own small way by  means of a donation and to help us keep Baanboard as successful as it has been over the last 2 years. The donation scheme runs through PayPal (http://www.paypal.com).<br />
<br />
Donating does NOT require for you to have a PayPal account. All you need is internationally accepted credit card, e.g. VISA etc<br />
<br />
We will make a special Donors page (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/bbinterface.php?s=&amp;action=donors) page listing those who have donated to us. However, if you wish to make an anonymous donation then just let us know when filling out your donation form on PayPal and we will not include you on the Donors page.<br />
<br />
Thanks for supporting us!</div></div><hr />

Many thanks for that Mark, Terrence and Vamsi. ;)<br />
<br />
The Donors (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/bbinterface.php?s=&amp;action=donors)  page can now be accessed from the list of links at the bottom of each page right next to the link to our Sponors page.</div></div><hr />
