<br />
I know that most people will just pop into these kind of forums to see whats happening or to post a question from time to time, but it would be good to see more interaction in the group. A newsletter of sorts will show whats been happening in the forum and hopefully get a bit more interest in people wanting to join in.</div></div><hr />

There is a hack available called 'Community Bulletin' which could send out a weekly newsletter with the hottest topics and threads etc.<br />
<br />
The problem is that hacking the board now will make future upgrade much more difficult. I want to try to avoid applying hacks as long and as much as possible.<br />

We'll keep it under consideration :)</div></div><hr />
