<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">1st December 2023, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
This is very likely going to be the last thread ever that I am going to start on the site. As the title says: we are shutting permanently on the last day of the year. When I and my my ex-colleague James Gittins started the site in 2001, we never imagined it would become such a big success. 22 years has been a very good run indeed but it is time to move on. <br />
<br />
For the last few months, I have tried to find a serious party who could continue the site as-is and also bring sufficient commitment and resources to make the site more up-to-date again. Unfortunately these efforts have failed so I am discontinuing the site forever. I do not not have the time anymore to revive the site as is really required to make it a modern &amp; secure platform to go into 2024 and beyond.<br />
<br />
So what is going to happen?:<br />
<br />
 As of today user registrations on the site are no longer allowed. Users and guests can continue to access the site's resources as before until the end of the year.<br />
 On december 31st, the site will shut down. All data - user profiles, forum content, documents or other - will be removed, the VPS that is hosting the site will be erased.<br />
 Sometime in January 2024, the e-mail to @baanboard.com will stop working as well<br />
 I will keep both Internet domains baanboard.com &amp; baanforums.com registered in my name to avoid future abuse.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is not going to happen?:<br />
<br />
 Data sale: do NOT contact me for any questions regarding the sale of any user data or other bits and pieces from the site. I will ignore and refuse all such demands.<br />
 Restore of personal information/documents: do NOT ask me to retrieve a document or post you have contributed in the past from a backup, because: there simply will not be any backups anymore. If you want to save information from the site, do so before 31-dec-2023!<br />
<br />
<br />
For those who want their own private mirror of the forum: feel free to suck the life out of the public available text archive: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/archive/index.php ;)<br />
<br />
Finally: I wish to thank all users, moderators &amp; sponsors who have contributed immensely to the success of the site and who have participated in the core mission of Baanboard.com: knowledge sharing. Again: THANK YOU :)<br />
<br />
And as a closing note: the disappearance of baanboard.com might make way for some new initiatives. One door closes, another opens. You know the story ;)<br />
<br />
Be good, kind and respectful to each other. ALWAYS. Also in business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RieseUSA</div><div class="date">2nd December 2023, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, Patrick Van der Veken &amp; James Gittins for BaanBoard all these years!  The platform has helped a lot.<br />
<br />
I hope another door will open for functional &amp; technical LN discussions.  Maybe, the Infor Communities (https://community.infor.com/ ) will finally get more LN users and become useful.  For anyone who is not aware, there is a community for LN Developers (https://community.infor.com/infor-developers/f/ln-development ).  Unfortunately, many users have not figured out the subgroup concept, and they post in the main one (https://community.infor.com/infor-developers/ ).  There are also several user groups for different regions and languages.</div></div><hr />

We had the luxury to google any time we face difficulties to redirect to your forum. It will be better if this baan encyclopedia is remained open. Wishing you Happy and Healthy life,</div></div><hr />
