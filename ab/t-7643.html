I see alot of postings which would be helped by knowing what version, porting set, etc the user is operating with to help solve the problem.  Is it possible to add this to the posting as you have for message icon etc?  I have seen several posts which went back and forth several times just to determine whether someone is on Baan IV or V.  Just a question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">The best way is to edit your profile to include not only your Baan version but also operating system and database type/version.  After that, it is just a matter of everyone knowing where to look.  Failing that, simply add it to your profile signature and this will show up in every post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this has been brought up before. That's why we added 3 custom fields the user profiles so that you can either enter this information at registration time or later on from the User Control Panel. This information can then be easily accessed by clicking on the 'profile' button of the member within each post.</div></div><hr />

That only speeds the process...</div></div><hr />

I've brought up this issue before with James. In my opinion it's a good thing to have it right on the user pane beside the posting. Actually, the version info is more useful and less personal than the geographical location of the user. You can look it up on the profile page, but that means extra clicking. That extra clicking  and loading means very precious time if you're in a country where dial up connection is slow and broadband hasn't really penetrated as well. So, my suggestion is please put it there. Thank you very much<br />
