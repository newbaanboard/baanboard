<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
3) Recent Baanboard.com upgrade<br />
<br />
If you have not visited Baanboard.com for a while, then it is worth that you<br />
pay us a visit again. We recently completed a large overhaul of the site in <br />
which we upgraded the forum to a new release of the forum software and <br />
introduced a new look. <br />
The forum now comes with tons of new features ranging from threaded views, <br />
an advanced calendar, a revised FAQ section, an indexable thread archive, <br />
WYSIWYG editing, an enhanced User Control Panel, extended private messaging,<br />
RSS/XML syndication and many many more features.<br />
<br />
Please visit this thread to get a quick glance at some of the new forum <br />
features:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=15512<br />
<br />
In conjunction with the forum overhaul we also upgraded the Wiki to a new <br />
software version and integrated its look with the forum. This will make the <br />
forum user much more at home when browsing the Wiki. We encourage anybody <br />
to participate in using the Wiki and helping us to build a public domain <br />
knowledgebase.<br />
<br />
Please visit the Baanboard.com Wiki at: <br />
http://www.baanboard.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome<br />
<br />
To find out more about Wiki's, please visit the largest free online <br />
encyclopedia (it's a Wiki too!) at:<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
4) Donations/subscriptions<br />
<br />
With the recent site upgrade we have decided to move away from the old donation<br />
system. Instead we have introduced a professional and easy-to-sign-up <br />
subscription system which allows any member to support Baanboard.com <br />
financially.<br />
You can choose to join up for a year at a cost of 30 EURO's in return for which<br />
you will receive some additional privileges on the forum.<br />
<br />
To join up as a Baanboard subscriber, please visit your User Control Panel at:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/subscriptions.php?<br />
<br />
For an overview of the additional features subscribers will receive please <br />
visit the FAQ section:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/faq.php?faq=bb_donors_subscribers<br />
<br />
Note that we can only accept payments through the online payment system PayPal.<br />
<br />
Also note that regular members (non-subscribers) do and will not loose out on<br />
any of the standard features and will have full access to the forum/wiki.<br />
Baanboard.com is and remains a FREE community but you are welcome to support<br />
us!<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
5) Call for documentation guru's/technical writers (Wiki)<br />
<br />
Since the Baanboard Wiki went live nearly a year ago, the participation<br />
rate in trying to set up a free but professional documentation section about <br />
Baan products has been somewhat disappointing. For members unfamiliar with the <br />
concepts of Wiki's the willingness - granted time and opportunity - may be a <br />
bit of a stumbling block. Yet there is nothing so easy to use as a Wiki! You <br />
just got to give it a go and remember that there is little damage you can do<br />
to existing documentation.<br />
<br />
To get started with the Baanboard Wiki, visit the 20-min online tutorial at:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TWikiTutorial<br />
<br />
In the past some members have raised the question or offered the idea to build<br />
a 'Frequently Asked Questions' (FAQ) section about the most common topics and<br />
issues that Baan users/developers come across. We would like to call out to<br />
these members again and come forward with ideas, suggestions etc on how we<br />
could implement this in our Baanboard Wiki and whether they are willing to <br />
help in making this happen. Please contact us at the usual email address<br />
(see below) or feel free to add your comments to the following existing forum<br />
thread at:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=1796<br />
<br />
To get an idea of how powerful writing documentation in Wiki can be, have a <br />
look at the BaanERP Programmer's Guide which is available in its entirity in<br />
the Baanboard Wiki at:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/twiki/bin/view/Progmanerp/WebHome<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
6) Moderators wanted!<br />
<br />

ranks of the current moderators. Moderators play a very important role in the<br />
good functioning of our forum so we always welcome enthusiastic volunteers.<br />
