<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">8th April 2002, 08:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
This post is meant as a little 'poll' to see if there would be an interest in the following extension we have in mind for baanboard.com<br />
<br />
So what it is about? Well, we are thinking of adding a newsgroup gateway to baanboard.com that would allow members to read, reply and search on posts from a select set of newsgroups. Newsgroups that are eligible for selection would e.g. comp.unix.admin etc.<br />
<br />
However, there is a but. Whether the project will go trough will not only depend on whether the NNTP extension brings added value to the board but also on some technical matters, of which most importantly are diskspace and bandwith. If for any of these reasons the feasibility is too low, than the project will be put on hold.<br />
<br />
So what do we want to know from you? Well 2 things:<br />
a. do you think a newsgroup interface is useful on baanboard.com?<br />
b. let us know your top 5 list of newsgroups you would like to see added.<br />
<br />
Regarding the newsgroups: do not suggest any binary groups, off-topic groups. Reversely, we are also looking for newsgroups that are not available on most ISP or public news servers but newsgroups that feature on free accessible news servers from companies that sell 3rd party products and that deliver support through these forums.<br />
<br />
So let's hear your thoughts :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">afvdba</div><div class="date">8th April 2002, 13:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I would welcome such an improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SRWSRW</div><div class="date">8th April 2002, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I was discussing discussion forums with a potential client and mentioned BAANBOARD as one of the few Web based systems I have used that seem to be successful.<br />
<br />
I think BAANBOARD is successful inspite of the deficiencies of the interface, in part because BAAN is so seldom discussed elsewhere, and in part because the people who set the board up and look after it are able to provide useful answers themselves.<br />
<br />
The deficiency are speed, and difficulty seeing threads, and seeing what is new. NNTP addresses these issues nicely, so I would be in favour of the proposed change.<br />
<br />
Suggest you consider &quot;alt.baan...&quot; or similar in case you decide to share the NNTP groups with other newsservers following the existing conventions might make it easier.<br />
<br />
As for groups - well I'm biased by my needs but anything on the HP-UX/Oracle underlying infrastructure side...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FriarTuck</div><div class="date">8th April 2002, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I would support a NG feed on BB, but I hesitate to cast my vote to go ahead without voicing some concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the noise level on most unmoderated NGs so high, I question whether we would see a benefit to BB with the addition of such a feed.  I have noticed that questions to which I cannot find an answer for on BB can be found with a quick search of the http://groups.google.com archives.  The effort made to duplicate the archives of Google (et al.) here on BB, to me, could be better spent on other improvement projects (not that I can think of any right now :D).<br />
<br />
<br />
Myself, I find BB in itself quite helpful with any Baan related questions I may have on my mind.  Even general Unix and Oracle information is readily available online with BB.  The interface is refreshing and intuitive.  I do agree, though, that new threads are difficult to identify.<br />
<br />
My opinion said then, as long as BB does not move to become a fee-based forum as so many others seem to be heading towards I won't be a stick-in-the-mud.  Rock on!<br />
<br />
Like others, my NG choices are slanted to my needs, but, if I had a choice, my five would be:<br />
<br />
* comp.databases.oracle.server<br />
* comp.unix.admin<br />
* comp.sys.hp.hpux<br />
* alt.comp.baan<br />
* comp.os.linux.advocacy  :cool:<br />
<br />
BB is a wonderful resource and I applaud the folks who work so hard to bring it to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">8th April 2002, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">SRW, thanks for the good feedback. But me elaborate on some comments you made:<br />

This is one of the few times that we have had negative feedback about speed of the board. The underlying software and technology really makes it the fastest bulletin board out there. The only factor we cannot control of course is the end-to-end network connections.<br />
<br />
About difficulty seeing threads: I assume you favour the threaded view rather than the flat view of posts. Well good news since the new vbulletin version will have both and it will user selectable.<br />
Suggest you consider &quot;alt.baan...&quot; or similar in case you decide to share the NNTP groups with other newsservers following the existing conventions might make it easier.<br />
<br />
As for groups - well I'm biased by my needs but anything on the HP-UX/Oracle underlying infrastructure side... <br />
<br />
Mmm, if there is one group I would *not* include it's the alt.baan.comp group simply because it's waste basket of spam posts. There are much more valuable groups like the comp.unix.* etc. <br />
<br />
As to the actual interfacing itself: we have no intentions of 'exporting' our bulletin board onto usenet. Rather what we are thinking of is to bring valuable usenet information INTO baanboard into separate forums with the added benefit that all the new contents will be searchable etc. The only issue we have here is possible retention of posts. But for that we can devise acceptable work-arounds as well.</div></div><hr />

With the limited resources we have we are not going to mirror to Google archives :) The idea is pull in newsfeed from potentially interesting groups into *separate* forums. The gateway would allow direct interfacing with usenet, ie posting and replying from bb and the usenet contents would be indexed as well. Any interesting Usenet threads could be moved into our own 'native' forums to allow regular purging of the gateway forums<br />

Guys, are you using the View new posts option and any of the sorting features???<br />

Thanks for the compliments :)</div></div><hr />
