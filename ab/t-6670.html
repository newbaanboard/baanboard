<br />
Remember this poll?: How many will we be? (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1267&amp;highlight=poll)<br />
<br />
With reaching 2500 members today we already proved one group of members wrong. So any people out there who think differently on the topic now? Any new voters?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somehow it gives me that warm 'n fuzzy feeling.:cool:</div></div><hr />

It's been an age since I've seen as little as 100,000 on any of my cars. Of course, if Francesco is splitting time between Baan sites in Omaha and Ogallala, the Olds may only be 6 months old!<br />
<br />
Regardless of mileage, 2500 committed drivers is impressive!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">13th September 2002, 06:47</div></div><div class="posttext">when I lived in a small town near Ogallala (or should I say smaller town?). Come to think of it...that's when I bought the Olds.<br />
<br />
Amazing. lol</div></div><hr />

Amazing. lolNot if:<br />
- Scott took over that maintenance of the car's reseller/factory's Baan system.<br />
Sometimes you can see nice thinng in the order history table on the sites where you work :D</div></div><hr />

Is all of these 2500 &quot;active potential&quot; involved in reading and writing? What are the numbers on unamed guests?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What about some statistics regarding members at the board. <br />
How many new members per month since the start, how many members in different categories (newbee, junior member, member aso), how many posts per month per member, how many new threads / posts per month since the start ..........<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Not a nasty question at all! You can see the number of active (posting) and inactive (non-posting) members in the Board Stats (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/vbstats.php). The Activity Rate is really nothing more than a percentage if you divide it by 10. So currently it's around 43%.<br />
<br />
Where guests are concerned we don't know. Simply because you need to register before you can post and search. Especially for the last reason most guests do eventually register I believe although they may stay inactive.</div></div><hr />

Hey Sturla,<br />
<br />
Some of these things are available to us admins and other for all members (see Board Statistics (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/vbstats.php)). But it may be a good idea to make some extra stats available if it doesn't take too much customizing. We'll stick it in the suggestion box :)</div></div><hr />
