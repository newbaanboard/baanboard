<br />
Some of you might  have not received the latest Community Bulletin over the last few days, other may have received it 2 times. Our apologies for that. <br />
<br />
It seems that the mailing engine has starting to have problems with our growing number of members. Therefore we will not be sending out the Community Bulletin anymore through email but instead put the transcript of it in this folder so that everyone can read it. If we can improve the mailing engine we will resume the email distribution.</div></div><hr />
