Can only a moderator delete this thread or is there a way for the thread-starter to do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">3rd December 2002, 07:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if you delete the very first post of the thread, it would delete the complete thread. And I think only thread starters/moderators/board masters are authorized to do this.<br />
Right Pat!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">3rd December 2002, 07:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is right.<br />
<br />
If you feel a post is not in its place then just alert one of the moderators or administrators.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">3rd December 2002, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify, I was only referring to threads which had been started but did not have any replies i.e. just the original post only.  The fact is I was looking right past the &quot;delete now&quot; check box at the top.  Sorry (insert smilie for embarrasment here).<br />
