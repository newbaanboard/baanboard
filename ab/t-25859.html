0) Introduction<br />
<br />
Hi all, we have a pretty lengthy newsletter this time. I just wanted to take the<br />
opportunity here to wish all Baanboard members a well deserved Christmas or <br />
holiday period and a Happy New Year!<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1) Sponsorship renewal by Nazdaq for 12 months<br />
<br />
We are glad to announce that Nazdaq has decided to extend its running sponsor-<br />
ship for another 12 months.<br />
<br />
About Nazdaq (by Bader Mansour, CEO):<br />
Since 1999, NAZDAQ has been providing tools for enhancing the Baan software<br />
for customers in 45 countries. NAZDAQ is proud to sponsor the most professional<br />
Baan Forum for the forth year in a row.<br />
<br />
Listen to what some Baan customers say about NAZDAQ:<br />
<br />
- B2Win and B2Email are so affordable. The software paid back for itself in <br />
8 business days!<br />
- The software is quite simple yet rich in functionality<br />
- I advocate all Baan shops to review and consider NAZDAQ's line of tools.<br />
- With NAZDAQ, you will not only add value to your system, but you will <br />
couple with a world-class manufacture of software utilities.<br />
- In my decade of career in the field, your software has been very impressive<br />
to me in that it has been amongst the easiest to install, configure and use.<br />
- Their products are easy to install and safe to handle. We also like the <br />
ongoing development and the excellent customer service.<br />
- Good stuff. I check the NAZDAQ website (www.nazdaq-it.com) regularly to see <br />
what they are going to come up with next.<br />

2) Sponsorship renewal by BridgeLogix for 6 months<br />
<br />
We are also happy to announce that also BridgeLogix has decided to extend its <br />
running  sponsorship and this another 6 months.<br />
<br />
About BridgeLogix (by Martin Linch, Director of Business Development):<br />
&quot;What do Finland and Australia have in common?<br />
During this year they have become the latest additions to the Bridgelogix map <br />
of global users. With other new customers in existing countries such as China,<br />
Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the USA they join the largest community of data <br />
collection users in the SSA Baan and SSA ERPLN arena.<br />
On the back of a successful User Conference in Chicago during October,<br />
Bridgelogix have also launched a new Time &amp; Attendance solution, which now sits<br />
alongside their Warehouse Management System as fully &quot;Baan embedded&quot; solutions <br />
that make use of barcoding and data collection technology to simplify key <br />
transaction processes.<br />
For companies that do not want to use the ILC feature in SSA Baan but who need <br />
the functional benefits, Bridgelogix have also released a solution called <br />
&quot;ILC Lite&quot;.<br />
Look forward to more innovations from Bridgelogix during 2006!&quot;<br />

3) Baanboard and EBUG teaming up<br />
<br />
Baanboard and EbuG (European Baan Users Group) plan to work together in attempt<br />
to bundle forces within the Baan user community. EBUG has decided to abandon <br />
its plans to create its own forum space and instead will encourage its members<br />
to use Baanboard as discussion forum. Already EBUG is linking to Baanboard from<br />
its homepage at http://www.baanusers.org. EBUG will also encourage the national<br />
user groups it represents, to make use of Baanboard as general discussion <br />
platform. Baanboard supports several language dependant forums and will assist<br />
in transitioning national user groups to Baanboard if they so. Hopefully more <br />
concrete plans will emerge in the next couple of months.<br />
<br />
About EBUG: the power of cooperation.<br />
<br />
The EBUG builds an European Baan User Groups Forum for the national user groups.<br />
It is an independent, self-funding organisation that enables extensive access <br />
to the communication platform of SSA Global, Baan/SSA ERP LN software users and <br />
solution partners offering products all around Baan/SSA ERP LN on an European <br />
level.<br />
This European wide cooperation strives to make EBUG the place for Baan/SSA ERP <br />
LN customers to find the resources and solutions they are looking for. Because <br />
of the intensive cooperation of members, EBUG and SSA Global, the organization <br />
enables the development of strong relationships.<br />
All participants gain knowledge from each other`s experience and obtain major <br />
benefit through the international teamwork. Also SSA Global and Baan/SSA ERP LN <br />
solution partners have the possibility to learn about customers` needs.<br />
One of the major goals of EBUG is to provide opportunities for member-user <br />
groups to submit collectively enhancement suggestions to SSA Global.<br />
On the basis of following the EBUG strategy not only members such as Baan users <br />
but also members such as solution partners and SSA Global are satisfied.<br />
<br />

<br />
4) Play the Google game!<br />
<br />
Two of most 'hard-core' members - Vamsi and Francesco - have started an<br />
initiative to increase the rank of the baanboard.com website on the Google<br />
search engine. Read about how you can help to increase our Google rank in the<br />
popular thread 'Play the Google game' at:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=25323<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
5) Google Ads on Baanboard<br />
<br />
Since a couple of weeks Baanboard's forum is showing some Google Ads for <br />
anynomous or guest users. Logged-in members will not experience these ads <br />
except for the site's start page. The main reason for adding Google Ads to <br />
Baanboard - apart from the limited financial gain - is the give members the <br />
possibility to show appreciation for their favourite Baan forum without having <br />
to be out of pocket themselves. Every time you click on one of the Google Ads, <br />
Baanboard will receive a small fee. So click away!<br />
<br />
We plan to throw a poll after the holidays period and evaluate the use of the <br />
ads on the site. In the mean time you can go for more information and discussion<br />
to: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=25717<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
6) Different reading experience for Baanboard<br />
<br />
If you have been visiting Baanboard recently you probably already noticed that<br />
we have switched from the standard 'Verdana' font style to the newer and more <br />
trendy 'Bitstream Vera Sans'. Check it out and cast your vote on the change<br />
before 31st December at: <br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=25801<br />
<br />
The outcome of the poll will decide whether we stick with the new font style or<br />
whether we will revert back to the old one.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
7) Did you know?<br />
<br />
That you can always delete your own posts or threads? This may come in handy if<br />
you made a mistake in the original posting or if you wish to withdraw your<br />
question. However, it is not considered very polite to delete threads to which<br />
other members have already replied. Therefore we scan the forum on a periodical<br />
basis for such deleted threads and resurrect them (yes, this is possible :-))<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
