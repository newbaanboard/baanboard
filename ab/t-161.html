 created the forum Multisite (SIGs) by request of several users: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=116</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">28th November 2001, 00:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to a lack of popularity following forums were removed:<br />
<br />
 the forum Links: posts were moved to the General Discussion &amp; Chat forum<br />
 the forum Baan people: posts were moved to the General Discussion &amp; Chat forum<br />
 the forum Future Technology &amp; Developments: posts were moved to the Tools Administration and/or Operating systems &amp; Databases forums<br />
The forum Multisite has been renamed to Archiving &amp; Multisite, thus also serving questions regarding Baan archiving.<br />
<br />
The forum General Discussion &amp; Chat is now also open for questions about training &amp; education</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">14th January 2002, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Created a new forum category for SIGs: Archives (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=35). This will serve as an archive store for obsoleted SIG forums. All archived forums are closed. This means that all posts will still be viewable but no replies or new threads will be allowed.<br />
<br />
First archived 'victim' is the Baan &amp; the EURO (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=22) forum. As the EURO is now well on its way, we do not expect this SIG to be of importance anymore. <br />
<br />
If - for one reason or another - you feel that the EURO forum needs to be reinstated, then please send me a message and we will consider it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 22:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to many user requests (e.g. in this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1309)) we have decided to change the search engine indexing limitations:<br />
<br />
 lower limit: 4 -&gt; 3 characters<br />
 upper limit: 20 -&gt; 17 characters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">18th March 2002, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">On moderator's advice we decided to split the old CRM, iBaan, Front-Office forum into 2 separate forums:<br />
 iBaan: Open World, Portal &amp; Decision Manager (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?forumid=15) (category: Quick Support)<br />
 CRM &amp; Front-Office (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?forumid=39) (category: SIG)<br />
Most of the threads have been moved accordingly but if you feel that your thread is located in the wrong forum then drop me a note.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">22nd May 2002, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
For sure you have seen the graphic button disappear at the top of the forum pages. We have replaced them with a text table that offers a better page fill and future extensibilities. <br />
<br />
Additionally we have placed a Quick Search dialog box  right under the top links that will enable members to search the forums with the usual defaults without having to access the search page itself. We hope it will enhance your baanboard experience just a little bit :)</div></div><hr />
