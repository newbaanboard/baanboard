<br />
Monday 15/08/2005 or tuesday 16/08/2005 - depending on how you look at it - will be the 4th birtday of baanboard.com. <br />
<br />
I would like to take the opportunity again to say thanks to all members that have contributed over the last couple of years - whether large or small - to make this a worthwhile community and a site that sticks out in a positive way compared to most other Baan related websites. <br />
<br />
Let's see if we can make 5 next year!</div></div><hr />

How did we get by before? I can hardly remember the dark ages. <br />
<br />
Congratulations BaanBoard!!<br />
<br />
I still can remember having to wade through insults and innuendo before Baanboard :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lots of people who are looking for information about Baan end up in the Baan Fans web site (It has a higher ranking in www.google.com than www.BaanBoard.com). These people get the feeling that Baan is abandoned, no body cares and there is nothing go on. The truth is that Baan is still serving lots of customers and is live and kicking!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rita Kotecha</div><div class="date">24th August 2005, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to all the members of BaanBoard for the co-operation.<br />
<br />
Thanks Mr Patrick.</div></div><hr />

I found that BaanBoard is the only alive (with activities) and well maintained discussion board for big ERP. I'm proud to be part of it. Unless of course, I missed other good discussion board because they rank so low in Google that I couldn't find them :) . Four cheers for our BaanBoard<br />
