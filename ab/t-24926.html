Dear Managers of Baanboard.com  ,<br />
                                               At present , when we r applying to any job advertised in Recruiters Forum , no &quot;Confidentiality&quot; , is being maintained .<br />
Anybody ( including my present employer ) , can see my application . <br />
                           This is highly un-ethical &amp; un-desirable feature . I suggest that , only , the representatives of the organizations , that have advertised , for these posts , should have the access to see our application forms . The present system needs to be corrected .<br />
<br />
Regards ,<br />
<br />
B.V.RAO</div></div><hr />

<br />
BV ROA, what on earth made you think that Baanboard should guarantee 'confidentiality' when you make a public post on a public forum? Perhaps you should think twice before using baanboard.com and complaining? Baanboard.com's job forums are for *YOUR* convenience only and do not offer the same functionalities as professional job sites or recruitment agencies. And it never will.<br />
<br />
Note that you are usually able to contact recruiters via their registered Baanboard e-mail address or by sending them a private message through the forum rather than making a public post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When explaining to bvroa that his/her post was public, I think you should have added, &quot;and because it is public someone esle may read it&quot;. Form the tone of his/he initial note I think he/she may have trouble fully understanding that point without further repetition.  <br />
<br />
Despite an odd-ball case like bvros's,  I sure you know that your hard work is very much appreciated by the vast majority of members. I can't understand why those who are not happy with the 'board' bother to log on. <br />
<br />

<br />
When I checked the earlier posts of BV Rao, I could see that he has put his CV on display for some recruiter. From his mail I guess he has got into trouble with his present employer and under tension got angry against Baanboard which is unreasonable. Most of the users know very well that others can see the details if posted. It is very simple. If I could see others' details then others can see my details. I think BVRao has learnt his lessons the hard way.<br />
Undoubtedly, the inference is, everyone, whether employer or employee looks<br />
into Baanboard which I am sure, will give you satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
I second Terry. Baanboard is indeed the most professional forum. Kudos to you Patrick. Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baanboard is the best professional forum for baan users.<br />
<br />
I think ur comments are quite right. Mr Rao has to pass the email id to the  recruiters so that if  recruiter want his cv then he will mail the same. <br />
<br />

Dear Mr.Patrick ,<br />
                     Just because , Baanboard.com is a public forum , does not mean you , make everything public . Technical discussions ,sugestions etc. , Yes ! You can make them public , for the benefit of all baan users . But , not somebody's &quot;Job-hunting ' .<br />
<br />
Regards ,<br />
B.V.RAO<br />
<br />
P.S : Private e-mail id's , sometimes don't work ! They bounce back ! Like , for instance , your own e-mail id &amp; other administrators' . Mails sent  to them bounced back !</div></div><hr />
