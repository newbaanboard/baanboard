I'm specially interested to have an SIG on AS/400 Baan platform. Perhaps other people can be interested to have Windows NT, Windows 2000, HPUX, ... plateform sig?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">24th August 2001, 01:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, could be a good idea. Anyone who would advocate this proposal, please raise your hands :). I think we can make a sub-category platform SIGs under the main category of SIGs. For that sub-category we can add the different platforms as desired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">24th August 2001, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this would make life a lot easier if you wanted to post a specific platform problem and wanted a quick answer. It also would show which platform has the most problems and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">24th August 2001, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the board admins had a quick word about it. The idea is good but we have 2 concerns:<br />
<br />
* not to clog up the board with too many forums<br />
* not to create forums that will remain empty or unused<br />
<br />
Therefore we would like to see that members post any OS/DB related posts in the Operating Systems and Databases forums for the moment. If this forum should become too full we can then think about splitting up the single forum into several platform specific ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Commandeur</div><div class="date">24th August 2001, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok,<br />
<br />
It seems a good proposition.</div></div><hr />
