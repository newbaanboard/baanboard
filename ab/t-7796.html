I know I will sometimes not answer for lack of a complete solution if the question has just been posted.  However, if the poor soul is waiting 2-3 days and no one has answered, I would post what I know.  But, since I usually go to 'unread posts', I never see it again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even a partial solution or answer may point someone else to the answer or generate other replies that may work.  So I am sure even your partial response from you would be appreciated.<br />

Can't we modify it(vbulletin) to suit our needs keeping in mind upgrades.Is that a big task?<br />
<br />
Also I guess those poor souls who dont get replies will not be encouraged to post again.<br />
<br />
<br />
If we want to make Baanboard better than Baan support (as pointed out by pat in one of his posts when baan.com was down) we should look for customer(member)satisfaction.<br />

The vbulletin we use is already modified, extended to a certain amount. There is only so much you can do before it becomes unworkable. It takes me nearly full day every time I have to do the upgrade procedure. <br />
<br />
I don't recall me saying we're supposed to be better than Baan Support. Just if their site is down they redirect the URL to us. We are not and cannot be Baan Support simply because this BB is a voluntarily community effort and we don't have the same resources as Baan Support.</div></div><hr />

Yes Vamsi I forgot that! So there, problem fixed :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry I've only just picked up this thread. <br />
<br />
The issue of searching for threads with zero posts was brought up about 12 months ago.  Reason being, is that one of the duties of our moderators is to keep track of their forums and to respond to any un-answered posts.  Moderators would then be able to direct the poster in the best possible way for an adequate response.  And yes, the best way to find these posts is to click on the &quot;Replies&quot; column in each forum and do a reverse sort.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If we want to make Baanboard better than Baan support  I'm sure pat didn't say or imply this - this is not one of our objectives.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I apologise for that.<br />
