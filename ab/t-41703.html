0) Introduction<br />
<br />
Hi, baanboard member!<br />
<br />
Welcome to the second newsletter of 2007. Summer holidays are over and most of<br />
us probably have their noses back to the grind stone. Here is some fresh news <br />
on your favorite forum in case you missed it during the holidays!<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1) Sponsor news<br />
<br />
a] Since our last newsletter, Baanboard has managed to attract 1 new sponsor:<br />
<br />
Jewelex Creations signed up for a 6 months sponsorship. Jewelex Creations is <br />
sponsoring the &quot;Polls &amp; Surveys&quot; forum.<br />
<br />
About Jewelex Creations:<br />
Jewelex - a leading Baan customer in India has discovered many jewels of Baan. <br />
It was quick to visualize that versatility of Baan native data dictionary need <br />
to be combined with the power of MS Excel and multi-dimensional pivot table. <br />
So it created a reporting tool to extract (data from any Baan report / any baan <br />
table in a user friendly manner tackling all complexities and to load the same <br />
into MS Excel along with lot of flexibilities like calculated items, hierarchies, <br />
user-defined functions etc. It is different from present output formatting <br />
approaches in that it does not act through a device, original report (layout <br />
and output) remains in tact and additional excel output comes to authorized <br />
users. <br />
<br />
The reporting tool - named ERPJewels is developed in a modular manner in package <br />
'tu' module 'dll' not affecting any standard or any other components. Now more <br />
and more reliable and analytical MIS in Excel is generated leading to better <br />
well informed decision making. Over a period of time, Jewelex has built a <br />
repository of about 800 analyses (besides many excellent Baan reports) with an <br />
average about 50 run for each analyses and about 50 analytical users using the <br />
output from this tool. 4 times baan license growth is a testimony to the success <br />
of the tool. For more info please visit http://www.erpjewels.com or send an <br />
email to css@jewelexindia.com <br />
<br />
b] Following sponsors have opted to extend their current sponsorship and we would<br />
like to thank them also for their continued support:<br />
<br />
* BridgeLogix. See http://www.bridgelogix.com/index.cfm?id=33<br />
* Neustro Consulting. See http://www.neustro.com/<br />

<br />
2) 6th Birthday<br />
<br />
In case you are wondering how long baanboard.com has been around: last month we<br />
passed over the 6th year mark. It proves that maintaining a strong cummunity<br />
over a longer period of time is indeed possible. Let's go for 10 now and throw<br />
a big party then :)<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
3) New server<br />
<br />
The baanboard.com site is now running on a totally new, shiny server. It is a <br />
HP Proliant DL360G5 with a 2 Ghz DC core, 2 GB RAM and plenty of disk space. <br />
The box also has a 4yrs next-business-day on-site hardware support contract.<br />
Slowly we have migrated all the necessary bits and pieces from the old server<br />
and the work was completed during the summer holidays. The old web server has <br />
been &quot;recycled&quot; into a backup server (running Bacula) and is located just <br />
underneath the web server in the rack.<br />
<br />

<br />
4) What do YOU want to see on baanboard.com?<br />
<br />
I am calling for new suggestions on how to improve the site. Whether you want <br />
to propose changes to the existing features or totally new things, anything <br />
goes. Call it a &quot;brainstorm&quot; exercise. I am however looking for realistic goals <br />
and together with new ideas volunteers to make these happen are also welcome. <br />
Based on the feedback I will select a number of ideas that I think can be made <br />
reality and if there too many, we can have of course have a vote on what is the <br />
most popular etc.<br />
<br />
Please post your ideas and suggestions here:<br />

5) Did you know?<br />
<br />
You can submit a search to the forum with a URL, just like you can with the <br />
search form? The basic URL is:<br />
<br />
    http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/search.php?do=process&amp;query=&lt; searchword &gt;<br />
<br />
Where searchword is the word for which you are searching.<br />
<br />
Here is a list of the extra search parameters you can add to the URL. Some <br />
controlling parameters can be added to list as well. You can read more about <br />
this on this Wiki page:<br />
