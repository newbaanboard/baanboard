0) Introduction<br />
<br />
Hi, baanboard member!<br />
<br />
This is the first community newsletter of 2007. The forum has been quite busy<br />
during the first 3 months of the year which has resulted in us breaking through<br />
the 10,000 member barrier! Back in 2001 the majority of members thought we<br />
would never reach the 10,000 mark. How they were wrong :)<br />
See: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=1267<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1) Sponsor news<br />
<br />
a] Since our last newsletter, Baanboard has managed to attract 2 new sponsors.<br />
They are:<br />
<br />
* Migration Labs signed up for a 6 months sponsorship. Migration Labs is <br />
sponsoring the &quot;BB Language&quot; forums group and can also be found on the main <br />
Sponsor page.<br />
<br />
About Migration Labs:<br />
Do you want to see your own BAAN IV/V data in ERP LN ? Within five Days ?<br />
Now at the beginning of 2007 many companies using older versions of SSA BAAN <br />
ERP software are considering an upgrade to Infor ERP LN.<br />
But how to go from one version to the other when so much of the architecture <br />
has changed?<br />
What may sound so unbelievable, can be proven easily by our on-site Migration <br />
Labs workshop. The process works as follows: as soon as we are on-site at your <br />
facility we will extract a subset of your SSA BAAN IV or SSA BAAN V data and <br />
within 5 days we will show you the major processes in sales, planning, <br />
purchasing, production, warehousing, invoicing, finance and controlling in <br />
Infor ERP LN using your own individual data. Especially in case you are <br />
considering to upgrade to Infor ERP LN we challenge you to find any other <br />
existing Infor SSA BAAN service provider who is able to pull this off in such <br />
a short time frame.Our Migration Labs promise to you is that easybaan® allows <br />
you to migrate your individual SSA BAAN IV or SSA BAAN V data to Infor ERP LN <br />
in a matter of weeks where all the others will take months.<br />
Please mail us at info@migration-labs.com or call us at +1.(757).362.2795 for <br />
more information on our on-site workshop. For more details on our unique <br />
implementation and migration easybaan® methodology to Infor ERP LN please visit <br />
our website at http://www.migration-labs.com. <br />
<br />
* Xpert Technical Services also signed up for a 6 months sponsorship. Xpert <br />
Technical Services is sponsoring the &quot;Distribution, Transportation &amp; Warehousing&quot;<br />
forum and can also be found on the main Sponsor page.<br />
<br />
About Xpert Technical Services:<br />

<br />
b] Following sponsors have opted to extend their current sponsorship and we would<br />
like to thank them also for their continued support:<br />
<br />
* e-Ventus Corporation. See http://www.e-ventus.com/114.html<br />
* Neustro Consulting. See http://www.neustro.com/<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
2) New moderator for 'Tools Development' forum<br />
<br />
We are happy to announce that George Abdo (george7a) has joined the crew of<br />
baanboard forum moderators. George will be co-moderating the very busy 'Tools<br />
Development' forum.<br />
<br />
Are you also interested in becoming a forum moderator? Please contact us at<br />
boardmaster@baanboard.com<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
3) Web Statistics<br />
<br />
Baanboard has been providing publicly accessible web statistics for a long time. <br />
However, these statistics have been getting abused more and more lately by <br />
so-called &quot;referer spammers&quot; that aim to tie in baanboard.com with less desirable <br />
websites. We have therefore decided to no longer provide web statistics on a <br />
public place but they will rather be password-protected from now on. Together <br />
with some specific anti-referer spam measures we hope that this will get rid <br />
of referal spam all together.<br />
<br />
Baanboard does keep providing some forum/site statistics at following URL's:<br />
<br />
* Forum stats: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/psistats.php<br />
* Site stats: http://www.baanboard.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BaanboardStatistics<br />
(not updated real-time)<br />
<br />
For more information on referer spam, <br />
see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referer_spam<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
4) Forum spammers<br />
<br />
The forum has seen an increased activity of registrations and posting by spammers<br />
during the last couple of the months. Even though the forum software features<br />
an advanced &quot;captcha&quot; system to avoid registration by spam bots, spammers see <br />
increased value at going through the registration process manually, including<br />
using a proper e-mail address for validation. The only way to combat this <br />
practice is to delete such accounts/posts as they appear. Please use &quot;Report <br />
Post&quot; feature to signal any post you may consider spam. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
5) Server migration<br />
<br />
Baanboard will be moving to a completely new dedicated web server in the near<br />
future. We have been running on a HP Proliant DL380 for some time now but our <br />
sturdy &amp; trusty box is getting quite old. Therefore we will be moving towards a <br />
brand new HP Proliant DL360 server of the latest generation. The migration of <br />
the baanboard sites &amp; databases may cause some downtime during its process. <br />
We will inform you timely via forum announcements of the upcoming migration and<br />
potential downtime.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
6) Did you know?<br />
<br />
That you can use special tags to format your message in a particular way when<br />
posting messages on the forum? These tags are called &quot;vB codes&quot; and a <br />
descriptive list of them can be found here in the FAQ section of the forum:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/misc.php?do=bbcode<br />
<br />
A special mention goes to the standard &quot;CODE&quot; tag. With the help of one our <br />
longstanding members '~Vamsi', the &quot;CODE&quot; tag was extended to integrate<br />
with the 'enscript' syntax highlighting system.<br />
<br />
You can find more information on the &quot;CODE&quot; tag and the 'enscript' integration<br />
in following post: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?p=18665 <br />
<br />
