<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Following the registration of our 1000th member, we decided to also 'release' an enhanced, tweaked version of the bulletin board. The following posts will describe which functional and cosmetic changes were made to the board. Please take a couple of minutes to read through them.<br />
<br />
All the changes have been tested with the following browsers:<br />
 Internet Explorer 5.x<br />
 Netscape 4.7x/6.x<br />
 Mozilla 0.9.5<br />
 Opera 5.x/6.x<br />
For Netscape users on some pages the display might look a bit clunky. The recommended browser remains Internet Explorer 5.x/6.x<br />
<br />
We know that change brings good and bad feedback. In any case, we want to hear both of them in this thread! (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=996)<br />
<br />
A special note regarding the sponsors (http://www.baanboard.com/sponsors.html) page: please contact me or James at boardmaster@baanboard.com (mailto://boardmaster@baanboard.com) if you would like to know more details about this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">When reading threads you will notice a '+' or '-' icon next to name of the poster. Clicking this icon makes it possible to either contract or expand the contents of the post, an operation similar to opening and closing directory trees in file managers.<br />
<br />
When a post is collapsed, it will only display either the post title or the first line of the post.<br />
<br />
Additionally, there are two more options available at the top of each thread page: expand all and contract all. These options will either expand or contract *all* posts of the thread in one go.<br />
<br />
And finally an option is available to view old posts in collapsed state by default. This feature is user selectable, meaning that each user can toggle this option in their User Control Panel:<br />
<br />
User CP &gt; Edit Options &gt; Contract posts you already read (Yes/No)<br />
<br />
The default is setting is 'No' indicating that all posts will be shown in expanded or normal view.</div></div><hr />

This will help users to keep track of how many private messages they are storing and when it will be necessary to do some pruning.</div></div><hr />
