<br />
Today I found at least a workaround to stop them:<br />
1. General Topics / News Feeds / Forum Tools / Mark This Forum Read<br />
and then - as usual -<br />
2. What's New / All Unread Posts<br />
<br />
Is there another way to stop the News Feeds flood?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are seeing these posts because you are a member of the group Newsreader. If you leave this group via your CP then you will stop seeing these posts alltogether. If not then the easiest way to avoid having them show up in What's New/All Unread Posts, is to mark the Newsfeeds forum as read by double clicking on the forum icon from the home page. This is an AJAX based feature that will automatically 'switch off' all the unread posts in that forum.<br />
<br />
Does that help?</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for the quick respone. I just left the Newsreader group and everything looks like before. I must have joined that group unintentionally.<br />
<br />
The feature of double-clicking is very cool.<br />
