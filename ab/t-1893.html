<br />
One of moderators gave me the idea to try to make a set of logo's for your mobile phones. So attached you'll find a set of low-resolution pictures that I think most GSM software can use to upload the logo to your mobile phone. Well at least if you have a phone that supports it (mine doesn't :( ).<br />
<br />
Any improvements to be made, let me know! In the mean time, stick our logo on your mobile and show it off! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just download the file then upload it to your private gallery on the T68 support site. Then download it via WAP to the phone. <br />
<br />
It fits quite nicely under the network provider name and just above the time.</div></div><hr />
