<br />
Good and exciting news! As it stands now I will be upgrading both the bulletin board and the Wiki coming saturday May 29 which will mean that the site will be unavailable for the entire day. Please pencil this into your agenda's!</div></div><hr />

First impressions good but the lack of a &quot;List posts within the last 24 hours&quot; that used to be on the main forum page is disappointing.  I'd really like to have easy access to that functionality again.</div></div><hr />

There are plenty of new and good features that warrant the big overhaul. I will have a look if I can re-add the daily posts again. Note that Baanboard now also offers RSS/XML syndication which may also answer your needs! See: 58942</div></div><hr />

Wonderful Work! There is so much features.<br />
Really appreciate you all for moving this board forward faster.<br />
<br />

Can we avoid all those redirecting transition pages that appear more often with this version?<br />
Also, we used to have a mark posts as read, how does it work now with the new posts (if we don't read all after the &quot;get new&quot;)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">31st May 2004, 13:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark posts read is still here of course, you can find it in 3 places:<br />
a. at the bottom of the home page: 'Mark Forums Read': for all forums.<br />
b. in the dropdown-menu 'Quick Links': for all forums<br />
c. in the dropdown-menu 'Forum Tools' when viewing a forum: this will only mark that forum as read.<br />
<br />
For slow connection users: Try switching to either the threaded or hybrid display mode.</div></div><hr />

The need to to redirect to the home page in order to sign off was a source of [minor] irritation <br />
<br />
And I'm waiting for an excuse to use the formatting icons on the reply window. I'm sure that I will live longer and happier if I don't need to insert start-stop coding marks to format text.<br />

<br />
fantastic update! Lot's of new features and a really modern look and feel. The only thing that I was missing on the first sight was the &quot;What's Going On&quot; box on top of the screen (I discovered it later at the bottom).<br />
I really liked to see who's online, how many members have been signed up and all that stuff when visiting baanboard.com. It made me feel like home  :D<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion: can we move it up again?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Martin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">2nd June 2004, 14:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Martin,<br />
<br />
Thanks! Yes you are right: for those who are looking for the old Who's Online section, it is now located at the bottom under Currently Active Users. OR: from the dropdown menu Quick Links at the top of the page.<br />
<br />
There is a good reason why it is now located at the bottom. We tried to standardize the top part of each page as much possible including the Wiki pages. Moving the 'Who's Online' section back up would break that look and I think it would also look too cluttered as there are more navigational controls already present at the top of each page.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also agree with Victor: is slower on a modem!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Scott, what do you mean by start/stop coding marks? You can always just write plaintext in any reply. No need to use bold, italics etc if you don't want to. The only thing we do ask is that you use the CODE function when you wish to include pieces of source code, log output etc.</div></div><hr />
