<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">11th February 2002, 12:40</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some visibility problems with the new black layout, where some icons are white (clip), so it's hardly seen. The open letters in the threads are also hard to differenciate.<br />
A tackle of the icons should do the trick, because I defenetely would like to use the black theme :D</div></div><hr />

Like the new look.  But you know since I am a UNIX guy, I would just as well not use a GUI  :) <br />
<br />
But since I have to, this one works very well.<br />

Ok, and if this post get's posted, that board also works excellent with the KDE Browser Konqueror.<br />
<br />
Great jooooob!</div></div><hr />

<br />
In any post, just click the [-] symbol to the left of the username.  Very useful for quickly filtering information from large threads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason why Netscape users are left out is because the gimmick makes use of specific IE only code. I will check with the creator of the hack whether it would possible to create a similar tool for Netscape. But to be honest,  I would not bet my money on it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 11:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Too dark now, and not too good with the black text and dark blue links... How the buttons &amp; icons are stored, independent icons/images or a big bitmap? maybe we can change the ones that are not seen :)<br />
<br />
Ah, another thing, the board is setup to display fine at 640x480 I think, but I think that a lost of wated space goes into so much white borders (the extra rouded is nice!), is it possible to use more screen state? This would avoid a lot of scrooling scrooling...</div></div><hr />

Give me some time to work out the colours. I only have limited access to the board this week :) We'll think about enlarging the forum table again although it was only decreased by 5% to give a less clogged up impression of the board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">15th February 2002, 14:19</div></div><div class="posttext">The collapsed posts display the vBcode when used in the first line instead of the text only (BUG?).<br />

It is also the first time that I see someone using vBcodes in the message title!</div></div><hr />

That is possible yes. However we opted not to add that information in each post so that it would not 'overkill'  the screen with information. After all the sam information is directly accessible from the 'profile' button which is present at the end of each post. But we'll consider it :)</div></div><hr />
