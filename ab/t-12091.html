<br />
A little surprise for those who keep an eye on statistics like post and thread count. If you look again now you will probably notice our post count jumped up by 2000 posts or so :)<br />
<br />
Reason for this is that Baanboard and the users of  the german Kai's Baan forum agreed to merge the 2 forums into Baanboard.com. We also managed to bring forward all posts of the old Kai's Forum Archive into the Baanboard database which explains the massive jump in post count. All of these posts were imported in the Deutsche Forum (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=65). We also managed to retain the original post dates so the thread structure of the Kai Archive should be consistent (exceptions permitted). However, there was no way we could import these posts using the original user names. Therefore all of these posts are now 'owned' by the generic user Kai's Forum users<br />
<br />
We have also invited Kai Bourdaillier to become a moderator for the 'Deutsche Forum' effective now.<br />
<br />
I would like to make some general comments on this successfull 'joint-venture'. I know some members have been very anxious seeing the creation of native language forums for non-english speakers. Reason being that it will cause 'some fragmentation' within our Baanboard community. However, we will be trying to offset this internal fragmentation by external consolidation, trying to tighten the global Baan community. In that regard, the current exercise with the Kai forum doesn't have to be a once-off event. On the contrary, we would love to do the same with other Baan forums out there that seek to strengthen their position. So if you know any of these forums then please let us know. Primarily we would be looking at free and open forums but we will not exclude private forums on the condition that convert themselves to the Baanboard philosophy. Help us to make the global Baan community stronger.<br />
<br />
And lastly, I'd like to welcome all members of the original Kai Baan Forum!</div></div><hr />
