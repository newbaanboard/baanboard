<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">11th September 2002, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">While watching the interesting (hrm...) film 'Trekkies' over the weekend (for those that don't know, its a docufilm about Star Trek fans who use Star Trek as a way of life... hey there was nothing else on!), I was asked why there was the 2 versions of Trek fan, Trekkies and Trekkers... and why was this not carried onto other fan bases, to the point that how silly it would be if us Baan 'Fans' were to be called Baanies... Personally I don't like the idea of our names being the same as the purple dinosaur trying to take over the world (and does any one else think that the Teletubbies could just be Barneys lovechildren that he does not want the world to find out about so he abandoned them somewhere in the hills of England and left them to fend for themselves?)<br />
<br />
So what do we call ourselves, should we have a name (I mean, we are no longer a small group, there is now enough members to make a small village, and if so, I'm number 6 *another fave comes out of the woodwork* ), should we plan a Baanboard conference somewhere and get a film crew to wonder around the Baanies talking passionatly about Crystal Reports and the problems with patches.<br />
<br />
Any views out there?</div></div><hr />

Believe it or not, that's the name I used in our office for a long while. Didn't want to propose it here because of its 'sensitive' nature :D</div></div><hr />
