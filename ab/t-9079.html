I have one Suggestion cant we have a Forum of Baan Localization Just like Baan SIGs at BaanBoard and Baan Localization will further have sub forum of say India and similarly various other country localization.<br />
Which will have all the threads related to localization. As right now we dont have any such facilities. Mind you there are definitely large numbers of users, which are more in touch with their respective localizations then the standard Baan. And there is no place to showcase their discussions, dialogs and grievances. I think BaanBoard would be the better place to provide these facilities for large number of Baan localization users.<br />
I would suggest you to think over it and if feasible you can implement it as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

The idea of having separate forums for each localization is in itself not a bad idea however we have to think of the practical side of it as well. First of all, it would make out current (long) list bigger again which doesn't do good for performace and secondly we would like to see forums busy enough. I am not sure if this would be the case for individual localizations. Nevertheless, your suggestions has been noted and we will come back to it if we feel the need for it is justified.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its good to hear that you have considered and given your thought on the idea of putting on the localization on baanboard.com Let me know what are the plans and difficulties in details that will be faced if will put the localizations on the BaanBoard.com so that every one can contribute and help.<br />
<br />
Please let me know the confirmation of whether it is possible or not because if it is absolutely not possible to put localization on baanboad.com then we can create a whole new forum on some other site say ezboard which provides hosting of free communities <br />
<br />
<br />
No hard feelings but I think that localization is must and if we dont have forum for that then we are missing out some thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />
Arun</div></div><hr />
