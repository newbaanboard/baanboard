what is your opinion:<br />
is it better to distinguish the forums in sperate threats for BaanIV, Baan5 and LN 6? Since LN a lot of new functions and features are implemented in the software (and daily I find new ones...) and the answers in the major releases of baan are different.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">29th May 2006, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Certainly that would result in an explosion of forums, basically each forum times 3 or more. I understand, that this would help a lot the user side, because usually a specific user is only interested in a specific version. For the consultant and supplier side this would resultin many more forums to monitor. <br />
<br />
I personally am not so fond of this idea. But I am also mainly interested in the technical bits of the discussion and (funny enough) the differences between the versions are not so big.<br />
<br />
Also I personally benefit, be stumbling by chance upon an ERP topic, whenI am in reality hunting for BaanIVc4 topics.<br />
<br />
I would keep the current structure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree with Markus on this. The problem with adding version specific fora is the fragmentation of Q&amp;A that would occur. The way the forum is currently set up allows us to 'absorb' new relases of the software without forum changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DFisch</div><div class="date">1st June 2006, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Harkus, hello Patrick,<br />
yes of course I can unterstand your opinion...<br />
But is it possible to set up a field, where the users can see in the overview of every topic, for witch release the question is?<br />
Maybe that would help.<br />

<br />
That is a good suggestion. I will have a look if there is an easy way to attach such meta information to threads.</div></div><hr />
