<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">21st January 2006, 14:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
The forum software has been upgraded to the most recent version available currently. As usual a new version brings in a ton of new features (and hopefully not too many bugs).<br />
<br />
Anomalies<br />
<br />
 Enscript syntax highlighting: do not use the 'switch editor' mode button when trying to edit a post that has extended CODE tags in them (like  [code=baan]). Doing so will cause the editor to drop the '=baan' part which will effectively disable syntax highlighting.<br />
New Features<br />
  Product/Plugin system with over 550 'hook' locations strategically placed in the code. Allows modification and extension of vBulletin without physical alteration of the vBulletin PHP scripts.<br />
  Inline moderation allows multiple threads or posts to be have moderation actions performed without a visit to the admin or moderator control panels<br />
  Completely rewritten message editor with ability to instantly switch between standard and WYSIWYG modes<br />
  Thread title editing on forumdisplay via AJAX<br />
  Thread opening and closing on forumdisplay via AJAX<br />
  Super-Quick Reply on showthread via AJAX<br />
  Inline post edit on showthread via AJAX<br />
  Username suggestion for PM recipients and search by user via AJAX<br />
  Data manipulation APIs (Data Manager) for centralized data saving<br />
  Template History &amp; Comparison for easy tracking of changes<br />
  Database-based thread and forum read marking<br />
  MySQL Full Text Search<br />
  Additional Datastore Storage Methods<br />
  SMTP Mail Wrapper<br />
  MySQLi Wrapper<br />
  PHPDoc'd Source Code<br />
  Moderator log language abstraction<br />
  Webkit support for style manager color picker<br />
  ImageMagick 6 Support (alternative to GD)<br />
  Calendar events support start/end times<br />
  Custom avatar and profile picture resizing<br />
  Profile pictures can be saved to filesystem<br />
  Statistics ordering<br />
  Each attachment image type can be individually set to generate thumbnails or not<br />
  Each attachment image type can be individually set to open in a new window or not<br />
  Moderated posts and threads do not contribute to post count until approved<br />
  Language chooser in footer<br />
  New bbcode parser now corrects invalid tag nesting to ensure valid HTML<br />
  New [attach] bbcode tag for placing attachments inline with messages<br />
  New [noparse] bbcode tag for disabling bbcode parsing within<br />
  Word wrap excludes contents of PHP/CODE/HTML blocks<br />
  Search engine spider configuration via XML file<br />
  Attachment upload via URL in addition to local upload<br />
  New (hopefully foolproof) method for setting cookiepath/cookiedomain<br />
  Forum description field no longer limited to 250 characters<br />
  Completely rewritten Paid Subscriptions system - now known as Payment APIs. New support for 2checkout, Worldpay and Authorize.net<br />
  Threads containing posts awaiting moderation have indicator icon on forumdisplay for moderators<br />
  Right-to-left language support improved<br />
  Additional 'Execute SQL' auto-queries added<br />
  Image verification for sendmessage to avoid spam issues<br />
  Improved registration image verification to out-fox those pesky bots<br />
  Control panel navigation controlled by XML for easier addition of links<br />
  Upgrade system now imports styles/languages/options only after upgrade complete rather than after each script<br />
  Ability to preview signature edits<br />
  Calendar event email reminders<br />
  And of course, numerous bugs and annoyances resolved.<br />
Please report any feedback and problems in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gfasbender</div><div class="date">21st January 2006, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that the &quot;View New Posts Since Last Visit&quot; menu item under the &quot;What's New&quot; menu is gone. I've always found this very useful to browse through the new posts.<br />
<br />
Can this option be found else where, or re-instated under the &quot;What's New&quot; menu?</div></div><hr />

I was waiting for this question to pop up :) As of vBulletin v3.5 the detection mechanism of finding out whether you have unread posts has been remarkedly improved. Previously a user would only see new posts from the time he/she last visited the forum. What is new is the possibility to track back further in the past - based on database activity rather than cookie date - and allow you to actually see all unread posts since the last 60 days regardless of whether you visited the forum or not. This feature combined with the option to individually mark post read per forum (see Forum Tools &gt; Mark this forum read in the Forum View) gives each user the full power to determine when and which posts should be considered 'read' or 'seen'.<br />
<br />
So for this purpose the old New Posts Since Last Visit has been replaced by All Unread Posts. Note that the All Unread Posts screen will distinguish between truely updated threads (ie meaning there have been new posts since your last visit) and posts in threads that you simply not read at all. This is indicated by the separator text The threads below have not been updated since your last visit but still contain unread posts.<br />
<br />
On a final note: the forum can be configured to use either the old style cookie-based tracking or the new-style database-driven for 'Get New Posts'. However only one can be active at the same time and may also be only set forum-wide for all users.<br />
<br />
I'd like to hear feedback from other members to see if they perceive the new-style 'Get New Posts' as an improvement or not. I intend to make a poll on this after a while anyway.<br />

Thanks for you response about the &quot;View New Posts Since Last Visit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Although it's a 2-step process, using the &quot;All Unread Posts&quot; option under the What's New menu along with the &quot;Mark Forums Read&quot; option under the Quick Links menu, I'm able to view posts since my last visit.<br />
<br />
I'm sure others will get use to this process also, once they understand it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">30th January 2006, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps one way to make it less confusing is to rename 'All Unread Posts' into something that links closer to the previous 'View New Posts'. <br />
<br />
How about New &amp; Unread Posts?</div></div><hr />
