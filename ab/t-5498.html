<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonian</div><div class="date">13th June 2002, 07:02</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that very often when someone logs a question(particularly if a Baan user does ...versus a consultant)  and if the information is not provided, the first response generally is to find out what version of Baan the question is related too.  Can this not be associated with the user profile and show under the author's information on the column on the left of the post?  You could include a classification for each version of Baan and potentially a classification for consultants, unspecified, etc.  I always find that when reading a post, one of the first things that I consider is &quot;what version?&quot;  This would just help to possibly reduce a few unnecessary posts if the info is provided by the author's profile.<br />

Just a thought<br />

<br />
Note that the 'Baan version' is already associated with member profiles.  We discussed displaying this info in the left pane and have some code to do this.  So, we may yet end up implementing this feature.  But remember for now that you can just click the &quot;Profile&quot; icon at the base of each post to take you directly to the Members info.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
