* EFS Technology signed up for a 6 months sponsorship during the month <br />
of November. EFS Technology is sponsoring the Finance, Invoicing and <br />
Integration forum.<br />
<br />
EFS Technology brief:<br />
AutoFORM LaserNet integrates with BAAN applications to provide a comprehensive <br />
suite of output and document management solutions.  The easy to use Windows <br />
based tools enable you to dramatically reduce the time, effort and cost of <br />
managing BAAN output, without making complex and expensive changes to the <br />
core application.<br />
- Output Management: The easy to use, GUI interface allows you to transform <br />
your output into effective, attractive, laser printable documents incorporating <br />
logos, barcodes and specific customer data - without re&#8212;programming the BAAN <br />
application. Re&#8212;pagination, International date, number and language formatting <br />
supplied as standard. Design elements and layouts are created in MS Publisher <br />
or similar allowing you to delegate this time consuming task outside of the <br />
IT department.<br />
- Document Distribution. Use your network, intranet/extranet in addition to <br />
automated fax, email and XML to deliver documents directly to the recipient, <br />
as soon as they are generated.<br />
- Document Management. Web browser document retrieval and viewing system to <br />
equip your staff and potentially customers and suppliers with fast on-screen <br />
access to document copies so that they can complete their tasks in less time <br />
and at less cost.  Encompasses COLD &amp; SCANNING imaging archiving technologies.<br />
- Process Management. Tailored work flow solutions help you to eliminate time <br />
and laborious manual processing costs and delays, associated with the <br />
processing of purchase invoices, invoice queries, purchase order <br />
authorization and providing proof of delivery copies.<br />

2) Upcoming site changes<br />
<br />
I am contemplating replacing the rather ailing Wiki by a full blown CMS solution <br />
in the near future. As things stand now, the likely candidate will be vbDrupal. <br />
vbDrupal will do away with the need of having the register for both Forum and<br />
Wiki separately and will offer some other nice features like blogs, links<br />
directory etc. I am aiming to have the migration ready by the end of Q1, 2008.<br />
Updates and more news on this will be posted on the forum.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
3) Did you know?<br />
<br />
That the Baanboard forum now has a Google-integrated search engine besides its<br />
own internal search feature? The Google search results will be displayed within<br />
the forum layout rather than a separate Google page.<br />
<br />
