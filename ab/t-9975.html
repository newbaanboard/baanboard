Might there be a way to get a simple spell checker on the submit screen?  I know that my spelling is horrible and I normally end up copying the entire text and dropping it in a new mail post to check the spelling before submitting it here.<br />
<br />
I find that when posts have spelling mistakes, I worry more about that then the content...  and that is a shame.  <br />
<br />
Not looking for the whole thing with squiggles and grammar checking, but maybe just to identify the words that the system does not know in red when we preview the post?<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.<br />

Cheers,<br />

Good idea and something we would love to have ourselves. Some of the earlier versions of the vbulletin software had a built-in spell checker but that feature was ultimatily abandoned as it relied on a free online spell checking service which has disappeared in the mean time. Nevertheless, there is nothing from preventing us to look for alternatives. We'll stick your suggestion on our to-do list and see if it's technically feasible.</div></div><hr />
