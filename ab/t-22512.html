<br />
We have a new entry in the Language forums (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=64) section! On popular request I decided to introduce a forum supporting discussions in Thai language (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=74). <br />
<br />
Thai uses a different character set than English and by default posts and threads in the Thai forum will look like gibberish to most members. To support the use of Thai diacritics 2 new settings have been introduced in the User Control Panel (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/usercp.php?):<br />
<br />
  First of all, the option Forum language in the Options (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/profile.php?do=editoptions) screen now supports both US English and Thai. If you want to be able to read the Thai diacritics you must switch your language setting to 'Thai'<br />
  Secondly, access to the Thai language forum (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=74) is by default restricted to read-only. If you wish make posts in the forum you must first become a member of the public group Thai language users. By joining this group you will gain read-write access to the Thai language forum. Joining the group can be done from the Group memberships (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/profile.php?do=editusergroups) screen in your UserCP.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Note that only the content of member posts can be made in Thai. The user interface remains to be in English.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the new discussions! (for those who can read them  ;))</div></div><hr />
