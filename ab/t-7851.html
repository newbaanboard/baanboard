<br />
Just some additional words on the new feature we have introduced yesterday on the board. You may have read already about it in the other thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?threadid=7844) but here's the story behind it.<br />
<br />
We have decided to put up a page (Offerings (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/bboffers.php?s=&amp;action=show_offerings_listing)) where vendors can offer their services/products to our members at a discounted price. So this is truly a way to make your Baanboard membership - albeit free - pay off in a financial way. <br />
<br />
For every offer you will be able to read some basic information on the product/service and for those who would like to receive more information - including purchasing details - are giving the choice to receive an email with these details.<br />
<br />
For the moment, we have the educational offer from OST-USA but in the future we hope to expand the range of offers to other companies and products/services. In any case, if you decide to make a purchase do not forgot to mention that you are a Baanboard member so you can benefit from the agreed discount.</div></div><hr />
