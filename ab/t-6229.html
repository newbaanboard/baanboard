It's exactly one year since we opened the shop. And what a success it has proven to be! With a current user count of +2200 and post count of +12000, it has been proven without doubt that a strong Baan community exists and a good communication channel was much needed.<br />
<br />
On behalf of myself and James, may I thank all the people who have contributed in making this board the success it is: the moderators and all registered members.<br />
<br />
Let's hope our second year will be as successful as the first. We keep working hard on making Baanboard a nicer and better place!<br />
<br />
Have a glass of champage on us! :)<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But why cannot I find this special day in the Calendar? ... There have been some rumours about a treat for all.... did I miss it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 00:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Doh, I forget ther calendar :) I added the event. As to the treat, well that was supposed to the publication of the programmer's manual though that was released a bit before the birthday. Rest assured we keep working hard to provide our members with more of these presents :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dbinderbr</div><div class="date">2nd October 2002, 07:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratulations for all Board Masters and active members from brazilian Baan community !!! You are doing an excellent job.<br />
<br />
I know it´s not easy to happens and it could be very expensive for everyboady, but, some day in the future, it would be funny to make an international meeting with BaanBoard members somewhere like Netherlands, the &quot;Mother Land&quot;, for the first meeting.... :) <br />
<br />
Or somewhere like Germany, during the next World Cup, so besides the meeting I´d be able to watch Brazil wins another cup... (just joking !! :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">2nd October 2002, 10:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratulations to all BB masters, moderators and members from faraway Russia :) Five years ago we had  no baan but  now we have quiet a lot. BB helps us to feel free here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">3rd October 2002, 13:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I'm waiting for the first BaanBoard'OVision song contest! ;) <br />
<br />
Anyone for Baaneoke (which is basically Baan related songs, such as the Beach Boys 'Baan Baan Baan, Baan Barely Ran') <br />
<br />
Ah memories of the 2002 BaanUsers UK conference come flooding back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">3rd October 2002, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a job for the Capitol Steps. <br />
<br />
(And all this time I thought Baaneoke was Annie's younger sister who couldn't shoot straight!)<br />
