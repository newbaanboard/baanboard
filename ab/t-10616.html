<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 00:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, here it is! You can finally post in your native language right here: Baanboard Language Forums (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=64). At least when your mother tongue is one of the following:<br />
 German (Deutsch)<br />
 French (Francais)<br />
 Dutch (Nederlands)<br />
 Italian (Italiano)<br />
 Spanish (Espagnol)<br />
<br />
Please read the updated Board Rules (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/faq.php?faq=bb_faq#faq_bb_disclaimer_privacy) before posting.<br />
<br />
A second new feature is the presence of the language translation box below each thread. It will allow you to translate a piece of text between the most commonly used languages (Sorry no Dutch! :(). You must have javascript enabled for this to work properly.<br />
<br />
Finally, a call for help. We would like to have moderators for the non-English forums. Not moderators in the 'classic' meaning (solving problems, keeping order) but rather people who are able to understand the non-English posts and who can take action when 'unwanted' posts occur.<br />
<br />
So if you are interested in becoming a moderator for the German, French, Dutch, Italian or Spanish forum, then let us know!<br />
 Also if you can help us write a small announcement in German, French, Italian or Spanish, please let us know.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

I'll take a stab at the german language forum - I'll just have to dig up a german keyboard somewhere for the umlaute<br />

Thanks for that. I will put you up for the German forum! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Err... when following the link to the new board rules page I'm getting the following message:<br />
<br />
While trying to retrieve the URL: http://bbinterface.php/? <br />

The following error was encountered: <br />

This means that: <br />

 Check if the address is correct.<br />

what could be the problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for that. Fixed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 10:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Pat, you sure are fast!  Wish some well known company starts listening to their customers like you do...<br />
<br />
Didn't like the InterTran (http://www.tranexp.com:2000/linking.shtml) solution?  It has Dutch, you know!  Not that we personally need it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I tested the Intertran solution. Problem is that they work with translation quota's so that after translating a couple of pages you get a 'quota exceeded' message. Unless of course you pay for their services. But Altavista is free :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 11:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, point taken!  Sorry for bringing it up :o without testing it.<br />
<br />
I would have remove the post, but that would remove the compliment as well, and that still stands! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">No problem Nico, I am looking forward to your first Dutch post ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, who told you I would be posting in Dutch?  If I try, I'll probably be thrown of the board, since the standard of my Dutch is bad!  You'll probably call it dunglikaans (would be Dutch, but part in English, and hey, is that an Afrikaans word in between there?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunglikaans will be fine. But maybe a tip for Altavista to add it as a choice to their translator :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 11:57</div></div><div class="posttext">No worries Nico, if you can talk tools then that's fine - any other attempt at communicating is secondary to that. Regards from the German forum!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose we're getting a bit off-topic, but, Rupert, would that then become dunglikatools? :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
my compliments Pat, that thing sure did go fast! <br />
If you want, I can write a little announcemnt in german, since I´m sitting right in front of a german keyboard. Just gotta know, if it should be a new thread or a post to this one?<br />
Is that OK with you Rupert or do you still want to do the job? Gimme a short message, pls.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Bart,<br />
<br />
Yes please go ahead! I assume you are Dutch speaking so you can have a look at the announcement in the 'Nederlandstalig Forum' and try to have something similar for the German forum. Please post it in a new thread in the German forum :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bart Kerkman</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 12:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pat,<br />
<br />
have a look in the german forum. Hope it´s fine like that. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Bart,<br />
<br />
It's great! Thanks a lot :)<br />
<br />
Let's roll on the German posts! :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Good job!<br />
<br />
Pat, sorry about suggesting InterTran.  Just to test (:D) I translated Bart's post to English with both engines, and AltaVista is much better!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bart Kerkman</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! <br />
<br />
As I just saw, rupertb has posted an announcement also, I guess the rules are quiet clear now for german users!  ;) <br />

How about a portuguese forum ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">6th July 2003, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pedro,<br />
<br />
Good idea but we want to stick with our current 5 forums and see how well they will do. Then we can evaluate the experiment and expand on it if it becomes a success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pedromrs</div><div class="date">6th July 2003, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pat,<br />
<br />
Sounds fine to me. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">7th July 2003, 03:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope these new forums will not result in the uni-language english speaking people missing out on valuble posts. <br />
<br />
I can understand that many people may prefer to use thier mother tongue, but unless these posts are translated to english quickly the audience for these will be much reduced.     <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Terry, I agree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand your concerns. This is exactly why started talking about these forums more than a year ago and they only happened now. However, we do feel the good will ultimately outweigh the bad. If people are in dire need of assistance then they do well to post their issue in the traditional English-speaking forums. Alternatively, there is a chance to do the same in their native tongue. And the fact that alot of people *do* so is/was the successful Kai's Forum for german speakers for example. Which is now merged into Baanboard by the way! See: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12091</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok explains a lot.</div></div><hr />
