Hi Yogesh,<br />
<br />
This is community of volunteers which means all help is driven by a healthy dose of goodwill. We have considered a &quot;chat room&quot; in the past before but that idea was cast aside quickly because we want to able to re-use potential answers and solutions in the future as well. Please also do not expect &quot;experts&quot; to be online whenever you think you need them. We are not Infor support ;-)</div></div><hr />
