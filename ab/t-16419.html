<br />
Summer holidays are nearly over and we have also passed our 3rd birthday for the website! Time does fly when you get older :D<br />
<br />
For those keeping an eye on the numbers you will also be happy to see that we toppled the threshold of 50,000 posts.. Up to 100,000 now!</div></div><hr />

Its changed a lot in look and style since those dim and distant days but always continues to teach and entertain. <br />

Now if only I could sit down long enough to update the screensaver!</div></div><hr />
