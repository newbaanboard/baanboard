I am pretty sure your threads are still there. We never delete posts unless they violate the posting rules. Most likely, the reason why you are not seeing your post in the forums views is because of the forum default view window (see attachment). This option determines from how many days ago you can see threads. Any threads older than that date are 'cut-off' - not shown - but they are still there. To view older threads you can simply choose a bigger view window or select the threads from the beginning which will show all threads.<br />
<br />
The default view window setting can be overruled by 2 custom settings in your User Control Panel:<br />
<br />
UserCP &gt; Edit Options &gt; Default Thread View<br />
<br />
- and -<br />
<br />
UserCP &gt; Edit Options &gt; Default Posts per Thread<br />
<br />
Other ways to retrieve your posts are using the general Search option or using the Search button that appears at the bottom in each post [profile - pm - search - buddy]. Clicking this button will show you ALL posts from the member who made that post.</div></div><hr />
