<br />
Time to bid goodbye to this board as I will not be able to contribute anymore.<br />
<br />
I had worked with Baan support for quite some years and have now moved to a different platform. its not ethical for me to talk abt my product knowledge also my present employer may some issues with it. <br />
<br />
Learnt a lot from friends and could help lot of other customer with some real creative ideas. <br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone for making these &quot;baan&quot; years so interesting. <br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Ashish</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry to see you go although I don't understand why you should suddenly throw away all your past knowledge now that you are working for another vendor/platform. Besides anyone is a free agent in his/her free time right?<br />
<br />
As to ethics: um, surely that doesn't stroke with your homepage in your profile?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">29th September 2004, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">This seems to be the standard more and more. I have been out of the baan industry now for 2 years. I still visit the site, but feel that I cannot give anything as I am so out of the loop and have moved onto other things. <br />
<br />
As baan seems to be replaced in more and more sites, the actual consultants and users are having less and less to do with the product.<br />
<br />
I would like to add though, that I am currently working towards my MCSE and MCDBA, so maybe I'll be able to help out soon with those nasty little SQL problems again!<br />
<br />
I feel the same as Pat, in that, in your free time, you should be allowed to participate in anything you feel, even if it goes against your employer. After all, they only own you for 8 hours of the day. If you have something to say, or something to give, then please do. <br />
<br />
You never know when that person you just helped, could help you.</div></div><hr />
