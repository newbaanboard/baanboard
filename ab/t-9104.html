It seems we are getting hit by one or more spam attacks from users signing up and posting messages all over the place. It has happened twice so far and all related messages have been removed. However, if you do see such messages not being reacted upon, then don't hesitate to email us (boardmaster@baanboard.com). Removing these messages may inconvenience you if you are receiving threads notifications by email as the referred link will not work anymore. Let's hope this idiotry will cease soon.</div></div><hr />

Yes, unfortunately we cannot help that. The only thing we can do is to stop the spammer from posting as soon as he/she is spotted, remove the posts and ban his credentials/IP's. By that time, the email notifications are already sent out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
This morning we received a large amount of spam messages on our message forum<br />
http://www.baanboard.com from somebody apparently using your email server.<br />
This person registered himself on our forum as 'celebguy_dv' (see attached<br />
picture).<br />
<br />
It seems that your email server has been blacklisted as open relay server<br />
before: http://samspade.org/t/lookat?a=207.103.102.78<br />
<br />
If you care about people abusing your infrastructure and other people's<br />
websites, then I urge you to close and/or secure your mail server.<br />
<br />
Note: we have banned your C-class subnet for the obvious reason.</div></div><hr />
