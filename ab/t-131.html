I seem to vaguely remember that warehousing used to be part of distribution in previous versions, maybe that is why. Still, time marches on and so does Baan.<br />

Maybe just a mention of the wh package?</div></div><hr />

That's a good remark! As - we admins - are more technical Baan people, we are not that familiar with the other parts of Baan so we depend on people like yourself to tell us where the gaps are. I have already adapted the Distribution forum to also include warehousing topics. Please feel free to post your question!</div></div><hr />
