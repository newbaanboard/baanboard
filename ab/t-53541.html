0) Introduction<br />
<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
With a good bit of delay we are pushing out the first newsletter of this year <br />
to all all members. 2008 has been a busy and eventful year so far with the <br />
site undergoing major changes (more about that below). Many of us are<br />
finishing their summer holidays around this time and this presents a good<br />
opportunity to send out an update of what has been going so far in 2008.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1) Sponsor news<br />
<br />
a] Since our last newsletter, Baanboard has managed to attract 3 new sponsors:<br />
<br />
OST (Open System Technologies) signed up for a 12 months front page sponsorship.<br />
<br />
About OST:<br />
What do you look for in an IT partner? Brilliant solutions? Of course. But how <br />
about brilliant solutions coming from friendly, likable people? That’s our modus <br />
operandi at OST. And it’s what’s made our last few years such a whirlwind of <br />
growth. Like having Inc. 5,000 put us on their 2007 list of fastest growing <br />
private companies. And being recently named to CRN’s prestigious FastGrowth100 <br />
for two years running. So come on in, kick the tires, and take a look around. <br />
We’ve got lots of very sharp folks standing by to take the stress out of your <br />
most complex IT needs. You’ll be glad you stopped by at http://www.ostusa.com<br />
<br />
Ometa signed up for a 6 months sponsorship. Ometa is sponsoring the &quot;Pages &amp; <br />
Stories&quot; forum.<br />
<br />
About Ometa:<br />
Ometa is specialized in Enterprise Content Management (ECM). We perform ECM <br />
studies which result in a full content analysis study, the design of an ECM <br />
road map, the selection of the appropriate applications and the implementation <br />
of content centric applications.<br />
Ometa designs solutions using Microsoft SharePoint Technology to capture, <br />
manage, publish and archive unstructured (e-mails, documents, presentations,…) <br />
and structured (by ERP) business data. Our experience in ECM resulted in the <br />
development of components extending the standard SharePoint functions.<br />

ESS (Edinburgh System Support) signed up for a 6 months front page sponsorship.<br />

2) Ometa customer case<br />
<br />
Heijmans Infrastructure uses a Time Registration Portal in MS SharePoint <br />
integrated with their Baan application.<br />
<br />
For Heijmans Infrastructure, a division of the Heijmans Group (largest construc-<br />
tion company of The Netherlands -11600 employees), time registration is crucial. <br />
It is one of the most important elements to measure project progress and costs. <br />
Until recent project managers filled out time sheets in MS Excel and a central <br />
admin unit entered the data in their Baan application. Now Ometa has developed <br />
a Time Registration Portal on top of their Baan application. The MS Excel time <br />
sheet is omitted as the project managers directly use the portal to make the <br />
time entries. It results in higher efficiency and data quality.<br />
This is only one example of the generic framework Ometa has developed to read, <br />
insert and update data in your Baan application via SharePoint Portals. You can <br />
now combine the robustness of your Baan application with the concepts of <br />
MS SharePoint (e.g. user friendliness, integration with MS Office, approval <br />
workflows, etc.).<br />
Ometa is specialized in Enterprise Content Management and develops solutions <br />
to optimize your business processes using Microsoft SharePoint Technology <br />

3) Forum &amp; CMS integration<br />
<br />
If you have not visited baanboard.com for a while, you may find find that a new<br />
visit to our site will be a worthwhile spending of your time. On the 1st of June<br />
we released a major upgrade. The never-popular Wiki was replaced with a full-<br />
blown CMS solution (Drupal) that integrates tightly with the forum. Some of main<br />
new features and/or advantages of the new site release are:<br />
<br />
* re-designed front page (portal style) with a context-sensitive navigation panel<br />
* single sign-on for the entire site<br />
* individual member blogs<br />
* advanced commenting system that leverages from a set of new forums <br />
  (under the &quot;CMS - Forum Integration&quot; category)<br />
* dedicated job market place<br />
* power search capabilities that include keyword &amp; category search<br />
<br />
There are many more new and interesting features that you may want to discover.<br />
We recommend that you browse around the site and take a look at the new Baanboard<br />
FAQs: http://www.baanboard.com/faq<br />
<br />
For more information on the new site release, please refer to this FAQ: <br />
http://www.baanboard.com/whatsnew<br />
<br />

Policy. They can be consulted at following URLs: <br />

<br />
4) 7th birthday!<br />
<br />
Last month baanboard.com celebrated its 7th birthday. With 7 years under our <br />
belt we have seen and learned a great deal of things. The continued success of <br />
the site sets a positive signal for another 7 good years. <br />
<br />
So where do we go from here? With the arrival of the integrated CMS/Forum<br />
integration (see above) baanboard.com can more and better information to the <br />
Baan community as a whole. In any case our forum will remain the pivotal <br />
component of our community site. But some of the things that may came to pass<br />
are for example integrations of our Baan site/user groups into baanboard.com. <br />
Ideas and thoughts, feedback and criticism are always welcome on our forum or<br />
privately at boardmaster@baanboard.com <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
5) Call for new forum moderators<br />
<br />
As a regular habit, we launch a request for new forum moderators. Moderators<br />
play an important and visible part in the well functioning of our forum. If you<br />
are interested in helping out by becoming either a moderator or super-moderator,<br />
then send an e-mail to boardmaster@baanboard.com<br />
<br />
Note that we do require a very regular presence on the site of super-moderators! <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
6) Holidays!<br />
<br />
Your boardmaster is going on holidays from Sept 5th until Sept 21st. During this<br />
period I will not have access to the site but will be able to read my baanboard<br />
mail on an occasional basis. Please contact me on boardmaster@baanboard for any<br />
urgent and/or important business.<br />
<br />
