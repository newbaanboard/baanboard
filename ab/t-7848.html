Some of us are very new to Baan and, although the BaanBoard is very helpful, reading some of the threads is like reading badly worn ancient Egyptian scripts! (I guess!)....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to Baan I'd say. I am not sure what you mean by 'beginner's area' so can you elaborate on that a little bit more? What can of topics would have to be discussed here? How do you define 'beginner's' or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bilbo Baggins</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 11:59</div></div><div class="posttext">It may be easier if I go through some of the problems I've had ..!<br />
<br />
(1) How Baan works - at a high level.<br />
<br />
(2) Finding documentation on Baan generally - e.g. &quot;Dummy's Guide to Baan&quot;<br />
<br />
(3) Finding documentation on specific topics - e.g. Exchange.<br />
<br />
(4) If it's possible to do certain tasks - without knowing what section it may be in. <br />
<br />
(5) Advice on what and what not to do!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am afraid there's no 'Dummies' Guide for Baan'. However there's nothing stopping us from building one ourselves. This is a project we are working on. It will allow people to ask and answer questions in a FAQ and/or free-style kind of way. A beginner's section could a very useful part of that indeed. So bear with us for a while longer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">28th November 2002, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Do not hesitate to post your beginners questions and to keep asking when you do not understand yet. There is a limit to anyone's patience, but you will only become familiar with baan by asking, trying, studying etc. And if one will loose his/her patience then most likely someone else will be good enough to continue on the thread.<br />
<br />
And if you read through threads and think you do not quite understand what is being said, then you can add your doubts/questions in a post.</div></div><hr />
