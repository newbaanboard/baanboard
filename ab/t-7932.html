I have a suggestion: could you split the recruiters part in Europe/USA/Other? A lot of posts are unclear about what they need, it makes selecting easier</div></div><hr />

We will not  do this simply because the volume of posts is way too small for that. If we would have 10 new job posting each day, it would be worthwhile considering but not with 10 posts a month. In the accompanying sticky post in the forum it clearly states to give as much detail as possible about the job, location, rate etc. It's in the recruiter's own interest to be as complete as possible.</div></div><hr />
