But it so happens that if Im trying some suggestion from Baanboard on my Baan application and when I come back it has timed me out. And I have to re-login which is kinda irritating.<br />
<br />
I also see that the max no of users logged onto the site was arnd 45 which not much. So if we can increase the timeout to say about 60 mins it shouldnt affect the performance of the site.<br />
<br />
Not a matter of life and death but just a suggestion.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
- Automatically login when you return to the site? (uses cookies)<br />
- Browse the board with cookies<br />
<br />
Increasing the session timeout only really affects the 'mark posts read' mechanism. If you browse the board with cookies and auto-login then your problem should never happen.</div></div><hr />
