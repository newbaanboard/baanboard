<br />
when logging in to baanboard.com the number of new threads and posts is displayed on the top of the page.<br />
Recently I noticed that the link 'View New Posts' does not show the number of threads as displayed. Is there any reason for that?<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

<br />
I am not sure that I understand you correctly. The 'View New Posts' option will display all threads where a new post has occurred since your last visit. However there can be more than one new post in a thread. That is way the number for threads are different than for posts.<br />
<br />
With hindsight I think I can understand what you mean though. If some these posts happen in one of our 'private' forums they will show still show up in the new thread/post count but in the 'View New Posts' result you will not be able to see them.<br />
<br />
I will have a look if we can correct that without impactint the database queries too much on the home page.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your reply. <br />
If there are private (or hidden for 'normal' users) forums everythings is all right. It's not necessary to change it. Actually I just wanted to understand how the software works.</div></div><hr />
