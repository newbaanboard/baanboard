2) New forum for Thai Users<br />
<br />
Since a couple of weeks Baanboard has been facilitating a separate forum for<br />
Thai users allowing discussions to take place in the Thai native language. <br />
With the aid of some configuration changes each Baanboard member will be able<br />
to participate in Thai-language topics. Following changes are required to your <br />
user settings:<br />
<br />
a) add yourself to the public usergroup 'Thai language' from the list of group<br />
memberships (UserCP &gt; Group Memberships): <br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/profile.php?do=editusergroups<br />
b) select 'Thai' as default forum language in your user options (UserCP &gt; Edit <br />

<br />
3) Did you know?<br />
<br />
Did you know that Baanboard.com forum allows you to 'rate' both forum threads <br />
and forum members? <br />
<br />
Threads can be rated by using the 'Rate Thread' shortcut that<br />
you can find in the little menubar above the thread text when viewing a<br />
thread. Threads ratings may go from 0 to 5 'stars' and help other members<br />
to identify top quality discussions. Threads may also be sorted on their ratings<br />
by clicking on the 'Rating' column header in the forum view.<br />
<br />
Apart from rating threads you may also with to 'reward' a member for his or her<br />
outstanding contribution. By doing so you will add to his 'repuation' which is<br />
shown as little coloured gem (default is dark green) inside the user info<br />
header of a user's post or in his/her public profile. A user may receive both<br />
positive and/or negative comments but also has the option to disable the public<br />
display of his/her current reputation. Visit your last received reputation<br />
comments at:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/usercp.php?<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
4) Spam List<br />
<br />
The popular email address 'boardmaster@baanboard.com' receives on average<br />
several hundreds e-mail messages a day of which 97% is spam. Therefore we have<br />
introduced a domain-based blocking filter on the main @baanboard.com e-mail <br />
addresses that will hopefully make both our mailbox and blacklist more <br />
manageable again.<br />
A list of blocked e-mail domains will be published in the Wiki on a regular <br />
basis at http://www.baanboard.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BaanboardSpamList. <br />
If your e-mail address falls under one of these domains then it is highly <br />
unlikely that you will be able to contact us through this e-mail address. <br />
In that case use another address if you require to contact us or else use the <br />
private messaging feature on the forum.<br />
