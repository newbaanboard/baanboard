I quite like the idea of getting and receiving info from other sources... But how about making the site wap available? <br />
<br />
We did think of WAP - but I really feel its not that suitable or appropriate for this type of site. <br />
<br />
Remember that you can synchronise this (or any site) with any PDA.  I have a Sony Clie (Palm OS) and use &quot;Avant-Go&quot; for syncing baanboard.  Basically you can port the whole site for offline reading on the PDA.  It works very well.  And if your PDA has internet access then even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">What about an offshoot of the site then with a WAP based glossary of terms, tips and solutions, a kind of 'HitchHikers Guide to Baan'<br />
<br />
Would this be of any interest to the users, it could be accessed via the site but also downloaded to your PDA and available as WAP and have a collection of all those bits that you can never quite get your hands on when needed....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">There would be a lot of manual work involved. How much money would you have veil for a WAP service? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever the word Baan comes up it always comes down to time and money.... Ah, that explains consultants then!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Just splitted this thread off for clarity.<br />

Would you like to have my expense and time/effort list for baanboard.com? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey mate, you know its just a laugh. Many of us appreciate the work put into the board (and some would love to be a bit more involved!)...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone who wants to help, drop me a note, my co-ordinates are pretty well known :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">9th April 2002, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll have a look into the possibilty and requirements if you'd like, after all I always fancied being a sort of 'HitchHikers' reporter.</div></div><hr />
