<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">13th August 2002, 04:11</div></div><div class="posttext">This solution first appeared on Baanfans on July 19, 1999 at 04:23:11 EST. It works only with Unix print queues and not with BWPrint (either Unix or Windows).<br />

 <br />
&lt;h1&gt;&quot;Page of&quot; using Barcode-Functionality&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
<br />
A completly other way of printing the number of pages is to use Barcode-Functionality. <br />
The Barcode-Feature (Warning : Works only for UNIX-Printers) is in fact a API-Interface for<br />
printing. You can merge everything you want to an existing spool. And the merging ist done<br />
after Baan has createed the whole printing, so Baan also knows the total amount of pages.<br />
&lt;p&gt;<br />
I tried my example with an Easy-SQL and it works really fine. <br />
&lt;p&gt;<br />
In short the example works like that:<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Before printing I generate a unique Spool number and print it (!!) on the report in<br />
a field, which is connected to a Barcode<br />
&lt;li&gt;At the end of printing I write the unique number and the number of pages to an ASCII-File<br />
&lt;li&gt;In the filter-Program of Baan (which puts the correct Escape-Sequences to a spool) I take the <br />
Barcode-Script (which gets the unique number as parameter) and read the corresponding <br />
number of pages. Instead of a barcode i merge the number of pages in the Spool - Output<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&gt; there we are !!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;<br />
The greatest problem is not getting the Page - number, but managing the unique numbers.<br />
&lt;p&gt;<br />
&lt;h2&gt; How to use the example&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Print in the header of your report something like &quot;Page : VVVVVVV of FFFFFFFF&quot;, <br />
where FFFFFFFF is the new field <br />
(in my example &lt;i&gt;int.unique.s&lt;/i&gt; of type tcmcs.str8 and with Barcode - Type 95)<br />
Dont care of the warning : &quot;Input field not declared&quot; . &lt;b&gt;Do not declare the field as input field&lt;/b&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Warning: I think there is an error in the Baan-Barcode-API, because, when the Barcode-Field <br />
is the last field in a line the Printer-Daemon gets mad, so i added a &quot;.&quot; (= point) after the <br />
barcode-Field and everything works fine. (Note: a empty field of 1 Byte works also)<br />
&lt;li&gt;paste the code on this site to the report-script <br />
&lt;li&gt;create (once) a subdirectory under your $BSE_TMP-folder named &quot;printing&quot;. Make sure, that <br />
everyone has accessrights for this directory. <br />
&lt;li&gt;for each Baan-Printer(device), you have to connect the printer to a Baan- Printer-information-File<br />
(see &quot;technical manual&quot; in the online help). Normally every UNIX-printer is <br />
already connected to a Printer-Driver<br />
&lt;li&gt;for each (unix-)printer you want to work with this feature you have to change <br />
the printer driver file ($BSE/lib/printinf/.....), so that it contains a link to a <br />
barcode-directory (there must be a line &quot;barcodedir=xxxxxxx,&quot;; dont forget the comma)<br />
&lt;li&gt;In the barcode-directory ($BSE/lib/barcode/xxxxxx; xxxxx = name of the barcode-Directory) <br />
create the shellscript (Name type95)<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Report-Script :&lt;/h2&gt;<br />

&lt;hr&gt;<br />
I have to admit : I'm not very strong in shell-Scripting. For my Sun it works fine, but<br />
I suppose for other UNIXES you have to change something on the script. I'm sure someone <br />
could do this script in a better way.<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
Make sure, that the shell-Script is executable !!<br />
&lt;p&gt;<br />
Make sure, that the 2 ASCII-Files in the directory &quot;printing&quot; <br />
(and the directory itself) are accessible (UNIX-rights)<br />
&lt;p&gt;<br />
In case of error : Check the logfile ($BSE/log/log.filter6.1)<br />
<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;<br />
The number for uniqueness ist 8 digits long, so I dont think, there will a be<br />
a problem, but feel free to increment the size<br />
&lt;p&gt;<br />
Clear the file with the page numbers every month (or every weekend). <br />

<br />
Can you explain how to do this in simpler terms.<br />
If I am using Windows, can i use this method?<br />

Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am researching this topic: &quot;printing page x of y&quot;  in Baan ERP LN 6.1 <br />
I had reviewed this two important threads about this topic:<br />
a)  Vamsi  -   Kevin Brock's solution.   Febrero de 2002<br />
b)  Vamsi  -   Jo Büche's solution.      12th August 2002,<br />
<br />
Both oriented a Baan installed in a Unix S.O. <br />
There are good job in these solutions.  <br />
Also I saw that these threads are of many years ago.  <br />
<br />
I want to know  if there are an advance or upgrade in a generic o standard solution for this topic useful in windows or unix severs  for Baan V or Baan LN. <br />
 <br />

The best I have heard was there was a forms package that could be installed that would do this.  I do not recall what the name was, but I do remember the cost was high.  <br />
<br />
Also please only post once. Here is the other thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=1079) gerardo refered to in the post.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garias</div><div class="date">27th February 2009, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Mark  thanks for your answer. <br />

Hello Everybody:<br />
<br />
I was working yesterday and today in a solution. <br />
- I delevoped a simple DLL  with only a external function.<br />
Features:<br />
<br />
- You don´t have to pass parameters to this function. <br />
- Only have to put the function in the after.program section of your report script<br />
- And of course to put *GA* in the layout where you want that the total page  number appear. As you can see <br />
max a 9999 total pages because *GA* are four characters.<br />
- This solution is for WIndows and Unix Baan Server. No matter in which S.O Server   is installed Baan. <br />
- At the present time the solution is for Infor  LN 6.1. But I supposed that it could be work in previous versions. <br />
- It function don´t have to process the report two times. only one time. <br />
- You don´t have to put any additional conversion program in the device.<br />
- I have tested it with a Windows printer (BW) and with some customized reports. (I am going to test with more devices..) <br />
<br />
If you are interesting I may send you, by now, the DLL object as a &quot;black box&quot; to test it.  When I finished it I could put it here.<br />
<br />
A more complex case:         <br />
         When you print a report with a range of documents <br />
         And you get some independent documents (e.g. invoices, orders) in <br />
         the same report (spooler) , and you have independent page numeration for every <br />
         document. And you want to print an independent total page number for every one<br />
         document. <br />
<br />
         The actual version of my dll don´t cover this last case. But I am going to work in this case. <br />
<br />
<br />
That´s all <br />
<br />

Did you had a chance to post your &quot;Single pass: Page x of y&quot; library?<br />

I think that it will be a great tool.<br />
