I've got two companies one is logistic and one &quot;logistic - finance&quot;, so the second one contain CodeDefinition for the first one also.<br />
I can send CodeDefinition BODs out for finance company and I need do the same for the first one, the logistic (due to an integration) ... I can't. So since they are using the same BODs I would like to create a copy of them, so I'm asking how can I do that in ION, receiving BOD from LN, create a copy, transform one for creating &quot;logistic&quot; logical-id and send them both to the endpoint application. Do you think is this a correct approch and is it feasible ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">27th May 2020, 09:15</div></div><div class="posttext">That is not the right approach. There are many CodeDefinitions, the type is specified with the ListID. Some of these exist in logistic companies and some exist in finance companies. In the integration you will need 3 connection points. 1 for the LN log company, 1 for the fin company and 1 for the receiving application. From both LN companies you can publish the SyncCodeDefinition. As the receiving application is probably only interested in a few ListIDs, you can restrict the publishing in LN with session tcbod0520m000.<br />

thanks for replay. That’s the problem. By Finance cmp I can create Flexible and Fixed dimension definition and related mappings for publishing CodeDefinition BODs BUT when I change to Logistic company, configuration is not possible because it say “cmp is not financial company” and when I’m going to publish the BODs (which is take from his Finance cmp) I can select which ones but when I’m going to process and I’m choosing to display results, nothing happens … so that’s why I would like to copy the Finance BODs for Logistic.<br />
Do you think something is mess up in BODs configuration for Logistic company?<br />
Run session tcbod0520m000 say  session not found.<br />
Thanks.<br />
Marco.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">27th May 2020, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The tcbod0520m000 solution is delivered with KB 2096878.<br />
You should not try to setup the financial data in the logistic company. So you did define it in the fin comp. So that is good. The problem is that the data is not published from the fin company to ION? Is the fin company defined as connection point in ION? Are there active routings for the connectionpoint? You run tfbia0200m00 and there nothing happens? Hope you did select the Mode as 'Publish'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marco.meli</div><div class="date">27th May 2020, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">indeed it say it is not possible to configure those parameters in logistic, it's ok. Yes, publishing CodeDefintion BODs works for finance company. <br />
Now I'm in logistic cmp and I want to publish CodeDefinition BODs from it, because I need they comes into endpoint application with logistic “logical-id” element. At the end, I suppose they would be the same, so in the endpoint application I should have equal CodeDefinition BODs elements for each company.<br />
The problem is when I publish those BODs in logistic, no error has been raised but neither BODs comes out. In ION this logistic company is configured has the finance company.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">27th May 2020, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;because I need they comes into endpoint application with logistic “logical-id” element&quot;<br />
To me this is the wrong assumption. In my view the receiving application should not worry about the sending Logical ID. So what is what you need at the receiving side?<br />
I would say your configuration at the LN side is good and the issue needs to be resolved in the receiving application.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marco.meli</div><div class="date">27th May 2020, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">The receiving application is another Infor application called EAM and it takes the LogicalID for mapping those BODs to the right destination company:<br />
e.g.<br />
&lt;LogicalID&gt;lid://infor.ln.smboneln01_200&lt;/LogicalID&gt; tooks last three chars to address this BOD to company 200<br />
so I would like receive also<br />
&lt;LogicalID&gt;lid://infor.ln.smboneln01_224&lt;/LogicalID&gt; to address to company 224 but this is not possible, because 224 (has 200 as a finance) is just logistic. <br />
Are you able to publish CodeDefinition bods from your logistic company ? I think only if the company is Both …</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">27th May 2020, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't remember the details on how EAM handles BOD. I thought they are looking to the accounting entity value. If you only have 1 finance company then you could define the same accounting entity value in both the LN companies. If that is not the resolution than it needs to be discussed with someone more experienced in EAM and especially on how BODs are handled. Did you raise this as an incident already to Infor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marco.meli</div><div class="date">27th May 2020, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">ARijke, thanks for your support , I'll open an incident for that and back to you.<br />
Thanks.<br />
