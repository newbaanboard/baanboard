<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wenaymj</div><div class="date">7th October 2005, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I am using BOI Adapter 2.6 which I am using for WEB(ASP) interface with BaaN IV c4 integration. On my test web server it works fine. The test server has only one IP. But when I run it on Live Web Server it hangs up.<br />
<br />
The only difference between the server is, Live Web Server has 4 IPs and it is on IBM Blade Server. While the test server is independant and only 1 IP.<br />
<br />
Our Live server environment is as follows<br />
<br />
IP(1) -&gt; 172.27.0.150 &amp; 172.27.0.149 Which are on Public network and my IIS running on this IP only. BaaN can comunicate the web server on this IP<br />
<br />
IP(2) -&gt; 172.27.0.221 which is in Private Network and BaaN Server can comunicate to this IP also as the BaaN server is in same network also.<br />
<br />
IP(3) -&gt; 172.27.0.113 which is in Private Network and BaaN cannot communicate to this IP.<br />
<br />
Now the problem is when I run any application which uses BOI interface it sends header information &quot;Reply to = 172.27.0.113&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can see the reply on BaaN server that the information is sent but because of it sends to 172.27.0.113 (to which BaaN server cannot communicate) it hangs and the Web server cannot recieve the infomation.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help How can I change header information of BOI Adapter whiche sends at the time it is called. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
In any case, I think you should read about use of Bi-Directional Sockets. Detailed information is available in Installation and Configuration Guide<br />
for Connector for Java<br />
<br />
See attached snapshot of the part of that document</div></div><hr />
