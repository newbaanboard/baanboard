 <br />
  I would like to start the session using AFS but with UI. Is it possible in AFS to start the session with UI, by setting some environment variables like &quot;background&quot; to one etc.<br />
 My basic intension is to drive the baan sessions ie to automate the opening of session and inserting the values and saving it and closeing the session.<br />
 Do let me know is there anyway in Baan to do this.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

Usually AFS is used to process large amounts of data or minimize the number of sessions a users has to interact with.  In the case of releasing GRP Purchase orders I created a session with my own forms to confirm and transfer the GRP orders.  I do not know of a way to use AFS to move the session from foreground to background.  Maybe more info on what exactly you are trying to do may help someone come up with a solution.<br />

Hi Mark, <br />
 Actualy, my requirement is like this. Would like to automate a one process. Say i have all values related to sales order stored in a text file. Thru script, i should able to activate the session, so that user can see the session window (saler order session) got opened(this we can achieve thru 3gl function activate. Then, user wont enter any value, but thru script itself, it should read the values from text file and put those values for the field ( ie as we do stpapi.put.field in afs). But in afs, stpapi.put.field works in background mode(UI is not displayed). But for me, UI should be displayed and I should able to achieve same functionality of putting fields, and insert, delete and update the record as we do in AFS.<br />
 do let me know if I am not clear enough<br />

<br />
So my guess is it is possible to do it. But u might need to<br />
know windows GUI controls ..etc (I don't know anything...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th July 2003, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">As Nico suggested  u may need program script . AFS functions may not be required in this case.<br />
<br />
U can create a function like <br />
<br />
function tab()				<br />
{<br />
	long	event_2(EVTMAXSIZE)<br />
	evt.type(event_2) = EVTCHANGEFOCUS<br />
	evt.client.sender(event_2) = pid<br />
	evt.client.command(event_2) = 1<br />
	evt.focus.key(event_2) = KEY_TAB<br />
	if not send.event(get.pgrp(pid),event_2) then<br />
		message(&quot;Press Tab&quot;)<br />
	endif<br />
}	<br />
<br />
And call this function in before input  function of the script to automate input just after initializing the field value from text file . U need to take care of error handling of check input section.</div></div><hr />

Please complete your user profile with regards to the Baan software version, Database software and OS version. This will help other members when diagnosing your problem. <br />
<br />
I think most of us here would like to find a real good solution for this issue.<br />
<br />
Hitesh gave you a good idea. I was thinking more in the direction of using -<br />
<br />
start.session() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_starting_and_stopping_programs_start_session) and then using the funtions - put.indexed.var() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_variables_interprocess_transfer_put_indexed_var), put.var() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_variables_interprocess_transfer_put_var) to put the values into the form fields. But I couldnt figure out an option to simulate the clicking of command buttons. I think using Hitesh's solution you can then send button events to execute the process. In this way, you dont need to change the code of the called session.</div></div><hr />
