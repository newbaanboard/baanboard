<br />
I just stepped into a job that includes administration of a Baan FrontOffice setup with 38 seats in Sales Force Automation. Now, there are several problems with this:<br />
<br />
1) The software was purchased more than two years ago and never implemented.<br />
<br />
2) I've found very little current information about FrontOffice on the web. Most of it is more than a year or two old. I've requested information from inventsyscrm.com, but haven't had a reply for three days. My phone messages haven't been returned, either.<br />
<br />
3) The world has moved on to Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0, but the software we have works only with Internet Explorer 5.0.<br />
<br />
4) I'd like to run SQL Server 2000, but the software we have works only with SQL Server 7.<br />
<br />
5) I'm more than a little fuzzy on exactly what Baan FrontOffice does. The demo I have is a nice implementation of a CRM database, but it doesn't look that different from what could be built with plain vanilla SQL Server/Visual Basic.<br />
<br />
All of the above leads me to the real question: Does anyone out there still support this and is an upgrade available that will allow us to use currently shipping software such as Internet Explorer and SQL Server?<br />
<br />
Any advice will be much appreciated.<br />

When invensys took over Baan and InvensysCRM was created a new version of the product was released - 4.2. This addressed alot of integration issues and general functionality issue. Basically is appears to work now. I will find out about the servers it supports and get back to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sburkes</div><div class="date">29th November 2001, 22:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help. That's encouraging. We're in Roanoke, Virginia. <br />
<br />
The demo I have is highly customized and that -- and the fact that we have an older version of front office -- is proably causing our problems. We're considering an upgrade, but it's not certain yet.</div></div><hr />
