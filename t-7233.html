<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ttss82</div><div class="date">18th October 2002, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the following code works with no problem when using VB.NET (Windows application):<br />
<br />
DIM BaanObj as System.Object<br />
BaanObj = CType(Server.CreateObject&quot;Baan4.Application&quot;), Baan4.Baan4)<br />
'<br />
' some code<br />
'<br />
BaanObj.Timeout = 30<br />
BaanObj.ParseExecFunction(dllname, dllfunction)<br />
<br />
A Baan BW Client is started with no problem in Automation mode ( as I see it in toolbar) and properties ans metods are executed and the control is returned to the calling program.<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
When I use the same code in ASP.NET code behind, the BW client<br />
is started (I do not see it in the toolbar, but bw process is active). <br />
I can normally access BaanObj.Timeout property.<br />
But when I try to execute BaanObj.ParseExecFunction method just nothing happened (page is just waiting...) and the control is never returned to calling program (I have to stop the browser manualy).<br />
<br />
My ASPNET user is in the Administrator group. I also have setup the DCOM security properties with &quot;dcomcnfg&quot;, so the security is not the problem.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea, what else can I try?<br />
<br />
Any help will be very welcome.<br />

<br />
Just wondering if you found some clue. I am having similar problem, though I am not calling baan from ASP .Net but from a win32 service. The common thing is that both are lauching the bw.exe process in non user mode (service mode). I have also mentioned some observation under this thread  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=25090) . <br />
<br />
Will applreciate if you can share your findings.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much.<br />
<br />

 <br />
BOBS is a pretty good option, although I had some troubles in the past regarding the socket management... So I tried using the same API with web services or directly from the web page. I found the same problem mentioned here... the bw.exe process was shown at the task manager, but application would never get an answer from it once you send the ParseExec function. After some time learning about DCOMs and services I found that the problem was regarding the DCOM process security, I just missed to include the IIS users as well as the anonymous user. Once I corrected this I could work with no problems.<br />
 <br />
Please try searching for &quot;DCOM security setup&quot; at google and you'll find some coherent answers.<br />
 <br />
Any doubts I'm at your orders.<br />
