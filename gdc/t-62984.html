<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">17th October 2012, 20:45</div></div><div class="posttext">That's how I started.  My suggestion would be to not narrowly focus on tools administration, but learn as much about the system, both technical and functional, as possible.</div></div><hr />

Thanks so much. That really boosts my spirit. By functional knowledge you mean I should learn for example, how to execute Purchase Order, Sales Order etc ?? And all other activities related to different modules??<br />
<br />
Is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">18th October 2012, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Techidiot,<br />
<br />
I think Vince says you need to understand and study the Business Process where you are working. Vince correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.  Really, as much of an understanding of the entire system as possible.  Company structures, parameters, master/common data, business processes, administration, development, etc.  Not that you have to be an expert on everything, but the more you know can only help.<br />

<br />
I really agree on this, it would be always a plus point to know indepth about functional modules as that will help a tools administrator to perform his duties very well..:cool:<br />

<br />
I am very pleased with the answers provided by you. And I have really started taking interest in the other modules like finance, purchase, sales etc. I want to know how many years will it take for me to be to be a technical consultant?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">31st October 2012, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Every person is different, and time to master functional areas depends greatly on the person's ability to grasp the information and present it clearly.  Most of the work in the functional side of ERP is understanding the information and ensuring that the end user understands it as well.  Unlike bigger systems like SAP, it is best to know multiple modules in Baan/LN since they are so tightly integrated.  A finance functional expert must also have intimate knowledge of warehousing and distribution to understand the source of the transactions.<br />
<br />
Some people are best in the functional area while others are better in technical and you should first decide where you best fit.  Although you may think that you can make more money being functional, you want to be in a comfortable position when working on an extended project - there's more to life than the big bucks.  I wouldn't rush or push anyone in one direction or the other before understanding where the person best fits.  This works personally as well, where a strong technical person may be able to also work functionally but is not in their best interest to work in an area where they are less comfortable.  I work both technically and functional in all modules but tend to stay more technical since it is my stronger area.  I feel that completely turning my back on &quot;programming&quot; for a fully functional position isn't the best for clients or personal satisfaction.<br />
<br />
The time to learn the system functionally also depends on the resources you have to use.  A strong user base with a system using many modules helps when trying to figure out how to use the system.  Also, keep in mind that there are often many ways to do a single task, so you have to remain open minded and understand why and where each method is best used.<br />
<br />
A tools base is a good thing.  I would rather work with someone functionally that has a good tools knowledge than someone who was brought up fully functional.</div></div><hr />
