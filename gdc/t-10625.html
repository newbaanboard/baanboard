<br />
those amazing user stories reminds me that quite a few of us HAVE to deal with Baan Support (!!!) too...<br />
<br />
Any cools ones from there? <br />
(wish Baan Support could read this too..)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BBailey</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure everyone has a funny user story...good for a laugh and smile, as long as its kept in good fun.  <br />
As for support stories, well, I wouldn't like to see it turn into Baan Support bashing. For every Support story we have, I'm sure they have an equally embarrassig customer story.<br />
Point is, keep it in good fun, there's always two sides to a story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure what he meant to say but the English translation was &quot;Thank you for being passionate!&quot;</div></div><hr />
