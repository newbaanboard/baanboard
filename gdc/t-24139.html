<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">27th May 2005, 02:29</div></div><div class="posttext">The number of shares and the price of the IPO are a fair bit less than previous press articles anticipated.   The last article that I saw (and commented on on this forum) had the number of shares at 14.3 million and the price in the range of $13 to $15 each.    This would have raised around $200 million whereas the actual IPO looks like raising around $100 million.<br />
<br />
This seems to be a fairly small amount for a company that must by now to be valued in the $ billions again.<br />
<br />
What would be interesting to see haw many employess have the confidence to see the bargain they could get.  I expect that it won't be long until their incentives are paid in shares.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uday_jm</div><div class="date">27th May 2005, 11:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this a small IPO and that too not much noise about it. May be SSA is not in urgent need of large funds. It seems SSA's intention is only to do listing and test waters. Listing will offers them lot more visibility and also ready valuation of the company.<br />
<br />
Certainly it is discouraging that they reduced the offer price from USD13 to USD11 per share. Seems there is no much appetite for the offer among investors.</div></div><hr />
