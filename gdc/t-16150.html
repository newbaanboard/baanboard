Any tips on snagging jobs over there? I looked a few years back, <br />
there are never any jobs that sponsor visa's on any jobsites or on baanboard,<br />
especally in the area of baan / db admin...<br />
<br />
Just wonderin!<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
I worked in the UK for several months and found it to be a great experience.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.<br />
<br />
I was able to find the opportunity because the comapny was based in the US and I did some work for them at there US facility.</div></div><hr />
