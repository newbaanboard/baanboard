<br />
Really though, there shouldn't be many of those. only correction programs, etc.<br />

<br />
Sorry,my english still needs work.<br />
<br />
I mean that,the session is executable and the program/script is also executable.<br />
<br />
So Is there any relationship or difference between the session and the program/script? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">14th December 2005, 05:44</div></div><div class="posttext">A session is sort of a container for a program. <br />
A session (for example) tiitm0101m000 <br />
contains many things:<br />
Forms<br />
Reports<br />
Object<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
A Program Script is compiled into an Object.<br />
<br />
There are 2 main types of objects:<br />
4GL - Objects that would be linked to sessions<br />
3GL - Objects that can basically stand alone.<br />
<br />
ottcorlinux is a 3GL object<br />
otiitm0101 is a 4GL object<br />
<br />
You cannot run otiitm0101 directly. You must instead, run tiitm0101m000 <br />
<br />
However you CAN run ottcorlinux directly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does that help?<br />

<br />
Thank you very much,you have do me a great favor.<br />
<br />
By your introduction,I gain a lot.<br />
Yet,I still have a trouble that whether otfcor0313 is a 3GL Object or a 4GL Object ?<br />
Because I can run it directly.<br />
<br />
That's maybe my last question(confusion).<br />

<br />
Maybe I have not statement clearly.<br />
<br />
You say a 3GL object's name is like &quot;ottcorlinux&quot; and it can basically stand alone , a 4GL object's name is like &quot;otiitm0101&quot; and it would be linked to sessions.<br />
<br />
There is a program called &quot;otfcor0313&quot; that can basically stand alone(run directly) while it's name like a 4GL object's.<br />
<br />
So whether that program is a  3GL object or a 4GL object?<br />
<br />

If you can run tfcor0313m000 then that is a 4GL object.<br />

Correction - You can attach a 3-GL script to a session.<br />
<br />
Refer to the link - Programming a UI Script overview (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_4gl_features_overview) <br />
<br />
When you create a session, the default behavior of that session is handled by the 4GL engine. If additional functionality is needed or default functionality needs to be by-passed, this should be programmed in a UI script.<br />
<br />
A 3-GL is basically a &quot;C&quot; style of program script where you write code, compile it and then execute it. If you need any GUI, then you have to program the windows/screens and the event handling yourself. <br />
<br />
Yet,I still have a trouble that whether otfcor0313 is a 3GL Object or a 4GL Object ?<br />
With the Tools Program Scripts Session - ttadv2530m000 and you can know the type of script. There are also different other types with the latest versions - library, DAL, DAL2, DLL, Integration DLL, BOI, etc.<br />
<br />
Session is the basic executable in general, and it has different components attached to it like a Form (for UI fields layout, groups), Scripts (program logic) and Report (to show the output/results of print/process sessions), charts/graphs etc.</div></div><hr />
