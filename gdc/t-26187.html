<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gigaman</div><div class="date">23rd January 2006, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that EDM is short for Engineering Data Management, which is a module in baan manufacturing package. This module can provide item and bom revision management, transfer E-BOM to P-BOM, and ECO (engineering change order) control. EDM module exist in baan iv, baan erp and erp ln system. The former two are simliar, and the one in ln system is a little more powerful and easy to use for less session and flexible functionality. EDM is used by engineering people<br />
PLM is short for Product Lifecycle Management, which is a separate package outside baan erp. PLM contains PDM. PDM is short for Product Data Management. PLM and PDM are used by product or marketing people.<br />
Although, I'm still not very clear among the three functionally. I wonder why PLM and PDM are also needed for the user? Yes, only EDM is not enough for product data management, but, in detail, which functions are not included in EDM? Could someone give me some points.<br />
Or, please write down your idea related to this topic. I want a discussion here and get knowledgable. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now if you have an engineering department that have drawings on a CAD system you would need PLM. PLM have PDM and ECM. PDM can be integarted to your CAD system and allowes such functionality as Red Lining etc. that is needed in an environment where you have strict engineering control. There is also workflow functionality to help with the authorization of revisions.<br />
<br />
ECM (Enterprise Content Management) is the documentation management part of PLM. This allowes web based documentation control of the engineering documents in PDM as well as any documents that can be linked to Baan sessions. These documents are revision controlled as well.</div></div><hr />
