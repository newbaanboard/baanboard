<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">18th November 2006, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">New version of SunSystems (not Sun Micro, SunSystems is an accounting package acquired by Infor) will be rewritten in Baan 4GL. Existing version of Sunsystems is written in Microfocus Cobol<br />
<br />
Implication:<br />
SunSystems now has about 50 thousands customers in the world. I think there are only around 5 thousands Baan customers.  So if you are a developer or adminstrator on Baan systems, your career is bright.</div></div><hr />

Mind if I ask you what was your source for this news? Can't find any mention of this in Infor's and SunSystems' web sites. Thx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">20th November 2006, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">They acquired it about six months back when they bought extensity who were buying Systems Union who owned SunSystems, they also got VISION from the deal which is a nice enterprise reporting tool and MIS a BI tool. Info integrated their other erp systems to it (like syteline7 ) for big customers with complex financial reporting. I guess it made sense to bring it in house. I wouldn't be surprised to see vision and MIS integrated to LN at sometime. keep it all in the family. <br />
good news if it is confirmed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manbod</div><div class="date">3rd February 2007, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think Infor have anywhere near the integration policy that SSA had. So that would indicate to me that it is unlikely.<br />
There are several (historic) versions of SunSytems and they are not all UNIX. I believe that of the 30,000 individual clients they have around the world, most are very small (user numbers) and 95% run on PC base.<br />
<br />
Visual is nice, but Cognos and Business Objects are in another league</div></div><hr />
