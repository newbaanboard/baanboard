OST has hosted similar events in the past and the attendees loved it!<br />
<br />
Each company attending will have an LN company with some of their OWN data to use for the lab.<br />
<br />
We are trying to determine the interest in the event so we can meet everyoneâ€™s expectations.  It would help greatly if you would answer the following questions:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Are you, or is anyone in your company, interested in attending an event like this?<br />
 Do you prefer a single track for all topics that everyone can attend, or separate tracks such as finance, logistics, and tools?<br />
 Do you consider $1000 per attendee, or $2500 for a 3 person team from a company, a reasonable price for attending?<br />
 How many people from your company do you think would attend?<br />
 What specific topics would you like to see covered?<br />
<br />
<br />
We look forward to hearing from you (and seeing you in October)!<br />
<br />
Please contact Vince Murphy at vmurphy@ostusa.com with any questions.</div></div><hr />
