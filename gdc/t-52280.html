Eliminating A Bottleneck: GRINYA<br />
<br />
GRINYA (Goods Received In Not Yet Invoiced) can be a very complex area in Baan® Finance. GRINYA tracks the value of items received against a purchase order. However,these items have not yet been matched to a supplier invoice. As a result this processcan make balancing your ledger accounts very difficult and stressful. Early versionsof Baan IV &amp; V® were not complete or ready to handle GRINYA. To take advantage<br />
of GRINYA, be sure to contact Infor Support for your updates. Prepare to spend some time patching.<br />
<br />
Setups must be correctly entered. It is important to double check them to make sure that they are correct. You can easily verify this in your support manuals. Be sure that you know what time period an integration error occurred to correct the problem.  Also, test and validate any integration you put in place. Audit your system to see if everything has balanced correctly.<br />

Summer is Almost Here,  It's Time to Archive!<br />
<br />
Archiving is a method of removing non-current or static information from your Baan system and storing that information on separate media off-site in a secure location.  Archiving frees up space in your system. Current data (12 months or less) will run more efficiently on your system.  &quot;Old&quot; data, which has been taking up valuable space, can be removed and stored in a safe location. In other words, archiving protects your data from catastrophic events. Old data is secure off-site and new data can be backed up in less time with less back up media. Best archiving practices suggest that the archived data be kept available, in some format, for look up purposes. Your Baan can be configured to do that. Best practices also suggest that archiving<br />
adhere to your company's records retention policies as well as US and Canadian guidelines.<br />
<br />
e-Ventus Corporation has the experience to help your company work through the issues involving archiving. You must take into account customizations that have been performed, as well as other areas. <br />
e-Ventus Corporation can provide you with additional information<br />
to help your company perform this important annual routine.<br />
<br />
Archiving is an essential part of doing business.<br />
