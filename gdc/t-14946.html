I'm involved in a sort of SW selection for an ERP, that should be used in a small swedish manufacturing plant.<br />
The features of this ERP are quite standard:  assemblying of few standardized item, BOM, warehouse control, purchase &amp; sales, invoicing, subcontracting, MRP, general ledger.<br />
It should be obviously localized in swedish but also with support of english language.<br />
This ERP should not be too expensive (no Baan, Sap etc ;-) ), because the plant is small (the end user of ERP will be less than 10 persons, I think), and the type of production is relatively simple.<br />
Does anybody knows some name of sweden ERP supplier that produce an own-made ERP like this?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance...</div></div><hr />

Both are Swedish companies, They aim more at the mid to small market and both offer full ERP solutions. Might still be too expensive for the site you describe.</div></div><hr />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

www.compiere.org/ (http://www.compiere.org/) <br />
But I can't say that I have tried it myself.</div></div><hr />
