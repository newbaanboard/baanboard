<br />
If you did'nt see this Press Release..looks like AMB-Dataminers has released a new product to help data migrations..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jgagne</div><div class="date">3rd May 2002, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a very interesting SOUNDING product.  BUT, be very careful, database to database transactions (interfaces or migrations) are very complicated and can be very dangerous.  Judging from AMB-Dataminers website I would say that you would be dealing with a VERY young company, with a very young product.  This doesnt have to be bad.  It is another risk to be added to the equation.  The old saying  Theres no free lunch! applies in Spades when it comes to data management. For those of you that are new to the process and cannot tolerate much risk  look for companies with a proven track record.<br />
<br />
I know I sound negative and I do wish the best for AMD-Dataminers. But, you have to remember  incorrectly migrated or interfaced data WILL shut your system down.  Relational systems like Baan can not only be shut down, but damaged so bad that you could be spending years fixing the data.   <br />
<br />
FYI  There is a move in the industry to market applications like e-Cartography under the title of EAI  Enterprise Application Interfaces. There are a number of packages in this space and they all say they can do everything with not effort.  They also seem to avoid the discussion of the complexities of the issue.  In AMDs defense I have yet to really see any one product do such a stop the world great job.  What AMD can bring to the table is a company that could really work with you and your issues.<br />

<br />
Let me right to the point. AMB-Dataminers founders come from company's like Evoke, DB Star, Prism and have extensive consulting experience in building data warehouses, ODS, Data Marts and have built a pound for pound a solid offering for the small to mid tier market. <br />
<br />
The e-Cartography product positioning is based on the fact that vendors that provide like functionality (Informatica, Acta, Evoke, Sagent, Ascential) do not deliver products under $100,000 dollars.  Take months to implement and there are no products like ours on the market with the same dollar to dollar value. <br />
<br />
We will guarantee our product works as advertized, it will proform as advertised or your money back -Period in contract. NO RISK Just our time .  <br />
<br />
We understand being small software vendor has it challanges, but once upon a time Baan's conviction to it's product line caputred it's first customer ..as did SAP, Oracle, Informatica and so on.<br />
<br />
As a consultant...step up to the plate..let us show that &quot;Maybe just maybe, there is a better way&quot; so you can see what we have, why we are different and become better educated..all it will take is a simple Web-ex demo and our techical folks to share this wonderful product and our vision...Heck.. I'll even get Doug Laney from the Meta Group to attend and speak with us..<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reponse and we look forward to serving you to better understand our company and technology.<br />
<br />
Regards, <br />

I commend your commitment to your product and your company.  I have been in your shoes and I know of the challenges you face.  <br />
<br />
I am VERY glad to hear of your commitment to work with your customers.<br />
<br />
I DO WISH YOU THE BEST, AND MUCH SUCCESS.  There is a very real need for your product.<br />
<br />
I was only sharing a few words of caution.  <br />
<br />
As good as your product is, database interfacing/data migration is a non-trivial event.  Correct?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Razzano</div><div class="date">3rd May 2002, 21:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Data Management is clearly not a trivial process.<br />
<br />
We pride ourselves on the fact that Data Profiling is and will always be the first phase to data quality. It's this vision and where the products foundation is based upon. <br />
<br />
I would estimate that 85% maybe 90%  of all data analyst and consultants have never performe Data Profiling ..with an tool set  <br />
<br />
This is due to the fact that data profiling is new technology. <br />
<br />
Most ETL vendors don't have Data Profiling capability and hence have trained and conditioned buyers, consultants and the market that a product must have specific &quot;interfaces built for each vendors applications&quot; Not so.....<br />
<br />
Jeff.. ..lets set up a web-ex demo...and we we speak about our implementation at Covolos and the ODS we built in weeks for them.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the nice comments..<br />
<br />
