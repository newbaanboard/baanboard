<br />
I am newbie here. We have client requirement to integrate their CRM system with Infor LN system. We have done integration with other ERP systems like SAP using APIs ( SOAP API calls and RFC calls). We have never done integration with Infor LN system. I have 2 needs. Any expert guidance is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Need 1:<br />
Export data from Infor and load in our cloud AWS database.<br />
<br />
On periodic basis (e.g. nightly) we would like to export data from Infor database and load in our database. If we can get Infor system to FTP CSV files to our server on periodic basis, we can import that in our database. We need master and transactional data.<br />
<br />
Need 2:<br />
Real-time API call to perform Business action in Infor LN<br />
<br />
For example, if customer address needs to be updated, we would like to all API and update address in Infor LN. For that I am not sure if Infor LN has published API list. If yes, that would make life easy. If not, what is the best way to perform such action.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
(1) Write a session to extract what I needed into files. Then just put it in a batch job and add the necessary ftp commands.  Now if there is a shared directory with the AWS system then no FTP(or secure ftp needed).<br />
<br />
(2) Real time calls - you could always write libraries to perform certain functions using AFS code.  The key with this is what you can write the code to call it in.  I know there is a what to call these type libraries from Excel, but I am not sure of all the options available to LN.  So wait for an LN export that can provide much better options.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion and sure there are better ways with the newer software.</div></div><hr />
