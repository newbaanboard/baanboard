     I am currently looking at upgrading my environment from baan 5x.c to LN latest revision.  I am running oracle 9i and baan on w2k 2003 enterprise edition servers.  I am wondering if anyone has done an upgrade to LN from 5.x and if so what are the experiences and issues related.  I am also wondering if Windows is the best platform (no issues so far) to continue to run on?  And finally, if there is any reference material (ssaonepoint's website is horrible to say the least) that could be sent, that would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I am not sure which location you are at? either your local support representative didn't help you well or you didn't search well.<br />

Refer to:<br />
SSA® Baan ERP 5.0c<br />
User's Guide to upgrade to porting set 8.2b or later<br />
Document Code: U8985A US<br />
Release: SSA® Baan ERP 5.0c<br />
Document Title: User's Guide to upgrade to porting set 8.2b or later<br />
Publication Date: June 06<br />
<br />
About This Guide<br />
This document describes how to upgrade an existing SSA® BaanERP 5.0b or<br />
SSA® BaanERP 5.0c environment from the 7.1d porting set line to the SSA®<br />
Enterprise Server 8 porting set line. This document also includes upgrade<br />
conditions and prerequisites.<br />
<br />
Chapter 3 Delayed Move to 8.2b Porting Set<br />
Windows cluster<br />
SSA® Enterprise Server 8.2 does not support Windows clustering at this time.<br />
Therefore, SSA® BaanERP 5.0c customers with this setup must delay their<br />
upgrade to the SSA® Enterprise Server porting set until that support is<br />
available.<br />
Windows and DB2<br />
When you deploy ERP 5.0c on Windows with DB2 and you are ready to<br />
move to the new porting set line, contact your SSA OnePoint Support<br />
representative for SSA Global to enable support.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The key there is 5x.c to LN not porting set, the whole application.  And while I might not be searching properly you would think that the word &quot;upgrade&quot; would get some type of result.  Thanks for your help but your document is far from what I want....</div></div><hr />

It looks like it might be a cut over instead of a migration for us but it would be nice to at least get some feedback on the whole situation.</div></div><hr />

Another key point which is missed by many people is that you can upgrade to the LN tools to take advantage of the new features and still run the other ERP code. We are using LN-Tools (6.1) and Reger-(5.2)ERP combination. You have to contact BaaN/SSA Support to get information about the Data Conversion Tools to upgrade from 5.x to LN-ERP.</div></div><hr />
