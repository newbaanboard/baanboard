<br />
Starting tomorrow for the next 4 days i.e. from Oct 7 till Oct 10  2003, the Baan World Users Fall Workshop will be held at NC, US where iBaan ERP 6.0 will be formally inaugurated and the migration paths and differences between the existing platforms would be highlighted.<br />
<br />
For the benefit of those unable to attend it and the Baan Board community as a whole, lets keep pouring in the news from NC as and when  they happen.<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adityapd</div><div class="date">9th October 2003, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">There are around 2000 participants ( more than those at last BWU ) consisting predominantly of Baan V customers.<br />
<br />
Dominant amongst the many stalls that have been put up is that of SSA where efforts are also being made to cross-sell their other products ;)<br />
<br />
Some of the modules of the new product were unveiled yesterday and the show was expected to continue. <br />
<br />
Terminals have been put up all over the place where users can get to try and test the demo versions of Gemini. <br />
<br />
more laterz...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doclee</div><div class="date">11th October 2003, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I was there.  There were about 600 participants, not 2000.  Most of them on BaanIV not V.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adityapd</div><div class="date">12th October 2003, 08:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone please clarify whether Baan IVa, IVb upto IVc3 versions also enjoy standard support upto<br />
2008 just like Baan IVc4 ?<br />
<br />

<br />
I just returned from the BWU Fall Workshop in Charlotte, NC and one thing has become clear: SSA Global will not sunset the older BAAN versions.<br />
That means as long as customers keep on paying the Maintenance Fees for the BAAN version they are using they will be supported until the end of times. This may mean that if a customer is more than 2 versions behind of the most current one the Maintenance Fee will be increased.<br />
SSA Global will keep on developing new functionalities in older versions as long as the Support revenue is coming in.<br />
They will never force a customer to go to a higher version as the &quot;old&quot; BAAN management wanted to do.<br />
<br />
There was a special announcement that a b40_c4 web client will become available in Q1 2004 and this will be given to customers for free if they pay their Maintenance Fees.<br />
More interesting deals for customers using older versions can be expected.<br />
<br />
The general feeling I got from customers attending the show was that they have received many nice stories before but want to see some actions from SSA. They seem to be prepared to give SSA a new chance but remain sceptical. I would say &quot;Actions speak louder than words&quot;.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">13th October 2003, 02:32</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;...special announcement ... b40_c4 web client&quot; <br />
<br />
This is great news. It certainly looks as though SSA are our saviours.  <br />
<br />
With this sort of approach and attitude they will have very happy customers who will be loyal to the product and have no need to evaluate competitive offerings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adityapd</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah , right said Terry , perhaps that just gives another reason to IVa and IVb users to consider upgrade to IVc4 i guess !!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m.wilhelm</div><div class="date">15th October 2003, 12:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there any public papers or presentation available from the BWU 2003 Fall Workshop?<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to get the presentation from the sessions like &quot;Our Next Release Â– What's New &amp; How it Will Impact Your Business&quot;, &quot;New Features in Baan 6&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
Yours<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">15th October 2003, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I guess that soon all powerpoint presentations done at the 2003 BWU Fall Workshop will be available online at www.buw.org.<br />
Just wait another two weeks or so and then go there.<br />
I doubt if there will be slides on BAAN VI because SSA has decided to postpone the release until Q2 2004 and lots of new features are being built in right now.<br />
<br />
