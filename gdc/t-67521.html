<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">in_for_life</div><div class="date">25th March 2015, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I have lost of experience in BaanERP, BaanIV etc.<br />
<br />
I am looking at starting a new Remote access support and development venture without long term contracts but I am not sure if it is feasible.<br />
<br />
Are there many customers still on products below Infor Ln, that require this kind of service?  I am trying to gauge if the service is required?<br />
<br />
Do you know, how many customers have source code agreements, Do you?<br />
<br />
This service if it gets up and going will be based in the UK.<br />
<br />
Would you be interested?<br />
<br />
What kind of annual support/developments costs do you have? that you would like to reduce.<br />
<br />
Are there any other customers that like the idea of this potential service?</div></div><hr />
