We are currently looking into this and the only one we have looked at so far is Mercur. Are there others out there? Pros / Cons on others<br />

<br />
Mercur is a fine product, from what I understand, and they are recommended by SSA.  We have also worked with Streamserve, they are very strong in functionality.  It integrates well with Baan, similar to Mercur you may have some report changes.  Depending on what you want, Nazdaq offers alternatives to parts of document management (faxing, MS Interfaces, etc).   I'm sure there are some others too. <br />
<br />
Streamserve happens to have a webinar going on May 24th if you are interested.  Go to www.streamserve.com to have a look and register for the webinar if you want.</div></div><hr />
