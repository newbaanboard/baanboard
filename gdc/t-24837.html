  What features do you think Baan has (technical and functional) which are not available in SAP?<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">16th August 2005, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Technical: Baan has less database objects! :D A normal SAP installation has 38660 tables, 45700 indexes, 6000 views and some LOB's as well.  But, different to Baan, multiple companies do not result in more tables. All companies are stored in the same table set.  Which, IMO, makes Baan more flexible, since you can have different table layouts for different companies (e.g. for localizations), and, to reduce the database footprint, you can share tables between companies as well.</div></div><hr />

Am only looking at the database from the Oracle level! :D Have no other knowledge about funtional side of SAP... sorry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanBak</div><div class="date">17th August 2005, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that in SAP you can work with several companies in what is called &quot;a mandant&quot;. I also know that you can choose to place each company in a separate &quot;mandant&quot;. This might be the answer to your question</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">25th August 2005, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm observing the difference between financial integration design in BaanERP and SAP R/3. I found that in many areas SAP has a lot more features available than BaanERP (even things like bank interest or inflation management). But in area of business process (how people do their work), BaanERP seems to have a more thought out design.<br />
For example, SAP just leave the field for AR ledger account number right there on its customer master. Sure using table field authorisation they can give access to the field only to authorised accounting personnel (thereby avoiding the chaos that can be caused by salesperson keying in wrong ledger account). However, BaanERP does it more nicely, I believe. It only provides financial business partner group field in its business partner data. Surely salesperson will most likely know which group the customer belongs to and little mistake can be done there. An accounting person would then relate the financial business partner group to ledger account using completely separate screen. So, in BaanERP, this process is handled by 2 different departments completely competent to fill in the correct data. This is achieved without even bothering the Tools consultant to tinker with table data authorisation at all.<br />
