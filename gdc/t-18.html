I think that somebody implemented a tetris as well... :D</div></div><hr />

An interesting introduction to 4GL programming! I've probably got a copy of the script somewhere but the Profuse guy owns the rights so I couldn't distribute it.</div></div><hr />

Baan would certainly be a lot brighter with the added touch of a game, but they wouldn't be the first company to do this.  Now, Tic-Tac-Toe using 4GL sounds quite feasible, but does anyone remember or know about the Flight Simulator hidden in Excel 97?  Thats right, a flight simulator!  Well, ok, flight sim is a broad term and its more like an early version of Descent, but this was programmed over 5 years ago and was quite impressive at the time.  You could fly around little blue and red mountains and eventually find the programmers' &quot;Credits&quot; for Excel scrolling away somewhere.<br />
<br />
Before you ask, here's how to do it if you've still got Excel97.<br />
<br />
* Load Excel 97<br />
* Hit F5 (&quot;Go To&quot;)<br />
* Enter &quot;x97:l97&quot; to go to cell x97-l97 (thats a lower case L)<br />
* Hit Tab<br />
* Press Ctrl+Shift+ using the mouse click the Chart/Graph Wizard icon on the toolbar<br />
* ... and there you go, use the cursor keys, spacebar,enter, to control ... :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
A colleague of mine told me about this discussion related to Baan enhancements.<br />
Sometimes I use a simple TicTacToe session to explain some 4GL basics.<br />
If you're interested I could make a dump of it .<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Germanicus</div><div class="date">2nd October 2001, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Jurrien,<br />

I have viseted your technical Tools Training in May of this year.<br />
Nice to meet you again in this board.<br />

<br />
I'd love to see the TicTacToe game. I think alot of folks here would appreciate you making the dump. You can attach it to any post as long as the size &lt; 100K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">3rd October 2001, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jurrien,<br />
<br />
I went to your course in Dublin in April 2000 - proved to be very useful - thanks! Your tic-tac-toe game was still in the development stage - looking forward to seeing the latest version!<br />
<br />
Jason</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jurrien</div><div class="date">16th October 2001, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi again folks,<br />
<br />
attached to this message you can find a zipped BaanIV dump file containing the game. Hope you like it.<br />
