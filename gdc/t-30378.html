<br />
Perhaps it is a good idea if you first share some of your experiences up to now. <br />
I am sure many members at BaanBoard will be interested in them as well.</div></div><hr />

main conclusions..<br />
- the migration tools is OK... but pay attention to versions...<br />
- archiving first ! <br />
- make a detailed estimation of data volumes... (and schedule some long nights...)<br />
- be sure to have direct support from the INFOR migration team...<br />
- prepare detailed tests scenario... <br />
...<br />
conclusion of conclusion..<br />
migration is a project !</div></div><hr />

<br />
I plan to do the migration from BaanIV to LN.... <br />
I know that the steps and the database structure in BaanIV and<br />
LN are very different.....<br />
<br />
What I plan to do is to re-implement using LN...however,<br />
i want to transfer the master data as much as possible..such as:<br />
 <br />
1. Item master data.<br />
2. Customer and Supplier master data.<br />
3. Bom  &amp; Routing<br />
4. Item Planing master data ( MPS/MRP)...<br />
<br />
Are there any standard tools from Baan to do this or i need<br />
to map the database structure between to systems myself....?<br />
<br />
any comment, welcome....<br />
<br />
with my best,<br />
wit</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bringing over the static/master data as soon as possible will be a great advantage for your key users as they will learn LN faster and the implementation time will be a lot shorter. <br />
As Migration Labs we have seen great results to do upgrades from IV to ERP LN &quot;upside&quot; down. This means do the data migration already in SIM 1 so that your implementation team has enough time to optimize the implementation of LN in SIM 2 and SIM 3. The final data migration to the new live system is of course just before &quot;Go Live&quot;.<br />
With our migration solution called Easybaan Â® we are able to provide you with a pre-configured ERP LN environment allowing you to work with your own BAAN IV data in ERP LN right from the moment your key users have to be trained at the beginning of the project. They will appreciate this a lot and the success of the entire project is better guaranteed. <br />
Normally all implementation projects have the same problems:<br />
<br />
- From the start of the project users are frustrated because bad data is in the system. If they cannot complete processes in LN they do not know whether it is the bad data, incorrect set-up of the system or a bug in the system.<br />
- Implementation consultants have to aplogize for the situation and are constantly fighting &quot;fires&quot;.<br />
- The data migration is done at the very end of the implementation and there is hardly any time left to really test the BAAN IV data migrated into LN. This leads to all sorts of unnecessary issues after the Go-Live. <br />
<br />
Currently we offer an on-site workshop to do a mini-migration of a subset of your BAAN IV data into LN. This workshop lasts 5 days in total and after those 5 days your company can run the major processes in ERP LN using your own BAAN IV data.<br />
The objectives of our workshop are to proof our solution actually works and to show your users ERP LN is a very stable product with many new and exciting features. Using your own BAAN IV data in this process makes our workshop even more powerful.<br />
If desired we can also provide this workshop web based.<br />
