<br />
My vote goes to the following:<br />
<br />
tdssc0217 - auto create planned deliveries<br />
I can't remember the number of times we've had to customize, troubleshoot, and fix problems<br />
<br />
EDI message libraries<br />
I admit that once you learn how they work, they aren't horrible.  But when you start out debugging them for the first times, they are a pain in the ***.  We've had to customize these numerous times as well.<br />
<br />
Finance Transaction components<br />
OK, getting a little carried away here, but I think there's a reason why Baan has so many correction programs for finance.  Dimensions, accounts, debits, credits, balances, transaction types, currency, tfacr250/tfacp250.. need I say more?  what a pain to debug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">19th December 2001, 21:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree about the EDI dll's they can drive you mad ! Not all functionality is supported by the dlls:,<br />
- phantoms (issue components) <br />
- direct delivery <br />
- importing data to custom fields in the sales order.<br />
<br />
We have trouble with Commissions, <br />
- Takes too long to calculate<br />
- Reports are poor (had to build our own)<br />
- Lots of steps in the process that don't need to be there<br />
<br />
Outbound Data<br />
- Difficult to manage outbound<br />
- Maintain Outbound data is a very hard session to use<br />
- You can't correct a user's error !!<br />
<br />
There are a few of my personal choices.<br />
