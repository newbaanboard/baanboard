<br />
I saw one post regarding version control.  We will also have challenges with change management (moving our components from a test-&gt;prod environment and different physical boxes).<br />
<br />
If you have had experience, I would love to chat and share ours!  It's been a difficult road, trying to translate the rules into our own IT standards and procedures.<br />

One of the issues the auditors had problems with was the movement of modifications from test to production and developers having super user access and development access in production.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">9th June 2004, 19:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We are going to remedy this situation by two means:<br />
<br />
1) Hire one person to perform all the change management - meaning all moves from dev to prod.  This person could not be in the development department.<br />
<br />
2) Developers will NOT have developer rights in the production system.  We will be able to do table maintenance when needed.  But no developer access set up.<br />
<br />
We are running these ideas past our auditors this month.<br />

<br />
Developers would be able to create solutions that an admin would then<br />
load. I wrote a script that even automated that process. <br />
<br />
Plus you get all the revision control that you can handle, since you can always<br />
back out a PMC solution and get the original object.<br />

<br />
Is this all custom, or Baan supported?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">9th June 2004, 19:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hire one person to perform all the change management - meaning all moves from dev to prod. This person could not be in the development department.<br />
In our situation we had a person moved from my team to another team called - &quot;Production Control&quot; and I gave up some my BaaN administration duties for QA and Production, although I still do the first line support for all tools issues. Their main purpose is to do software migrations from Dev -&gt; QA -&gt; Production, handle root authorizations need for some BaaN stuffs, handle Job Schedulers, user creations and On-Call.<br />
I am not on-call anymore or have to work in weekends, and I can focus on other projects as Gemini, development, OW etc.  :)<br />
I think there is also some new regulation about password expiration, and disabling users who did not login for a particular time, user id coding conventions etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">9th June 2004, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Another question for the group - what are you doing for documentation.  We have found, we think, that if the process is entirely standard Baan, Baan's documentation will suffice.  Are you using Baan's documentation and if so, how?<br />
<br />
How do you handle the customizations you may have made?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">9th June 2004, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Denise,<br />
<br />
Yes you can create your own solutions. The creation process is Baan supported (i.e., if you have problems with PMC distributor, you can get help)<br />
<br />
It's not documented though, so you sort of have to muddle through the PMC Distributor sessions to figure it out, but its really not too bad..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jacobwd</div><div class="date">31st August 2004, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a thought. I saw a reporting solution from Cyberscience at the last Baan Users event in the UK. Each report has it's own banner page with date/time/data source/developer ID etc etc, and I thought then about SARBOX. If you need to prove where you got the data from, when and by who - there it is at the top of the page - easy!<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">6th January 2005, 00:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We had to negotiate this process with our SOX-related auditors. We do not have sufficient staff to have a promote-only person and it would be a severe hindrance for troubleshooting to restrict developers from production environments.<br />
<br />
Our auditors bought into our internal QC process as a compensating control. Every script created in the development environment is reviewed by an IT QC person before moving to production.<br />
<br />
There are three people who can do development. The developer may choose either of the other two as his (there are only guys in this role) QC person. These two will communicate by email with questions and comments regarding the script in development. When the work is satisfactory, the IT QC person gives his approval for the developer to move the objects to production.<br />
<br />
We track all this through logs and keep the documentation in Microsoft Outlook folders.<br />
<br />
It's been a burden getting comfortable with this but we get better at it all the time. By this time next year it will be second nature.<br />
<br />
We're pretty much set with SOX stuff but we're still struggling with user account auditing - looking for internal control conflicts and being able to prove to the auditors that we've identified and snuffed out any problems.<br />
<br />
I'm going to post a question on that and see if I can find out what others are doing.</div></div><hr />

Let's start with the basics and see if you can help me by answering a few questions.<br />
<br />
In what kind of organization do you work? Is it a manufacturing company, a government agency, etc?<br />
<br />
If you work in a private company, in general terms how large is the company in annual income and employees?<br />
<br />
In what kind of Information Technologies organization do you work? Is it just a few people, dozens of people, hundreds of people?<br />
<br />
What are your largest systems by brand name, JD Edwards, Peoplesoft, Oracle, etc?<br />

The Baan user access control requirement is fully addressed by a Baan certified business solution called EZ-Process (www.ez-process.com). Its EZ-Compliance module is compliant to all Baan versions (from Triton 1.0 to ERP-LN), and is able to perform automated Segregation of Duties validation on Baan Tools and/or DEM user authorizations (with or without User Roles). The availability of a pre-defined SoD Baan Conflicting Sessions Library also enables daily SOD conflicts identification for all user authorizations.<br />
<br />
EZ-Compliance was selected by organizations such as Olympus, Komatsu, Herman Miller, Bio-Rad, Coopervision, Zebra Technologies, Microchip, Griffin Pipes, Magna, Immucor, EnerSys, etc... With the support of EZ-Compliance, these organizations successfully passed their SOX/J-SOX/Eur-SOX/SoD audits, conducted by E&amp;Y, PWC, Deloitte, KPMG, ...<br />

Tip-1: The website offers a free of chargea SoD scan. <br />
Tip-2: This SoD scan engine is also able to handle SAP, Oracle, Mapics, and others.<br />
