<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">8th September 2007, 00:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been hearing in the trenches that Infor is planning to make Baan obsolete and has communicated this to vendors that were developing 3rd party products for Baan such as Business Objects (Crystal) and Cognos.  If you ask any of these vendors for productss like Baan Integration Kit they will tell you that they no longer sell those products since Infor will make Baan obsolete in the future.  This is contrary to the statement from Infor that no products in use by maintenance customers will be made obsolete.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone else heard of this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">msninave</div><div class="date">10th September 2007, 07:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Its strange.  The new customers of BaaN might know the fact but as we are already using BaaN4c4, its news for us.  We only heard that the BaaN(JOB) market is not very much exciting. We are getting support from infor also for all BaaN services. Thus I dont think it will obsolute in near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mvohra</div><div class="date">10th September 2007, 08:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree Infor is still supporting not only Baan IV but also all other product lines. Information from a third party does not have much relevance unless reiterated by the vendor itself. We must all get first hand infor mation from the product vendor before we start such grapevines.<br />
As far as my knowledge goes ther is no plan to sunset any product and integrations to third party tools are developed and sold by Infor and not the respective third parties. hence, must consult the product vendor.</div></div><hr />
