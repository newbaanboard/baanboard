<br />
<br />
Los Angeles, CA, USA - October 16, 2002 - Baan, the leading enterprise application provider for industrial enterprises and part of Invensys plc, has selected Frango - a leading supplier of corporate financial management and control software - for a new strategic alliance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why? Why are they doing that all the time? If I recall correctly, in the last four years we already had Hyperion, Safari, and Crystal as &quot;strategic&quot; partner products for reporting. Where is the strategy here? The same for databases, Oracle, Informix, you name them. The all  have been &quot;strategic&quot; partners once for Baan. <br />
<br />
If I was to buy a piece of software like Baan, one of the main issues I will consider is STABILITY. I want to have a solution that I still can update in five years. Ans whats going on right now? The Crystal interface just gets starting to work slowly right now, and now the &quot;strategic&quot; partner changes. Will Baan drop development on the Crystal interface as they did with the Safari and Hyperion interfaces?<br />
<br />
Oh you Baan folks, sometimes you make it really hard for us to deliver good consultancy services to our customers...<br />
I think I'll go and buy a crystal ball.<br />
<br />

PS: By the way, does anybody know why two important products that are meant to deliver absolute reliable data are called &quot;Crystal&quot; and &quot;Oracle&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Crystal is fantastic at providing reporting &amp; information delivery solutions, but be aware they have nothing to offer regarding financial management and consolidation. Customers who demand ready-to-use solutions are not deciding for Crystal.<br />
<br />
You still have a point - I'm a product manager for Business Intelligence field and my business largely depends on a stable partnership of Baan &amp; Crystal.<br />

<br />
Since we never used the Hyperion interfaces (wrote our own), I did not realize that BaaN was supporting the interfaces for Hyperion.  I always thought they were exchange schemes, SQL scripts and jobs loaded to BaaN.<br />
<br />
Does this mean we can expect no more upgrades from Hyperion?<br />
as well as no support from BaaN?<br />
<br />
May never need it, just curious!</div></div><hr />
