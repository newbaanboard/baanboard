I would like a package to measure and monitor, production time, scrap, down time and other key metrics<br />

Please contact me at tim.fleming@mvs-na.com if you have any information<br />

If you only need some key metrics calculated though, then it's also possible to develop those specifically (or have them developed) in the &quot;Enterprise Performance Manager&quot; in Baan (have a look at the Baan main menue). <br />
<br />
It's a package in Baan that offers a framework for performance indicator  calculations. It's necessary to develop the scripts for the calculations though. That requires some programming skills. Once developed, a process runs to calculate the metrics. For better visibility I upload the results into an Excel sheet or word document.  <br />
<br />
Maybe something you want to look into.<br />
