It will be interesting to see what happens to the current code base from Triton -&gt; Baan -&gt; ERP Ln(Triton, Baan and ERP Ln are just different names but the core tools are the same though). Will the existing code base be migrated to .NET as suggested in the announcement?<br />
<br />
any insights?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Years ago Microsoft also announced that they would change the code base of their business software applications (Great Plains, Axapta, Navision and CRM) to .NET but that never happened for obvious reasons. <br />
I personally do not see that Infor now will spend the time and money to change the source codes of BAAN IV, BAAN V and ERP LN to .NET.<br />
Perhaps Infor's hidden goal by making the statement to change the code base to .NET is to be taken over by MBS (Microsoft Business Solutions) so the owners can cash out.</div></div><hr />

Infor will use Silverlight and Sharepoint for the new userinterface, MS Reporting services for reporting and Windows and SQL Server as prefered OS and DB.<br />
Infor ION (Open SOA Framework) will be fuelled by Microsoft Technology.<br />
Hope this helps. Let me know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you please clarify the relationship OpenSOA/ION: Is this just a rebranding, or an effort to make the existing OpenSOA stack a real stand alone product (which, personally, I think it's a good idea), or does Infor intend to change the technology used for system integrations again (after BaanConnect, OpenWorld, BDE, OpenSOA now for the 5th time in ten years)?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrankManders</div><div class="date">3rd July 2010, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">It is all of the things you mention. It is a rebranding of all the work done for Infor Open SOA Framework. But it is also the effort to make it a stand alone product. What does this mean: ION contains the interoperability tools, so ION offers event driven BOD based integration for SOA enabled applications (Baan IV, Baan 5 and LN are SOA enabled). ION contains information management tools (Business Information Services), Workflow management and collaboration tools (workflow based on BODs) and Business Process Management Tools (&quot;DEM2&quot; we used to call it ;-)).<br />
<br />
It can installed 'stand alone' so no need to install MyDay (and business analytics tools) if you don't want.<br />
<br />
MyDay can still be used of course but we're changing the technology. By the end of the year (2010) MyDay will be powered by SharePoint. The content however (in which Infor invested a lot) is already available, so roles, metrics, KPIs, BODs etc. are tobe re used).<br />
<br />
The technology [in LN!] does not change but it is good to mention that we support the latest state of the art SOA integration technologies. It is important to understand that with LN we support two types of SOA: WebServices (BDE) and event driven SOA (ION/OpenSOA). These technologies are complementary and each serves a specific goal.<br />
<br />
Hope this clarifies.<br />

<br />
yes it does - thanks for bringing some light into the necessary(?) marketing fog.</div></div><hr />
