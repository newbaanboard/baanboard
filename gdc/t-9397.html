**********************************************************************<br />
<br />
1.  Never ever write a line of code that someone else can  understand.<br />
<br />
2.  Make the simplest line of code appear complex. Use long    names. Don't ever code  &quot;a=b&quot;, rather do something like<br />
AlphaNodeSemaphore=*(int)(&amp;(unsigned long)(BetaFrameNodeFarm));<br />
<br />
3.  Type fast think slow.<br />
<br />
4.  Never use direct references to anything ever. Bury everything in macros. Bury the macros in include files. Reference those<br />
include files indirectly  from other include files. Use macros to<br />
reference  those include files.<br />
<br />
5.  Never include a comment that will help someone else understand your  code. If they understand it they don't need you.<br />
<br />
6.  Never code a function to return a value. All functions must<br />
return a pointer to a structure which contains a pointer to a     value.<br />
<br />
7.  Never discuss things in concrete terms. Always speak in<br />
abstract.    If they can understand you they don't need you.<br />
<br />
8.  Never complete a project on time. If you do they will think it<br />
was easy and anyone can do it and they don't need you.<br />
<br />
9.  When someone stops by your desk to ask a question, talk forever but don't answer the question. If they get their questions<br />
answered   they don't need you.<br />
<br />
10. Never clean your office. Absolutely never throw away an old listing.<br />
<br />
11. Never say hello to anyone in hallway. Absolutely never address anyone by name. If you must address someone by name, mumble or use the wrong  name. Always maintain the mystique of being spaced out  from concentrating on complex logic.<br />
<br />
12. When you are having lunch at the office-canteen, never fully<br />
concentrate on your lunch. Try to get absent minded suddenly<br />
in     the  middle of the lunch and say to your coleague something<br />
like: 'But I don't think that data page was actually locked by another RX call,  rather I see the possibility of a wrong access mode.' Otherwise     they will think you are not serious about your job and then they won't  need you.</div></div><hr />
