I have heard of some companies taking their implementation partners or the software vendor to court over failed implementations - but no first hand knowledge of it.</div></div><hr />

That would be the client's team and the consultants hired to HELP them with the job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for all your replies!<br />
<br />
As you know, the clauses of the professional service agreement are becoming more and more close to the physical goods supply agreement. In order to prevent the losses or indemnifications, both the clients and services providers should have the requirement to  have a insurance compensition.<br />
<br />
I ever heared several years ago that there are some company provide this kind of insurance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, as rightly mentioned by @Benito, it's the Team who is going to make the change.<br />
<br />
Utmost care must be taken while selecting an ERP Vendor, and the Consultants (Ofcourse, you also need to select the best Internal Team - Super Users).<br />
<br />
Though we have less chances of getting Fake Experienced Candidates (Unlike SAP/Oracle), there are chances, you might get few in-experienced candidates projected by the ERP Vendors as an Experienced Candidates.<br />
<br />
Hence, It is highly advisable to check the knowledge levels of the Consultants (through interviews/interactions), visit their LinkedIn Profiles, and check their background (BaaN is a Small World - So, not a big deal) before on boarding them. <br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />
