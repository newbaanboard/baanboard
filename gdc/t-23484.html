<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">21st March 2005, 01:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Good article. All the others I have seen have been for IT press, this one is from financial market perspective.<br />
<br />
One area that could be a problem for SSA with their cute antics of having a new product but not giving to many people is brought out in this quote from the article &quot;...The software market is constantly evolving, demanding new products from the company and raising a basic concern for investors: Can a small company like SSA Global Technologies keep pace with its larger competitors?...&quot; <br />
<br />
They may have made a better impression on the financial market had they encouraged the thousands of baan customers who have have been waiting years to upgrade their BaanIV systems, to install ERP LN and they could even have thrown in a couple of the little add-ons to demonstrate the take up of their new software. <br />
<br />
I'm waiting to see the day when all incentives are paid in shares and pay raises are given in shares. Then we will know that the employees really believe in the products and the longevity of the company.<br />
