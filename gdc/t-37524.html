<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Migration Labs</div><div class="date">14th June 2007, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Ooltewah, Tn., June 14, 2007  Migration Labs, LLC., a leading developer of data migration tools and provider of data conversion services for Baan and Infor ERP systems, announced today that Miller Industries Towing Equipment Inc., http://www.millerind.com , based in Ooltewah, Tennessee has selected the Easybaan Migration bundle to accomplish the data migration phase of their upgrade from Baan IVc4 to Infor ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Sias Reyneke, IT Director at Miller Industries, selected the Easybaan Toolkit and methodology as the only solution able to handle all of the complexities of migrating data from Baan IVc4 to Infor ERP LN. According to Mr. Reyneke, Easy Baans unique framework will allow Miller Industries to migrate Baan IV data in a multi-site (multi-logistic / multi-finance) environment and accomplish a partial migration of the Baan IVc4 data for only open transactional data (sales, purchase and production orders), open entries (ACR and ACP) and the sales data related to the Product Configurator (tipcf). This last point was critical as Miller Industries is on a rapid deployment schedule and needed to bring over their open items separately to allow operations to continue as the data migration proceeded. In addition, the migration and testing of the data will take less than half the time to accomplish.<br />
<br />
The Migration Labs solution for data migration of Baan IV and BaanERP systems includes a comprehensive set of data exchange modules, BaanIV  / BaanERP and Infor ERP LN data templates, an EasyBaan company in Infor ERP LN with pre-defined business processes for complete integration transactions (logistical and financial), and a best practices methodology for data migration and testing. In addition, Migration Labs offers professional services, training, support, and five day on-site workshops to insure the smooth and successful transition to the Infor LN ERP system.<br />
 <br />
This is the first deployment of this cost saving approach for migrating to Infor ERP LN in the U.S. The company has successfully completed numerous migration projects for clients in Europe. In addition, the list of U.S. based Baan users planning to deploy the EasyBaan approach is growing rapidly.<br />
<br />
According to Edwin van der Borg, Managing Partner at Migration Labs, The interest in our data migration framework and the Easybaan tool for upgrades from Baan to Infor ERP LN is extremely high. We are in the process of finalizing multiple projects as we speak .<br />
