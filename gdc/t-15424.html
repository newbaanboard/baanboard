It's been a long, long time since I've looked for such a thing but I'd like to have one now as a conversation tool with our users.<br />
<br />
When I looked at the newer SSA/Baan general website, they no longer have customer names. I've asked our Baan sales rep for a list but I'm not holding my breath.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone either a) has such a list or b) knows where one is posted and I can go retrieve it. I'm looking for recognizable brand names like Boeing, Komatsu, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of Baan's customer are manufacturers. They don't have a famous brand name. But still some are famous,<br />
<br />
like   Boeing, KPN, Fiat  Ferrari, Del Monte, ABB, Nortel, HP, VIA, Komatsu, Siemens, Acer, Tyco, Sensormatic,</div></div><hr />
