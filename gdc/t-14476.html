This kind of mail has been circulating for quite some time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">13th February 2004, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been circulating by mail a few weeks ago. I knew this one for a long time already. I happen to like it very much, mainly because it is the type of riddle which an adult will mostly not be able to guess, and only a chile with simple straight forward mindset, will get it right...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It moves companies <br />
You can't say how things really work<br />
Rich People(Companies) need it<br />
Poor People like us(Baan Consultants) have it?<br />
<br />
Just a try.Have fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When this one first circulated in NZ (a while ago), the line was;<br />
Rich people 'WANT' it....<br />
<br />
But that made it really difficult, as rich people still want things... If it had said &quot;need&quot; instead of &quot;want&quot;, it would have been more obvious.</div></div><hr />
