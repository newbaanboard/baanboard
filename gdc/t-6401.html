I just have to mention the Valley Sports team from Louisville, Kentucky. And the team from Japan is awesome also.  Any fans at all?<br />
Maybe a Netherlands fan or two?  What about Worcester Mass fans?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th August 2002, 05:04</div></div><div class="posttext">That's okay Pat. I just figured that there might be a few fans running around on the board. If it was not Little League and involving a team where I live I probably would not have mentioned it.:)<br />
<br />
I really figured to run into some fans from Japan since baseball is such a big sport there.  Last but not least congrats to Valley Sports from Louisville, Ky. the US winner. Also congrats to Japan the internation winner.  Good luck to both teams tomorrow.<br />

<br />
Congratulations to your Kentucky team for winning the Little League world series. I'm not particularly into baseball but it's a sweet revenge on Japan for beating our Apopka team last year.<br />
<br />
I bet there will be a lot of celebrations there. Although our team was defeated last year, the celebrations for being second were enormous with parades that included Orlando Magic's Tracy McGrady (he said he was an aspiring little leaguer himself) on the streets of Apopka, the Walt Disney World and Universal Studios in Orlando.<br />
<br />
Again cheers to your local heroes and Kentucky.</div></div><hr />
