<br />
Recently I came to find out of preview checkbox in &quot;Select Device&quot; which can lead multiple reprints of Invoices or any other documents that can lead to MAJOR theft.<br />
<br />
Note we have blocked reprinting option of Invoices, Picking List and Packing Slip however this preview checkbox can still lead to multiple reprints of Original documents for which even audit logs are not activated.<br />
<br />
Is anyone out there is also aware of this issue so that we can together ask the vendor for fix to it. Or is anyone having solution to this.....<br />
