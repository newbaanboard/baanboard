The prhase, You have to cut maintainance fees. Are a well known phrase for all of us, IT professionals.<br />
To do this my company have decided not to upgrade our existing HP9000 servers. The quotations for do that was excessive. So, we look up for Linux on Intel Servers. <br />
<br />
After a long trip to migrate HP-UX HP9000 servers to Xeon-Red Hat ES, (around 10 days), Im thinking to post a document where it contains the problems and solutions founded on this adventure. Me and the Infor's consultor, spend hours, even in weekends, in surfing Internet forums to see if someone have found a solution for a specific problems.<br />
<br />
I believe that the effort pays the deal. The performance was greately improved. Just to give an expample, the dump of our company 0 tooks around 2 hours to generate and it have a 1.4 gb of size. To upload that file in the new servers, it tooks 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I have post one question regarding, shmvalues.<br />
<br />
The weird thing is: Suposedly, Infor have all the knowledge and how's to make a succesfull migration... but when the consultant begins to say, Hey, why you don't reinstall the servers and put it on 32 bits?, or Hey, you should have choosed windows servers for your migration... the things going bad. And have to act quickly.<br />
<br />
Thank you..</div></div><hr />

Please post what you found.  I would like it, if only for the sake of having the documentation available, when we do our own migrations.</div></div><hr />

   Could you please post the document, if you would have processed it. We are in the process of installing BaanIV in linux, but we are facing problem in connecting through BW client.<br />
   <br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

   Thanks for your Reply. We have installed BaanIVc on RHEL5.0 with Oracle10gR2 standard. The installation was successfull. While opening through ba6.1 the system works fine. But while connecting through BW client even with latest version, we are getting error as REXEC failed to host. Error in ipc_boot6.1. We have installed the porting set 6.1c.7.20.<br />
Please advice us where to make changes to connect for BW client.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Thamarai</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen that before. There was a known problem with rexec on some operating systems. First try to put your workstation IP number to /etc/hosts file on the server. If it helps for one workstation, you may put all IP's to /etc/hosts or you may consider BaanLogin instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">6th February 2009, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd recommend BaanLogin. Rexec is insecure, and transmits passwords in plain text over the network!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">6th February 2009, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
This problem is caused due to Red hat has not enabled REXEC service by defalut. So, if you choose to connect your clients by this service you must enable it before.<br />
<br />
The steps are:<br />
1.- Install RPM rsh-server, included with Red Hat.<br />
2.- Execute ntsysv and enable rexec. Here you can also enable rsh and rlogin.<br />
3.- Restart xinetd using /sbin/service xinetd restart<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

  Thanks for your reply. Somehow we managed to login through Baanlogin from the client. But, now the root login is not getting logged through BW client. It says username &amp; password is not correct. Any Suggestions Please...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Thamarai</div></div><hr />

don't know if it's related to your problem, but we had issues with BaanLogin when the BaanLogin Deamon was started on server and the environement variable USER was set on OS (root in our case). In that case we were not able to login through BaanLogin (on porting set 7.1d.13). <br />
So we had to stop the BaanLogin daemon, unset the USER variable in shell and afterwards start the Login deamon again.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can give that a try,<br />
