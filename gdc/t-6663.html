<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">13th September 2002, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">And it raises an interesting question regarding about the corporate politics surrounding Baan.<br />
<br />
Luminux was taken over by Jan Baan (I believe it is one of the companies that are preparing a law suit against him because of the methods he uses, but I'm not sure about that).<br />
<br />
So how did Support-eye, which is obviously Luminux (technique) end up with Invensys when Jan Baan is supposably out of the picture?<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">13th September 2002, 22:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought Luminux went belly-up and Baan pulled the whole consulting business around the Luminux products back into BGS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">13th September 2002, 23:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually from the Baan internal documentation I have seen, BGS is responsible for SupportEye.  It is definitely being positioned as a services generator by Baan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">14th September 2002, 04:19</div></div><div class="posttext">(which sounds awfully similar to my usual excuse, &quot;got it from the toilet seat&quot;):eek: <br />
<br />
During my recent visit to Holland I picked up a magazine that boasted Jan on the frontpage with the header &quot;the return of Jan Baan&quot;.<br />
The article talked about Jan's take-over tactics and Luminux was mentioned as an example.<br />
<br />
I'll try to find out the name of the magazine (because my memory is failing as usual) for those in the Dutch language area who are interested. <br />
<br />
Of course the answer may be as simple as Vanenburg sold Luminux (or its technology) to Invensys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Slob</div><div class="date">16th September 2002, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">iBaan SupportEye is the formal Luminux.<br />

It contains some very handy tools for the customer, like  <br />
System Viewer that can be used to get a HTML overview of the System Configuration.<br />
<br />
The Object Magnifier to analyze Baan objects.<br />
<br />
Next to these tools there are some services that can be used to anlyze the system for optimizations.<br />

The SupportEye portal needs to be installed on the Baan Application server and can be accessed via an internet browswer.<br />

The portal can be downloaded via solution 120511. <br />

At present it is with Baan, it is wonderful, very helpful to all the customers. Here are the details.<br />
<br />
Support Eye is a support utility that has just been released to customers. It is available as a solution from the Support Site (www.support.baan.com) and is available for download from solution 120511.<br />
Depending on your OS, please download the appropriate file (.tar for UNIX and .exe for NT).<br />
The installation instructions are available within the downloaded file once extracted.<br />
<br />
Support Eye provides you with the following utilities -<br />
<br />
1) System View - This gives you a complete overview of your System including -<br />
	a) Hardware configuration<br />
	b) Operating System settings<br />
	c) Various parameters you have set for Databases<br />
	d) Complete BaaN configuration including detailed VRC structure etc.<br />
	e) BaaN Parameter tables overview<br />
	f) An easy to read Error Log display<br />
<br />
2) Object Magnifier - This gives all relavant information about any BaaN objects and dll's including -<br />
	a) Tables that are read, updated, deleted<br />
	b) dll's that are called/used by the object<br />
	c) Queries within the object<br />
<br />
3) Flow Monitor - This option helps you to analyse transaction flows within the application. It also helps in identifying<br />
	bottlenecks within the flow.<br />
<br />
4) Performance Advisor - This option is a service that is available in this utility. This option reviews your complete <br />
	configuration and searches for potential enhancements ranging from database tuning to OS parameter tuning to BaaN<br />
	parameter settings.<br />
<br />
5) System Documenter - This option is a service as well. It is similar to the Performance Advisor but gives a high level<br />
	overview of the possible optimizations<br />
<br />
6) Archive Scan - This scan will encompass your complete system and the output shall be in the form of a report that will<br />
	advise you on the tables and the records that need to be archived in order to reduce the load on your database and<br />
	reduce the size of the data as well that will result in performance improvement.<br />
<br />
7) Migration Scan - This scan will investigate all possible aspects required for migration of BaaN s/w. This will save a lot <br />
	of time in pre-migration activities.<br />
<br />
Further information about each option is available once this utility is installed and functional.</div></div><hr />

I do not understand what's the need to discuss who was owing product &amp; other history etc.. At present it is with Baan, it is wonderful, very helpful to all the customers. Here are the details.<br />
<br />
<br />
I personally was never very impressed with Luminux, and am not with Support-eye for the same reasons, however that is a matter of personal opinion and just like mechanics, we all pick our own tools of choice to get the job done. :)<br />
<br />
As for discussing Baan policies and politics, my carreer is tied in closely with Baan, and as such I for one always have an interest in what is going on with Baan on a corporate level.<br />
My life depends on it. lol<br />
<br />
We are drifting away from this forum's topic though, so let me move this thread to a more suitable place</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">16th September 2002, 23:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The magazine was FEM (no, not the L.A. Feminist magazine) and I even found an online version of the article here (http://www.fem.nl/archief/verhaal2.asp?soort=cover&amp;NieK=286&amp;tekst=Jan_Baan).<br />
<br />
It is in Dutch, so the rest of you may attempt the various translator sites and see what jibber jabber it comes up with, but it does say that Luminux was part of Vananburg. <br />
In 2001 the program was finally completed, at which point Jan Baan (according to the article), withdrew his investment from Luminux, causing Luminux to go bankrupt and leaving Jan the source code.<br />
<br />
Luminux (Luc Deleu) is not taking Vanenburg to court. That is former Answers.com and Netshepherd (Michael Morrison).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">23rd September 2002, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks <br />
<br />
It is very &quot;illuminating&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes , Baan have offered this &quot;tool&quot; to be used<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the customer was on 4a1 which is not included in this document. It has not worked very well so presumably the details of &quot;acceptable&quot; versions may still be accurate.<br />
<br />
However as we are on 4c4 then it should /might be ok<br />
<br />
If we use it I will communicate success or otherwise<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">23rd September 2002, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sturla<br />
<br />
Having read document I am unclear whether it reports ONLY on qualifying entries for archiving and does not report on entries ( either by summary or detail )where the &quot;record&quot; may qualify on the archive date but not qualify on the &quot;rules&quot; applied.<br />
<br />
It seems this is where most of the time is required to &quot;ensure&quot; the archive rules are met<br />
<br />
Do you know the answer ? or do such reports exist ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
