What is BaaN world. How useful it is. What efforts required to have it working?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimbob</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 13:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Good question indeed!<br />
<br />
What is Baan World?<br />
<br />
Any takers?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">No... I get it. You mean the BaanWorld conference (which next year is called IBaanWorld in Rome)<br />
<br />
This is open to all customers and other too. It allows Baan and others to show off what they can do and is one of the largest meetings of its kind. <br />
<br />
I know many people who have been and find it very informative. I'm hoping to be there myself next year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">4th September 2001, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">What about Baan World Users? In the infamous Implementing BaanIV book (at least the release I have) there is a section on what to do once you've learnt all that wonderful information the book gives you. It says in order to find work in different areas you go to the Baan World Users website and have a look at the members so you can contact the companies in the area you want to work. It forgets to mention the fact that you have to be a member to see that information and that you already have to be in the Baan World (licensed user etc.) to become a member. Maybe it's easier than that to join - anyone know?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure there is a list available anywhere else of all the companies using Baan, their locations and how many users they have etc.. It seems we have members from all over the world on the Baanboard though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">7th September 2001, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I think that this is a great place to ask questions and see who else is having the same problems. BWU is not the end of the Baan world. After all, if you are not a member, how many others are not, therefore not listed! This forum shows that there are more Baan users out there then we ever thought of. I mean, how many other Baan forums have had this kind of response in such a short time?</div></div><hr />
