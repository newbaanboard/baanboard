<br />
To give you a background, we have 5 companies with different types of business and each have its own financial books. I just want to know the advantages and disadvantages of having a single finance/logistic vs multi..  What is the best company practice on this kind of set up? Any issues on performance, hardware, consolidation &amp; accuracy of data, authorization, etc..?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance..<br />

<br />
It's  suitable  when u need to all logistics transactions like purchase / sales etc in one finance company only . This requires to  have integration and finance tables to be shared . Bulky integration trx may create performance impact.<br />
<br />
If  central finance is not the requirement , u can still have multi-fin-multi-logistic with only masters like tfgld005 , tfgld008 , tgld011 etc shared . If u need intercompany fin trx tfgld102 / tfgld015 may be required to be shared . U need to maintain company relations in tfgld0100m000 and tfgld0101m000 .<br />
U can share TB tables (tfgld201-215) to get central TB  if and when required in tfgld3402m000 . Absolutely no perf impact for such a configuration .</div></div><hr />
