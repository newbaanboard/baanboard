<br />
I'm an experienced programmer but new to the Baan environment. I'm looking for some direction on where I can obtain books on Baan Tools, customization principles etc.<br />
<br />
I've already had 5 days of preliminary training from a 3rd party but the manual wasn't very good and I'm looking for more.<br />
<br />
What's the best reference for Baan Tools. We are currently using Baan IVc.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
Other than the Baan Tools help, and the course books you get at Baan training, I have found the BaanERP Application Performance Guide to contain very useful information.  You should be able to get an electronic copy from Baan.  The document # is M2017B US.  Although it's for BaanERP, a lot of it also applies to Baan IV.<br />
<br />
I believe there is another document on UI guidelines for BaanERP.  However, I have not looked closely at it since we're running Baan IV.<br />

I havn't seen any book so far.<br />
But on your system there are the Ban Help Files, (windows help files) located at $BSE/lib/help/DIRNAM, where DIRNAM is tfB40_c4 or suchlike. The most interesting dir here is ttB40_c4, where you will find a file called &quot;tt3.hlp&quot;. Transfer this file to a windows box (if you do that with ftp, don't forget to use the &quot;bin&quot; option, otherwise you can't use the file) and doubleclick it. In this tools help file you can find a lot of interesting topics. Search for &quot;executables&quot;, if you look for information about the programs of your porting set.<br />
<br />
Have fun<br />
