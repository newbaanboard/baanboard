<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zlong11</div><div class="date">22nd October 2008, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We are looking for a PDM and Baan PDM is one of the choices. I was told that Baan PDM has problems on CAD integration, ex. Solidworks. One Baan IV user moved from Baan PDM to Smarteam due to Catia integration issue. One PDM vendor says Baan PDM CAD (including Solidworks) integration is poor. <br />
<br />
Does any one use Baan PDM with Solidworks and how does it work out?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

What we have been told is that an SW integration will work best with open SOA which will be released next year in FP5... Maybe someone else does already have a SW integration running with open world?<br />
