I'm not talking about your normal marketing blurb and pretty brouchures but something that goes into relative detail.<br />
<br />
Perhaps somebody can give me a few pointers on why we shoudl upgrade from IV to V.<br />

<br />
I suggest you have a look at following thread:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">28th August 2001, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you also have to look at business practise and where you may be heading. Its not just the differences in look and feel, but how your company may work after a Baan V install. <br />
<br />
Upgrading should only be considered if really needed. Just upgrading to get the lastest version is done in this industry and normally ends in failure. <br />
<br />
So the first question should really be, do I need to upgrade, then why!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">For migration to Baan V, I agree that you have to take a serious look at your business requirements.  There are major functional changes that need to be managed properly.  Baan V does present many solutions to current Baan IV problems and create some problems out of your current Baan IV setup.<br />
<br />
Although we still have to implement for a client, we have simulated conditions at sites that are currently running Baan IV and Triton.  Our finding is that we are bound to do less customizations and consequently implement faster due to the new functionality. By the way, the sites we simulated are electronics on multi-site scenario.<br />
<br />
all the best,<br />
