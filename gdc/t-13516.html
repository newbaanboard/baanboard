=======================<br />
<br />
[Johannesburg, 5 November 2003] - In order to move from outdated technology into a strong upgrade path for future business expansion and continuity, Shatterprufe has embarked on a major project by providing the basis for an enterprise application integration platform.<br />
<br />
The first step towards this future growth path was the upgrading of its Baan site from IVB2 to a higher version, IVC4.<br />
<br />
Comparex Africa was awarded the contract to implement the upgrade and it had to face a number of project challenges including:<br />
<br />
* Completing the project within six months.<br />
<br />
* Converting a massive amount of data and transferring over 2 000 customised sessions to the new version.<br />
<br />
* Performing the entire migration in only 80 hours.<br />
<br />
These challenges were intensified by Baan having to interface with 25 different external third-party systems, while the project team had to deal with ongoing support requirements throughout the project. All of these challenges had to be coordinated across 12 different logical companies, set up within Baan.<br />
<br />
According to Cedric Parker, IT manager at Shatterprufe, this set the scene for a pressing challenge. &quot;There was uncertainty as to whether we would be able to complete the migration process in the time available (a long weekend) and thereby avoid the disruption of normal business activities.<br />
<br />
Found this story today. May interest some of the companies that run Baan 4b:<br />
<br />
&quot;From the outset of the project we had a comprehensive plan covering everything that needed to be done to successfully convert from Baan IV B2 to C4. This included extensive testing of C4 functionality and involved both users and the Comparex project team. We were always confident that with good project management we would successfully achieve the milestones set out in the plan, and this is what transpired,&quot; says Parker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks to some innovative work by the Comparex team, we were able to complete the migration process well ahead of schedule and C4 went live without a hitch on the due date and on time,&quot; commented Parker.<br />
<br />
Johan Herselman, divisional manager at Comparex Africa, says the changeover to the new technology was run according to the standard Comparex Africa project management methodology. &quot;This was supported by a committed Shatterprufe management team and every aspect of the migration was staged at Shatterprufe's DRP service provider to ensure this part of the process was applied to effectively manage risk,&quot; he said.<br />
