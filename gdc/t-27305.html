<br />
I am considering doing the CPIM certification from APICS. I wanted to see if there are Baan people who have done this certification and what their opinion was in terms of <br />
<br />
a) Usefulness of CPIM for Baan technical-functional people (I am a technical person who has learned the functional side over the last 10 years). <br />
<br />
b) The amount of effort required (hrs/day, overall length)<br />
<br />
c) Costs in terms of books, classes, exam fees etc. <br />
<br />
d) Value of the CPIM certification (from a job perspective)<br />
<br />
If anyone has done/is doing the CPIM and is willing to answer any of my questions, I would appreciate it. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
Metbaan</div></div><hr />

I completed mine over 10 years ago and the information gathered was used in everyday business.  The process of studying/attending classes/etc. is probably more valuable than the actual piece of paper received at the end.  The CPIM also helps during a job search in the distribution/manufacturing arena, since it indicates that you are willing to spend the couple of years (if tests are taken 3x per year) to learn the body of material and know it well enough to pass the rather lengthy exam.</div></div><hr />

I have read the materials. It really helps to clarify lots of points I misunderstood before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metbaan</div><div class="date">14th June 2006, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to thank all of you for your feedback on this topic. I think I am going to go ahead and register for the classes and the exam.<br />

Thanks again, <br />
