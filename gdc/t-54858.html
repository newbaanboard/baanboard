<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Migration Labs</div><div class="date">23rd January 2009, 08:38</div></div><div class="posttext">During the last Microsoft Dynamics Convergence in Copenhagen last autumn, it was announced Dynamics AX (Axapta) 2009 does not support the multi-company concept. It covers multi-site but not multi-company.<br />
The difference is that in multi-site you still have a single logistic - single finance set up and use multiple Enterprise Units within this one company (a legal entity). This is how AX 2009 has &quot;solved&quot; the multi-site issue.<br />
However, in AX 2009 you cannot have a multi logistic - multi finance set up (have several legal entities in different countries work together). But, in ERP LN, like in BAAN IV, this is not a problem.<br />
Microsoft was asked whether they have plans to enhance AX 2009 or future versions so they can also cover the multi-company concept and the answers was &quot;No because AX is not meant for such large customers&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is great news for ERP LN as about 2,000 BAAN IV customers worldwide are planning to change their current ERP version. Companies that work internationally very often need the multi-company concept and so AX 2009 is not an option for them.<br />
If you know your client is considering a move to another ERP system (especially to AX 2009) tell them this information and convice them to stay with Infor and migrate to ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />
