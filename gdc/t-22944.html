<br />
Part of their spin boasts &quot;...SSA Global is the third largest provider of ERP and extended ERP systems globally with 13,000 active customers in 90      countries...&quot;<br />
<br />
Probably true and due in no small part to their Baan purchase. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bamnsour</div><div class="date">28th January 2005, 09:18</div></div><div class="posttext">It was announced yesterday that Infor is aquiring MAPICS.<br />
<br />
See this http://www.amrresearch.com/Content/View.asp?pmillid=17968<br />
<br />
&quot;The combined company will have revenue close to $600M. While Infors customer count is now higher than the active 13,000 reported by SSA Global in late October, the revenue is slightly smaller. For the year ending July 31, SSA Global had revenue of $637.8M. The two companies now rank fifth and sixth in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) market behind SAP, Oracle, Sage-Best, and Microsoft Business Solutions&quot;.<br />
<br />
For those interetsed in the evolution of MRP, MRP II and ERP, this may shed some light on the history of MAPICS - http://www.itjungle.com/breaking/bn012705-story01.html</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">31st January 2005, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">The article pointed to by jjx124 (is that an SSA alias?) has a couple of interesting points.<br />
<br />
(1)  SSA is moving its regional hq to Singapore (Is that not where Baan's was). This probably makes a lot of sense considering where the market growth is, I wonder if he (CEO el supremo, etc) includes the support center in this calculation? <br />
<br />
(2)  Not sure that it really means anything, but I should think there would be no doubt on a revenue basis that SSA is now in number 3 spot after JDE the PeopleSoft are out of the equation. But I think spots 1 and 2 have a lot more zeros before the decimal point when looking at their revenue and profit numbers.<br />
<br />
(3)  How will it feel being an IPO investor just for sake of paying the share proceeds from (their) unsecured investment to the existing owners as a dividend and not to buy out / reduce the existing owner's investment?  I wonder how the IPO shares will rank along side those of the original investors in terms of dividend entitlement and quantum, voting rights, liability etc? <br />
<br />
(4)  Looks like the accountants have been flat-out again with the numbers. The reported earnings for the first quarter of 2004-2005 year of $167million are stated to be up 18 percent on the corresponding period in the prior year. This is only a little up on the average of $159 for the whole year ($638/4) and must look pretty sick against the 4 th quarter figure if we are to consider a gradual and sustainable growth in revenue over the year from the $142 for that quarter last year.  <br />

Terry, just using a simple user ID.  I'm not associated with SSA, just encountered an interesting article and thought I'd share it.  It's always good to see positive news on the product.</div></div><hr />
