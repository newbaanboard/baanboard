It looks like a large portion of Internet users are currently suffering from a DDoS (Distroibuted Denial of Service) attack. My firewall logs have been clogged up for hours showing thousands of hosts trying to gain access using port 1434. It looks like the hackers are using a well known vulnerability in the MS-SQL server which you can read about here:<br />

<br />
I would strongly advise all users who are using MS-SQL that ther servers are properly secured and that they are not participating in this DDoS attack.</div></div><hr />
