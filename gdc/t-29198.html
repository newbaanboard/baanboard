I wanted to know if QKEY ,Rush ,RMCgen used for the wrapper technology is useful in case we already have access to the standard script and we have an option to copy the script and modify it and write another session to serve the same purpose.Does it have any advantages w.r.t Service Pack changes also getting included automatically in case we use wrapper technology which is the main disadvantage if we copy the std script and make changes ?When we use the freeware rushdll it requires the std baan dll tccomdllrush for its execution is the script available in this forum or should we request the same from baan.<br />

The advantage of using this technology is that you do not have to modify standard baan.  The technology works off the most current object.  So when you get a patch for an object your code should just work off of it. If you maintain baan standard code everytime you get a patch you either have to incorporate your changes or copy the new changes into your code.  Of course Baan will not support your code.  With Qkey, Rush and RMCGen all you have to do is remove your object and test against standard baan - which baan will support.<br />
<br />
Dis-advantage is that you can not change functions - you can call different ones, or rewrite the one that gets called.  Not as flexible as maintaining the actual source code.  Sometimes debugging can be difficult when trying to figure out whether a problem is in your code or baan code.<br />
<br />
We use Qkey and I am glad we have it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th January 2007, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't speak for QKEY, my company, RMCis puts out a similar product called RMCgen.  The concepts still work in LN, you can wrap the UI script, add code to it, create your own sections, etc.  However, since so much of the logic has been moved and overridden by the DAL's, the results are diminishing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sikima</div><div class="date">29th March 2007, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">As I know, Qkey is working with DAL. Also, Qkey is working on new porting set (8.2) - not sure about 8.3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naabi0</div><div class="date">29th March 2007, 22:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I was told by Fullscope that it won't work with LN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">29th March 2007, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, can't speak for Fullscope/Qkey here.  But for ours, it 'works' for the DAL, but there is a problem sending Arrays as arguments, and some DAL's use that, as do some libraries.   Also, the DAL's are changed/patched so much in LN right now that it's very high maintenance.  We would not recommend wrapping the DAL's without very careful consideration, and if it is passing arrays as arguments, we do not support it.</div></div><hr />
