<br />
Since everybody now wants my hourly rate, I am wondering what acceptable rates are here in the US.<br />
<br />
If you have a problem with posting your numbers, please drop me a boardmail.<br />
<br />
I am also interested in any known pitfalls with this type of operation. <br />
<br />
Thanks guys.</div></div><hr />

Thanks to all of you for your response.<br />
<br />
Some of you asked me to publish my findings, so here goes.<br />
<br />
It appears that there is no average rate. There are quite a few factors that need to be considered. The most important ones being:<br />
<br />
- Duration<br />
- Location<br />
- Urgency<br />
- Qualification<br />
<br />
The (wide) range appears to be between $35 and $60 an hour.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, I got offered the same job twice through different agencies. The first one made it sound like $45 was the ultimate price. The second one said it would be between $50 and $55 (of course rooky-me had already signed with no. 1).<br />
<br />
By the way, I didn't get the job. From what I hear they liked my analytical skills but they didn't think I had any hands-on experience (??!!). Next please!</div></div><hr />

ROFL.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">14th April 2004, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">At that rate, it hardly seems worth it.  I know that I wouldn't consider it.<br />
<br />
I wonder if we will ever see the rates of days long past?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">15th April 2004, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  I am running the Supply Chain functions (purchasing, warehousing, distribution etc...) for a 3PL in the health care industry.  I can make more doing functional work than working as a Baan consultant.<br />
<br />
I will be implementing a system, most likely Lawson with a bolt on WMS, my plan is to use this as an opportunity to learn another package and get back into the consulting gigs.</div></div><hr />
