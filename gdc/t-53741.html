<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fieyr2002</div><div class="date">22nd September 2008, 04:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a college student currently researching Baan's ERP for my Enterprise Resource Planning class.<br />
<br />
I need to find information on the following topics. I really need information more specific to Baan's finance and accounting modules. If anyone knows any information on them or knows where I can find information directly related to these topics, I would really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
As far as User Friendliness<br />
<br />
1. Does Baan have tutorials you can use to learn about their modules and how to interact with them?<br />
<br />
2. Is Documentation for Application modules available<br />
<br />
3. To they provide technical documentation?<br />
<br />
Cost<br />
<br />
1. How are costs calculated for the ERP modules. (In my case, I'm starting off with a business that has 100 microcomputer workstations, a Windows NT network, and a Hewlett Packard server supporting legacy systems working with a $1 million dollar budget for the ERP itself(not including upgrading hardware))<br />
<br />
2. Is there anything you can tell me about the cost of configuration and implementation support?<br />
<br />
3. Cost of training support<br />
<br />
4. Cost of maintenance fees and software licenses.<br />
<br />
Basically I need to know how Baan handles all these things. Once again, absolutely any information or links to information would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">30th September 2008, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Try Infor's website<br />
<br />
http://www.infor.com<br />
<br />
They should be able to assist you.<br />
<br />
If not, do a google search for whatever your question is, and find three companies that offers what you want, and ask them for a quote.<br />
<br />
That would be the quickest way.<br />
<br />
Also, I wonder aloud for how long you're planning to run this with your million dollar budget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fieyr2002</div><div class="date">1st October 2008, 06:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha yeah I was wondering the same thing. Ask the writers of my book where I'm getting this case study from :)<br />
<br />
I was actually suprised at how little information I was able to find on the infor website that was specific to what I was looking for as far as what they do in the realm of technical documentation. I managed to find a good deal on the cost of their modules though.<br />
<br />
I gave my presentation today and everything went smoothly. Thank you for your response though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">1st October 2008, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I must ask, what is your major, that you are having a class on ERP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fieyr2002</div><div class="date">2nd October 2008, 05:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm majoring in Information Systems. It's a mix of programming in Java and VB and with a emphasis on the business side like project management, information resource management, etc. The class, Enterprise Resource Planning, was offered for the first time this semester. This semester it was mainly just conceptual, learning about different modules, their functions, the vendors who create them, etc. Next semester, they are planning on installing SAP on computers at the school to show how things work in the real world, or at least, as close as they can get. Kinda disappointed I won't get that experience, but I've definitely learned a lot from the class. I wasn't aware of what companies like SAP, Oracle, Infor and others even did before I took this class.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't aware of companies like that did until I began working with my current employer last summer.  I knew that Oracle did databases, but really had no concept of what ERP was, as it pertains to systems like Infor or SAP.</div></div><hr />
