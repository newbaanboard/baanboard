However, you cannot do many tools tasks such as developing reports and maintaining users. <br />
<br />
Webtop has the ability to cache forms from your sessions so the presentation is fairly quick, it then relies on a bshell backend to handle the processing. So that isn't any different than your typical Baan session. <br />
