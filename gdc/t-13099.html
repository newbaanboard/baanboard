<br />
I added my self to a new service from google to get news alerts about Baan. I get some emails about a hotel in Thailand named &quot;baan&quot;, but it also scans many online newspapers for stories about Baan, the company.<br />
<br />
There have been lots of items in the last few days about SSA and Baan, following SSA's usergroup meeting in Orlando. You may want to check the following story<br />

To avoid alerts of Baan in thailand reset ur alert to <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;baan&quot; in Thai means &quot;house&quot; and it is kind of a convention to transcribe it the same way as the software package.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you do not exclude Thailand from you baan software-related searches, as you can find quite a lot of happening in that respect here. We just launched a dedicated forum for Thai-speaking users http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=74<br />
And... more 2 come<br />
