Guess which company will be their target.  SSA like to acquire companies who are losing money (IFS? Intentia?Manugistics?I2?). The stock value should be low(IFS?Mapics?I2?). They like the AS400 install base(Intentia? Mapics?). Have a product to compete in the SME market(Mapics?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The IPO may be the next step that will enable the Venure Capital investors to get their money out of the company and move on to some other very high return investments.  <br />
<br />
It has been identified in numerous recent posts that the management structure and competencies are not in marketing software but in bean-counting. You may also recall (refer earlier posts regarding SSA and Atlantic partners) that the Baan purchase involved insider information and dealings dating back manny years.    This may be the next (final?) step in that deal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">18th January 2005, 04:21</div></div><div class="posttext">It is sure that the investors want to get their return through IPO and also use the public money to make its size bigger.  But whether they want to quit is not sure.  Until now, the investment in SSA seems quite profitable. I tend to believe the investors will continue to play such games, drive up the stock price and sell the shares. They will become a minority, but it will take some years.</div></div><hr />
