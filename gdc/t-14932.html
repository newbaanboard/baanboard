We are evaluating Business Objects's &quot;Business Objects&quot; Query and Analysis application tools to do analysis and create reports from our BaaN IVc3 database.<br />
<br />
I will appreciate any comments and experiences about Business Objects + BaaN?<br />
<br />
My questions are : <br />
<br />
1. Are the universes really usable and useful? <br />
2. I presume Business Objects is more useful than Crystal Reports. Is this the case?<br />
<br />
Any comments welcome,<br />

It's hooked up mostly with our Baan system (IVc4).  Generally the users are very happy with the tool.  You can create simple reports without any programming skills (as long as you know your Baan).<br />
I believe Crystal was one of the other solutions we looked at before going with BO.<br />
Let me know if you want more info.</div></div><hr />
