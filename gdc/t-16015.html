<br />
If not, would anyone out there be interested in purchasing one? We're in the process of developing this monster!<br />

We have a package - RMCtime, it is a full Time and Attendance and Payroll interface (ASCII export to a payroll system).  It integrates Hours Accounting as well.  It runs in Baan sessions or through DDC.<br />
<br />
It sure was a monster :)<br />
<br />
Let me know if you need any advice or want to discuss, I have spent a LOT of time on it over the last couple years.  If you are interested in a demo, let me know as well.<br />
<br />
Also, SSA has a high end HR package that is very slick, built on Cognos and supposedly integrated with Baan.  I saw the demo and was very impressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You saved me a whole lot of coding.  I will check out both products.  Can you give me a link to info on the module you designed?  The client is not a manufacturer, so they don't require hours accounting functionality.  They need payroll, and HR with vehicle management functionality for the sales rep cars.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks again and dont forget to send info on your Payroll package.  Hurry, they want to make a decision next week. :cool: <br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
