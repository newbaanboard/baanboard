Infor: The $2B Enterprise Application Company You&#8217;ve Never Heard Of<br />
Here&#8217;s today&#8217;s test:<br />
Who&#8217;s the third largest enterprise application vendor?<br />
Who grew revenue by more than 300% in the past year?<br />
Who has more enterprise application customers than SAP and Oracle combined?<br />
The answer to all three is Infor Global Solutions. The company hasn&#8217;t even been in<br />
business for five years, but is shaking up the enterprise applications industry with an<br />
interesting new business model and a passion for acquisitions that makes Larry<br />
Ellison look like a window shopper.<br />
Who is Infor?<br />
Since it was founded in 2002, Infor (originally known as Agilisys) has been one of the<br />
software industry&#8217;s best-kept secrets. It began with a team of software industry<br />
veterans and private equity firms that recognized the bursting of the Internet bubble<br />
and the recession created an opportunity to assemble a new kind of application<br />
business.<br />
Its first purchase was a process-industry ERP system called Adage, followed shortly<br />
by a group of applications focused on the auto industry. Company executives say they<br />
intended to create a portfolio of products for specific vertical markets, and then it was<br />
off to the races. Infor and its major investor, Golden Gate Capital, have made an<br />
unprecedented string of acquisitions that have taken the company from startup to<br />
more than $2B in revenue in just four years.<br />
A group of AMR Research analysts met with Infor Chairman and CEO Jim Schaper<br />
and his team to discuss the company&#8217;s business strategy, technology direction, and<br />
product plans for the dozens of applications it has acquired.<br />
<br />
AMR RESEARCH<br />
14th December 2006<br />
We learned that the company remains committed to its original concept of assembling<br />
products for specific vertical industries, size segments, and geographies. It is also<br />
happy to sell either broad integrated suites or niche products into its own customer<br />
base or anyone else&#8217;s. Mr. Schaper also made it clear that, although the company is<br />
digesting a bit after making three massive acquisitions in August (SSA Global,<br />
Systems Union, and Extensity), it is not done yet. The company&#8217;s objective is to<br />
push revenue to between $3B and $4B in the next two to three years, which clearly<br />
means more major acquisitions.<br />
Infor does not necessarily feel bound by traditional market segmentation boundaries,<br />
but it believes that its addressable market is roughly one million companies with<br />
between $25M and $2B in annual revenue. About half of the revenue today comes<br />
from maintenance, while professional services and licenses are about 25% each.<br />
Management believes that over time the services revenue will remain flat, while<br />
organic license growth should be in the mid-teens. They claim their maintenance<br />
retention rate is 95%, substantially higher than the enterprise application market in<br />
total.<br />
While this model would result in respectable organic growth in the high single digits,<br />
the real growth strategy is to continue acquiring products and companies in the<br />
existing verticals and adjacent markets. This will generate additional maintenance and<br />
license revenue and increase the opportunities for cross-selling within the evergrowing<br />
installed base. The company believes that it has developed a very disciplined<br />
and effective process for evaluating, acquiring, and assimilating software businesses,<br />
and it intends to capitalize on this core competency.<br />
The company<br />
Infor is organized into three major product businesses that are responsible for sales,<br />
support, and development of its products:<br />
Enterprise Solutions Group (ESG)&#8212;Manages a number of ERP systems for various<br />
vertical and geographic markets, and also contains the global accounts sales team<br />
Financial Solutions Group (FSG)&#8212;Has all the financial and HCM products plus some<br />
independent business units for smaller product lines<br />
Strategic Solutions Group (SSG)&#8212;Contains a variety of products in application<br />
segments like CRM, enterprise asset management, SCM, and performance management<br />
<br />
AMR RESEARCH<br />
14th December 2006<br />
These product groups work together and separately to offer products to 25 vertical<br />
industries within the manufacturing, distribution, and services areas. In some areas,<br />
the company is only a minor player. In others, however, it is the dominant software<br />
provider.<br />
For instance, Infor has tremendous penetration within the automotive supplier market,<br />
industrial machinery manufacturers, and wholesale distributors. But even in those<br />
industries, the Infor brand still lacks visibility. The company is working hard to<br />
package and brand a set of go-to-market products and extensions for each industry,<br />
company size segment, and geography where it would like to play.<br />
Infor customers<br />
Infor now has 70,000 application customers, and most of them didn&#8217;t even buy their<br />
products from the company. This means that there is a tremendous amount of interest<br />
in what Infor&#8217;s strategy and policies will be regarding customers and products.<br />
The good news is that Infor has a philosophy and strategy that is very customer<br />
friendly. Customer retention is a main focus because maintenance and cross-selling is<br />
its largest revenue opportunities, and that requires happy customers.<br />
Infor is committed to supporting and enhancing all acquired product lines and says it<br />
has no plans to retire products. There is also no strategy to merge the product lines<br />
into some amalgamated product or to force customers to migrate from one product<br />
line to another.<br />
While Infor is investing in functional and technological enhancements for its<br />
products, its approach will be much more evolutionary and the enhancement<br />
prioritization will be very customer driven.<br />
Traditionally, software vendors dedicate a major part of their R&amp;D investments to<br />
enhancements that might increase sales to new customers, either by expanding the<br />
product footprint or addressing adjacent markets. This means that existing customers<br />
are often facing the expense and disruption of new releases with very little new<br />
functionality that applies to them.<br />
In Infor&#8217;s case, the strategy is to expand product footprints and enter new verticals<br />
through acquisition. This means product enhancements will reflect customer requests<br />
and be packaged into smaller, low-impact upgrades.<br />
<br />
AMR RESEARCH<br />
14th December 2006<br />
Infor freely acknowledges that not all products in the portfolio will get equal<br />
investment. It categorizes products based on market demand, the size of the installed<br />
base, and customer characteristics, allocating resources accordingly.<br />
To its credit, the company is trying to be transparent about its plans for each product<br />
line. It has published statements of direction for many of the major products that<br />
provide detailed information about its strategy and development plans, as well as<br />
current and anticipated compatibility with other complementary products. This is<br />
exactly the kind of information that CIOs need for planning and investment purposes.<br />
Conclusion<br />
Infor is a relatively new player in the enterprise applications club, but Jim Schaper has<br />
assembled a very experienced team of software professionals. In addition to its<br />
internal staff, Infor is also benefiting from the acumen and enormous resources of<br />
Golden Gate Capital, which has become the premiere private equity firm in the<br />
software business.<br />
At the moment, the company&#8217;s rather unique strategy is working well. The revenue<br />
and profitability numbers are very impressive, and the growth in new customers and<br />
licenses is far better than we had guessed. The company now needs to put some effort<br />
into building brand awareness&#8212;being the $2B company that no one has ever heard of<br />
doesn&#8217;t do them any good.<br />
The inevitable question for a business like this is, &#8220;What&#8217;s the exit strategy?&#8221; Mr.<br />
Schaper answered it before we were able to ask it. The expectation is that at some<br />
point Infor will go public via an IPO, although the timing is still uncertain. The<br />
company still has work to do to get all of the business on common systems and<br />
processes and to get Sarbanes-Oxley&#8217;s internal controls in place. Mr. Schaper<br />
indicated that the company would be ready for public reporting by the fall of 2007,<br />
but that no decisions had been made about an IPO filing.<br />
Private-equity-financed rollups are quite common in other industries, but no one has<br />
attempted one on this scale in the application software market. At this stage, all the<br />
signs for Infor are very positive: the customers seem happy, the numbers are<br />
excellent, and the investors seemed poised to realize a huge return.<br />
The question is how the market will respond. Will customers see this as a safe and<br />
attractive model for a software supplier? Will other software companies and/or<br />
investors seek to duplicate Infor&#8217;s success? Will the consolidation encourage the<br />
formation of new, startup software companies? Stay tuned.</div></div><hr />
