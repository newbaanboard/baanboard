I intend, in fact, am required to carry out case studies in Malaysia to study the impact of ERP on organisational change of Malaysian companies. Hence, it is critical for me to get access to companies adopting ERP systems in Malaysia.<br />

<br />
1. identify companies employing ERP in Malaysia;<br />
2. get access to your company/ customer's company etc.;<br />
