Yes my friends, I am moving to the dark side and burning my baan ships behind me. <br />
It's been an interesting decade and I'm throwing some hard-earned experience overboard, but the time has come to move on to greener pastures ;)<br />
Today is my last day as a Baan expert. Next week I will be an SAP rookie.<br />
<br />
Special thanks of course go to Pat who has built this community and kept it alive all these years. We still need to do that beer, my man.<br />
<br />
Vamsi, it's been a pleasure meeting you. If you're ever in Europe, give me a holler. Also, your contributions were never short of brilliance.<br />
<br />
Mark &amp; Lisa, the BB tools gurus, you two have saved my ass many times. Thanks for everything.<br />
<br />
Prashant, we had some interesting discussions and you too are always there to lend a (sometimes stealthy) hand.<br />
<br />
Edwin, I had fun on our little project together. We should get together too some time. Say hi to Willie for me.<br />
<br />
Everyone else, thanks for all your contributions. The answers to my questions and your questions that made me think, explore, and learn.<br />
<br />
Well, let's not get too sentimenal ;)<br />
<br />
I left a little farewell gift on the util SIG. Hope you like it. <br />

I have been planning to do that for a while. Any suggestions for me on how to go about doing that? How did you learn SAP and how did you get this break? I think thats too many questions. Dont mind I am just curious to know how you got into that. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you.<br />
