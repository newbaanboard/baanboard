<br />
It is difficult to find a public class, or at least one that does not get cancelled because of low enrollment. <br />
<br />
I do give classes in Baan and I am also local to you. I have worked for Baan as a tools instructor, and still I have been contracted to teach ERP ln over the last year.<br />
<br />
If you are interested please contact me.</div></div><hr />
