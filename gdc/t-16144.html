<br />
I am just the Finance part of our implementation Team, but I do not remember that we had problems to the multibyte font. <br />
The bigger was problem the logique of chinese finance transactions and cultural things, between chinese and german culture. <br />
There is a chinese localization, but at that time, 2001, there was no solution for the preprinted invoices from the government. <br />
If the problem still exists, call again please. <br />
<br />
Regards, Juli</div></div><hr />

On the country specific note, it will specify the characterset of the DB and also the environment setting of the Operating system.<br />
<br />
Since Baan does not support Unicode, you cannot input Chinese characters and German characters in the same installation :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camilla</div><div class="date">10th August 2004, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for answering to me. i understand the problem. But I can solve it buying another server. Do you think that is possible for me having BaaN in Chinese on a Win 2000 server? Has it to be installed in chinese? In this moment I have 5 companies centralized in my server, that is a Unix server. But, I would like to install BaaN for my Chinese companies on another environment. My only doubt is: could I have a user working in english?( for making maintenance to BaaN!)<br />
Thanks a lot<br />

Simplified Chinese characters contains ASCII code. You can switch the user interface between Chinese version (o) and English version (2), but not other European language, like German.</div></div><hr />
