<br />
We are based in Kenya and would be interested in support partners in Africa first based on proximity, Asia and Middle East.<br />
<br />
The kind of support would be technical support and development support, i.e change requests;, annual support, licensing; it may require the consultants to visit our site and probably spend some time fixing our issues.<br />
