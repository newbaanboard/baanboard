<br />
So ladies, come on up and show yourself to the men of this forum. We are new men and appricate the finer  working members of this merry band... <br />
<br />
Now, I can't promise there will be no flash photography, or even no flashing at all, but it would be nice to know which members of this team are of the fairer (well, okay cleaner fighting, no maybe not, more looks better in clothes) ***.<br />
<br />
So do we have our first lady to stand up and by counted?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had not told me I would still deem 'Jan Park' to be a man. :) Thanks for correctin that! What are your interest in Baan up in Aberdeen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Patvdv,<br />
<br />
Yes...I get that all the time!! People call expecting to talk to a man and get quite a surprise.<br />
<br />
The address is a little misleading. I got involved with Baan as a key user on an implementation in a paper mill in Aberdeen which has now closed down so I find myself working as a Baan business analyst in Hemel Hempstead. (Makes for a long drive to work lol).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe,<br />
<br />
Do you know  that Hemel Hempstead would translate to Heaven Hempstead in Dutch? :-) Must be a wonderful place you're working in! <br />
<br />
How's Baan business in Scotland these days? I remember from 2 years ago that there were alot of well paid job offerings for Baan consultants but I don't much see the name of Scotland popping anymore when it comes to job postings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I new a guy called Kevin who did a lot of development work at that paper mill in Aberdeen - I heard they were using Baan ERP. I'll have to find his e-mail address and let him know about this site.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jason,<br />
<br />
Can't say I remember Kevin too well....was he with CR Europe? Still at one point we had so many people doing development work it got hard to keep track! The implementation was 4c4 not ERP. <br />
<br />
Pat, can't say that I know too much about jobs in Scotland in general but Aberdeen is mainly SAP so no jobs there!<br />
<br />
Chris....you shameless hussy you ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">oh well - I'll get in touch with Kevin anyway to tell him about the site.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it's a man's world but if Kevin remembers you let's say that it's a small world.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to hear about the jobs. I am wondering if I should censor bad words like SAP :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If he was there then he will remember. Infact poor guy probably still has nightmares thinking about it! Most of our development guys required therapy after being with us for more than 1 week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 16:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard! Don't worry I won't repeat any of the stories he told me :D !<br />
<br />
Aberdeen is a great place anyway - my bro and his family live there - I needn't mention which ERP software he and his wife work with - but it's not Baan - and you know the oil industry standard! Anyway - I heard those 3 letters are sensored on this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL Jason I shudder to think of the stories you've been told (most of them are probably true if not worse) I still suffer flashbacks in the middle of the night! <br />

I know Aberdeen well as well. A ex girlie of mine went to college for an Art course.
