<br />
Did you get it to work? I had some problems running it from home - things got a bit jerky after the 20th piece. But it seems fine sitting here at work. Such a shame having all that horsepower going to waste on boring old screens and reports.<br />
<br />
I'm going to add some levels and other features - like not being able to crawl through yourself.<br />
<br />
How about a challange  - do you know the other DOS game, gorilla? Nice to see that on the menu too.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Rupert</div></div><hr />

<br />
please add:<br />
if not graphical.mode then message(&quot;Better use the Graphical User Interface to play this game&quot;)<br />
<br />
Hmm, that is not going to do it for my bx client... that does not play either...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">2nd April 2003, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe there's something wrong with my timer OmeLuuk. Although Baan assures me that the timer function is in milli-sec. Did you maybe forget to change direction with the arrow keys? If you don't then you'll hit the right wall pretty quickly.<br />
Any further bug reporting will be appreciated. Release two will have multiple levels and more!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">3rd April 2003, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really curious to see this gimmick in action but don't have a Baan system to install it on. Can anyone post some screenshots? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">3rd April 2003, 11:26</div></div><div class="posttext">:)<br />
Maybe this one goes fine...</div></div><hr />

Morph, have you got any spare time to help me on this one?<br />

It's an honour that you have asked my help on your creation.<br />
Currently I am on an implementation project, but I can always take out some time to play a part in it (afterall one does not get such opportunities very often!!).<br />
Thanks...<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sammeer</div><div class="date">3rd April 2003, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">well i think i can also help on same by simulating , playing &amp; testing the gme &amp; every new version you r trying for:p <br />

<br />
How can I create interest for this thread?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">17th April 2003, 11:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Create a nice solution text for the Knowledge Base of BaanBoard, in which you declare all benificial aspects of the session:  because of the use of the keyboard instead of mouse a pleasant session to run in the RSI minipauses. a nice way to keep your Baan session if not needed to avoid problems due to lost connection with the SESSION_TIMEOUT mechanism ... more you can think of.and post the solution text here... also put the same text in the HELP on the session...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">17th April 2003, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go with the advice of Lucas. We can also make a thread with the downloadable code in the 'Code &amp; Utilities' forum and keep this thread for discussion. Interest on a forum is always based on the number of replies you get!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">17th April 2003, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies, stuff to look into - how about a demo version where the worm drives itself! Anyone into Artificial Intelligence?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">17th April 2003, 15:31</div></div><div class="posttext">A demo sounds an excellent idea! One more thought: how about a universal game engine that would allow development of similar games, ie. sokoban? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">17th April 2003, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">It is always interesting to see how far the Baan development environment can be pushed.  I once saw a consultant playing a version of Asteroids in a Baan session.  UNfortunately he wouldn't give up either the code or the session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">18th April 2003, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">A demo - mode with a random &quot;go-off&quot; mechanism, so it does not die too soon, but it will die sooner (20 or so) or later (&lt; 400). Would be nice... so it can be run to aviod &quot;SESSION_TIMEOUT&quot; for over a longer period of time. But then also restart the demo mode after it died.</div></div><hr />
