<br />
SSA Global Client Forum 2004<br />
<br />
The first event, the SSA Global Client Forum, our premier customer conference, being held September 26th  29th in Philadelphia, PA is fast approaching.  SSA Global Client Forum is the best opportunity for our customers to learn more about strategic business issues and how to utilize software to meet the many challenges your organization confronts every day.   This event, designed for manager and senior level executives will explore contemporary topics such as globalization, mergers and acquisitions, Sarbanes-Oxley, RFID and more. <br />
<br />
Customers can attend over 100 sessions in 13 different tracks to learn about our future direction and growth strategy, as well as how our SSA ERP and Extended ERP solutions can deliver tangible value to your company. Over 25% of our sessions this year are real world case studies, presented by our customers, just like you, wholl share their experiences using our solutions to resolve complex business issues.   And as a BWU Member, we are offering you an additional 20% off the current registration fee.
