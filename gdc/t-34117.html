<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Migration Labs</div><div class="date">12th April 2007, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Now at the beginning of 2007 many companies using older versions of SSA BAAN ERP software are considering an upgrade to Infor ERP LN.<br />
But how to go from one version to the other when so much of the architecture has changed?<br />
<br />
What may sound so unbelievable, can be proven easily by our on-site Migration Labs workshop.<br />
The process works as follows: as soon as we are on-site at your facility we will extract a subset of your SSA BAAN IV or SSA BAAN V data and within 5 days we will show you the major processes in sales, planning, purchasing, production, warehousing, invoicing, finance and controlling in Infor ERP LN using your own individual data.<br />
Especially in case you are considering to upgrade to Infor ERP LN we challenge you to find any other existing Infor SSA BAAN service provider who is able to pull this off in such a short time frame.<br />
<br />
Our Migration Labs promise to you is that easybaan® allows you to migrate your individual SSA BAAN IV or SSA BAAN V data to Infor ERP LN in a matter of weeks where all the others will take months.<br />
<br />
Please mail us at info@migration-labs.com or call us at +1.(757).362.2795 for more information on our on-site workshop. For more details on our unique implementation and 5 step migration easybaan® methodology to Infor ERP LN please visit our website at http://www.migration-labs.com.<br />

<br />
Only a subset of the data including the table references.<br />
This subset is based on a maximum of 5 sales orders that have been shipped and invoiced in BAAN IV. We will retrieve all data related to them including things like items, bills of material, routings, operations, customers, vendors, etc.<br />
A full migration of ALL data in 5 days is not what we offer with our on-site workshop.</div></div><hr />
