<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">17th January 2002, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have lived in Scunthorpe! (don't laugh too much if you're from GB)<br />
<br />
Apart from that Sheffield (born there), Manchester (Uni), Innsbruck - Austria (7 years), Dublin (3 years), Cork - 14 months and Mechelen - Belgium (current abode, work in Brussels).<br />
<br />
My wife is from Toulouse and our daughter was born in Cork.<br />
Would be interested to know if there are any Baan users from Toulouse or Montpellier on the board - send me a private message if you know of any. You never know - I meant end up there one day!<br />
<br />
Have supported Baan users throughout Europe but nothing too exotic.</div></div><hr />

be good if we could get a list of bb teammates by country?<br />

This way neighbours could get in touch easier if they wanted<br />
to. I think it would be much more helpful than this statistics by<br />

more. Don't you think so ?<br />

It is not a feauture of the product. Possibly there might be a hack for it or we could ask for one to be created. However it would still depend on willingness of members to fill out their location in the user profile. Something quite a lot of members do *not* do. <br />
<br />
We will keep the suggestion in mind for the future. Thanks!</div></div><hr />
