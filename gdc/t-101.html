<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Commandeur</div><div class="date">24th August 2001, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I was functionnal and technical consultants and i manage projects from 2 years.<br />
<br />
I use MS Project, MS word, MS Excel, a network directory that i try to keep well structured (very hard) and an Access database made by Astrum to manage cases and some technical tasks.<br />
<br />
I'm not very satisfied about MS Projet to manage complete project. I used it for big technical sub projects (500 days of developments) and it was great. But I have some difficulites to use it to manage a complete project (functionnal and technical side).<br />
<br />
Project size : 200 users, distribution, finance and manufacturing, with a sub-project (subsidiary 25 users, distribution, finance and manufacturing). No configurator. Not responsible for the sub project.<br />
<br />
About methodology we try to follow Baan Target method but my US colleagues don't seem to like it so... <br />
<br />
What type of tools do you use? <br />
What methodology?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">houstoce</div><div class="date">3rd October 2001, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I work for a heavy engineering company that refurbishes and maintains power stations. We have been using the Industrial Project module (TP) to great effect for the last 3 years now <br />
(Baan IVc). Some of our project managers were less that enthralled with the planning board though, so we interfaced to MS Project. I believe that Baan V Project has a built in interface to MS-P. We also make use if the DEM PRI model.</div></div><hr />

Baan would expect you to use this for anything beyond the most basic planning.</div></div><hr />
