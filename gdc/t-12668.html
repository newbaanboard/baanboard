<br />
What does this have to do with regards to BaanBoard?  And I don't like the guy anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">21st August 2003, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Nico, this has got to be the right forum - general discussion &amp; chat and anyway what happens in California affects the IT community as a whole. By the way what don't you like about him - look at his history he has come a long way...<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Rupert</div></div><hr />

Personally I would not vote for him unless he can clearly distinguish himself as non-republican - which he cannot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">21st August 2003, 12:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol Pat - that's a bit difficult when your wife is sitting on the other bench. Yes I'm not sure how he is going to field that one. However it's my opinion that politics the world over needs a revamp, just yesterday we were told over the evening news that the special parlimentary channel would be discontinued as the ministers were tired of us laughing at the images of them snoozing on the job??? <br />
Didn't Reagan do a good job - maybe it is time to hand over Washington to Hollywood.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Rupert</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">21st August 2003, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Think I disagree completely with you Rupert. Reagan did everything except a good job. What he did was to make people believe he did a good job. Just like GW Bush. But the collatoral damage they both will be leaving is huge. <br />
<br />
I agree that some sort of revamp is necessary but not by choosing for the 'other' party. I think the american political system should be questioned as a whole. In the end, compared the European political landscape, differences between democrats and republicans are minor. So the real problem is rooted in the lack of choice and alternatives of a 'rusty' political system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">21st August 2003, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe politics need a revamp, but give it to actors?  The current politicians are actors already, if you ask me.  They tell you one thing &quot;very seriously&quot;, then turn around and do something totally different.  If that is not acting, what is?  And, looking at the last presidential elections in the USA, that was a complete soap!<br />
<br />
As for the sleeping politicians, that has been a problem since the senate in the Roman glory days of Julius Ceasar.  They only think of partying, and getting the most (money) from the job, with the absolute minimum as far as actual work is concerned.  So it hasn't changed in over 2000 years!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">21st August 2003, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">For you European guys sitting comfortably accross the Atlantic: Reagan is the one who convinced Gorbatsjov to let go of the satelite countries like DDR, Poland, Hungary, etc. <br />
Then the people were able to stand up and get rid of the Communist occupation.<br />
In the end even the Sovjet Union disappeared.<br />
I am not saying that Reagan gets all the credits for this but when he had a vision all of us in Western Europe were still dealing with a future shock.<br />
<br />
Last night I watched Arnie doing his press conference and I have to say that he is actually doing it in a &quot;European&quot; style.<br />
Even though he is a Republican he is already bringing in Democrats to help him. <br />
California is in a big mess and they need both sides to work together.<br />
The problem over there (which is a national problem in the US by the way) is that the people spend more than they earn. You would not believe the amounts of debt people have here in the States. Even the Federal and State Governments are affected by this disease of over-spending.<br />
One can only wonder how long will this go on before the whole system collapses.<br />
The positive sign is that many people are now refinancing their home mortgages because the interest rates are so low. The money they save is not for investing in the house but in many cases to pay off the debts. That is also the reason why consumer spending in the US is down. You can only spend your money once.<br />
<br />
To be continued...(until Arnold is elected Governor on Oct. 7)<br />
