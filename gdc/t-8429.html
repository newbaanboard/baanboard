The same group of people contacted me not too long ago whether we - Baanboard - would consider a co-operation with them. We gracefully declined and I think today we got the proof in the pudding that our reaction was right!<br />
<br />
I hate spam!<br />
<br />
PS: of course I never 'updated' anything at this forsaken site.</div></div><hr />

I've always had a warm fuzzy feeling for a good Champagne managerat the end of a project. After all, enjoyment after popping the cork is a true &quot;limited time offer&quot;. <br />
<br />
But a campaign manager! That's all the h*** I need on site!<br />
<br />
Keep up the good parrying.<br />
<br />
