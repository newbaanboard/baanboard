The following Steps involved in ERP implementation<br />
<br />
1.  Pre - evaluation and screening<br />
2.  Packagae Evaluation<br />
3.  Project Planning Phase<br />
4.  Gap Analysis<br />
5.  Re-engineering<br />
6.  Configuration<br />
7.  Implementation team training<br />
8.  Testing<br />
9.  Go to Live<br />
10. End User Training<br />
11. Post Implementation Support.<br />

The most important is after going live i.e. retaintion of existing trained employee in same company.<br />

<br />
First of all I have to understand that what do you mean by &quot;project plan&quot; pertaining to ERP implementation as per my knowledge we have have to make a documented &quot;AS IS&quot; flow of industry, in which all work process must be maped including all type of reports which we are generating in daily, monthly or yearly. That is called Business Process after that we will match existing with ERP. This is a huge excercise not a small thing, it's require a complete team from all area lying at your end. They will make a detailed document in which all the working to related area will be documented. In this process so many things will come out which required reenginnering, may be some of the activity not required of some thing to be done like that. So, I think any ready made project will not solve your purpose. Apart from that for example purpose if you required any base document that I can give you. If still you want a ready made &quot;AS IS Flow document&quot; you can mail me on my personal id jk.sharma@kanoriachem.com<br />
