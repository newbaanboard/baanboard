<br />
I found the Baan IV c &quot;Sizing guide BAAN IV BackOffice (Confidential) released in 1998. This seems old. Does anyone know  if there is a more recent release and if so, where can I find it? We are having functional problems with the baan server as it seems the baan database and user activity has increased in a geometrical increment. The idea is to have a parallel idea of what SSA (baan) wants to sell us.<br />
Hope to find some help with you,<br />
with my best compliments,<br />

I recall having the same kind of problems a couple of years back, and rebooting every night after the job daemon was finished solved the problem.  Some &quot;sloppy&quot; code was retaining memory and resources, and this made the machine go slow...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guillaume.G</div><div class="date">29th October 2004, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a mixed solution :<br />
- Every Night : i stop service : baan and SGBD  (before the backup)<br />
- Every Week (Sunday) : I reboot the server<br />
<br />
And, it's result it's good<br />
<br />
For information, i'm using an another ERP and i have the same problem (and i'm use the same solution : on reboot per week)<br />

Best Regard<br />
