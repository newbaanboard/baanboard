I'm quite interested if someone worked/ implemented iBaan RoutePro, iBaan Human Capital Management, iBaan Corporation Performance Management and/or Hyperion Enterprise, among Baan IVc4 or SSA ERP LN.<br />
Thank you, appreciate!<br />

Anyhow I thank you, and'll try to be more specific in title.</div></div><hr />

I never even heard of these products. I also would like to know, wether anybody is using any SSA products which start with an &quot;i&quot;. I always thought this is vapour-ware or at least &quot;no-clients ware&quot;.  :-)</div></div><hr />

I don't either.. In addition to that: the phrase »Human Capital« has recently recieved the »Doublespeak Award« in Germany. Probably rather difficult to sell a product with a name that stands for »disregarding people as material« (the jury).  :rolleyes: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mihamax</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">i MEAN this is not baanboard, this is ssaboard already!?<br />
So you should look at <br />
http://www.ssaglobal.com/documents/ssa_hcm.pdf<br />
<br />
<br />
take a good look.<br />
<br />
<br />
now, if anyone does NOT heard about them, is invited to make at least some NOT ironical statements.<br />
<br />
<br />
The others, if they are not purely VIRTUAL, are asked to say at least &quot;yes, I do&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much, and YES, is very serious matter for me.<br />
<br />
THANK YOU A LOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, sorry if you do not feel taken serious by me or you think, I am joking about a serious matter.<br />
<br />
In fact I am not. And also in fact, if you do not get any other replies, then you should take a consequence out of our &quot;ironic&quot; comments:<br />
<br />
These are (in my opinion) very obscure, exotic and hardly used products!!!!! Baan/SSA talked about iBaan and diverse &quot;i&quot; called e-commerce related products for a long time, but none of my customers touched them. That's all.<br />
<br />
Sorry again,<br />
<br />
Markus<br />
<br />
P.S.: Interesting question, wether this is baanboard or ssaboard. But most likely SSA would prevent this board from using the noble name &quot;SSA&quot; anyway. The products mentioned sound to me anyway like SSA products with the title &quot;Baan&quot; incorporated for a pure sales benefit. I somehow doubt they are actually related to the core ERP product we all know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mihamax</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">in fact, I found the material on RoutePro under &quot;iBaan&quot; prefix. Don't know for sure if HCM is or is not linked somehow to baan or ssa history, and I'm glad you'll stay objective to whichever brands will prevent.<br />
<br />
The problem is. I have to make an evaluation, whether to develop a module (in baan /LN/ ERPwhatever or out of IT) or just apply and/or modify something already tried, for HR. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I have no idea so far... but I've to make some statements, and maybe to decide before knowing for sure I choosed the right solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Boy, tough crowd.  Sorry, I have not worked with the software that you mentioned either.  But my company puts out a Baan Time and Attendance solution, and I have researched a few that are used within Baan.  What I know:<br />
<br />
High End:<br />
SSA - Infinium:  The high end HR Package that I thought SSA was pushing.  I saw a demo on this, very impressive.  Built on Cognos.  This was a strong stand alone HR package that SSA bought.  At the time the Baan integration was fuzzy, but that should be resolved by now or easily, as they own both products.<br />
<br />
Mid Range:<br />
Kaba Benzing:  Another fairly high end package, though not as big as Infinium.  They have been working tightly with Baan for a long time.   This is probably the most popular system that I have run into.<br />
<br />
Kronos:  Also have a collection driven system that has been working with Baan for a long time.<br />
<br />
Lower Range:<br />
RMCis (My Company):  Collection based system that integrates with Baan Hours Accounting (Baan IV and V) / Baan People (ERP Ln), and provides some additional HR related functionality to standard Baan.  This requires an outside Payroll service to process checks, deductions and taxes.  We provide the integration.<br />
<br />
Connectware, TriNET, other collection partners, generally provide their own flavor of this Payroll Interface through Baan / Data Collection.  Of course, ours is the strongest of this group (yes, that's just my opinion, I have to get that in there somewhere!).<br />
<br />
The Mid Range packages are good out of the box solutions.  The Lower Range  solutions are generally less expensive, not as robust, but more customizable as the collection partners generally have good Baan expertise and are willing to provide custom solutions.  Infinium would be the 'bomb' as far as the HR functionality goes, try a demo if that is the range you are interested in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, for Corporate Performance Management - one alternative that has been working with Baan is CorVu (www.corvu.com).   They have a nice stand alone tool for Business Intellegence, and our company has partnered with them for Baan solutions a few times.   You can contact David Dickson (ddickson@rmcis.com) if you want more info on how CorVu can work with Baan for Business Intellegence.<br />
<br />
Not sure of any other Business Intel. solutions, I think that Cordy's (www.cordys.com) has some claims in this area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mihamax</div><div class="date">21st January 2005, 13:26</div></div><div class="posttext">With all these in mind I'll try to re-think the strategy. I'll ask for RoutePro, to see what things it can do, and I'll try to see closer the developping ways in the BI we'll have, I mean Hyperion, for HR and Payroll. I'll take a look on your BI proposal, but I have a strong limitation in choosing something else.<br />
Thank you a lot for your time and interest, I think now I have a more realistic view on this extensions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">1st February 2005, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">RoutePro is part of CAPS Logistics which includes TransPro and at least one more software. They have customers other than BaaN ERP sites. They were made part of the &quot;iBaaN&quot; packaging during the time of Invensys. Hyperion is a 3rd party BI that has developed an interface with the BaaN ERP Package and is used by some large customers.</div></div><hr />
