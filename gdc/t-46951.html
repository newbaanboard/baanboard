The revised price on Biztalk server 2006 R2 seems very attractive. The major change is the bundling of different adapters (Rosettanet, SAP, Peoplesoft, JDE, Siebel, Tibco, EDI, RFID ...) into one single price, making it an attractive option as ESB.<br />
<br />
If Infor can develop an adapter of Baan ERP for Biztalk server, it will help to make Baan system attractive to new customers, and also keep existing install base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The BizTalk adapter for BAAN already exists and has been developed by CentrePoint, a company based out of Virginia, USA. A few companies in the US are already using it.<br />
It is not just the adapter because some sort of a mapping and programming will always have to take place.<br />
CentrePoint has experience with both the BAAN software and BizTalk.<br />
 <br />
If you would like to have more information about this please contact me at edwin@baanboard.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we also developed an integration kit for a process manufacturer in China to exchange data in real time with Biztalk. From my point of view, our integration kit is not general enough, we still need to code something on Baan server if some new type of data need to be integrated. A general adapter without programming will be better.</div></div><hr />
