<br />
This happens in Mexico. By early July, the tributary system in Mexico (SAT) published a set of rules to be accomplished by all the contributors.<br />
<br />
One of them it is called the Electronic Accountability.  It consist a in a set of reports in xml format where it will be sent to the SAT in a monthly manner.<br />
<br />
Anybody knows if Infor are doing to offer this functionality in Baan?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

but I'm guessing your requirement may be a bit similar.<br />
<br />
For a number of years in Germany, they have had a requirement to have extracted data available on a CD etc. for the tax authorities. It is called GDPdU (Grundsätze zum Datenzugriff und zur Prüfbarkeit digitaler Unterlagen).<br />
<br />
There are a few generic data extraction tools out there that work on various ERP platforms with some configuration e.g. audicon.<br />
<br />
However, Infor Germany had created a Baan specific package and we purchased that.<br />
It extracts data from financial tables in xml format and can be configured to some extent. Perhaps referring to that may help you explain to Infor what you need?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I´ll do that. Apparently Infor Mexico, will develop a functionality to cover this.<br />
<br />
Today I´m expecting some official release of Infor´s strategy to cover this.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">8th October 2014, 02:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, <br />
Well, after a furious search to have a integrated solution for this issue in Mexico, we finally have, choose to develop our own solution using baan tools.<br />
<br />
We had to choose between external solutions that in principal extracts the information from our ERP and process them externally and give us the three reports required:<br />
1.- Chart of accounts.<br />
2.- Trial balance.<br />
3.- Detailed transactions.<br />
<br />
The other approach was to buy the Infor´s solution known as Mexican Localization. Apparently that solution are fully integrated extraction process with several ERP products, but the final product are processed externally. At today I just have a brief document but no demonstration yet.<br />
<br />
Finally, Infor Mexico, developed a solution for Baan IV, Baan V and LN to get the reports directly from our ERP.<br />
<br />
Well, all the solutions has pros and cons. We choosed to develop our solution considering the following points:<br />
a.- All these solutions are quoted in terms of the number of companies located in Baan. In our case we have 20+ companies in Baan, and at a rate of 4K USD each, it became into a 80K USD solution.<br />
b.- For that price we are only buying the standard solution. If we required some aditional customizations and another process changes, it will charge us the required. By example, in our case, the assement of the additional consultancy will cost us around 9K USD.<br />
<br />
For a fraction of that price, we developed in 20 days all the required functionality by the SAT.<br />
<br />
Attached you will find the xml test files obtained with our solution.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you to choose a solution that fits to your needs.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />
