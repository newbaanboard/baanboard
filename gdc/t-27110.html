12th-13th October, Tortworth Court, Wotten-under-Edge  <br />
<br />
Firstly I would like to take this opportunity  to  introduce myself as Vice President for the UK, Ireland, Middle East and South Africa Infor business unit. To further this introduction I would like to extend a personal invitation  for you  to attend the  Annual Combined User Group on 12th-13th October at Tortworth Court. I will attend this event  alongside my  colleagues  Keith Deane, EMEA President and Bruce Gordon Infor's CTO.<br />
<br />
This  year's  programme will not only provide you with individual product development sessions and user experiences but allow you for the first time to hear face-to-face from Infor on corporate strategy. <br />
<br />
I am confident that you will find the 2006 conference of value and I look forward to meeting you there.<br />
