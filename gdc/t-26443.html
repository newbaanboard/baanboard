We have mercury suite and have installed WinRunner and Baan add-in for WinRunner. I am new to WinRunner and our Organization is planning to use WinRunner for testing the Baan application.<br />
It would be of great help if anyone can provide some documentation or user guide specific to using WinRunner for Baan. Any kind of document is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />

See WinRunner is basically uesd to test the functionality of an application. It is a  record and play device that capture the script that u had earlier recorded and replay to verify whether your application is working as per the functionality or not. Don't think that u r going to test BaaN through WinRunner becuase u only need to perform Black box testing and for that there is no need of understanding logical concept. I have so many documents on winrunner but before sending these to you i would like to know whether u r specifically looking for BaaN realted document or not. as u r new to winrunner so first u need to understand what is winrunner and how it works once you understand the concept you wouldn't find that it hard to test any application.<br />
<br />
So let me know your remarks.<br />
