Projections are that there will be an A&amp;D support in 2009 - last I heard, but who knows when it will go away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">We are planning on using Baan IV for at least another 4-5 years.<br />
<br />
We have 70 users on Baan, and are fairly happy with it.  We have written several customizations to handle specific requirements.  Our executive team is fairly happy with our use of Baan, and has little interest in investigating other options.  The cost of changing Baan for another option would be quite high.<br />
<br />
When we started using Baan, we said we were planning on a 10 year life span, and I suspect that we will end up using it for 10 - 12 years in total.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 23:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We are now ~9 years live with baan IV (680 users). I think we will change in 4-6 years. Our next system will not be baan (european decission, not a decission of the german department). We've made many customizations, but most is completely new (own development, meanwhile 95%-99% internal).<br />
For my pitty we will not go to LN. Development/Cutomizing/Optimisation is easy in Baan IV if you know what you are doing (like always :D ). In this case you also don't have so much problems with updates/new service packs. It is a great base system for customizations. In LN (as far I've seen it) it is more complex, but you have much more possibilitys (and many features we've programmed).<br />
<br />
I think baan IV will go end of live if the last customer leaves the platform - or stops paying for support. Whatever comes first.<br />
