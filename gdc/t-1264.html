<br />
If I were running Baan....<br />
<br />
- I would dream of Lee Iacocca and sleep tight<br />
<br />
- Wonder why the website (www.baan.com) is not bagging the best maintained and creative site award<br />
<br />
- Talk about weaknesses in Project Management and comfortably forget about marketing activities leading to change in conventional thinking (on Baan)<br />
<br />
- Keep iBaan as one of the best-maintained secrets<br />
<br />
- Sharpen the pencil and doodle<br />
<br />
- Look for ways to keep the seat warm and start talking about 6-year road map...<br />
<br />
- Start a rumor about Invensys Baan implementation, draw a smiley, wink<br />
<br />
- Start wondering whether my company had something to do with Talibaan<br />
<br />
- Announce take over of baanboard for tighter integration with lean manufacturing, PLM and whatever....<br />
<br />
<br />
Folks....BTW....I am open and available for the post....and will do a good job....<br />
<br />
(I have no intention of hurting someone nor is this bashing the CEO, Baan). Just felt sarcastic and funny today.</div></div><hr />

I rather not spent on a fortune on solicitors to keep this site going :D</div></div><hr />
