Also check ITtool box - I no longer use it or know the web site, but I think at one time they had a board.  You also might want to search on Peoplesoft, I think they bought JD Edwards(or at least I saw something on it somewhere).  And if you are lucky you will find one almost as good as baan board. :)<br />

Good Luck!<br />

I hope you do not need to start a new forum in the near future.<br />
But I am worried that we won't see Baan/SSA LN flourish again as it did in the late 1990's. I think many of us will find ourselves in another market space where we will be looking for a forum like the one you have setup here.  <br />
<br />
In those mid to late 1990's days whenever there was mention of ERP applications,  Baan was listed as one of the Big-4or5 (SAP, PeopleSoft, JDE, Baan). Those were also the days when SSA was falling rapidly from the pinicle of its BPCS market in AS400(s38) niche.<br />
<br />
The big names now are SAP, Peoplesoft and perhaps soon to be Oracle.  I think Baan/SSA will be regarded as a second or even 3rd tier product. Last year the market vauled JDE at $1.8 billion while it valued Baan at $0.130 billion. The market now values Peoplesoft at about $8billion and SAP at a much higher figure.  SSA Global is just not in that leaque.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of other smaller players in the market. MAPICS and MfgPro are names that have been around for a long time and appear to be profitable. There is also an open-source product that looks very interesting. I think these will be SSA'a real competitors along with microsoft. <br />
<br />
Just as we see Oracle wanting to lock-in the RDBMS with a the purchase of a tier 1 ERP (Peoplesoft), I think we will see Microsoft try to lock in its MSSQL with a large ERP vendor. Although Microsoft will claim to be in the big league with its RDBMS, it will certainly be the one to beat at the low-end of databases.<br />
  <br />
I am sorry to say that I think SSA will be too happy with the maintenance/ support &quot;honey-pot&quot; they bought for $130 mil to want to put the Baan software back up in the big-league. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smanohar</div><div class="date">7th November 2004, 06:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Have any of you guys come across an application development framework in the  Open Source Community which has the Baan tools functionality.<br />
<br />
The few things that comes to my mind are:<br />
- Database independent<br />
- OS independent<br />
- Authorization mangement<br />
- Audit management<br />
- Ability to access through thick client or thin client (web)<br />
- Dynamic Form functionality (changing form fields based on index, hiding fields based on authorization, etc.)<br />
- Easy of application development<br />
- Reporting<br />
- and much more<br />
<br />
If such an application framework exists in the Open Source community, we could build an application.<br />
<br />
PS: I checked GNU-Enterprise. But their tools are no where never Baan tools functionality.</div></div><hr />

Hi Terry,<br />
<br />
Your comments are so true.  I'm sure Baan will not flourish again, and SSA will be happy with the honey-pot as you say.  SSA have bigger fish to fry anyways.  <br />
<br />
Myself, like many other members and mods are sadly already working &quot;in another market place&quot;.  But thats life I guess.  Shame is that we have a great forum here, with high potential, but with interest in a field going in the wrong direction.  Areas which do have the right direction don't have these kinds of forums, doh! (... with the exception of sites that have ripped our ideas http://www.sapfans.com/forums/index.php   :mad: )</div></div><hr />
