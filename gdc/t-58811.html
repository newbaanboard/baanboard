<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MK_BAAN</div><div class="date">11th July 2010, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All<br />
I need a suggestion from you all as soon as possible you can provide. I have got an opportunity from one MNC for BaaN as SSE. But I am not able to decide what to do. Should I join or not. <br />
I am working as a baan developer but I am not much proficient in it. I do small customization not so much advance.<br />
My worry is whether I will be able to work as per their expectation or not. If I will be given advance customization then I may not be able to work but I can learn and perform well. But company should be ready for this. So, what to do.<br />
Plz Plz help me out. Waiting for you all reply and suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />
Mohan</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they have selected you, which means you must have gone through some screening process by them.<br />
<br />
They know what your capabilities are, and as you said you can learn and perform well, these qualities  a company looks for. Go Ahead join. <br />
Best of Luck :)<br />

<br />
As you must be aware, I do not think anybody can predict the Future. Be Positive, go ahead assuming that Future will be bright. <br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />

Thanks to all for your valuable suggestions.<br />
Still I want one suggestion &quot;What is the Future of BaaN&quot;.<br />
Will it be on demand or not in Future. Should i see for Other Technology rather than BaaN since I am having different technology option too. Thats why I am asking.<br />
<br />
Expecting suggestions from you all at the earliest.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
I wouldn't consider building my career on any ERP system (or ERPs in general). The industry is changing too fast.<br />
<br />
My advice is to:<br />
1 - Take the best opportunity you can get<br />
2 - Learn all you can, while you can<br />
3 - Never feel like you're locked into one platform / product<br />
4 - Don't be afraid to take chances<br />
<br />
I went from Baan Admin -&gt; Oracle DBA -&gt; PostgreSQL DBA and am still evolving.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rajeshk</div><div class="date">31st July 2010, 08:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Good comment there Dave. <br />
Evolving, specially in the IT industry, is the key to survival. <br />
Everyone evolves over a period of time. <br />
I guess so will Infor. <br />
I feel its the way one evolves, which may or may not be in one's hands, that decides the future. <br />
<br />
As for you Mohan, if you are young, go full throttle. Move around (max 2yrs at one place); get different experiences, but maintain a plan to settle down. <br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
     When you applied for the opportunity - you didnt think about it<br />
      When you gave the interview - you didnt think then either<br />
      Now when you have to join - Why think so much ? <br />
       <br />
       Be positive !!!!! Every opportunity is a learning phase ...Good Luck!!</div></div><hr />
