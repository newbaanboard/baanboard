<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">17th August 2001, 12:40</div></div><div class="posttext">That depends on whether people see this as a dicussion area for Baan or Baan issues, or Baan problems. <br />
<br />
<br />
Personnally, I just post whatever takes my mind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">17th August 2001, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that is way we have a mix of sensible and non-sensible forums so that everyone can find what he/she is looking for :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 20:54</div></div><div class="posttext">still not that many problems being raised here - hard to believe that most people have fairly stable systems. Can't imagine things will stay quiet for much longer though - once we get to September especially.<br />
<br />
Apropos quiet in August - don't Fiat and Italy go on holiday this month? ;) (just kidding). Any Italian members on the board?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">It is true that August is always a quiet month with most people on holiday. As we now have quite a number of people registered to the site, I would imagine that the problems will come thick and fast in the next few months. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, I'm enjoying the quiet time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the bulletin board is evolving in a very positive way. We are up and running just 1 week now and the number of registered users is beyond expectations. And indeed, when people get back from holidays and get more accustomed to the board, the questions will come flying in :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">28th August 2001, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not just the questions, sometimes the actual topics of conversation are thought provoking as well. Some of the ideas are creating little pockets of thought in a few peoples head that I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marlon</div><div class="date">3rd September 2001, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, indeed everybody is working on stable systems ( I guess).<br />
Some questions seems to stay unanswered, maybe that's why ?<br />
<br />
take for example that poor fellow in Manufacturing still waiting to get his questions answered. I think he does not have time to start  and solve the rest of his problems.......... <br />
<br />
keep smiling!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">4th September 2001, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hang in there Marlon.<br />
<br />
Have you any suggestions on how to attract more functional users/consultants to the sight - as mainly technical users seem to be using it at the moment?<br />
<br />
Do you think that technical users are more likely to look for solutions on the web than functional ones and hence are more likely to find this site? I think it might be interesting to start a pole called - &quot;Where did you hear about this site from?&quot; - what do you think Paddy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marlon</div><div class="date">4th September 2001, 19:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Jason, as a matter of fact I'm lucky ( I mean the organisation I'm working for) as my collegue IT specialist is taking care of the system. <br />
Means that I can have time to nagg :D consultants on getting some of my functional problems solved.  Would you have any answers to the topics ? <br />
<br />
As fot the threat - Yeah why not - let' s start <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marlon</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">it takes time, but problems do get solved!:)<br />
Maybe the most difficult one of them all - my PUR price differences - are solved! Had a discussion with one :D consultant!<br />
I'll be testing it and if you are interested, you may send a private mail for the answer!<br />
<br />
Just wanted to let you know!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">20th September 2001, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just meandering through some old threads on Baanboard when I came across this one.  I lead the technical team of a small technical consulting/hardware reseller company with a specialty in the Baan space.  I was at a Baan user group meeting yesterday and I asked someone this very question.  <br />
<br />
The problem the functional people have is that errors are fairly easy to track down (eg. database 510 error when logging in).  But most business side problems have to do with things like developing effective ways to reconcile WIP at month-end closing.  When you encounter problems like this, you CALL people you know in similar businesses to talk about how they handle the issue.  Or, they call a functional consultant that has specific skills in the area they are looking for.  Very few of them would even go the web and ask the question.  <br />
<br />
Also, I noticed that patvdv was aggressive in BaanFans with references to this board in the technical forums.  Did anyone similarly go after the manufacturing and finance side of BaanFans?<br />
<br />
BTW -- did you notice that they really cleaned up BaanFans after this past weekend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">21st September 2001, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Jim,<br />
<br />
You are probably right when you speak of the difference in balance between technical people and functional people on this and other Baan sites. Maybe it shows that technies can get into more desperate situations :)<br />
<br />
We did put ads on most forums on Baanfans but I think some posts were removed and some forums - e.g. project, service - are gone after the cleanup as well. With all modesty I think we may have had some influence in Baanfans cleaning their mess up :) Nevertheless, Baanboard remains dedicated to become the best Baan site out there....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">21st September 2001, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I do think this is the best Baan board out there.  Definitely the best technology.  I have been pleased with the quality of the responses as well.<br />
<br />
The tone of some of the Baanfans post were highly biased against certain religious and ethnic groups.  The anonymous posting and unmoderated forums led to an ugliness that in light of last week's events becomes less tolerable.  I wonder if that had something to do with it as well.  But some forums on Baanfans like &quot;Third party products&quot; were eliminated despite good levels of activity.  Oh well.  We just tell people to come here.<br />

<br />
As a co-founder I am absolutely thrilled by the response to our initiative so far:  the number of people joining up and actively participating in it. Alot of thanks goes for this to the people who have *told* their collegues, friends, family to come and have a look on here!</div></div><hr />
