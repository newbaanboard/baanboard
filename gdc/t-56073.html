We are looking at purchasing a Field Service Software for our company since the BaanIVc4 Service Module is limited and does not offer some of the functions and features we are looking for.</div></div><hr />

Compared with Baan IV there is a world of benefit to do that. Of course the intergation efforts (mostly financial consolidation of costs and revenues), new user experience and application management for additional/new technology needs to be managed.<br />
<br />
There is another solution direction as well. Have you considered looking at ERP LN Service? Service in LN is considerably more comprehensive. See AMR report attached.<br />
<br />
Of course this would mean a second ERP environment. But when looking at the additional effort to launch it - compared with technology from a new service management system - it might be the same or even less. <br />
<br />
You probably have Baan competencies in house and the navigation/architecture will be similar. In addition Infor released with the latest Webtop a common user interface that finally performs well for both versions IVc4 and ERP LN (for free). Also probably some or all ERP LN users would be an upgrade, so they would come at no additional costs. Plus for the integration scenario of management information and financial reporting Infor released MyDay and will release Multibooks. These evolve applications will consolidate and disclose information from both IVc4 and ERP LN simultaneously. These components will bring PSO implementation work, but are standard products that will add no additional license/maintenance cost.<br />
<br />
If you need help exploring this latest option, I can - and would be willing to - help you with that. Feel free to contact me.</div></div><hr />
