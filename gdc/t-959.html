<br />
Please, can somebody tell me more about BaaN knowledge base access?<br />
I mean are there different access types, how the access is granted (I just want to check if we have the corect access rights to knowledge base); can be recognized the access type by user code (I mean the letter folowing the user code means something or is just part of the code)?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Bogdan</div></div><hr />

<br />
in your case the Baan Eastern European Localisation Center should be your first point of contact. They provide general info and First line Support for our Customers in Eastern Europe.<br />
Normally they send the &quot;web account registration form&quot; to the German Support Center - then your web account will be created if you have a valid support contract. <br />
<br />
If you don't know who to contact you can ask the Baan Support Center in Germany - we provide the Second Line Support for the Eastern Eurpoe Area.<br />
From our Call Administartion you can get more info and a &quot;Customer Support Kit&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adastra</div><div class="date">7th February 2002, 00:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure that I understand your question correctly, but most of my cusomters got three userids a, b and c. These were suffixed to the license code, like if their license code was 12345 they would get userids:<br />
<br />
- 12345a<br />
- 12345b<br />
- 12345c<br />
<br />
next part of the information will be your password.<br />
<br />
To get access to you may have to enter the doamin as part of the logon, like:<br />
<br />
Userid: baan-commerce\12345a<br />
Psw: XXXXXXX<br />
<br />
(Domain = baan-commerce)<br />
<br />
Problem is that I am not 100% sure that the format is fully correct.<br />
<br />
To citate what is said on the suppport page:<br />
<br />
&quot;To access the online support services of Baan Global Support, you need a user ID and password. You may register and receive access when you have a valid support contract with Baan.<br />
<br />
Registration is simple. Please complete the registration form [which I did not include: author comment]  below and submit the form. The completed form will be returned to Baan Global Support by pushing the submit button. Baan Global Support will record the registration information and will advise the primary contact of all the personal login codes by e-mail. At that point you may access the advanced support features of this site.<br />
<br />
Each customer may register up to five contacts for full online support access. Full access means you will have the ability to enter new cases, download patches, query the knowledge base, etc.<br />
<br />
You may also register 'read-only' web contacts who may check the status of cases, read information updates, etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
