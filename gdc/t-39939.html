<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">31st July 2007, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Last year when I attended a local sales meeting organized by Infor, an Infor guy said SunSystems finance package would be replaced by Baan finance and Infor encouraged resellers of SunSystems to start switching to Baan. At that moment, I thought the Infor guy had made something wrong. As everyone knows, SunSystems has a much better brand recognition than Baan finance in the market.<br />
<br />
But it seems true now when I see Infor re-package Baan finance as the core part of Infor FMS Enterprise Edition.<br />
<br />
Infor FMS Enterprise Edition = Baan Finance + Vision + MPC Budgeting + MPC Consolidation.<br />
<br />
The integrated of these software will be completed at the end of this year.<br />
<br />
Not bad. At least Infor will put more effort to improve the functions of Baan finance.</div></div><hr />
