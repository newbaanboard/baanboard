<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">29th June 2005, 06:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Just received a personal letter from Regional General Manager announcing that SSA-Global stock began trading May 27, 2005, and suggesting that this will give us more opportunities to comprhend and analyze SSA business performance and mean new levels transparency in their operations. <br />
<br />
I found the following links to NASDAQ quotes  http://finance.lycos.com/qc/research/marketguide.aspx?symbols=NASDAQ:SSAG  and  http://finance.lycos.com/qc/research/marketguide.aspx?symbols=NYSE:SAP <br />
which show some NSE statistics for both SSAG and SAP. A couple of interesting points arise form these:  (1) the relative market capitalisations (a) SSA $753mil and SAP $52,597mil in other words SAP to 70 times as large as SSA-G.<br />
(2) SSA is 96% internally owned whereas SAP is 34% internally owned. <br />
(3) the share price is sitting at $11.58 which is up from the $11 issue price <br />
(4) there appears to be 4 million shares bought at the issue price by internals. This being the case the IPO may not have changed the ownership very much at all.<br />

I fixed the URL issue. I think the '=' in the URL was throwing the parser off the right path.</div></div><hr />
