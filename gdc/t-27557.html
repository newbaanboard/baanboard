<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">12th July 2006, 02:53</div></div><div class="posttext">It is encouraging to see some upgrade activity.<br />
<br />
The article makes a couple of points that will be pertinent to many of us with customised Baan applications:  <br />
(1) &quot;Over time significant levels of data corruption had become apparent, primarily because we were running with numerous customizations, which made it difficult to follow an upgrade path...&quot; <br />
(2) &quot;...SSA Global carried out reengineering of software and conducted system testing...&quot;<br />
<br />
It would be very intersting to find out details of the scale of BAE project and the extent of the &quot;reengineering&quot; and/or upgrade of customisations.<br />
