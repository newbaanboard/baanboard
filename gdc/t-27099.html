First of all let me congratulate you for your efforts in writing a open source connectivity for BaaN.<br />
<br />
I downloaded your zip files (both binaries and source) and extracted the binary files and followed your instructions in the BOBSFAQ.html file. Now, when I try to start the BOBS server (BaaNOleBrokerServer.exe) I get the following error.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Files\Baan\lib\user\baantwobsp.bwc Configuration file not found. Please verify the correct file name.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I know that I have the baantwobsp.bwc file (which is the default) in the c:\Program Files\Baan\lib\user folder. I have double checked it. Not sure what the problem is. <br />

Thank you for your congratulations i hope more people use it and help BOBS to have more features.<br />

I think the problem is that you installed the baan client in &quot;Program Files&quot;, please install baan client in c:\baan or any other folder that does not have blank spaces. I have seen some different problems when you install baan client in a folder with blank spaces.<br />
<br />
And please, let me know if it resolved your problem.<br />

It seems baan was started succesfully, if you have a firewall active where BOBS is installed, please first check your firewall is not blocking the port where BOBS is listening.<br />
<br />
AND if it does not work, in order i can help you, could you please post the next:<br />
1.- What is the Operating system where you are installing BOBS? and do you have all patches? for windows, <br />
2.- .NET 2.0 was succesfully installed?<br />
3.- What is your BaaN version?<br />
4.- Have you set correcly the default connection to baan?, rigth clicking with the mouse and setting the default?<br />
<br />
5.- Please post too your BOBS config file &quot;BaaNOleBrokerServer.config&quot;<br />

<br />
1. Windows XP and patches are up-to-date.<br />

Hi r_nagu,<br />
<br />
I understand that Windows XP firewall is inactive?, it sounds strange to me but just confirm it.<br />
<br />
I saw in your config file that you only changed the IP address on the server, it seems that the problem is with WinSocks; i found this in a forum with the same error &quot;The requested address is not valid in its context&quot; in a .NET app:<br />
This is may be because the IP is not a valid IP on your computer, or maybe the port is binded to another application.<br />
<br />
I suggest you use the ip address 127.0.0.1(just to confirm the ip is the problem, BOBS must work with any IP address) and try to start the server; if it does not work, change the port to 32002 and restart BOBS.<br />
<br />
Please let me know what happened.<br />

	Thats it. My IP address was the one creating problems. I should have checked it first. After I specified the correct IP address, it stated working. I was able to start the server and also write/query data using the sample client program.<br />
<br />
	Now I was just trying to see how this would behave in a read/write extensive situation. I opened up four instances of the client and started to write data from all four clients. It did perform very well during first round but during the second turn and subsequent turns, the client hangs and would take few seconds to unfreeze and perform the actions.<br />
<br />
	Other than that it works great and again congratulations on your effort.<br />

I have uploaded a new file, it is a howto write an ASP .NET app to access BaaN using BOBS.<br />
<br />
I have been seeing that when using with baan IV, some times the baan client is slow executing the apps(as r_nagu noted before), when using in a web environment can not be easy to see it, maybe here we do not have nothing to do if somebody knows what to do in order to do the client faster, please let me know.<br />

<br />
First, thanks very much Carlos for doing and sharing BOBS. I guess it can open new perspectives for BaaN users.<br />
<br />
I finally succeeded to run the server after some probs. On first attemps, when i run BOBS, it was hanging for a while and send msg: <br />
<br />
Can not start BaaN service:System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80080005): Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {00000000-4000-11CE-AAA8-00608C50C597} failed due to the following error: 80080005.<br />
<br />
The prob was the class name in my default bwc file that wasn't &quot;Baan4.Application&quot; but &quot;Baan4.application.ovi&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that it's same value in BOBS and in my bwc file, server runs fine.<br />
<br />
I would like now to use BOBS in OpenOffice macros (OOo Basic), but i've no clue how to do... If one of you knows, it will be great help for me.<br />

<br />
Hi Olivier,<br />
<br />
You are wellcome, I am glad you are spending time with BOBS, i hope BOBS  help you to solve your problems.<br />
<br />
Virtually BOBS can connect from any other language that can deal with sockets.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not a developer of OpenOffice Basic.<br />
<br />
I have been looking how you can do the connection to BOBS and i found the next information:<br />
<br />
1.- It seems that the actual versions of openoffice have problems with sockets, according to this topic:<br />
http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?p=68632<br />
<br />
The good news here is that it seems it is resolved in 2.0.4 version of openoffice, but you will need to know how to develop a program using tcp/ip sockets connection with openoffice basic.<br />
<br />
At this moment i have a lot of work to do and i can not to test this, but if you follow the same rules that in the C# client example it must works, the steps are:<br />
<br />
<br />
a) Connection: Create a socket connection to the server, following the basic instructions.<br />
b) Send the client id text: ClientID = &quot;otdslsdllbobsts|bobstest.end( )|&quot; + DateTime.Now + &quot;\r\n&quot;;<br />
<br />
c) Wait that BOBS answer with an OK text: <br />
                if (ReceivedData != &quot;OK&quot;)<br />
                {<br />
                    m_processState = STATE.DISCONNECT;<br />
                    if not received ok, you are not connected.<br />
                }<br />
<br />
If you received OK, now you are connected and you can send and receive data to/from the BOBS<br />
<br />
sample in C#:<br />
                clientSocket.Send(Encoding.Default.GetBytes(BaaNCommand));<br />
                size = clientSocket.Receive(data);<br />
<br />
Remember allways to close the connection in the next way:<br />
<br />
first, sending the next text:<br />
                clientSocket.Send(Encoding.Default.GetBytes(&quot;[EOS]\r\n&quot;));<br />
                size = clientSocket.Receive(data);  <br />
<br />
C# is waiting to receive data but do not use this data. you must cath all exceptions, i do not know if openoffice basic handle the exceptions.<br />
<br />
If you continue with this development, post your questions in this forum in order i can help you and others can see a way to connect to BOBS from OpenOffice.<br />

<br />
we are planning to use BOBS with an e-Commerce site and it should be possible to communicate with different back-end systems based on Baan. BOBS uses the default client connection. Is it possible in some way to select a different connection at run-time with no user interaction? This would perfectly cover our needs...<br />
<br />
Thanks for replies</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you please explain in a few words, what are the next few rows for?<br />
<br />
private void open_connection()<br />
{<br />
String ClientID = &quot;otdslsdllbobsts|bobstest.end( )|&quot; + DateTime.Now + &quot;\r\n&quot;;<br />
// The firs part(before the first pipe) is the dll name, in the midle is the end function when running<br />
// an API session, and at the end, just the time<br />
<br />
<br />
I assume bobstest.end( ) is a dll function, which should exist in Baan, in dll tdslsdllbobsts. But what is it for, and why it is necessary to build up the connection? Can it be left out, and build up connection without this function.<br />
<br />

<br />
Will your broker for BAAN also work with INFOR Open SOA?<br />
Your open source solution may become very popular among BAAN customers because in the next 12 - 24 months INFOR is going to put a lot of emphasis on their Open SOA initiative to expose all of their products and integrate them seamlessly via a middleware platform. <br />
<br />
Good work by the way!</div></div><hr />

What About BOBS Security? <br />

does it have security implemented?<br />

is it enough secure to avoid injection to baan?<br />

<br />
Hi Diego,<br />
<br />
Initially BOBS has only been thought as service, not much thinking in security.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it is supposed  that you will have BOBS Working in your internal network, so implement security inside BOBS was not a first aim of the project.<br />
<br />
I do not have had much time to continue developing BOBS in order to to injection tests or check security risks, if you could provide help doing it, it would be good.<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
It seems you got this message when you click the button to start the service, is it correct?<br />
<br />
Did you install .NET runtime 2.0? <br />
<br />
You need to install The BaaN Client software, did you install it?, BaaN IV or BaaN V?<br />

In which moment do you get the error?, if you get it when click the button to activate the server, I think the problem is that you are using BaaN LN, BOBS has been tested using baan IV and BaaN V, you will need to compile BOBS using a BaaN LN Client.<br />

<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
It is not posible to send sql command directly to the database at this moment, what i am thinking is that may be you can create a dynamic sql satement and pass this value as an argument for a dll and the dll must return the resulst ins a pipe separated file.</div></div><hr />

Will your broker for BAAN also work with INFOR Open SOA?<br />
Your open source solution may become very popular among BAAN customers because in the next 12 - 24 months INFOR is going to put a lot of emphasis on their Open SOA initiative to expose all of their products and integrate them seamlessly via a middleware platform. <br />
<br />
Good work by the way!<br />

I’m currently working at Ness Australia which has Baan B40c.043 and i’d like to connect to it using your broker. <br />
I tried your program and it gave me “Can not start BaaN service:System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80080005): Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {00000000-4000-11CE-AAA8-00608C50C597} failed due to the following error: 80080005.”<br />

Baan also gave me BW Message Fatal Error : no DsNprogId specified. I couldn’t find any reference on this.<br />
<br />
Apparently not many people having this problem. I have baan client installed on my Vista box (maybe this is the problem?) and i use the most highest admin username and password. On my vb.net application, i have imported the reference from BW.tlb and i got Baan4 namespace listed on the References view.<br />

Can you please point me to the right direction on how to fix this?<br />

Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
I do not have tested BOBS under Vista since Vista has not been an operating system used in companies nor have the environment to test it.<br />
<br />
Anyways i think the problem with vista is the permission system, this operating system is always asking you authorization to execute certain tasks.<br />
<br />
I would install BOBS over XP or maybe over Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Other thing is to see what version of the .NET runtime you have.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps you to resolve your problem.<br />
<br />

Thanks for the quick reply.<br />
I managed to make it work in one only computer which is our Account Manager's computer that has Windows XP and .net 3.5. <br />
But when i tried it in another computer having the same windows and .net, didn't work. Vista is not the problem. I cannot use his computer for this purpose. <br />
<br />
Maybe i missed something from when i installed the Baan client?<br />
<br />
I'm also guessing maybe there are settings that are set up on his computer but he isnt aware of? Because he used to upload and download data from Baan to Excel using the VBA like the samples that came with Baan client.<br />

Sorry for the late reply.<br />
<br />
Please check your BOBS configuration file:BaaNOleBrokerServer.config<br />
<br />
&lt;configuration xmlns=&quot;http://tempuri.org/projects.xsd&quot;&gt;<br />
	&lt;project&gt;<br />
		&lt;projectName&gt;ServerConfig&lt;/projectName&gt;<br />
		&lt;projectSettings&gt;<br />
			&lt;add key=&quot;ServerIP&quot; value=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot; /&gt;<br />
			&lt;add key=&quot;ServerPort&quot; value=&quot;32001&quot; /&gt;<br />
			&lt;add key=&quot;PathForFiles&quot; value=&quot;C:\BaaNOleBroker\&quot; /&gt;<br />
			&lt;add key=&quot;ConnectionTimeOut&quot; value=&quot;90&quot; /&gt;<br />
			&lt;add key=&quot;BaaNVersion&quot; value=&quot;IV&quot; /&gt;<br />
		&lt;/projectSettings&gt;<br />
	&lt;/project&gt;<br />
	&lt;project&gt;<br />
		&lt;projectName&gt;BaaNConfig&lt;/projectName&gt;<br />
		&lt;projectSettings&gt;<br />
			&lt;add key=&quot;BaaNConnection&quot; value=&quot;Baan.Application&quot; /&gt;<br />
		&lt;/projectSettings&gt;<br />
	&lt;/project&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;<br />
<br />
To set the value of BaaNConnection, go to the baan client config, in the automation tab and copy the vale to your BOBS configuration file.<br />
<br />

I hope this helps</div></div><hr />

Hi Haraprasad,<br />

At this moment i do not have the environment to test your scenario but, i think you should start two instances of BOBS, just set a different port in file BaaNOleBrokerServer.config:<br />

&lt;add key=&quot;ServerPort&quot; value=&quot;32001&quot; /&gt;<br />

Thanks a lot for your kindly great ideas on this tool.<br />
I am currently working on it for testing, it seems everything perfect.<br />
Only one thing, in the dll, I had return message in multibyte string, however, in the client (whatever in winform or asp.net website), it always return unreadable string.<br />
<br />
Do you have any ideas on it?<br />
I am not sure about the Interop.Baan.dll support the mutibyte string or not.<br />
