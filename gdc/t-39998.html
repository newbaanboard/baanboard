<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jftello</div><div class="date">1st August 2007, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Companies have jobs and task that arise regularly and need to get done. That's why they look around for a product or service that they can &quot;hire&quot; to get the job done, effectively, conveniently, and inexpensively as possible, for example an ERP solution ((This idea was extracted from the book &quot;The Innovator's Solution&quot; - Clayton M. Christensen, Michael E. Raynor, Harvard Business School Press, 2003). <br />
<br />
And what happen when the product becomes good enough? Companies do not change his product unless they feel threat for a technology that their competitors have and they don't.  That's when they instinctively focus on being able to protect their customer and their current business, looking for a new tool to compete and satisfy their customers need.<br />
<br />
I think this is the reason why companies with BAAN IV do not want to migrate to LN.  They do not see the threat coming and they will not put money in the budget to implement a new ERP solution.<br />
<br />
But, what will happen with our BAAN community that is tired, waiting until this situation change? Are they willing to move their careers?<br />

Cost and Benefit<br />

To encourage more companies to migrate to Ln, increase the benefit and reduce the cost.</div></div><hr />
