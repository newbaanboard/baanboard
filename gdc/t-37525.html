<br />
The invitation is really interesting for Baan customers in Southern California, and also in Northern California and Arizona. If you cannot come to the full event - but would like to hear more about Baan and ERP LN, you can come to the exhibit hall for free (Invitation is attached) and meet lots of companies that have a lot to offer.<br />
<br />
If you are a Baan user and are interested to hear more about ERP LN, then you can meet people that will tell you stories about projects and how they can migrate you <br />
<br />
If you are a Baan user, but are NOT interested to hear about ERP LN, then you can come and meet with lots of companies that offer very interesting solutions for getting more out of your Baan 4 and 5 system.<br />
<br />
So, it is a really unique opportunity to meet with vendors, and also meet with users from around the USA and Canada. If you can come to the full event, then it is better, with tens of breakout sessions that meet the interest of all.<br />
<br />
I look forward to meet some of the BaanBoard friends in the conference!<br />
<br />
Attached is the PDF Guest Pass, which allows you free access the Exposition Hall only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good post and good suggestion!<br />
Since I will be at the event as well I am looking forward to meet you again.<br />
Hopefully more BaanBoard members will show up as well.<br />
I suggest we all order a nice polo shirt from the online BaanBoard shop so we can recognize each other and have a BaanBoard get-together too. By ordering the shirts online we will help Patrick, the Administrator who is putting a lot of his spare time in our community, fund his investment in the new servers he bought specifically for our site.</div></div><hr />
