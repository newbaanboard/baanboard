i'm wondering if i could manage integrating these two systems. <br />
We have an automation machine rolling fabric and there is a plc program running on it. There also exists another 3rd party windows based program handling the job to integrate that plc and our baan system. <br />
this windows-based application collects data from baan table and do cutting the fabric and store the result data to baan tables again. <br />
As far as i know there are at most 10-15 addresses in plc that are used to integrate. If i could read&amp;write to these addresses from baan i do not need the other application any more. <br />
The PLC program is developed by Omron.<br />
I would like to hear any solution developed in Baan for more or less the same aim.<br />
Best regards.</div></div><hr />
