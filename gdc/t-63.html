Baan extends alliance with BSP-US to provide Education services in North America<br />
<br />
Barneveld, The Netherlands and Leesburg, VA - July 10, 2001 - Baan, the global provider of B2B collaborative commerce solutions, has announced the addition of BSP-US as a provider of Baan Education services in North America.  This alliance strengthens the existing alliance between the two companies and expands BSP's Baan services across two continents.  Baan announced in October 2000 an Education Alliance with BSP (UK) Limited, a premier independent ERP consultancy company, to provide United Kingdom users a comprehensive range of Baan Education services.<br />
<br />
Baan North American customers can enjoy a vast array of Education services offered by senior level BSP resources located in both the United Kingdom and North America.  Offerings include public classes being held on both continents, private on-site classes, and end user training customized to user roles.  BSP (UK) has recently announced the official opening of its state-of-the-art training facilities in Milton Keynes, UK, which is dedicated to the Baan products.  BSP-US has recently announced a public schedule of Baan classes to be held in Toronto, Canada.  Both sides of the Atlantic will be offering a complete range of Baan Education classes including Baan IV, Baan5 and Baan SCS products.<br />
<br />
Andre Boone, BSP-US Operations Director comments:  &quot;Our aim is to provide quality education in North America and we will work on satisfying the customers expectations and requirements to the best of our ability with the high class instructors we have on board both in America and the United Kingdom. Most of our instructors have many years of industry experience behind them and that makes them very qualified to the education platform..&quot;<br />

Venkat Muthukrishnan, Vice President of Alliances and Education, Baan Americas says: &quot;Baan feels that the skilled resources at BSP-US will bring in a lot of value to the Baan customers and other alliances in North America by delivering quality education services for the Baan software.  There is demand for this in the Americas and I am confident that BSP-US will meet those customer demands.  The existing relationship that Baan and BSP (UK) has will add value to the North American Baan community&quot;.<br />
