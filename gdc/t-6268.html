<br />
Are there other places to go for licensing? Do companies sell theirs? If so, is it something that is portable like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">telgar</div><div class="date">19th August 2002, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">The price you are paying for license is actually what you are paying for Baan support. There are a few companies that after you are set up and running smoothly will handle your support for less than Baan, but still you have to purchase enough license for your users to log onto the system.</div></div><hr />
