     Well, he'd say - &quot;Here's an easy game to play. Here's an easy thing to say:<br />
<br />
     If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port, And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort, And the address of the<br />
     memory makes your  floppy disk abort, Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!<br />
<br />
     If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash, And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash, And<br />
     your data is  corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash, Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash!<br />
<br />
     You can't say this? What a shame sir!<br />
     We'll find you Another game sir.<br />
<br />
     If the label on the cable on the table at your house, Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse, But<br />
     your packets want  to tunnel on another protocol, That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall.<br />
<br />
     And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse, Then<br />
     you may as well  reboot and go out with a bang, 'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!<br />
<br />
     When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk, And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary risc, Then<br />
     you have to flash  your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM. Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your<br />
     mom!</div></div><hr />
