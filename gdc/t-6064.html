Yeah the info for the SETI project can be grouped and you can join up a group of computers working on a patch of data. so can we expect to see the SETI project screen saver on a collection of systems in businesses all over the world now on behalf of BaanBoard?</div></div><hr />

It's here, we have a team page showing our stats from the board: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/bbinterface.php?s=&amp;action=seti_baanboard<br />

Check it out, join up and start looking for aliens :)</div></div><hr />

Now all we need is a Baan based game of the old Spectrum classic 'Decathalon' for the keyboard bashing and everyone to put thier Baan servers on the SETI project for the weekends!</div></div><hr />

:) Don't get me started on 'Spectrum Classics' - I have an emulator for the PC and 20 or so of my favourite Speccy games that I occasionally have to play 'just one more time' for old times sake!</div></div><hr />

I've just reached the baanboard team .... I am a seti user for more than 2 years now ....<br />
<br />
I have a &quot;problem&quot; : I can't get seti to work on our Alphaserver running Tru64 4.0F .  Does anyone knows that OS enough to help me ?? <br />
<br />
the error is (by memory) something like : &quot;gethostsbyname() : not owner&quot; when setiathome try to reach the internet.</div></div><hr />

Looks like the SETI client has problems resolving host names? Are you running the SETI client as root user or a different one. Is /etc/hosts word readable?<br />
<br />
Welcome to the team by the way! :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and it seems like we have a looooooong way to go if we want to catch up with you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">etienne</div><div class="date">23rd August 2002, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I am root.<br />
They is no problem with /etc/hosts for the other applications (like Baan :) )<br />
<br />
<br />
the message is :<br />

running the command &quot;./setiathome -proxy 193.56.47.21:8080&quot;<br />

the proxy is not in the /etc/hosts file but this working fine with netscape by example.</div></div><hr />

You may want to check your /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hosts.<br />
AFAIK the osf1 libs are more sensible about propper syntax.</div></div><hr />

But yes, I use seti on a Baan server : it's a develepment server running several Baan but most of the time it is idle.<br />
<br />
I've just got it working : I did a dummy entry in the /etc/hosts file and run seti with :<br />
    ./setiathome -proxy dummy:8080</div></div><hr />

I meant the solution may be in the mailing list. And apparently you found the solution :) Let's see how fast your Alpha is!<br />
<br />
It's a pity the SETI client can't handle multi-CPU configurations because otherwise I could 'borrow' a HP Superdome for a couple of days and blast SETI on it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">etienne</div><div class="date">26th August 2002, 13:30</div></div><div class="posttext">No problem with multiples CPU's : you just have to run as much instance of Seti as CPU you have : 2 seti (in different directories) if 2 cpu ...   64 seti if you have 64 CPU's :D</div></div><hr />

For that matter, only James is doing worse than I am. Maybe I need to paddle those cranks a little harder?<br />
<br />
This is becoming competitive. I got 16 CPU's on my E10K segment. Now if only I can convince the rest of the company to put their Baan activity on hold, I may still have a chance.<br />
<br />
Of course I could also just increase my idle time, but that would set me back on Project Dolphin where I am defeated only by....Patrick???<br />
<br />
This leads me to the conclusion that Pat has at least two mega-pc's out there. One for working, and one for doing nothing.<br />

You are very close to the truth! I have 2 PC's at home working away - a dual PIII and a P4 - and I have my office running the SETI client as a background job - also a P4.  Don't think I will ever be able to catch up with Etienne though! :)</div></div><hr />

The figures are starting to look nice and at least my P4 Laptop can now run away with the data for a few hours a day while I leave it on the side. <br />
<br />
The race is now on to be the first one to get some answers (although if after 8 years of processing from one user and still nothing, its not looking good!)<br />
<br />
Now if I can only get every PC I work on to secretly add onto Project Dolphin, then the figures would really shoot up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">18th November 2005, 22:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have decided to remove the SETI project statistics from Baanboard. Since the SETI people at Berkeley decided to move to a new model last March (2005), the classic unit of measuring that was applied in our statistics are not valid anymore. Hence the numbers haven't been changing for the last couple of months (if you noticed it!). <br />
<br />
Since the original SETI project started 6? years ago a number of similar projects have been setup that use the same concept of distributed computing to achieve a goal for the common good. This has been so successful that a specific C/S platform (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) has been developed that allows people to participate in multiple projects at the same time without the need to install or run different clients. You can find an overview of the current supported project here: http://boinc.berkeley.edu/index.php<br />
<br />
Personally I am donating computing time for:<br />
<br />
 SETI@home<br />
 Rosetta@home<br />
<br />
<br />
Start crunching!</div></div><hr />
