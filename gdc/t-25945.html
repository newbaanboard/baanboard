<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anne Curtin</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 23:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We are a manufacturing/distributor company.  If we produce 20 SKU's, we want to pick orders for 500 stores but we want to pick the product as soon as it is produced.  Meaning if 495 stores ordered oranges and oranges were the first item produced, we want to be able to allocate the oranges to a sales order without scanning or typing the sales order.  We want the system to generate any order that requires the oranges for that day.  So we are looking for a picking system, pick to zero system.  Can anyone suggest such a vendor?</div></div><hr />

I work at such a vendor ( so of course take with a grain of salt )!<br />
<br />
We have data collection software that in one, simplified transaction would allow you to report the quantity completed (or received..), and then optionally Generate/Release the Inbound, find the next open requirement, in your case the sales orders, Generate and Release the Outbound, and produce a 'Move Ticket(s)', which you would use to either move the ticket to stock or to an awaiting location tagged to fill the Sales Orders/requirements.   Results can be reviewed, changed as needed, and new tickets printed on demand.  <br />
<br />
Many other 'functions' are available to run on the same system.   Here's a link to our overview web page:<br />

Other vendors provide similar services.  Let us know if you are interested in discussing or seeing a demo.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for replying, we currently have a system to report the finished goods and then putaway (I am assuming this would be your move ticket).  We would need a system to pick the inventory available.  Would we have to generate and release and then create a move ticket for each item?  That would be to much to do generate and release for each item.  Would it be possible to enter the item # that we want to pick and then all orders for that item would be generated automatically?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">22nd December 2005, 01:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah Baan V, right?  Write up above is in Baan IV terms.  <br />
Not sure of your system to report the goods.  Normally this would be our system, and it would continue then in Baan V to Generate Outbound for the requirements, Generate and Confirm the Pick List, and Create and Print the Move Ticket all in 1 step.  We can adjust to start (or stop) at any step.  If you are using our system you may want to look at it for reporting the quantites as well.<br />
<br />
So, to clarify, probably all you would need to enter is the Production Order or Receipt number / line coming in, a quantity, then let our system find the requirements and do the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anne Curtin</div><div class="date">23rd December 2005, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using baan 4c4. We are currenlty using an ADC solution but don't have the ability (yet) to pick orders the way our business is going.<br />
<br />
when you say all you would need to enter is the Production Order or Receipt number / line coming in, a quantity, then let our system find the requirements and do the rest, do you mean Sales order or production batch (we use batches for finished goods)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have streamlined solutions for receipts, production orders, and production batches.  When production (sfc or pmg) quantities are reported complete or PO goods are received, they can be directly applied against any or all types of requirements (sales, production orders, production batches, RPLs, etc.).  You can decide whether to just generate the outbound or go ahead and release it as well.  There are other configuration options as well, but I don't want to get too far into a long, drawn out sales pitch here.<br />
<br />
Feel free to contact either Lisa (lbencic@rmcis.com) or me (evesely@rmcis.com) directly, and we can provide you with more specifics.</div></div><hr />
