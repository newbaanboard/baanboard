<br />
My company is seriously considering the move of our current Baan platform from Windows 2000 to Linux. I have been reading up on some of the threads on this forum regarding Linux and they present some very valuable information, especially this one: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=16726. However I am curious to know if there any companies/consultants offering migration services onto a Linux platform in the Baan area. I would like to hear some feedback from them regarding the technical aspects of a migration and how they could assist us if we decide to go the Linux way.<br />

I can be contacted at johntrombone@hotmail.co.uk<br />
