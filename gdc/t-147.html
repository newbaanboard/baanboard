<br />
I am a new member and I wanted to introduce myself.<br />
<br />
And to answer the question of this forum: <br />
<br />
I am just a normal guy who works for a living - presenty<br />
as Support Analyst for Baan.<br />
<br />
cu<br />

<br />
Well, it looks like its just you and me then who are the normal guys around here :)<br />
<br />
Happy posting and I hope this website helps you in your work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">6th September 2001, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure do, everyone with an interest in Baan is welcome :)<br />
<br />
Maybe we can make  this thread into the place where - for those interested - can give a short description about themselves (personally/professionally).<br />
<br />
Something like a high school year book? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">6th September 2001, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Year Book type stuff...let me see...<br />
<br />
I've had the pleasure (?) of working with Baan for around 3 years now mainly in manufacturing/distribution. Having said that I can ususally be found fiddling around in most areas with varying degrees of sucess/competence. <br />
:) <br />
<br />
leisure time type stuff revolves around the Grand Prix, my horses and evenings spent drinking copious amounts of white wine with friends.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">7th September 2001, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Me, I prefer to be a bit of a mystery. A man of many talents, some good, most bad. A man a great taste and refinement, with a 'man of the people' twist. A man with not enough time on his hands, but great ways to waste what he has..... <br />
<br />
Above all, a man beyond definition....<br />
<br />
I think most people who know me would agree with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Germanicus</div><div class="date">7th September 2001, 22:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Ravenscross,<br />
<br />
if you are a mystery I will have to use my own imagination.<br />
<br />
I guess that you are a very smart looking guy with suit, tie,<br />
mobile, notebook and an incredible smile on your face.<br />
<br />
Always busy as you need to travel so much and I bet that <br />
you are extreamly communicative.  At all parties you are<br />
the &quot;Party Lion&quot; - as we say in Germany.<br />
<br />
Now, am I right? :D <br />

We would love to update our high school year book with information regarding such a knowledgable person !!...<br />
<br />
I can hear you saying Thanks!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that we have met yet. Hmmmm.<br />
<br />
Either I have nearly supernatual power -&gt; or just a good<br />
imagination, lol.<br />
<br />
Or there are some spitting images of you among the Baan<br />
consultants in Germany.<br />
<br />
Or have you got a twin brother?<br />
<br />
Or are you a person made of glas? (sorry I don't know the <br />
propper Enlish term for that)<br />
<br />
Or are you just a normal consultant? <br />
<br />
<br />
:D <br />

So here's my specs: I am a 1969 classic, large pink frame body with a 6.3l gas guzzling engine, size 10 1/2 ultra grip tires, *very* comfortable padded seats and high-volume 4-way stereo system...<br />
<br />
Do you like pink... cadillacs? :)</div></div><hr />

Ah, those were the days, songs you could sing along with, if only you didn't have friends</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimbob</div><div class="date">24th September 2001, 01:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Wondering if there's any brand of car that can be linked to a typical 'Baanie'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deeboss</div><div class="date">24th September 2001, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, why didn't someone just say cars before?!?!?!  BMW...M3!!!  I also have to pledge allegiance to Cobra Mustangs, esp. supercharged ones.<br />
<br />
...told ya I was a tomboy at heart.....<br />
<br />
Oh, but this was to introduce oneself...raised a poor girl on the wrong side of the tracks.  :)   Put myself through college, lucked into consulting, learned how to play AND made enough money finally to do so, now just loving life/husband/puppy/and my M3!  (Raised by mechanic grandfather!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">James</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a nice story deeboss ... and a cool car, M3's are really nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">A big applause for your achievements deeboss :) But I prefer my sturdy, comfortable - and pretty fast - Volvo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deeboss</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like another chance for a poll to me....<br />
<br />
BTW, standard or automatic Volvo?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Dee,<br />
<br />
You're free to open the ballot box yourself. Just enable the poll option when making a post. My Volvo V70 is a manual one. The automatic gearbox is still not a household thing in Europe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deeboss</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">That's great!  No ding intended...  It kills me here in the states that you'll see high performance sports cars with automatic.  What's the point?  :) It took over six months for me to find a used M3 with standard transmission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">25th September 2001, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess automatic and manuals both have good and bad things going for them. I loved driving the automatic Volvo we had on our holidays in BC, Canada last year. It was such a delight cruising through the pine forests and mountains for hundreds of miles. How's Madison, AL (Alabama?) for cruising? :cool:</div></div><hr />
