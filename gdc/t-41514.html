<br />
Infor today announced it will deliver new functionality to Infor ERP Baan IV and 5 customers. This move reverses the previous decision of SSA Global (acquired by Infor in August 2006) to discontinue further enhancements to Baan versions IV and 5, and firmly reinforces Infor&#8217;s commitment to continue enriching its customers&#8217; solutions.<br />
<br />
Infor ERP Baan customers now have the option to enhance their existing version of Baan or they can choose to upgrade to Infor ERP LN version 6.1, which is the latest version of Baan renamed. Customers will learn about the company&#8217;s development plans for Infor ERP Baan through presentations, workshops, and interaction with Infor&#8217;s senior executives at Infor&#8217;s annual user conference, Inforum 2007, held this week in Las Vegas.<br />
<br />
Future enhancements include role-based home pages, Infor Open SOA interoperability, enhanced reporting services, multi-books accounting, and other new components.  Many of the enhancements are customer-driven through the &#8220;Voice to Infor&#8221; program, and will be delivered within feature packs, the first of which is scheduled for delivery in winter 2007. <br />
<br />
&#8220;Our Infor ERP Baan customers rely on these solutions to run their business and stay competitive,&#8221; said Mike Frichol, vice president of global industry and product marketing for Infor. &#8220;Infor is committed to protecting the investment these customers have already made in their solutions.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Infor ERP Baan is an integrated advanced business solution that brings together business-specific functions in a scalable, multi-language, open systems platform. Infor ERP Baan is ideal for manufacturers in industries such as automotive supply, process manufacturing, industrial equipment and machinery, high-tech and electronics, component manufacturing (discrete products), and project-based manufacturing (commercial aerospace and ship building).</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmmm, sounds not to bad.<br />
I had an Infor salesrep showing me some examples of the new dashboards, the reporting tool etc. two weeks ago. Looked good (although it should have been in BaaN years ago already). But what I understood from him was that this was only for LN......curious what the developments will be.</div></div><hr />

If yes then which service pack is it a part of? If not, does anyone know when its supposed to be made available for Baan4?<br />
 <br />
Thanks<br />

It is really sounding good to hear that, Infor is going to add new functionality to ERP Baan IV and 5 customers. I think the decission will not only help the customers to gain on new functionalities but also to Infor to gain confidence amoung its Baan customers who have faced rough weather in past few years due to the change over of the company stake from one hand to another.<br />
And I hope Infor will honour its commitment on the issue. No doubt ERP LN is far more rich in functionality than BaaN IV &amp; 5, but again most of the Baan IV &amp; 5 customers will not prefer to graduate themselves to ERP LN immidiately at the same time they donot want themselves to be ignorned by Infor this way.</div></div><hr />
