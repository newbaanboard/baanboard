sap_project_costs_cited_in_jewelers_bankruptcy_filing (http://www.pcworld.com/article/157058/sap_project_costs_cited_in_jewelers_bankruptcy_filing.html?tk=rss_news)  and the counter story (http://ematters.wordpress.com/2009/01/14/shanes-blame-game/) .<br />

The number one responsible party was, of course, the management of Shane. This isn’t 1992, when management could pretend that they didn’t have the skills or knowledge to manage an ERP implementation, or at least hire someone with those skills. Sorry, the buck stops at the executive floor of Shane, not SAP. The other responsible party was systems integrator Ciber, whose name is strangely missing from the Bloomberg report. Shame on Bloomberg too, but I don’t expect reporters who don’t understand enterprise software to understand why the systems integrator is the one who screws up the implementation.</div></div><hr />
