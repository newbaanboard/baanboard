<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smartone75</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Recession has affected many companies, especially Manufactring companies where BaaN is strong. These companies will give second thought before investing in any further version, add-ons.<br />
The main reason is these activites involve huge cost.<br />
<br />
BaaN should think of giving very cost effective solutions which will force customers to implement. Also they can think of reducing annual licence cost.<br />
<br />
What say???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, plus lowering the cost of the licenses to small companies. Plus finally showing that the modular system (that they tried to sell last year) actually works in the right way. It was supposed to be like Office and you could just buy what you wanted to use at a discounted rate. As far as I know, no-one took it.</div></div><hr />
