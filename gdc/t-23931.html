Has anyone dealt with any of these vendors?  What are they like?  Good,bad whatever?<br />

<br />
I've had successful experience with RMCis and am currently workin on a Baan V implementation with one of their people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillCook</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Paul,<br />
<br />
          So-far it looks like RMCis has the top people, E-ventus a close second and SE Technologies last.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">4th May 2005, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">We have worked with RMCis on Baan Tools issues for about three years and have been very pleased with their work. We have not used them for implementation projects. In general, they promise what they can deliver and deliver what they promise - at least on the technical side.<br />
<br />
Now the caveat - of course your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what we are seeing also, RMCis has some great technical people, lots of solutions. E-ventus also,  SE Tech. not so much.<br />

We have utilized their services since 1995 (our first Baan implementation) and recently had them do our IVb2 to IVc4 upgrade, which went very smoothly.  Their technical expertise is the best!<br />
<br />
I also sent you a private message, because I didn't see the quick response icon at first (I'm fairly new to baanboard).<br />

        Thanks for the comments, looks like RMCis is the best bet.  I attended one of their Tools workshops and was quite pleased with their technical proficiency.<br />

<br />
We used TriNET. They had a tool that helped us clean up our data during the migration.  We also used the tool to make some changes to our dimensions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">12th May 2005, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">There are plenty of sales reps on Baanboard that have a second user so they can pose as happy customers and promote their own consulting services. My advice to any customer searching for vendor recommendations: I wouldn't put much trust in opinions posted on an internet board by users who obviously try to stay anonymous. <br />
<br />
Always insist on talking to real references. <br />

I've always been cautious and able to flush out the bogus in favor of the actual.<br />
Looks like we will be hiring the services of RMCis.  Througout all the discussions with and without the vendors, they have demonstrated the closest resemblance to our model of a professional approach.</div></div><hr />

I am with e-Ventus, I have noticed e-Ventus' name brought up in this thread.  I'm not sure if I have ever spoken to you or know you.  I would be interested in understanding more about your migration.<br />

<br />
If you have any installation/migration/roll out projects that will happen in China and need local resource, please let me know, we can provide the best people(or not so best) in China on BaanIV, Baan5, 6.1 or even Triton.<br />

I am be interested in knowing more details about work done by you or your associates in China...Looking for Baan5b knowledge mostly functional bilingual consultants... PM me !<br />
<br />
As far as vendors are concerned...have not dealt with RMCis and for evantus don't think they have a good presence locally... in Cleveland heard of some Baan customers working with SE Technologies for long. They seem to have a decent Baan team of their own. If its subcontracted then depends on the consultant.</div></div><hr />
