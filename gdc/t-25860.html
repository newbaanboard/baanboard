<br />
In navigating the SSA site, their may be a way to get all the information we got from the baan support site like latest solution for objects, sessions, etc.  But it seems we have no option of getting to the old site.<br />
<br />
Is there a way you can use both?<br />

Not quite everything.  The old site had access to the Old Query by Form interface to the KB.  <br />
<br />
This allowed the listing of solutions by date, so it was possible to see the solutions that had been released in the last month.  Did anyone else use the Old  Query by Form interface to the knowledgebase?  See the attachment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also it still has Search for latest solutions for a session / component.<br />

True.  But it is not possible to get a list of solutions without entering a problem description.  With the old knowledge base interface it was possible to get a list of ALL solutions that had been released in the last month.</div></div><hr />

U have to add ur default product in the profile, then only u will be able to do a searching.<br />
