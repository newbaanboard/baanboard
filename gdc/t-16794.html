I am sure there are a lot of devotees who would be happy for it to be Baanboard for ever.       <br />
<br />
If a good number of us more to ERP LN and SSA get some new customers then the Board executive may want to consider a new name.  In the mean time I still have doubts as to whether the new product will replace BaanIV/V.  <br />
<br />
Despite several direct requests for information, SSA-Global have not been forthcoming with any information what so ever for the installation where I work.   <br />
<br />
Whilst we could continue to run our 4c4 software long into the future, our corprorate strategies will not support this.  Unless we can upgrade fairly soon we will, regretably, upgrade to one of the big-name packages.  <br />

<br />
Good question. To be honest I do not see ourselves changing the site's name very soon. We may not even change at all. There are very good reasons to keep the current one one of them being that both our name and the Baan product are well and truly established. It also gives the additional advantage that people will perceive us more easily as independant from SSA - which we are of course. But nobody knows what the future brings. I think there is going to be a lot more concern over whether the new generation of Baan software is going to sell or not. If no new customers are coming along and no old ones are migrating than we are doomed to disappear anyway.</div></div><hr />

With all the &quot;views&quot; and only 2 replies to this post, I think everyone saw &quot;XXX&quot; and thought you were going to try to up the revenue by taking this board in a slightly different direction...<br />

More seriously, where can I find this new roadmap?  Haven't heard anything about it yet!  Am probably too far out of the Baan-loop at the moment... Excuse my ignorance! (But still, please provide a link!)</div></div><hr />
