<br />
I was in SNECMA Moteures - this is very successful project, one of the most large-scale in the world (more than 8000 users), all BaanERP modules using.<br />
<br />
I have meeting with Thales Airborn Systems - this is another very successful project in France, the same as OTIS France, Alstom (some plants), ABB (some plants), Flextronics Manufacturing France, and many others.<br />
<br />
I recommend you to contact with Jean-Philippe POMMEL [jppommel@baan.com], Directeur Affiliés SSA Global France &amp; Afrique.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply, maybe We´ll need a contact in france able to speak with our client , they want to talk with a BaaN Support company with enough knowledge about implementation and technical support.<br />
<br />
The idea is to introduce you or the Support company in France as our partner and try to share this project.<br />
<br />
What do you think about it ? it's possible?, if you aren't interested, do you know someone else, company or consultant?<br />
<br />
At the moment this project is just a possibility, we have not closed it yet.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Andrés P.</div></div><hr />
