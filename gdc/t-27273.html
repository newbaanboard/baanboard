Many customers still telling me today that the guy who made the design is really a genius, even it was made more than 10 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arthas</div><div class="date">5th June 2006, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan Tools were not designed. They were created. By god. In 3742 BC. When Moses descended from the mount he actually had three stone tablets containing the fifteen commandments. Unfortunately he dropped the third one on his toe, which is why he limped a lot. The lost and abandoned tablet contained the blueprint for triton one (which had originally been designed as an interstellar spacecraft) but this fell into the hands of Satan, who soiled it and passed it on to the Baan brothers. The brothers used the missing commandments to create a thing called a &quot;computer software&quot; and it was good, but flawed. The brothers used the wealth generated by their fortuitous inheritance to found the NGK. Satan's hand is evident in many places, such as General Table Maintenance, The Report Editor, and the PVRC (do not say this out loud lest you call down demons upon your head) structure. The report editor is proof of the existence of Satan as most people today believe that the product of the current incarnatation of the dark master is a much cooler tool, i.e. notepad. PVRC is the secet codeword/password of the 27th degree of the Priory of Psion, The thirty-third degree of The Ancient and Accepted Order of Masons, and is written on the inside of the door of the pope's personal crapper in the vatican. In Plum coloured lipstick. Don't believe me? go check out the crapper.<br />

more daft questions please, I'm practising my creative writing.</div></div><hr />

Very creative indeed, you are a match for Dan Brown :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who owns the Plum-coloured Lipstick and how do I get that colour in my Baan menus?<br />
<br />
(maybe we should make this a Poll/Survey/Competition?).<br />
<br />
100 Euros will be donated to the charity of the winner's choice. Entries will be judged by me on their humour value.<br />

<br />
Dan Brown does not mispell color with &quot;colour&quot;. He's also not used to offering prizes in Euros but deals strictly in US Dollars.<br />
<br />
I happen to live close to Dan here in New Hampshire.:) <br />

:)  Sounds like you do not like the things created by Satan. The problem with Baan tools is that Satan did not work on this piece of toys in the last ten years.</div></div><hr />
