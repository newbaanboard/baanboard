<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ash Gajjar</div><div class="date">14th September 2004, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone please tell me if there are any specific companies in Europe that offers training in Tools, but more importantly in script writing. We use Baan 5.2a and my earlier Baan 4.0 tools skills need refreshing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Although Europe is (in size) quite small, the number of countries is quite big, Ash! ;)  In what country do you want to do this training?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ash Gajjar</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I am here in the UK ( south East), but we have offices in most of the EU countries, so would not be a problem to have training in NL, DE, DK etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">For NL, I would contact Profuse.  Imho, they are the better training partner in NL. There are some members belonging to Profuse, so if anyone of them reads this thread, please supply Ash with contact information.<br />
<br />
For UK and the rest, I am not sure.  Hopefully, one of the members from the UK will respond...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ash Gajjar</div><div class="date">16th September 2004, 18:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info. Found the Profuse website very informative. Any idea where in Holland are Profuse based ?<br />
It would also be useful if anyone knows of any training consultancy in the UK offering similar courses</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mike P Here from Deal Solutions, I recognised the name! Hope all is going well at New Malden?  My old Baan UK / SSA office in Dudley W.Midlands used to run official courses in ERP Scripting.  If you still require it I can get you the number of a manager in the dept.  Alternatively If I can be of  use in a specific area then let me know.  I have some knowledge of providing training on ERP, and until recently ran a couple of 1 day courses in Milton Keynes for clients.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
