<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mervcarr</div><div class="date">13th November 2003, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">A few years back there was a memo which came from the Baan company which went to great lengths to explain the proper case usage of the Baan name. It basically went along the lines of the use of BaaN should be restricted to a description of the Baan Trademark only and any other useage of the Baan name should be with the &quot;B&quot; in upper case only.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if anybody out there still had a copy of that document? Would like to educate people in our company :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will you need to use the Baan name as a product name or a company name still needs to be seen. <br />
<br />
I remember reading somewhere that soon only the Baan product will exist. The company will be SSA Global. <br />
<br />
and then there is a new logo that might come in .. remember the invensys logo still exists at many places including some BWs.</div></div><hr />
