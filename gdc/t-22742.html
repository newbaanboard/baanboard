<br />
I've written a program to help Baan IV folks out with password aging. AND I am providing it for free on my website. (Under a modified BSD license.. <br />
[ sorry  Francesco =) ] )<br />
<br />
Here are some advantages if my program:<br />
- Works with both BW and BA<br />
- Copious logging<br />
- Strong focus on security<br />
- Allow users to change their password after the expiration date<br />
- Five day warning prior to password expiration<br />
- Force password change every 90 days<br />
<br />
This should also work with Baan V (or higher) as well - but its untested -<br />
If you're Baan 5+ and would like to try this out please let me know.<br />
<br />
I only have HP and Linux (not quite finished) systems to port it to, If you have an IBM, DEC or Sun machine and would like to try out the program, please let me know and we can work something out.<br />
<br />
This is v1.0 so there may be bugs, etc. I'm using it live in my environment<br />
and all seems well so far, if you find bugs, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Download the program below:<br />

<br />
Luckily it was just a problem with the delivery (messed up my baan export &lt;sigh&gt;)<br />
<br />
All better now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback folks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">4th January 2005, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">A friend of mine gave me access to his DEC/SUN/IBM and Linux boxes.<br />
So I've gotten the program to compile on all of them. <br />
<br />
However, he doesn't have Baan so I'd love to have feedback from anyone<br />
who could download and test one of those ports.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">6th January 2005, 02:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - after being freaked out by the baanportal story, I've decided that I'm going to remove all references to SSA.. This means, primarily, that I'm not going to distribute the Baan 4GL program to go with, and there won't be any really Baan specific instructions.. But i think most people can figure it out. Startup session calling a Baan program that makes its decisions based on &quot;passage&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll post the code for the Baan session down in the &quot;code&quot; forum..<br />
<br />
sorry folks. SSA didn't contact me or anything, but I'm not all that into provoking them.<br />

I think you would be okay on distributing the 4gl code.  You should be able to just post that in the code and utilities form.  We have other examples there for other type solutions.  Most notable of which is the &quot;Extend Source Code solution&quot;.<br />

<br />
Thanks. I did post the 4GL in the code and utilities forum. <br />
<br />
I'm mostly worried of saying that its a password aging solution for &quot;Baan&quot;.<br />
Since I'm not a partner and all. I didn't think that mattered, but maybe it does.<br />
