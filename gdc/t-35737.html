* Baan Constraint Planning<br />
<br />
Baan Constraint Planning provides planning functionality that takes into account capacity and material constraints. &quot;Finite&quot; planning takes in to account the capacity of production in work centers. A planning method called &quot;Infinite&quot; planning takes in to account that production is unlimited.<br />
<br />
Baan Constraint Planning provides Master Production Scheduling (MPS) with an integrated capability with finite and infinite planning methods.  MPS plays a key role in the MRP II logistical planning and control of internal and external flows of goods in a manufacturing environment.. You can select different planning strategies for different parts of your production system with Constraint Planning.<br />
<br />
Constraint Planning provides the following advantages<br />
<br />
* Optimizes the constraint resources from costs and cash flow, customer service, and inventory <br />
<br />
* Coordinates sales and production<br />
<br />
* Coordinates the availability of material and capacity<br />
<br />
* It becomes the &quot;driver&quot; of the flow of goods, or &quot;input&quot; to the MRP<br />
