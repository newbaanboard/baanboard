This article doesn't really add much to what we have previously<br />
discussed here but it does make it clear that SSA's strategy is to<br />
'buy' market share and to 'build' customer share. I take the building<br />
customer share to be increasing the revenue from customers by one<br />
means or another. Either more products or more services, or both.<br />
<br />
In the case of BaanIV customers who want to upgrade to ERP LN, this<br />
probably means at the very least paying for compulsory: migration<br />
services, systems consultancy, reprogramming vital customizations and<br />
for education.<br />
<br />
For some customers (such as the site where I work) this may be a lot<br />
more involved due to the fact that a number of BaanIV features and<br />
processes (such as containerised items and process manufacturing) are<br />
not available at all and therefore considerable changes would need to<br />
be made to business processes or to the software to work-around the<br />
recission of the features.<br />
<br />
The approach to data migration that is set out in the available<br />
documentation, is in my view, a bit too simplistic (or perhaps<br />
mysterious.) It involves unloading each table to an ascii file (much<br />
like the Create Sequential Dump program) which is then converted to<br />
the new field arrangement/format and then reloaded in the new format<br />
using RDBMS utilities (such as sqlloader.) This may be a great<br />
approach for small databases where the system could be out of action<br />
for days during the final cut-over. But for databases that are 100's<br />
GB and the max window is a day or less it does not seem feasible<br />
without massive parralel processing streams which would require<br />
additional hardware just for this job.<br />
<br />
It will be very interesting to see the number of BaanIV sites that do<br />
not move to ERP LN and then compare this proportion with the number<br />
who did not move to BaanV.<br />
<br />
I cannot but otherwise think that, as was the case with BaanV, the<br />
intention is not to have users migrate unless this provides<br />
significant increased revenue. Is this Customer Service ?<br />

Maybe SSA will try to shoot me for this, but I ran into an old 4c4 client the other day, and told them in so many words to stay on the software they have!  &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it!&quot;</div></div><hr />
