At least SSA is getting a mention in the IT press.  I read that article on your link and also read another article on Greif.  Didn't get much info out of either. viz: Greif consolodated up to 20 servers including w2000's and 2 flavors of SSA ERP to a single version on a new IBM box. <br />
<br />
Sirius were the &quot;partner&quot; of both IBM and SSA.  What did SSA do that warranted an IBM award?  What was their involvement (transfer of BPCS licences to Baan)?   Do they count this as new business?<br />
<br />
There is no indication in the articles as to this being ERP LN.  So I guess that means it is not.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">2nd March 2005, 06:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that SSA is focusing on only selling ERP LN.. If Baan 4 would be a better fit for a customer I think they'd sell that.. Specifically since Baan 5 and LN don't have an automotive or A&amp;D package (that I know of..)<br />
<br />
As for what SSA did, dunno, but seeing IBM back SSA is positive in my book.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skosana</div><div class="date">3rd March 2005, 02:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I was at the 'SSA Customer Days' event at Charlotte today. Their product branding and direction makes lot of sense now. They seem to be getting top ratings from Analyst community like Gartner etc. Ofcourse Baan application has always been regarded highly, even in troubled times.<br />
<br />
What is missing is the thumping of chests, the shouting from the rooftops. It will help turn the positive vibe into a good marketing tool. These things may not mean much to the existing customers but for those who are evaluating the software they can surely earn some points. It will be good if SSA gets more active in forums like APICS etc.</div></div><hr />

It looks as if Greif have just consolodated the hardware at this stage. They still run both BPCS and Baan. BPCS in an AS400 partition(s) and Baan in AIX partition(s).   <br />
<br />
Its an intersting strategy having one centralised box (in 21st century) to service the companies spread all over the world.  It is not as if the i5 is a giant system costing $trillions.  If the 1000 users were all in the one spot may be easier to understand.  Hope it really works with just the one box.  Just as well that they have &quot;capacity on demand&quot;. I wonder how the fairly large European operations are taking to the loss of the local systems. <br />
<br />
(Did get some snappy words for my next Toastmasters speach. &quot;Simplicity is very important; I'm a simple guy, and the number 'one' to me is a very powerful number. We want to get down to one platform, one system, one tool. Having one ERP and one platform is great. It's simple, it's elegant.&quot;)</div></div><hr />

We are running our Baan on AS/400 since 1999. Last month we brought power 5 IBM e-server called 570 and migrating our Baan form 840 server to 570 in 2 months. We are feeling Baan on eServer is very stable. Just for info.<br />
