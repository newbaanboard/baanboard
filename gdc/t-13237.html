People talk about business critical systems. I get the impression that Baan (where installed) is business critical to the extent that the implemented systems power the business - but really wonder whether Baan is seen as a strategic tool for helping the business move forward. <br />
The flipside to this of course is whether Baan actually prevents a business thinking about systems as a driver for moving the business on (given the concerns listed on this website as a starter).<br />
I really liked Baan in the late 1990's. Has its time really come to back down and disappear? Lets face it - SSA want the install base and associated revenues. Do Baan users really want Gemini or SSA?<br />
Answers on a postcard please ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably they plan to post pone it indefinitely until it fades from public memory...in such a case that would leave us, the existing baan users on Baan IV and earlier versions who want to upgrade, high and dry<br />
<br />
any comments ???<br />

<br />
i think it is a good way to stable the Gemini Version and bring it then up to the market. <br />
There is no reason to move away from BAAN<br />
