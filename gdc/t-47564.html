A bad news is that the release of Ln and the integration with EAM, SRM are delayed. It seems Infor slows down the investment in Baan product line. <br />
<br />
Infor gives some details of the enhancement projects under planning. These external add-on modules are provided to enhance the functionality of ERP products collected by Infor. They are<br />
1. Evolve BIS<br />
2. Evolve Role-Based Home pages<br />
3. Evolve Multi-Books<br />
4. Evolve Pricing<br />
5. Evolve Order Entry<br />
6. Evolve Costing<br />

They integrate  in one two FP (FP4 and FP5), which was planned in this year. Two FP in one year - is not a good for customer. <br />
Now new consolidated FP5 planning for GA in 4Q2008. FP5 include FP4 and some additional functionality for automotive. And integrations with many solutions, like EAM, WMS and SupplyWeb. <br />
New version of ES 8.4.1 we wait in spring 2008.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not really a delay or less investments.<br />
<br />
Infor ERP LN  is very rich in functionality and already 1000+ customers using worldwide.<br />
Apart from having rich functionality, Infor Wants to add better usability, Reporting and Integration to the Products.<br />
<br />
So ERP LN FP5 will come out with best usability, role based user experience, Powerful advanced reporting tools embedded with it and a better integration tech. And many products like EAM SW etc will be pre integrated.<br />
<br />
Also A restricted release of FP4 will be out in June / July so that customers can get the product (as a early bird) start implementing it and move on to FP5 by the time they go live.</div></div><hr />
