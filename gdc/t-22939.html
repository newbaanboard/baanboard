Here are some snippets for  people who may not be able to view these hyperlinks full for any reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
The forthcoming XL Reporter tool from SAP is intended to help staff create reports <br />
and perform analysis without the help of analytics experts. It works with Microsoft Excel <br />
and Outlook, allowing SAP data to be exported directly to desktops. <br />
<br />
iLytix's capabilities will allow customers to create ad hoc reports using<br />
 Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT - news) Excel. &quot;Excel is the primary tool among <br />
SMBs to show reports and manipulate data,&quot; Gadi Shamia, vice president, <br />
solution management, SAP Business One, told CRM Daily. <br />
<br />
The new feature, called &quot;XL Reporter,&quot; makes SAP Business One information <br />
immediately available in Microsoft Excel. It allows customers to create new<br />
 or modify existing financial and business reports, as well as schedule <br />
reports for automatic delivery. It also lets users develop alternative business<br />
 reports and &quot;what if&quot; scenarios with new point-and-click and drag-and-drop <br />
features<br />
<br />
SAP Business One is one of the two applications SAP offers SMBs. The other, called<br />
 &quot;All-in-One,&quot; targets the upper end of the market, while Business One has been<br />
 designed for companies with 10 to 250 employees.<br />
<br />
ILytix makes a tool called XL Reporter that helps companies pull together business reports <br />
and budgets that can be viewed in Microsoft's (Profile, Products, Articles) Excel spreadsheet <br />
software. Including the tool with Business One means customers won't have to export and reformat <br />
data to get it from their business applications into Excel, said SAP spokesman Jim Dever. <br />
<br />
It will also add improved reporting and data analytics capabilities through the acquisition of iLytix,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Excel is indispensible  in SMB sector (companies  with 10 to 250 exmployees as SAP). According to me <br />
turnover  definition of SMB sector  is companies upto USD 100 million turnover annually. Correct me if wrong.<br />
<br />
There is nothing to suggest that these XL reporter are not useful to big Enterprise customers too.<br />
Sure these are extremely useful due to its direct connectivity to ERP repository access rather than<br />
round about connectivity (ERP--&gt; OLAP cubes --&gt; Excel).<br />
<br />
The reason why companies extend to Excel is the easy to use drag and drop features in MS excel pivot table <br />
and Excel Group by features.<br />
Pivot Table in MS Excel is a very superior browser to browse dimensions and corresponding cellset values<br />
in multi-dimensional format. All other cube browsers talk of compatibility with MS excel due to itÂ’s<br />
superiority in following aspects.<br />
<br />
            1. Better Charting<br />
<br />
            2. Better printing &amp; emailing facility<br />
<br />
            3. In-build convertor to translate pivot table to interactive htm web page.<br />
<br />
            4. Better pre-defined presentation layouts.<br />
<br />
However Pivot table is not a scalable and secure storage for  multi-dimensional data. <br />
It can support upto 8000 distinct rows and 255 distinct columns (ie almost 2 million cellsets).<br />
Although this limit applies to summary data (ie distinct rows and columns after transform) ,<br />
 it just can not replace scalable  and secure multi-dimensional structures like  cubes in SQL server <br />
or Oracle 9i onwards.<br />
<br />
It should help Baan customers design their BI  strategies accordingly and include this Mini BI Excel <br />
features as part of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">22nd January 2005, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding MS-Excel as superior spreadsheet solution: are there any Baan customers who are using OpenOffice as an alternative? How do they value OpenOffice vs MS-Excel?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">24th January 2005, 07:34</div></div><div class="posttext">By open office I believe u talk of star office . <br />
<br />
I dont  have any information as to how SAP views this .<br />
<br />
All I know is Openoffice is used more in Europe. In all other markets MS <br />
Office dominates the show. People even do not know about openoffice.<br />
<br />
I have not done any systematic study of MS Excel vs OpenOffice as spreadsheet solution.<br />
I did c some articles on openoffice screen which look similar . Further I don't know<br />
the programmability aspects of Openoffice which is what required in a tool of this sort.<br />
<br />
When I told  MS Excel as superior multidimensional browser , I meant in case number of cellsets<br />
are less  (ie less than it's limits 8000 rows / 255 cols / 2 Million cellset) , it is<br />
the best drag and drop solution available for managers to query their data intuitively<br />
which is what intelligence is all about . This is 1 reason why all BI vendor talk of compatibility <br />
with MS Excel. All  other sundry in-built features like printing / emailing /interactive  web <br />
browsability / pre-defined layouts / smart tags/ calculated fields / calculated items / compatibility <br />
with any data source / drag and drop  charting etc go to make it extremely useful to a manager <br />
who is layman as far as IT is concerned.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of this post is to show that SAP considers integration with backend ERP as very important factor for this.</div></div><hr />
