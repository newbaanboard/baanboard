<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">midwestbaanguy</div><div class="date">13th May 2010, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been working with Baan for five years now. I'm called an assistant scheduler.<br />
I input data into Baan to generate production orders, make changes, run reports, close projects etc. I work in a custom injection mold manufacturing company. <br />
I wonder are there others doing this same job with Baan. Some of the people on this board sound on a higher level with their titles.<br />
I'm also wondering if there are others like me, what salary are you earning?<br />
After fives years, I'm close but not at 50K yet. With cost of living near Chicago, this isn't that much.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
