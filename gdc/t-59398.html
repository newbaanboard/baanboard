<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">19th October 2010, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you thought about upgrading to LN but don’t know where to begin?<br />
<br />
Are you tired of demos where you can’t play in the sandbox?<br />
<br />
Do you want to see other Baan users this year?<br />
<br />
OST is partnering with the MOSAIC Baan/LN User Group for  a 3-day ERP LN Lab November 9-11, 2010 to provide a hands-on ERP LN experience.<br />
<br />
Registration is $900 per user for the hands-on lab, or, if you’d prefer a hands-free experience,  $500 to attend the presentations and networking sessions.<br />
<br />
So grab your team and register at http://lnlab.eventbrite.com!<br />
<br />
Here’s what others have said about the upgrade experience:<br />
<br />
“I can assure you that your approach is exactly what we are looking for from a partner organization… We are excited to move forward with implementing LN and will be working with our internal folks to get them on the bandwagon.   You folks have taken a lot of stress off of us while helping us move forward and I can certainly see opportunity for us to work together in the future…”</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you know if they have an A&amp;D extension for LN?  At the conference in Vegas they said in a few years.  Just curious.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I haven't heard or seen anything myself.  Just reviewed the Function and Features doc for FP6 and did not see an A&amp;D mention.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone else on the board has info?<br />
