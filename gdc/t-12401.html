<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">28th July 2003, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">At the end of each month we usually check the current threads in the Recruiters (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=10) forum and close any that have been open for more than 2 months. Recently, a trend is starting to appear in which we have to close less job openings as each month passes. Is this a worrysome evolution or something that will blow over once the thermometer of the global economy starts going up again?</div></div><hr />

But I think the problem is something else: many people with Baan knowledge are laid off (e.g. JMI, CMG and Baan itself), and they are obviously looking for, and filling the possible jobs so fast that there is no need to advertise.  Maybe I'm wrong, but that's the idea I'm getting from the Dutch market.</div></div><hr />

Never thought of that. Very good point. If new Baan management is going to lay off 3000 people it will create even more pressure on the supply side of the labour market. Tough times indeed. :(</div></div><hr />
