ZetaNote is a new tool for adding sticky notes to Baan screens. <br />
Baan users know the feeling. You always have some extra information for this Item, but nowhere to write it down. So, you stick little PostIt notes on your monitor or desk. <br />
Well, No need for that now. You can easily link sticky notes to specific records in your Baan application. Each Customer, supplier, item, order and any other entity can have notes linked to them.<br />
No Baan customizations necessary - simple and fast installation.<br />
For a free download see http://www.zetanote.com</div></div><hr />

It looks like it allows each user their own text on an object.  So now instead of all those sticky notes on your desk and in your cube.  You can have get them right off your PC.  Looks interesting - I down loaded it but need another piece to get it to work.  I thought it was appropriate for Mrs. Sticky Note in my office. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zetanote</div><div class="date">31st August 2005, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, it isn't like the texts, for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
 Texts do not exist in all Baan records. ZetaNote allows you to link notes to almost any record. <br />
 The Baan text linked to the table may be used already. For example, the Purchase order header text is shown on the PO printout. ZetaNote is intended for personal notes. If you want to write some information for yourself regarding a specific PO, this is where you'll write it. Our customers use them for Items, Purchase orders, Suppliers, etc'.<br />
  Even when texts do exist, it is not easily visible. Not all baan sessions show the existence of texts. You have to look for them. ZetaNote will show you a popup when texts exist.<br />
