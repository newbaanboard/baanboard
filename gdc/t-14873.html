When we clik on button, next question select agent , once we select agent after communication with Support people. Now they can take control of our pc (which is having internet connection).<br />
<br />
I am interested only for which technology they had used or name of the technology. OR is there any similer technology available in market.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because normaly if we have to take the control of remote pc we have to install 2/3 files on remote pc and we should know the ip address of the same. Then we can take the control of pc.<br />
<br />
If  anybody knows about the same  please let me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">23rd March 2004, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not hooked up to them recently, but they used to use WebEx - www.webex.com.  I know they have changed (the WebEx company is owned by Jan Baan), but the concept may remain the same.   We use a similar service - WebDemo (see http://www.linktivity.com/home/index.html)<br />
<br />
If they have the internet connection, these tools will allow for web meetings and desktop sharing.  There may be a few Java Applets that get loaded when the meeting is initiated for the first time on that PC, but you do not have to do a hard install on the client PC.  The hosting services cost $$.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Real VNC (http://www.realvnc.com/) <br />

Microsoft Remote Desktop which comes by default on XP installations.<br />

You can search on Google for more information with the keywords - &quot;remote access software&quot;</div></div><hr />
