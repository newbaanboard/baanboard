This has been, what is to come?<br />
<br />
I have spent time on this board to transfer knowledge and enthousiasm about Baan to the world. I hope you liked it. There is more to know yet. I liked it.<br />
<br />
From now on I will focus more on sharing knowledge with my customers. It was nice to contribute to this medium. I will follow this board (as I see it now) though on a less frequent scale. <br />
<br />
Within some hours *(I hope)*, days maybe weeks I will be connected via ADSL on the Internet.<br />
<br />
There is so much to know in the world. Getting information on your business is important. But there is more important information available. Focus on that information too.</div></div><hr />

Even if I had the time for a 1000 posts I am not sure if I could fill them on the same level as you did.<br />
<br />
Indeed work is important, but there is so much more.<br />
<br />
Happy reading/posting in the future.<br />

Kind regards,<br />
