<br />
Its a great way for UK Baanies to meet up with loads of others from all of the country and swap tales, see new ideas and.. well drink loads...<br />
<br />
This years also sees the first in an annual event of the Baan Users Recognition of Preformance Awards, otherwise known as the BURP awards, more details of which at the site.<br />
<br />
Hope to see loads of you there and hopefully raise a smile or two...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as usual the conference was a success with many people getting to see the Baan Roadmap and loads of other exciting things. <br />
<br />
The first awards were given out and some of the winners were to be expected (well done Duncan Smith, BSP and Crystal)<br />
<br />
Hopefully those of you that went can add some of you fave moments and info here and hopefully those not in the BaanUsers UK group will get a bit more information about what happens and what is on offer......<br />
<br />
Personally, a big thanks to the committee for allowing this self styled madman to let loose some of his wildest ideas over the last few years. Hopefully some of them worked.....</div></div><hr />
