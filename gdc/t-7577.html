I want  to post this anonymously so I removed certain details. Not the person who emailed is important but rather the thought behind the email. Since even though Baanboard has been around for more than a year now, we still keep getting similar messages:<br />
<br />
I am sorry to say that I did not get any reply against my query of &lt;snip&gt; about &lt;snip&gt;. It is still unreplied. Please look into it. This is an urgent requirement for me. Please confirm.<br />
Well I replied to this person that we are NOT Baan Support, that we all do this work on a voluntary basis: the administrators, the moderators and all other members who spend their valuable time contributing. Therefore nobody can demand to get an answer to their queries.<br />
<br />
So please folks, if your problem is really urgent, critical and needs a fix asap, go to your local Baan Support office!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you feel that your thread is not answered, please add a note to your post. Like me most frequent mailers do select &quot;Unread Posts&quot; and they select the threads that are appealing to them and post a reply to that.<br />
<br />
If you got no answer: did you post in the right forum? Did you make your point clear enough? Did you post enough details? And tell us what you did already, keep us posted on the problem you shared with us, even when the roads you took appeared to be dead end alleys. Of course you already searched for similar problems on the board itself. If there is a similar thread, then add your problem to that thread. All readers on that thread may get an email that you have added the post. Your chance of getting an answer then are bigger... you already have the attention of some of the more or less interested members.<br />
<br />
And one big rule of thumb: never try to get answers via Personal Messages. Why not? Others will not be able to read the final outcome, other members will not be able to participate and correct / discuss the answers you get, you only get one opinion.</div></div><hr />
