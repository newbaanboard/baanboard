<br />
We invite you to our booth at Baan's Inforum Conference in Rome on April 17-19.<br />
<br />
News <br />
<br />
B2Win <br />
We just released a new version of our popular B2Win product for taking output from Baan to Excel and Word. Version 3.1 includes extended functionality and a better Human Interface. Many new users began to use B2Win in the last few weeks and existing customers upgraded to this new version.<br />
Check our Web site for more information about this new version or contact us to get an upgrade. <br />
<br />
B2Email <br />
The B2Email line of products is becoming more popular from day to day. The Standard version is running jobs at night and mailing results to users and saving time. Plus is used in day operations with its Outlook-like Interface that has been changed in version 3.0 to include TO,CC, BCC options, while the Mail-Merge version is used to email and fax Baan documents like invoices and purchase orders with no human intervention at all.<br />
B2Email products are the easy way to &quot;E&quot; your enterprise. It also allows you to fax your documents with no need to purchase a Fax Server. <br />
<br />
New Products<br />
Nazdaq is currently developing a new line of products that will integrate Baan Sessions with Office applications to make better work flows.<br />
Please drop us a line if you have any suggestions for us. (info@nazdaq.co.il) <br />
<br />
<br />
Read this testimony about our products <br />
<br />
Just a note to express our extreme satisfaction in implementing your B2Win and B2Email products at Baker &amp; Baker, Inc. a division of CSM North America.<br />
These products have become a critical component in our day to day business. The ability to distribute report, queries, and just about anything else from Baan that uses a printer definition to Ms-Word, excel, Acrobat, and html, etc. formats without the need of manually transferring between platforms (Unix to NT) has been a great relief and time saver for our users<br />
<br />
With your automatic formatting of columns for the spreadsheet format alleviates countless hours weekly for our Baan users. With using your B2email product, we have now optimized our Baan Job scheduling function (currently jobdeamon and Unix Cron) to route the output into a format to these users and automatically group distribute via e-mail right to their mailboxes. This level of productivity has been just what our users and us were looking for.<br />
<br />
Overall, our financial group calculated that the time, paper, and distribution savings along with the ability to get standard Baan information in a format that can be worked with for business analysis easier has paid for itself in 8 business days. Baker &amp; Baker thanks you for your insight in developing these utilities for enhancing our Baan environment and we look forward to reviewing your other products in the near future.<br />
