<br />
1.	 Longer item code and order number. <br />
<br />
2.	The user interface is better. With dashboards, users can easily access related information<br />
<br />
3.	Easier to customize. With data access layer 2, it is much easier to write customization code. Besides, Ln6.1 provides a much better documentation on the dll files, although I still find it not good enough.<br />
<br />
4.	Unicode. You can install multiple Asian languages, together with the languages in Europe. What does that imply? Now you can host a single server to cater the business of your branches in all countries. You can send out a PO in Japanese to your supplier in Japan, and in Chinese to another supplier in China.  You can do true enterprise planning without forcing your users to use English interface only.<br />
<br />
5.	Unit of effectivity. How to say, I can only say the designer of this feature is a very smart guy. <br />
<br />
6.	Alternative material. Manufacturers on electronics products should be happy with this. Ln6.1 takes care of alternative materials during planning, production order creation and material issue.<br />
<br />
7.	Support of Linux. Now even Microsoft gets to partner with Suse Linux. (Yes, you are right. BaanIV also supports Linux.)<br />
<br />
8.	Dimension accounting. Ok, if you need to have P&amp;L analysis of different business units.<br />
<br />
9.	Ln6.1 does not keep inventory information in item master table.<br />
<br />
<br />
10.        Actual costing for standard material.  (Correction: Material cancellation  in LN is not a benefit to BaanIV, but to BaanV)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Top ten reasons not to upgrade BaanIV to ERP Ln 6.1<br />
<br />
1.	Infor Global Solution. Infor Global charge you a lot to upgrade<br />
<br />
2.	SAP; Oracle; Microsoft. They offer you an attractive price to move to their products<br />
<br />
3.	Financial statement module is removed. Our accountants don&#8217;t know how to use crystal reports to define a balance sheet.<br />
<br />
4.	Process module is removed; No-where to specify co/by product. Why I need to put a line in BOM with negative quantity?<br />
<br />
5.	No extension version on dimension; how to handle metal and paper?<br />
<br />
6.	Standard reports are still not helpful. You still need to customize lot of reports.<br />
<br />
7.	Price matrix. The guy who designs the price matrix is surely not so smart. It seems few customers need such flexibility. It sacrifices the usability.<br />
<br />
8.	Define data at detailed level. Why I need to define item planning data for each item? And if I have several clusters, I need to copy the same set of data for each cluster. In BaanIV, you only need to define the replenishment relatioship of two warehouses. <br />
<br />
9.	Consumes much more disk space. Ln has more steps to handle. You need extra disk space to store something like warehouse orders; inbound/outbound lines; shipping lines.<br />
<br />
10.	Patches. You still have a lot of patches to handle. (To be fair, it seems the patches sometimes are actually enhancements. )</div></div><hr />

5. Unit of effectivity. <br />
<br />
We have unit effectivity in 4c4 a&amp;d versions - is this something different?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I am sorry. I have never used BaanIV A&amp;D version.  Unit effectivity was originally designed for the A&amp;D industry. I think the function in 5.1 and Ln 6.1 should be similar to those in BaanIV. Ln 6.1 is actually a mix of the extensions, localizations of BaanIV. <br />
But the application of this feature can be applied to many other industries.</div></div><hr />
