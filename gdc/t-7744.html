<br />
I am doing a research in ERP systems and project management.<br />
<br />
Therefore I am looking for people that were involved in an ERP project, for an interview.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows project managers or other people that were involved in an ERP project, please let me know.<br />
<br />
I am located in Sweden, in Växjö. Also, if you know companies around Växjö that have implemented ERP, please let me know.<br />
<br />
You can email me on ivesvanmeenen@hotmail.com<br />

Best regards<br />
