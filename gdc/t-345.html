<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cabihler</div><div class="date">31st October 2001, 22:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, we're a mid-size process chemical manufacturing company that has Baan IVc2 installed in several sites. We had to heavily customize the Baan software to meet our needs before going live in late 1998 with our first installed site. Now that our industry has been assigned to the BaaN Process Solutions business unit where is this software going? Do you know of anyone who has migrated from BaaN IVc2/3/4 to Protean? Is there a future in Baan V for Process customers? BaaN Process Solutions is made up of 3 previous business units 1) BaaN Dimensions; 2) BaaN IV Process; and 3) Wonderware. If you look at the BaaN BaaN web site the chemical industry link, as well as several others, seems to leave one with the sense that for Unix sites Protean is the software solution with Prism for the AS/400 world. What do you think?</div></div><hr />
