Baan created their own language. They also have there own compiler. The output - a so called object - is platform independent.<br />
<br />
See the Wiki on this board for for info on the language.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

There are two PDF documents, one a programmer's manual(No. U7168AUS) and the other is functions reference(U7167AUS). Try to get those two documents from baan support and read. After that, as far as I know, there is only one website where you can learn the Baan programming. That site is www.baanboard.com. You can search the tools development forum here for any of your doubts and if you can't find any answer, post a query and you will get a swift reply. (The functions reference is also available here at Baanboard.) Baan Tools is not Visual Basic. You can't google and get millions of answers.<br />

<br />
a) if you are functional user, then just ask your IT department. The mentioned documents are part of the installation CD's, which they got from baan/SSA.<br />
<br />
b) Even though this documents are widely available, they are still copyrighted by SSA. So I would be carefull just sending them around.<br />
