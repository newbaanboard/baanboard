<br />
It's a great idea to share knowledge as long as copyrights are not violated. Though this site is not set up as a file exchange (attachment max 100KB), there are possibilities that would change in the future. Eventually letting baanboard.com evolve into a true portal site would be a target to strive for (if resources permit of course). The only thing that would stop me from uploading stuff on MSN is Microsoft's ridiculous terms-of-use.</div></div><hr />

MSN does have tight policies; however, we hope that most of our docs come from the authors.  Like your site and structure better though.  Baan5 at msn also has posting documents.<br />
