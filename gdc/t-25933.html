<br />
Tension rises as 2B Interactive will pull the first SSA ERP LN customer live in the first week of January 2006!!! This client used SSA BaaN IV with a lot of cutomizations but said goodbye to virtually all custom designed software and is working in a standard enviroment with SSA ERP LN. <br />
<br />
If you are curious as to have we managed this at 2B Interactive, please send an e-mail to: w.relou@2binteractive.nl<br />
<br />
Have a very nice holiday, a good Christmas and a very happy new year!</div></div><hr />

Hi I am very interested in your implementation and the substitution of standard environment for BaanIV customisations.  Would also like to have an idea of environment and number of users involved.<br />
<br />
I note that you invited email discussion but thought your project would be of interest to most forum members if you are able to discuss publicly. If not please send email to my baanboard email (double click my name)<br />
<br />
Happy Christmas<br />
<br />
Terry</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 11:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I agree. This is more something for public discussion.... Every Baan customer is following up on ERP LAN developments/progress...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">22nd December 2005, 01:59</div></div><div class="posttext">It is up to Wietze Relou whether or not this can be discussed publicly.  There is a client company involved and it may not be appropriate to discuss some of their issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">22nd December 2005, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Then why offer to send emails to any stranger willing to receive...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wietze Relou</div><div class="date">22nd December 2005, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite simple: I posted my e-mail adress for those who are interested in the story. Of course: we have to be carefull not to name the customer at this point. After the go-live stage I have no problem what so ever to do so. If you are looking for details: e-mail me.<br />

Thanks for your reactions!</div></div><hr />
