<br />
I have been looking around your site after reading recommendations to users of other forums and bulleting boards and I have to agree with those recommendations regarding the content and interest here.<br />
<br />
I would like to ask, which of Baan's products are represented by this forum ?. I have read much regarding Baan 4 and 5, but I can't find any mention of Baan Process Solutions Prism and Protean ERP Products.<br />
<br />
Are these products catered for here ?.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the feedback! This site is here to cover all Baan-related products. So the answer to your question would be 'yes'. However most people concentrate on the core of the functionalities and that is where we started out 3 months ago. That doesn't mean however that there is no room for growth where e.g. forum topics are concerned. If you wish to make a public proposal for a new forum, then please do so in the Board Question, News and Suggestions (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=12) forum with a motivation of your request. We aim to continously improve the site based on feedback of our members.</div></div><hr />
