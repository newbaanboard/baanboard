<br />
Yes, its possible but the phenomenon you mentioned can happen in real too depending upon the situations. Like an active post can have mulitple responses at a time and to apply the logic would be then unrealistic. <br />
<br />
Spams coming on weekdays are generally cleaned quickly than the ones coming on weekends. You suggestion has already been discussed and measures will be taken to keep the board clean. :)<br />
<br />
Till then, you can report the posts as spam and moderators will surely get rid of them.</div></div><hr />

Best thing to is indeed report the spam. We do very regular sweeps on the board for spammers.</div></div><hr />
