<br />
I'm still new in the world of ERP in general and in the world of BaaN specifically. I'm an accountant who is working at a reseller agency for Baan in the Arabic Middle East. My duty in this agency is to study and to learn how to use baan with many environments so i might be later a Baan Financial Consultant.<br />
<br />
I'd really appreciate if you gave me hints where to start on baan and on this site regarding this point.<br />
<br />
I nagvigated the site and searched, but still confused about where and how to start.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you are working for a BAAN reseller agency they should know where you can get BAAN Finance training.<br />
Perhaps they even have training materials and a training environment where you can learn by yourself.<br />
<br />
BaanBoard is not a website where you can learn the product. It is an online user community where people share information.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you. Since I'm still newcommer to this world, I felt that i'm confused and I have to go on this step in someway. So, I appologize for the request if it wasn't suitable.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll be gald to be a member of this community... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your request was suitable. I only wanted to set your expectations right.<br />
BaanBoard is an independent user forum where people share information and if you want to learn anything about the SSA BAAN products you have to go to SSA Global directly.<br />
<br />
We are always happy to welcome new members and I hope you will have very good experiences by using our board.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
