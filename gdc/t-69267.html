I'm a really beginner with 4GL. Where can I find tutorials for basic concepts like this..What's first.set and what does it mean?<br />
What's the sequence of steps in BAAN execution??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and I'm sorry for my English.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th September 2016, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I would start with trying to get some training.  Or even downloading some documents from the infor support site.  You can also look at the help that is attached to this forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">20th September 2016, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">another quick option is to look at the program script. you should have at least one customized or even standard. download the help file and understand the script using the help file (syntax, etc. )</div></div><hr />

Where would you find training in 4GL?  I have a programmer in my staff that I want to have trained to do customizations in Baan IVc4 but finding training is difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st September 2016, 05:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I would check with Infor themselves to see if they have any training for development and if not they might be able to provide a recommended consultant for training.  I believe when we were looking at LN there was plans to bring a consultant to train us - at least that is what I thought was going to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giodan</div><div class="date">27th September 2016, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for reply..just one question..for the moment..<br />
I try to rewrite Goods Receipt in ASP .NET..What's happen in BAAN when i click on Save Button? What are the execution steps??<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th September 2016, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really sure I get the question - but you would need source code to see what is called to trace thru everything.  Since we do not own source code we use AFS Function servers to do the same type thing.  I think you can search the AFS forum and find a few ASP .NET questions - can't really help with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giodan</div><div class="date">28th September 2016, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">mark thanks for reply..<br />
I own BAAN code for Goods Receipts (session tdpur4120m000) but i don't really understand what happens when i click Save on relative form.<br />
What section is called?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th September 2016, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have the source my recommendation is to compile in debug mode and step thru it.  There can be a lot of events that get triggered when you do a save and I do not know what all those events might be doing.  On most of the sessions I have worked on I typically look at on main.table.io or maybe choice.update.db.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giodan</div><div class="date">29th September 2016, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark..thanks again..<br />
I feel real idiot...how could debug BAAN Session?? How could I set a breakpoint??</div></div><hr />
