<br />
We are currently in the process of negotiating the renewal of our support/maintenance agreement with Infor (expires December), and to be honest the prices we are being quoted are frightening!<br />
<br />
I was wondering if any other third party companies can offer a comprehensive maintenance and support service for BaaN IVc4, and if so who are they?<br />
<br />
Any advice hugely appreciated! :)<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
BAM</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd September 2008, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Does not look like it.  I know this year what we did was completely re-license the software(and I do not know how, who or what), but it was supposedly cheaper than paying the recurring maintenance.  It would certainly be nice to know if there was a third party company that could provide maintenance.</div></div><hr />

We do have customers that do NOT have a support agreement but we don't provide the items that require a support agreement to be in place.<br />

Do you want to say that, for instance, when my server crashes and I restore my Baan to another machine, you will deliver new validation keys and rebrand it even when I dont pay support fee to Infor???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gordonr</div><div class="date">9th February 2009, 11:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
no, we cannoy provide validation keys. There are threads elsewhere on this forum that discuss the issue of validation keys for customers that are not on Infor support.<br />
<br />
Any customer that is thinking of going away from Infor, whether to go to a third party, or to 'go it alone' should always check out their contract, preferably with legal advice, to ensure that they are still entitled to new keys should they need them.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grzegorz</div><div class="date">9th February 2009, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the point. Mr.BAMBAM asked a serious question and got two fair answers and three advertisements. And the fact is, that no company is able to offer FULL support for Infor products, as nobody, but Infor delivers validation keys if required and nobody, but Infor gives access to solutions, patches, Service Packs etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gordonr</div><div class="date">10th February 2009, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
and this is exactly the point about 3rd party support.<br />
<br />
If you are keeping up to date with service packs and releases, then absolutely you should stick to vendor support.<br />
<br />
If on the other hand you are on a mature, stable release, are not installing any patches, and never intend to upgrade, then maybe you should query the value of your maintenance fee, and review whether third party support is an option for you.<br />
