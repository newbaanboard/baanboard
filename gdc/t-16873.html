<br />
Interested, he asks what it is used for.<br />
<br />
The lady tells him: &quot;What's warm, stays warm, and what's cold, stays cold in a thermos&quot;<br />
<br />
Impressed, he decides to buy one.  The next day he arrives at work, carrying the thermos in front of him, so everybody can see it.  The obvious question is asked at last by one of his co-techies, so he explains: &quot;It's a thermos.  What's warm, stays warm, and what's cold, stays cold in a thermos&quot;<br />
<br />
Impressed, the co-techie asks: &quot;So, what do you have in it at the moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Our Baan boarder proudly replies: &quot;Three cups of coffee, and an ice-cream for this afternoon!&quot;</div></div><hr />
