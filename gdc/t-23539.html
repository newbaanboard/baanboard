The auditors want to validate the baan transactions, ie the logistics transctions are doing what its suppose to do..<br />
<br />
To this effect auditor want to know if baan has certification of either systrust or sas-70 (these are kind of certification, which declare the software as compliant with the fair accounting practices). This will help the audit process, make it easier<br />
<br />
If you know if baan is has this certification let me know..<br />
<br />
If not these two, is there any other certification available which will help in this direction? <br />
