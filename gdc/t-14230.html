So we still have couple of months at maximum to wait.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">19th January 2004, 18:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I will not say WebTop a web based version of WorkTop exactly but it is quite close. It has same kind of MS Outlook structure with multiple panes. But when you click a session in the Menu pane, the session doesn't open up in the new window. Rather all open sessions stack over eachother in the details pane. I have seen WebTop for BaanERP 5.0c in operation and it seems to be a nice tool. Also it is Java/servlet based and hence can be deployed on different platforms.</div></div><hr />
