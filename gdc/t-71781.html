We have recently upgraded a FP7 installation to LN 10.6 using DUE. The process was pretty painless other than the fact that in the Implemented software components the Demand Pegging parameter was incorrectly set ON. This is now creating havoc with the system constantly allocating and re-allocating. While the system does generate the allocation change orders automatically this is a lot of additional data being generated that is not required. <br />
We tried to turn the parameter off but then because of all of the existing allocations it was not possible to create the outbound - the system giving multiple messages. <br />
Does anyone have a procedure for the de-implementation of demand pegging?</div></div><hr />
