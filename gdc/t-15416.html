<br />
Generally, both the terms are used interchangeably in most<br />
situations.I would not worry too much at definitions.<br />
<br />
If you are familiar with the Baan Tools part of Baan General Menu<br />
to a large extent, you could be a Baan Tools person but remember<br />
most Baan tools programmers have varying degree of expertise<br />
with Baan Admin / utilities / interface programming.<br />
<br />
With many of the newer applications involving integrations with Baan , Baan programmer in a particular person's<br />
mind could also mean Baan+VB+EXCEL+100 3rdparty software+<br />
...........<br />
I guess the best answer would come from the source of the<br />
person posting the need.Good Luck.</div></div><hr />
