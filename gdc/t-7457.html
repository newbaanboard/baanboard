<br />
We're still on IVb and were looking at Baan5, but are now leaning towards IVc4. But we can't find anything to tell us what's involved.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated<br />

<br />
The main thing is that tfgld410 is splitted up into a few other tables. Baan helps you doing this by delivering a session for it. The other tables can easily be migrated with a normal change package combination for the company.<br />
<br />
However if you have changed the standard tables of Baan than more can be involved. Furthermore you have to consider your customizations. <br />
<br />
The docu that comes with c4 explains how you should do these things (if I remember well).<br />

Does anyone know of a reliable document somewhere that exlains the functional differences between IVb and IVc? We need to make some decisions soon and need to get a good idea of what the scope of the project would be (certainly less than going to 5c!), as well as what it will gain us.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

I have the document and will send it to you if you send me your e-mail address.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you (or anyone else) have a copy of this document? We have P3007BUS, which talks about BaanIV for Back Office, based on IVb2. We're already at IVb2 (already...?), looking at going to IVc.<br />
<br />
Once again, any help would be appreciated. I feel like I'm getting closer.<br />
