March 26, 2001  <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Baan, the global provider of enterprise business solutions, has announced an alliance with DynaFlow Modeling Solutions Inc. - a leading provider of e-business process and knowledge management software - to further extend its support for the recently-launched iBaan suite of Internet-enabled collaboration solutions. Baan will combine DynaFlow's world-class EZ-Process e-Product suite with its leading iBaan DEM solutions to provide manufacturing organisations with enhanced Dynamic Enterprise Modeling (DEM), Web-enabled process publication and knowledge management solutions. This will allow Baan users to Web-enable their DEM Business Models, accelerating the collaboration and exchange of critical business process information throughout their extended supply chain. <br />
<br />
DynaFlow's EZ-Process e-Product suite will provide organisations with a range of benefits that can help them to further extend the Return on Investment of their DEM asset. These include the combination of Web-based documentation and content management and DEM process flows to link business processes; full model navigation functionality to make process models available via the intranet, Internet or Extranet; and quantitiative analysis and simulation capabilities for all DEM diagrams - enabling business consultants to calculate business-related time and resources consumption. <br />
<br />
Pierre Beaulieu, President, DynaFlow Modeling Solutions said: &quot;This alliance with Baan is good news for all DEM customers. They will not only get the powerful modeling features of DEM, helping the implementation tasks and timeline, but will also be able to merge the valuable models into their Intranet Knowledge Repository, helping their end-users perform better and quicker, and triggering greater Web-based collaboration across their supply chain.&quot; <br />
<br />
Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution (PTD) ensures reliable and efficient transmission of electrical energy from the generating plant to the consumer and is a major Baan DEM user. Greg Watkins, Project Leader - DEM Development at Siemens PTD commented: &quot;Having invested time and effort on our Baan implementation with a heavy emphasis on defining our Corporate DEM model for our end-users, it is important for Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution to secure long term benefits for the organisation. In that regard, we have maximised our DEM asset through the use of the EZ-Process Suite, distributed by DynaFlow, Inc. Not only does it provide significant benefits in terms of Web-based document management directly integrated with our DEM flows, it also provides access to our documented processes for all our employees and extended-organisation associates. Tangible savings and productivity increases can now be seen as a result of the enhanced end-user support and greater work synergy.&quot; <br />
<br />
The agreement between the two companies builds on a dynamic and successful relationship in North America and Europe over the last 11 years. Henk de Ruiter, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Alliances at Baan added: &quot;This alliance with DynaFlow is a natural evolution for Baan and the DEM product. We are seeing a real market shift with organisations looking to leverage the power of the Internet to expand their business networks and this ability to add the capabilities of DynaFlow's e-Product suite will extend our support for DEM users, allowing them to Web-enable their process diagrams and increase the sharing of the business knowledge they contain.&quot; <br />
<br />
