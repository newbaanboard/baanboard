<br />
Below are four (4) questions. You have to answer them instantly.<br />
<br />
You can't take your time, answer all of them immediately.<br />
<br />
OK? Let's find out just how clever you really are.<br />
<br />
Ready?<br />
<br />
GO!!! (scroll down)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First Question:<br />
<br />
You are participating in a race. You overtake the second person. What<br />
position are you in?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer:<br />
If you answer that you are first, then you are absolutely wrong!<br />
If you overtake the second person and you take his place, you are second!<br />
Try not to screw up in the next question.<br />
<br />
To answer the second question, don't take as much time as you took for the<br />
first question.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second Question:<br />
<br />
 If you overtake the last person, then you are...?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer:<br />
If you answered that you are second to last, then you are wrong again.<br />
Tell me, how can you overtake the LAST person?!<br />
<br />
<br />
You're not very good at this are you?<br />
<br />
Third Question:<br />
<br />
Very tricky math!<br />
Note: This must be done in your head only. Do NOT use paper and pencil or a<br />
calculator.<br />
Try it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Take 1000 and add 40 to it. Now add another 1000. Now add 30. Add another<br />
1000.<br />
<br />
Now add 20. Now add another 1000. Now add 10.<br />
What is the total?<br />
<br />
Scroll down for answer..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you get 5000? The correct answer is actually 4100.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't believe it? Check with your calculator!<br />
Today is definitely not your day. Maybe you will get the last question<br />
right?<br />
<br />
Mary's father has five daughters: 1. Nana,2. Nene, 3. Nini, 4. Nono.<br />
What is the name of the fifth daughter?<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer: Nunu? NO! Of course not. Her name is Mary. Read the question<br />
again.<br />
<br />
You ARE the WEAKEST LINK!!!!!! Good-bye!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd rather find only Baan related issues on this site. I have never seen a Baan question posted on the Humor sites...</div></div><hr />

I have replied all questions boss... except the third one, on which I got a lil bit confused... anyway, good puzzle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">9th December 2002, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Humor is not a bad, but I think we should keep this site dedicated to BaaN issues only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th December 2002, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The 'general discussion and chat' forum is the only forum where off-topic messages are allowed so the humour thread is in its right place. Don't think we suffer from too much non-Baan content on the board so some lighter threads are always welcome :)</div></div><hr />
