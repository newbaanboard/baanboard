<br />
that is a very difficult question which you have, but for Point 3 ther ewill be an answer.<br />
BAAN will be have a migration tool which is for customers with a Support Contract for free.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael Phifer</div><div class="date">27th October 2003, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several considerations here:<br />
1) How extensive, if any, are your customizations?<br />
2) How many integrations (to Baan) do you have?<br />
3) Which modules are you using?<br />
4) How large are your tables?<br />
<br />
Fairly standard migrations (with no customizations) can be performed in as little as two-three months.   There are four primary focuses in this:<br />
1) Training of the user from Baan IV to Baan V.<br />
2) Cleanup of erroneous, missing and/or incomplete data.<br />
3) Determination of which files to bring across (many companies elect not to migrate all the history across).<br />
4) Set up of the harware and software for the migration.<br />
<br />
A company who has a good working migration toolset can move the data in a three-day weekend.<br />
