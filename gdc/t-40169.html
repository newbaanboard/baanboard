How to Get LEAN in Finance<br />
<br />
Today, CFOs and financial managers are under increasing pressure to produce financial information and management reports faster than ever before.  The needs of executive management, investors and other institutions are such that they cannot wait hours, let alone days or weeks to learn the results of a company's financial performance.  These groups need information provided to them quickly and accurately, and in a format that is flexible enough to allow them to extend the value of the information through analysis performed on their own.  As a result of the movement towards internet-based, web-enabled financial reporting, the demands of these report users are likely to increase, thereby further increasing the pressure to produce financial information faster.<br />
<br />
In order to increase the speed with which financial reports are produced, those responsible for the production of the reports must look for way to reduce the overall time spent in traditional period closing <br />
process.  The interval between the point in time the last transaction is processed in subsidiary systems such as inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, to the point in time the results are shown on an organization's balance sheet, must be significantly <br />
compressed.  Here, an organization can look to lean office techniques to help identify non-value added activities, and to develop more efficient processes to eliminate these non-value added activities. Each non-value added activity that can be eliminated from the closing process should help decrease the overall time to close, and thereby increase the speed with which financial reporting information can be made available.<br />
<br />
There are three areas in which non-value added activities can generally be found.  They are:<br />
<br />
* Financial integration between subsidiary systems and the general ledger<br />
<br />
* Consolidation of financial information from different business unit<br />
<br />
* Production and publishing of financial reports<br />
<br />
By the reviewing in detail the processes by which financial information is integrated, consolidated and reported, a great deal of non-value added activity can be uncovered.  By then focusing on eliminating this <br />
non-value added activity, the time to close can be reduced, and financial information can be compiled and reported at a speed that more closely matches the expectations of executive management, investors <br />
and outside institutions.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Rev'd-Up Service Module of ERP LN<br />
<br />
ERP LN Service is all new and feature rich.  Companies that depend upon recording accurate information for service of the products they sell will look to ERP LN for the best in functionality.  Any company that installs, services or repairs products they sell will benefit from ERP LN Service.<br />
<br />
There are two significant service methods that support traditional  <br />
service types.  Those are Preventive Maintenance and Corrective Maintenance.  Within these areas, ERP LN Service supports these types <br />
through the functionality of the following modules:<br />
<br />
* Configuration Management<br />
<br />
* Call Management<br />
<br />

<br />
* Subcontract Management<br />
<br />
