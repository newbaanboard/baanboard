<br />
After Seaman`s injury he did`nt have the same effect in goal the Brazilian`s used it to their advantage Sven should have taken him off and put on a fresh set of hands`s.<br />
Don`t get me wrong he was good but it could have been a better result if Seaman was taken off. :)</div></div><hr />
