Then SSA Global developed LN and I believe it is called ERP LN - No reference to &quot;BaaN&quot; in the name of this.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  My question is what is ERP LX?  Is this another version of BaaN or a different animal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madan.meegada</div><div class="date">30th August 2007, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">As per my knowledge, LX includes the Process Manufacturing products like BPCS.  Just like how new version of Baan is named as ERP LN, BPCS also named as ERP LX during SSA.</div></div><hr />

i don't know if the Line approach that Dirk mentioned is true but it sounds logical from the following point of view:<br />
<br />
In SSA times there was a strategy of convergence.<br />
<br />
SSA wanted to get the users of Triton, BaanIV, Baan 5 and also the users of ManMan and MK (two packages which relied on the Baan Sources. You can call them a fork) to an upgrade path to LN.<br />
<br />
The same with the BPCS users and the users of PRMS (which relies on BPCS ) Infinium and KBM with an upgrade path to LX.<br />
<br />
So you have two product lines leading into two products.<br />
That sounds feasible to me.<br />
<br />

<br />
Your logic seems logical enough to me also...so I will let it be there in my knowledge base till the time I will get something which can replace this peice of information...<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">exBaanguy</div><div class="date">7th September 2007, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">When SSA was the owner of Baan, they decided on a convergence strategy for all their ERP platforms (including things like MAX, PRMS, PRISM, Protean, ManMan etc).  The key to this was that Baan would continue as a strategic product as would BPCS. Every other ERP platform they owned was given a planned migration route into either Baan or BPCS.  From a marketing perspective the latest version of Baan was renamed ERP Ln, and the latest version of BPCS was renamed ERP Lx.  This is purely a naming convention - the products are definately and completely the next releases of Baan and BPCS.  Once Infor took over they changed the convergence strategy (as this was beginning to kill maintenance revenues from clients running such ERP's as PRISM etc - people didn't want forced convergence onto Ln or LX, so were looking to migrate off), but have retained the naming convention of ERP Ln and LX.  <br />
<br />
One of the key things to understand about Ln is that the current version is ERP Ln 6.1 FP3.  With older versions of Baan they released Service Packs (SP) which primarily contained bug fixes.  To get new functionality you had to upgrade your version.  Under Ln they have introduced a large quantity of empty tables and fields, such that new functionality can be delivered without a major version upgrade.  Consequently SP's are now called Feature Packs in Ln - and can contain new functionality as well as bug fixes. So version 6.1 is likely to be around for years - they will just issue new functionality under the FP process.  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
