I would definitely say the BaaN North America Support have been more than helpful. It also depends on your Staff's BaaN's knowledge and experience. Every product has some issues/bugs/enhancement requests etc, it just depends on how you get it resolved. I do admit sometimes there isnt enough documentation but with the latest releases they have improved a lot, at the same time I have observed many people asking Qs for which they can find info in the available manuals. It's good to do one's homework before they ask questions than seek out answers in desperation, in that way they would become smart and wiser by trying out things.</div></div><hr />

It will not only help to understand the things properly but also increase your efficiency to do things effectively.<br />

I recently heard of a company offering alternative software support for Peoplesoft and JD Edwards at half the cost of vendor support. <br />

Has anyone heard of similar companies offering more affordable Baan support as an alternative to SSA One Point Support?</div></div><hr />
