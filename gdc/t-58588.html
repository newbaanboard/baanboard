<br />
We've been using Baan query tool for quite sometime now to suppliment our existing BI tools. Functional key users being the primary users to set up reports for the lower level baan users who then consume those by using the print only option. Highpoints are<br />
1. we have a highly control system where any change in baan environment needs to be approved etc.. Even a Baan SQL query means a new report being generated and so requires a change request. BQT helps us in this situation as all the application level informtaion is stored in files outside baan<br />
2. It's failry easy to frame queries using the UI with good field search options<br />
3. Installation/upgrades are easy as does not require client side installation<br />
4. Very good product support<br />
<br />
Features we look forward to are running query as baan jobs, improved performance in higly used system etc.<br />
<br />
Overall it's a good to have tool for our functional users. In fact we are just in the process of getting some new licences for one of our group company. Hope you find this useful.<br />
