<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th July 2002, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's one that might come up one day when you are facing your new potential employer and you are under the pressure to give the 'right' answer:<br />
You are driving along in your car on a wild, stormy night. You pass by a bus stop, and you see three people waiting for the bus:<br />
<br />
1. An old lady who looks as if she is about to die.<br />
2. An old friend who once saved your life.<br />
3. The perfect man (or) woman you have been dreaming about.<br />
<br />
Which one would you choose to offer a ride to, knowing that there could only be one passenger in your car.<br />
Think before you continue reading.<br />
<br />
You could pick up the old lady, because she is going to die, and thus you should save her first; or you could take the old friend because he once saved your life, and this would be the perfect chance to pay him back. However, you may never be able to find your perfect dream lover again.<br />
<br />
This question was actually used once in a real life job application. The candidate who was hired (out of 200 applicants) had no trouble coming up with his answer. <br />
<br />
So what do you think was his/her answer?</div></div><hr />

He simply answered: &quot;I would give the car keys to my old friend, and let him take the lady to the hospital. I would stay behind and wait for the bus with the woman of my dreams.&quot; <br />
<br />
Perfect example of lateral thinking :)</div></div><hr />
