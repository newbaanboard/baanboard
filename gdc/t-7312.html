Looks like Baan is trying to make sure those that doesnt have support contract cannot access their Knowledge base and ftp site.<br />

Quote,<br />
&quot;With this letter we would like to inform you about an upcoming change, per October 4, 2002, regarding our ftp-servers. This change is a result of the decision made by Baan to have the ftp-servers secured from October the 4th 2002. The impact of the change for you as customer is limited to none.<br />
<br />
In case you normally download solutions via http://www.support.baan.com or http://partnerweb.baan.com the secured method will not influence your current process. The system will automatically guide you to the right ftp-server, based on your region.<br />
<br />
For customers downloading solutions directly from the server ftp://ftp.support.baan.com there will be a small change. Currently you are able to connect anonymous to the ftp-server. After October 4th this is no longer possible, the system will ask you for login details. The login details are exactly the same as you currently use for http://www.support.baan.com or http://partnerweb.baan.com.&quot;<br />

If you can get the solution to your problem from Baanboard.com for free why would you go to a paid service. Really the advantage of baan support website is their solution bank and download site. I just wish Baan has a support service where you just pay per incident/problem - something similar to Microsoft's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Benito, I agree and I am glad you see our site in that light :) The difference is of course that from BGS you can expect well defined response times etc. On top of that, our members have the great disadvantage that we don't have access to the internals and knowledgebase of Baan.</div></div><hr />

I think it's the patches and updates that Baan is trying to safeguard.   I can't say that I blame them.  <br />
On the  support  in regards to USING  the application goes.............  well, I've never had much luck with the Baan website for this.  User communities like BB have always been my first choice.   <br />
cheers,<br />
