A lot of the threads in there discuss accessing Baan functionality by calling the application function server DLL from a visual basic program. This is straightforward, cheap, and therefore an often used integration method in Baan software ecosystems.<br />
<br />
But... Did you know that this method is patented since 2001? At least in the US?<br />
<br />

<br />
Let's hope we never get such patents in Europe. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, please throw away your code, or prepare to pay patent license fees for using that feature of your ERP software for which you already payed software license fees.<br />
<br />
To not let it come that far, please support initiatives like <br />

<br />
On the subject of software patents I could not agree more. Baanboard has been carrying &quot;nosoftwarepatents&quot; banners &amp; logo's for a long time already. In the end software patents will only benefit one group of parties: i.e. lawyers. In fact, the whole US patent software system is on its way to self-destruction with a spiraling increase of lawsuits &amp; penalties. The interesting part will be to see how long (big) businesses &amp; government will allow the self-punishment to last and whether we can hold off on this diseased system long enough in the EU.</div></div><hr />
