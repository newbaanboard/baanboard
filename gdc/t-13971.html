<br />
We run c4 on an HPUX.  We are looking at new servers from HP and IBM and weighing the benefits of each.  We have a certain comfort level with HP based on past experience.  But IBM does peak our interest.  <br />
<br />
Are baan's porting sets geared more toward either HP or IBM?  From a baan software standpoint are there issues to watch out for?<br />
<br />
Any comments are welcome!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were using BaanIV c3 with informix 7.31 on HP-UX 11i (L2000 class 4 CPU  ,5GB RAM)  with concurrent 160 Baan users.<br />
And we migrated to Oracle 9.2.0.3 on IBM P630  (4 Power4+ CPU ,8GB RAM as Application Server) and P630 (2  Power4+ CPU ,8GB RAM as Database Server )  With 200 Baan user licences.<br />
<br />
We were very satisfied with HP  support in the past ,  and did not know about IBM's suport. But in the migration I persuade that IBM is a really big company . Because of the people on our local baan center were unexperienced with Aix ,IBM found a very experienced  person with baan and Aix  from the Netherlands , and he helped us every day till midnight during the migration process.<br />
<br />
Another issue is that HP did share  the  TPM (trasaction per minute) values of their CPU's with us. Ask for the TPM values  both from IBM and HP for the servers you are interested.<br />
<br />
The P630 machines and Oracle which  we are currently using is much more faster with many sessions than the old machine . for example cost price calculation session runs for 12 hours this was 4 Days ,MRP session runs for 15 Min and this was 3-4 Hours.<br />
<br />
Portingset 6.1c.07 supports The latest version of AIX (5.2)</div></div><hr />
