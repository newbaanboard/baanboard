We know all the pros and cons of these, but want to hear from other USERS who have gone through this process. What are the driving forces for one over the other. I know that purchase price differences, selling price differences, similar BOM's in bith warehouses. <br />
Any comments you could give me would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
well, there are several ways to go. The most important questions is: in which way is the new division intergrated in your company. Is it just a new logistic department or finacially completly seperated from your present company?<br />
<br />
We had a similar problem years ago. One headquarter and an independent salesoffice in France. The relationship between the France sales office and hardquarter is like customer (France) to supplier (headquarter). Goods sold in France should be purchased in the headquarter. But both companies share the logistic part of the business like items, bom's and so on. <br />
<br />
Finally we set up one logistic and two finacial companies in a multisite environment. Logistic tables are shared by both companies. The 'only' disadvantage: the relationship between sales office and headquarter insn't not really what we intended. There is no way to print an invoice for the french sales office. <br />
This part has been resolved with a customized report where the french sales orders are added to some kind of 'incvoice' which is registered manually.<br />
<br />
You are not alone with this kind of problems :D <br />
<br />
