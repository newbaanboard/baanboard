I've been using WinRunner/LoadRunner to test BaanERP (5) for 6 years. I just found out that Mercury Interactive is dropping support for Baan. Does anyone know of some alternative tools for functional/regression and load/performance/volume testing? Please inform. Thanks!!!</div></div><hr />

Is there anything you can share with the rest of the board here?  Our users complain about all the testing they have to do with a service pack it would be nice if we could automate all(or most) of the steps it would really help them.<br />

I had been told that Baan does not work with QTP. We have a Baan Add-in that is used with Winrunner. Does the same add-in work with QTP?</div></div><hr />

I have sent you emails but have not heard back. Maybe I have the wrong email. Please send info on QTP plug-in...Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">14th December 2006, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">My 2 cents:<br />
- You can always use the Web interface to connect to Baan. This requires more hardware, but this is how Baan created there WebTop Benchmark as well.<br />
- As Baan is using LoadRunner as well for their benchmarks, I expect that they will run into trouble as well and need a solution. So, don't panic too soon, but ask Mercury what the future is. If not only Baan makes some noise but also some other customers I think that it makes more sense to Mercury.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

Just an update...I have a case logged with Infor. They say that they are in the same boat with MI, but have not provided any details on the status of discussions as yet. Also, from the feedback I have received, it sounds like QTP MAY work, but needs some vb coding for it to do so. There is a 3rd party var called Inforstretch that has a QTP plugin. I'm pursueing pricing on this.<br />
Also, a note about Service Pack testing:<br />
We do run our suite of WinRunner regression test scripts to assist our SP testing. However, I do not think that you can avoid analyzing each solution within a service pack and prioritizing the impact of that solution in your environment. We treat SP implementations as projects for the most part. There is a good amount of time spent bymany functional experts disecting and prioritizing solutions. We usually have taken 2 SP's and combined them into an implementation on a yearly basis...<br />

<br />
We do the about the same with SP testing.  Just without any testing automation.  We run it like a project, but use predefined tests for the users.  The login run the test and provide the documents to certify the test.  Anything we can do to help them with this testing would be beneficial.</div></div><hr />

We are having a user group meeting here this week. I am going to talk to the Mercury guys about it. Since they are not supporting the Baan Addin anymore, it would be good to find out how we can be supported.</div></div><hr />
