Project Dolphin is a project established for a small circle of contacts on the internet, in order to track how many keys were being typed by them. <br />
Basically, you download a small agent to your computer that runs in the background and counts the number of keystrokes you make. It sends that number to their main server hourly / daily / when you want to, and your account is updated with the new keystrokes.<br />
<br />
I have formed a Baanboard team, so users can sign up and join the team, and the accumulated keystrokes of all members is that team's score.<br />
<br />
The team page:<br />
http://project-dolphin.net/cgi-bin/browse.cgi?mode=team-look&amp;step=look-this-team&amp;TeamID=1293<br />
<br />
To join the team, you first need to sign up for the program:<br />
http://project-dolphin.net/sign_up.shtml<br />
<br />
Once you have activated the account, download the Pulse program:<br />
http://project-dolphin.net/pulse_download.shtml<br />
<br />
And finally, go to your account:<br />
http://project-dolphin.net/members.shtml<br />
<br />
Click Join a Team, enter &quot;Baanboard&quot; in the Search String and press Name. On the next page click the team's name, and join it (no password is needed).<br />
<br />
Let's see if we can get in the Top-10 Ranking!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can now see how well we are doing right here on baanboard! I have added links Project Dolphin (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/bbinterface.php?s=&amp;action=project_dolphin) in the header and footer of the forumhome.<br />
<br />
Note that the stats are only updated once every hour. You can check the next update time as well<br />
<br />
Come on, join up and start typing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how great would it look if the Baanboard crew actually found the existance of life out there! And we get to try and talk them into using Baan first, WOW<br />
<br />
And just what else (program wise, not life!) is out there you have to wonder? Is there a program using multiple machines to work out prime numbers, universal theory strands. choatic mandelbrot structures or even which colour scheme works best with Windows XP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">5th August 2002, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this doesnt seem to be working with Windows'2000.<br />
<br />
It say &quot;done&quot; getting the information but the &quot;OK&quot; button is not enabled.<br />
<br />
Somethings wrong ?? :confused:</div></div><hr />

I am using W2K at home and in work and it works fine for me. I did have to enable the proxy settings because I am behind a proxy server. After that it took about 5-7 seconds before the OK became available to me. Could the proxy setup be your problem?</div></div><hr />

The SETI project is not a bad idea but I don't think you can 'work' together as a team as such. Let me know if I am wrong on that one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
This is too absurd.<br />
<br />
What's next? Can we register how many times I pick my nose at work?</div></div><hr />

It's the most ridiculous way of wasting of resources but you have to admit it's funny :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">23rd January 2003, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of days ago the owner of 'Project Dolphin' decided to dismantle the project, to shutdown the databases and to stop key counting. That's the reason why - if you did check - the numbers on our Project Dolphin stats page are not changing anymore.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Project Dolphin is and was very popular and is in the process of being taken over by another group of volunteers. This is now Project Orca (http://www.project-orca.net/index.php). Project Orca is still being worked on at the moment but you can already sign up and join a team. However, you will not be able to take forward your original Project Dolphin key count. So we all start from scratch again.<br />
<br />
To enable key counting for Project Orca you must change the pulsing server in your Pulse client or you can download the update Pulse client program from the Project Orca home page.<br />
<br />
There's no WebAPI yet so we are leaving the old Project Dolphin statistics on Baanboard. Once the WebAPI is ready, we'll switch to Project Orca.<br />
<br />
However, feel free to sign up at Project Orca in the mean time and join the Baanboard team!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">29th May 2003, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like there's no movement in the project status since the Orca people took over from the Dolphins. Therefore we have decided to discontinue the project on the board.</div></div><hr />
