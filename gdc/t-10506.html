Meaning, the weirdest things you encountered when dealing with support (not necessarily Baan Support!)<br />
<br />
The best problem description I've ever seen on a solution, as entered by the support engineer:<br />
<br />
PEBKAC - Problem Exist Between Keyboard And Chair!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th June 2003, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">How about a patch tape I received from Sun once.  It had a warning label that said:<br />
&quot;Installation of these patches will corrupt your system.  Install immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or the HP instructions on installing a patch. The first page listed all of the defects it was suppose to fix and said &quot;See page two for installation instructions&quot;.  Page two had one line &quot;This page left intentionally blank&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know these were misprints, but they were still funny at the time.  I could tell the story of the support center that wanted me to re-install my system, because of a failed memory card.<br />

<br />
A collegue once had to guide a user via the telephone in shutting down, connecting a SCSI terminator and rebooting his hp-ux system. After executing the proper OS shutdown procedure he asked the customer to switch off the system and switch it back on after he had connected the terminator. <br />
<br />
My collegue waited patiently for 30 minutes then called back the customer to see if the boot sequence had been completed. The customer told my collegue that his screen was still blank so they decided to wait another 15 minutes. After which the screen was still blank and as a result my collegue started to get really worried. He then asked the customer*exactly* what he had done. The customer told him that he pushed the button, connected the terminator and pushed the button again. <br />
<br />
Then my collegue asked: 'which button was that?'. <br />
<br />
The customer replied: 'well the button on the screen of course...'<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />
