<br />
Interesting development here because not too long ago Infor took over Profuse in The Netherlands. I guess this is their way of getting ownership of the BAAN/LN market.<br />
<br />
This used to be the old BBS division owned by Paul Baan and afterwards was turned into Watermark that was running a BAAN practise for European customers outside The Netherlands.<br />
These guys used to have lots of customers in Germany, Italy and Spain but I do not know if this is still the case.<br />
Qurius is the largest Microsoft Business Solutions partner in Europe and has a very strong Dynamics Ax (Axapta) practise and a lot of ex-BAAN people work there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">2nd July 2010, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">The only surprise for me is that Infor is buying that business, not another partner. Since the rebranding to &quot;Qurius&quot; (I just recently learned to put the &quot;u&quot;s in the correct places there), that company was mainly focused on MS, not on Baan products any longer. They had a large Baan IV support contract base though, which is a good cash cow of course. I guess that's why only Infor could afford to buy that business.<br />
