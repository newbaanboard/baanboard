<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bgarth</div><div class="date">5th May 2011, 05:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking to get some information on how Baan can communicate with other systems.<br />
<br />
In the past our business has partly integrated our inhouse built ERP with other customer ERPs - by which I mean a data file is generated at the customer end and sent to our FTP server and then uploaded into our database.<br />
<br />
These files are generated at each new &quot;status&quot; in the sales process - sales order info is drawn from the customer ERP and sent over the the internet. Some data is also transmitted back to the customer ERP in much the same way.<br />
<br />
We will be starting with a new client soon who uses Baan and would like to our EDI in much the same way and was looking to get pointed in the right direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone can assist in any way it would be greatly appreciated...<br />
  &gt; Is Baan capable of this? Are there tools that can do this\help?<br />
  &gt; Do orders progress through various statuses through Baan? Are these fixed\customisable? What are they? Does it work in a different way?<br />
  &gt; Has anyone done this before? Is this common?<br />
  &gt; Is there any documentation that can help me here?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Brenton</div></div><hr />

(1) Yes Baan can do EDI transactions, I just do not know anything specific on this.  You can search this board for EDI and see what comes up.  I know there are questions and answers around this.<br />
(2) The type of order determines what steps or status it will go through.  Are they fixed or customisable - well with source code anything is possible.  Not sure that is the answer you want.  I also know for something like purchase orders - you can setup the steps that order type has to go through. There is a flag on one of the purchase order tables that can be read.<br />
(3) I won't say it is common, but EDI transactions are used. Most of what we do is transfer files between systems.<br />
(4) Contact infor - sales rep or someone to get more documentation on EDI.  There are probably infor partners that would help you get something like this up and running.<br />
<br />
A lot of how this works will depend on the Baan version - I am sure it is different between the versions and possibly even the extensions.</div></div><hr />
