<br />
My company is setting BaaN 5 now. Current there are two sites, under two general managers, running independently in one location (ultimately the CEO is one person). We are in hot argument of whether having single logistic or multi logistic. Can someone advise what is the pro &amp; cons of setting up as single logistic or multi logistic? How about cost? Will the cost doubled if we set up as multi logistic? <br />
<br />
Below is the detail:<br />
- 2 sites running different operation, but one site sell parts to another sites<br />
- users are from two different groups , including finance<br />
- different P&amp;:L</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only downside I see to multi logistics is the maintanance on the system and the information flow between the 2 logistics units. You would have to use purchase and sale in multi logistics, where you can use transfers with enterprise units.</div></div><hr />

It is better to read the help first, then ask questions. If you received your instruction CD with your software, there is also a unit on enterprice units</div></div><hr />
