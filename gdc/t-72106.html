<br />
I am trying to find basic stuff like a function name such as &quot;seq.open(&quot; and doesn't matter what I put, always returns no results, I have done these types search and at least there is one hit. Is there anything new or something that I have to do to be able to use the search engine ?<br />
:confused::confused:<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

I did the search forum on the right and just put in seq.open (no quotes or ('s ) and did a search.  All kinds of hits.</div></div><hr />

I guess they are asking about the Search Engine we have inside Baan/LN(Not really sure if Baan has it) where you open your program scripts session and there is an option to search for a string within a script for the specified range of packages/modules/scripts.<br />

Hi cherokee,<br />
<br />
<br />
If my assumption is right, can you please post a screenshot of what you are providing in the range and text to search? You don't need a &quot; symbol if you are using it.</div></div><hr />

And if baan 4 has it I do not know where it is.  I created a ugly little script to just search a directory and sub directory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:confused:<br />
<br />
Thank you for your replies.</div></div><hr />

That will be a question for one of the others.  I know on some searches that do not return anything or what I am looking for,  I just use the google search on the left.  And sometimes it takes me a while to find a thread I know is out there.</div></div><hr />

I am afraid it is a limitation of the forum search engine. If you search in Google or any other public search engine, it will yield results.</div></div><hr />
