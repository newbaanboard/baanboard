So I get a Baanboard secret decoder ring now?<br />
<br />
Just out of curiousity, how does everyone feel this board is doing?  I think Pat and company are doing an excellent job.  Thanks for the contribution to the world-wide Baan community.  Hopefully, I will get to meet some of you at Rome in April.<br />

Rome would be a nice meeting place for all board members!</div></div><hr />
