<br />
As Baan we can pretty well estimate what the costs are related to an upgrade and how effective the migration tools are. <br />
<br />
What is more difficult to estimate is what the real measurable benefits are that can be achieved. <br />
<br />
Please share the benefits (if possible hard &amp; measurable, like $'s or e.g. reduction of leadtime) achieved with an upgrade from e.g. migration from Baan IV to ERP 5.0c.<br />
<br />
In case of other benefits achieved by migrating to a newer version, please share.</div></div><hr />
