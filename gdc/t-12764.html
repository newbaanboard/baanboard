<br />
I need to know what has to be set up in Baan according to European Union directives (rules) in MCS tables or another packages (distribution, manufacturing). Are there any documents available online for further explanation ? I could not find out any. (for example on baan support)<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">28th August 2003, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">go back to baan support web.<br />
go into Knowledge Base and click on the EURO solutions link.<br />
There are several implementation docs for BaanV and 4c4 initialization, conversion, etc...<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

But it is not only for the new-comers but also for the countries already in the EU and are doing business with these countries.<br />
<br />
So is it possible to do twice an euromigration in Baan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">8th September 2003, 13:38</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I could find, there is no need for existing Euro customers to redo the migration.  For these countries, the new EMU currencies will simply become foreign currencies with a fixed conversion rate.  The only exception would be those companies that have parts in the &quot;old&quot; Euro zone, and parts in more than one &quot;new&quot; Euro country.  These will have to redo the process of triangulation, internal &amp; (possibly) external conversion, and post-triangulation, along with the other customers from the &quot;new&quot; Euro countries.<br />
<br />
With regard to the redoing of the migration, yes, it is possible.  The &quot;new&quot; Euro currencies will have to be declared as such (in BaanIV with the session tcmcs0102m000, flagging the currency as an EMU currency), and after that the normal procedure as outlined in the relevant documentation can be followed.  The only big difference will be in the performance of this conversion.  Since the home currency of (a part of) the system is Euro already, these records do not have to be converted, with the exception of (possibly) some rate/ratefactor conversions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've checked the Triton2.2d conversion tools (Yes there are still companies using these software) and these can also used again. (Only Unix)</div></div><hr />
