<br />
1. Can somebody explain the mapping between FP vs  LN Release?<br />
Example: Someone says,  FP9 means Infor LN 10.3, FP22 means InforLN 10.6 . <br />
Whats the  exact is the mapping between FP0 to the  present FP vs LN Release?<br />
<br />
2. In Demo license of 30 days, Can somebody test the LN Studio Development (New Development - just for trial purpose)?<br />
<br />
3. In the latest Infor LN (I guess release 10.6), has the 'Logo' in Report is resolved, (without workarounds of fonts  or without using B2Win?). Can the Color Logos be printed on screen &amp; Printer?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brendan Shine</div><div class="date">19th March 2019, 00:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Original terminology was Feature Packs (FP 9) with number increasing.  Then newer naming convention is Release (ERPLN 10.3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">20th March 2019, 08:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there's no real mapping scheme between FP and LN release. It's simply a changing in the naming convention of Infor.<br />
See: Infor started with LN and FP-Upgrades (FP0 to FP8). With FP8 they changed the naming convention and changed FP8 to 10.2(.1). Since then Infor is naming the upgrades/releases by numbers. The next release has been called &quot;10.3&quot;. It has been nicknamed &quot;FP9&quot; by the Infor community. LN 10.4 has been called FP10 sometomes.<br />
<br />
I personally stopped calling the LN releases/upgrades feature pack with 10.4 onwards, so I could not map &quot;FP22&quot; to LN 10.6.<br />
<br />
Direct mapping between FP and LN point release may be difficult, since Infor introduced the &quot;in between&quot; cloud releases. Maybe someone else can provide a mapping list. <br />
<br />
As far as I know the name of the final LN version ever to be released will be &quot;Baan Paradise&quot;. So this name may mark the end of the mapping scheme.</div></div><hr />
