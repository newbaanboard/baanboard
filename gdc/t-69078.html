<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cylamhk</div><div class="date">9th July 2016, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor released Infor Ln 10.5 in June. The list of enhancements can be found in the release notes of Ln 10.5 and Enterprise Server 10.5. I think these 2 features are most outstanding, comparing with 10.4<br />
<br />
1. Data authorization on sales order, purchase order, item...<br />
You can define row level authorization before through roles in Tools package, but that is complex and not perfect. From now on, users only see the orders, items which are relevant to them.<br />
<br />
2. Table row versioning<br />
A version column is added to each table. Before that, to achieve delayed lock updating, the application compares the value of each table field to make sure the table record is not updated by someone else. That is not efficient as a table may contain over 100 columns. Now it only compares 1 column.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree. This module has not been enhanced since Baan 4. Ln has strong features in MTO/ETO and now ATO environment. But it lacks good functions in MTS, which is the manufacturing type of consumer products.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am used to work in a env with several cps on 10.3 std and with localizations for Brazil, we have several issues regarding table lock sometimes, specially because it's integrated with our Data Warehouse platform, improvement on this area seems to be very promising.</div></div><hr />
