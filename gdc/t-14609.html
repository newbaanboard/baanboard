I am uncomfortable in providing internal system information to an unknown third party on the basis of an emailed letter.  I'm also being requested to download and run some unfamiliar auditing software on my network.<br />
All this without one introductory phone call from SSA to explain the nature and the reason for this audit?<br />
If SSA wants to &quot;keep us as customers for life&quot;, then how about starting with some basic etiquette and proper communication...</div></div><hr />

<br />
this issue is under heavy discussion in Germany. Unfortunately not at the Baanboard. SSA says this is a common procedure for SSA customers ever since and nobody is complaining (except German customers http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14145 ).<br />
<br />
Obviously this is not the whole truth...<br />
<br />
I totaly agree with you that this kind of licence retrieving process is rather unsual, particularly the customers are adressed by a third party via email or phone call and not by the local SSA/Baan headquarter.<br />
