Have never seen the Supply chain browser , so would like to know what are the major differences between the two.<br />
<br />
Does Supply Chain contain that many more individual functalities that can't be somehow be duplicated in 5c ?<br />
<br />
Haven't really found any documentation outlining the differences , they may exist, but didn't have access or knowledge of them when could obtain them.<br />

thanks</div></div><hr />
