<br />
My co has BaaN 4 implemented with MS-SQL7 as DB. Can I create more tables in the BaaNdb database without hurting the BaaN system in any way ?<br />
<br />
If I do create the tables, what can be the issues, if any.<br />
<br />
By creating tables, I mean, creating the tables thru an SQL query or manually (Enterprise Manager etc). These tables will not be temporary and will continue to exist.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

The only think that you have to remember is that if they were not created thru Baan, Baan is not aware of them so that, any actions Baan does in the database will leave those tables untouched.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm using these tables for some custom applications that need to interact with BaaN tables. I need to only read from the BaaN tables for masters etc. Rather than dump the tables, I'm thinking of keeping 3-4 of my tables in the baan database. BaaN does not need to know about those tables in my case.<br />
All i'm concerned about is that the ERP should not have any side effects because of these tables.<br />

As mentioned, what is not created thru Baan is left untouched in the database by Baan. If you decide to delete tables or reorganize them Baan does it on a per table so those you create are left untouched also.</div></div><hr />
