And I do not think this is enough for my company to convert from one ERP to another.  I hear all other ERP systems have the same type of problems.  I think we will stick with Baan for a few more years, even with some of the problems we have.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanlegend</div><div class="date">27th January 2004, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
This is for people who can get benefitted from the Job Market. I was working in Baan for 12 years. But I regret now for the lame Baan job market.<br />
<br />
It is a good software for companies. But definetly not good for People who wants to pursue career with it. I hope everyone in this board will agree that.<br />
<br />
The aim for this post in Baan board which no way relevant to Peoplesoft as you correctly mentioned, to help people who want to tranisit from Baan.<br />
<br />
I thought it is an appropriate board when nothing is good for Baan consultant<br />
<br />
I received lot of emails from this ad from Baanboard who wants to move to Peoplesoft, that proves all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th January 2004, 21:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry if I mis-led you and I appologize.  I have no problems with the post, the content or the forum selected.  I just felt you would not get a large response from active members of this board.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I offended you - I will now return to my favorite forums.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

Every software has it's up and Down. Peronally I love Baan working for 12 years I can't think of any other software, When it comes to bread and butter, it is difficult to go with Baan, you know that very well. I dont want to mislead people who wants to start their career. You know very well how much job opportunities are there Peoplesoft as compared to Peoplesoft.<br />
<br />
Satisfaction is one thing; Survival is another thing. I dont want to die because I love Baan. I want to live. that's why I choose the software that is better for Jobs. <br />
<br />
I still love Baan. But I dont want to die with it. You know very well how bad the market is for Baan. <br />
<br />
I have not seen a single installation for last 18 months. It is definetly hopeless for Job.<br />
<br />
We all want to live. New Comers should find jobs and make a comfotable living with what they do. It is a bottom live they get their prey.<br />
<br />
Baan is not a place for that. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey. <br />
<br />
I really appreciate taking time to reply.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much MARK.</div></div><hr />
