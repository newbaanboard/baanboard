<br />
Can anyone provide me information about the BaaN's Gemini Product. I heard that it is going to be launched in October 2003 in the US. but nobody talking about this Product, after BaaN was sold to SSAGT. If anoyone knows about  Product details then pls post to this site.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance,<br />

<br />
The obvious meaning of Gemini is Twin/Twins.  Taking this to an English dictionary (http://www.realdictionary.com/T/dir/Twin.asp), we get a couple of meanings.  I lifted out those that struck me as the most appropriate:<br />
<br />
<br />
 very similar - Similar to another version? <br />
 a duplicate copy - Copy of another version?<br />
 bring two objects, ideas, or people together - Maybe a combination of the BaanIV logic and the BaanERP interface?  (That would explain why Baan can say that upgrading from BaanIV to Gemini will be easy!)<br />
 either of two offspring born at the same time - Did Baan perhaps develop BaanERP (5.2?) and Gemini at the same time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">22nd August 2003, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the plan was to &quot;launch/preview&quot; gemini at the European Baan User Conference in November 2003 which was to be financed by Baan<br />
<br />
However SSA cancelled this conference and moved that such a conference might/should be combined with an SSA user conference in the spring of 2004<br />
<br />
SSA were also reported as saying that as gemini was not as far advanced as they had been left to believe the launch date was also being reviewed<br />
<br />
Read into that what you will<br />

<br />
Just received my copy of the preliminary program for the BaaN World Users (BWU) fall workshop which will be held in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, in October.<br />
<br />
According to the program, they will unveil Gemini in the Opening General Session of the workshop.  To quote the program:<br />
<br />
&quot;After months of anticipation, BaaN Marketing will unveil its much-anticipated Enterprise Backbone - codenamed &quot;Gemini&quot; - in a presentation exclusively for Fall Workshop delegates.  This part of the session will highlight the migration paths, roadmap and differences between existing platforms and this new solution offering.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anybody attending?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">22nd August 2003, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds encouraging Linda , but it does make SSA's statement rather puzzling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">22nd August 2003, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">...not only is it puzzling, it's also a bit of a contradiction!<br />
<br />
Bear in mind, it is a PRELIMINARY program that I received, things could very well change before the actual workshop.<br />

BWU Fall Workshop 2003<br />
<br />
Charlotte,  North Carolina, USA<br />
<br />
You heard about it as the &quot;Gemini&quot; project last year in Los Angeles and now  one year later  we are proud to share with you the results of three long years of development. For the first time anywhere, we will unveil the iBaan ERP 6.0 suite for attendees of the BWU 2003 Fall Workshop. iBaan ERP 6.0 represents the next era in enterprise solutions, including a new enterprise backbone, a unique solution for lean manufacturing, a comprehensive depot and field repair solution and OpenWorldX for integration, information and collaboration. From October 7 to 10, 2003, in Charlotte, N.C., we will highlight the migration paths and roadmap the differences between existing platforms and iBaan ERP 6.0. The BWU 2003 Fall Workshop is your chance to cast a critical eye over iBaan ERP 6.0 and discuss its features, qualities and potential with hundreds of your fellow Baan users.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The anticipated September 2003 release date for the next-generation Baan ERP suite will pass by without a launch, with new owner SSA GT delaying the release on quality and feature/functionality grounds.<br />

<br />
I did some more research on the name, and (could be) there is nothing  fancy or mind-twisting about it.  Baan started using composer names for codenames, and this is probably just another, although abbreviated: Franceso Genimiani, a classical composer, who lived in the 17th century.  Here is a picture of this person:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice research Nico<br />
<br />
For added information can anyone from Baan confirm ?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile just in case some people were concerned by the possible typo<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaapzwaan</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">No, gemini has nothing to do with any composer. It's just the twins in the sky. Baan 5 were all composers.<br />
Gemini is baan 6, remember.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">3rd September 2003, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Well thanks for clearing that up Jaap !<br />
<br />
With the layoffs who is left to write the migration tools from 4c4 etc to Gemini that SSA say need to be done before the release ?</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, I'm sure they'll find a way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">By referring to the software required to upgrade to Gemini from whatever may a stated reason for the launch delay but surely is not the only reason. It would seem commercial sense for SSA to evaluate how other software products they have may be able to be linked to Baan and vice versa and to include these in the launch as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 14:27</div></div><div class="posttext">What other products could they want to link?  Isn't it maybe only giving them the time to see whether their ERP product is compatible enough to switch all their customers to one platform?  And giving them time to write conversion software for this cross-grade as well?  If so, it surely will have to be a long-term decision, or an extremely cheap and easy conversion, otherwise the reluctant customers (including myself) would never upgrade!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sure you are correct as far as the upgrade from Baan is concerned but they have just bought a supply chain package and will obviously be doing some detailed analysis to see how they can best promote all of their products</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanassist</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only that.<br />
SSA is also in the process of buying a new PDM solution and has already informed the Baan PDM folks they will be on their own.<br />
In fact C-Ark is now an independent company and has no ties with Baan anymore.<br />
<br />
The reason why this is kept quiet is because they still have some interesting deals in the pipeline and this information may jeapordize those deals.<br />
<br />
It is all about the politics these days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adityapd</div><div class="date">24th September 2003, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">could we draw some attention to the existing users which could be divided into two broad categories : users on Baan IV (roughly 80 %)and earlier versions and those on iBaan ERP ( Baan V ) ( balance 20 %)<br />
<br />
Would the users of earlier versions who haven't yet upgraded to Baan V, jump 2 steps at a time and upgrade to Gemini as and when it is available or would they consider switching to  applications of alternate vendors ?<br />
<br />
Also would SSA GT extend the support for Triton and other Baan IV versions for which the standard support ends one or two years down the line ?</div></div><hr />
