<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">7th September 2011, 14:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Received word that we are going to have an Infor audit of our Baan IVc4 installation.  We went through this about 3 years ago without much difficulty... however this time the SmartAudit software will not install correctly and Infor's License Management turned it over to their development team which has stated that the problem is a 'known issue'.  <br />
<br />
License Management is attempting to get internal permission for a manual audit.   Has anyone had experience with the 'manual' audit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th September 2011, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Never done a manual audit and we had some issues with the automated audit.  If nothing else could you just let us know your experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">19th September 2011, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Eddie,<br />
Several years ago, when Smart Audit was CAP_AUDIT, Licence Management asked us to do a &quot;manual&quot; audit.<br />
That audit consist on sending several archives/tables/reports from our systems.<br />
These were:<br />
. List of users<br />
. Archive loglicd6.1<br />
. Archive olg.licd6.1<br />
. query of spool table.<br />
<br />
The experience was good. No observations was made.<br />
<br />
Maybe because we asked to Licence Management to send their own people to do their audit due to my company can't assing resources to that task.<br />
<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

When I ran it, it appeared to drill down into our various $BSE/application directories.  A log was created and we had to submit it as well.  I haven't heard anything yet, but do not anticipate any problems.</div></div><hr />

We had to run it on all 4 dev/test/patch and production.  Then they questioned everything on all the environments.</div></div><hr />
