I have been selected as a part a Baan Implementation team.  Can someone please help me out with some good websites to visit so that I can better understand Baan and how to use it?  I would greatly appreciate anyones input.  Many thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Even though alot of the information on Baanboard is not structured as such, there is plenty available. The search feature is your best friend really. Good luck with the implementation!</div></div><hr />
