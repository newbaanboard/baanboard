<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">15th January 2003, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the things that Baan Support has been working on is providing webinars on various topics, where users can access a web demonstration/presentation on various topics. So far, the primary topics have been 1099 processing, Year End Closing, AP Accruals. The schedule will be updated in Solution 160196 on the Baan Support Website.<br />
<br />
At this time, they are looking at providing additional webinars on other topics, and would like to get some feedback from the users on what other topics or issues they would like to see covered. If you have any suggestions or feedback on the webinars, please forward them along and we will pass the information along to Baan.<br />
<br />
<br />
Baan CS&amp;S Americas announces the first of a series of customer knowledge &quot;Webinars&quot; - Web Ex based overview training. This webinar project has been initiated to provide product-related overviews on topics and issues that are frequently experienced by our customers. The series begins with a pilot of selected Finance topics (see below), which we will continually offer as part of your current support offering.<br />
<br />
Webinar content will be presented separately and specific to the Baan 4 and Baan 5 versions. Sessions will be approximately 1 hour long and begin with an overview and presentation of the selected topic, following with a question and answer session.<br />
<br />
Webinars are another way we are continuously working to improve the value of your support offering. We feel presenting this information in an interactive format is an effective method we can apply toward ensuring maximum performance of your software system. We value your continued partnership with Baan and hope you will take advantage of this opportunity!<br />
