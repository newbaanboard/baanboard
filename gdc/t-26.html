<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure which version of Baan development efforts are concentrated on at the moment but it seems that a stable system is a myth. As soon as you install a patch it creates new problems so you know that even if you do install the latest SP and patches you will not have a stable system and you don't know what problems you are going to get. You simply know that you have to do it to 'move forwards' (move on to a new set of problems!).<br />
<br />
PMC helps keep up-to-date with patches so new cases can be logged with Baan without simply getting the latest patch as a solution. Howver, PMC seems like a nightmare to those with a lot of customisations.<br />
<br />
Related to the development efforts of Baan in different versions, a question I would like to ask is 'Does BaanIV have a future'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Although I hear that there is a BaanIVc5 on the way, I'd say Baan should put most of their eggs in the BaanERP basket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, c5 is actually with us, and has been for some time. Although Baan do not use the offical tag, all development and patches now are labeled c5. It is true that Baan have announced that there will be no new development for c4 and that all development will be on Baan5 and iBaan. <br />
<br />
IBaan is of course heading for the 'Zero' defects option. This will mean that all bugs will be ironed out before it gets released, however, how you promise a system that can be customised is defect free, god only knows.<br />
<br />
Baans goal, is to have a piece of software similar to airline autopilot software. You cannot have even the smallest of bug there and Baan wants the same thing. Of course this takes time, development and investment. Thats why you see Baan want you to buy iBaan now. <br />
<br />
Plus, as Baan runs in a operating system, you still have the problem of how stable is your server. Baan, no matter where it lives, still relies on databases, CPU resources and other things. Until these too, are stable, don't expect a true stable system for many years to come.</div></div><hr />

For those with too many customisations<br />
You can say that again!<br />
<br />
coz it stands for<br />
<br />
P = pessimistic<br />
M = mass<br />
C = codes<br />
<br />
or perhaps it should be changed to <br />
<br />
O = optimistic<br />
M = mass<br />
C = codes<br />
<br />
You have the choice to be an optimist or a pessimist, so keep these thoughts in mind:<br />
<br />
Optimism breathes life into you each day<br />
Pessimism drains you<br />
<br />
Optimism helps you to take needed risks<br />
Pessimism plays it safe and never accomplishes much<br />
<br />
Optimism improves those around you<br />
Pessimism drags them down<br />
<br />
Optimism inspires people to great heights<br />
Pessimism deflates people to new lows <br />
<br />
<br />
Best Wishes,<br />

<br />
Regarding Baan development, it would be pointless for Baan to be doing any more development on the older products. Obviously they have to concentrate their resources on the future. However, there are an awful lot of people out here using the various releases of BaanIV, so it is hardly likely to go away considering the massive outlay involved in implementing these systems.  BaanIV will be alive and kicking for a good while yet, I'd wager.<br />
<br />
It might be interesting to create another poll to see which release of Baan people are using? Or maybe not! What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zaidlaz</div><div class="date">7th September 2001, 03:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Poll for which Baan versions.<br />
<br />
Great idea!<br />
<br />
Moderators what you guys think?<br />

<br />
Every ERP System is a nightmare. And not only for IT people. Some never goes live....<br />
<br />
Maybe because every company is a diferent business world and they want to have a stable system within a three month implementation.....:-)   ASAP????<br />
<br />
The Baan Target plan S phases and nobody receive a complete and good RFP before starting implementation.<br />
<br />
Who plan a very good optimization phase (O1,O2,O3...)????<br />
Or something like this old BaaN Product after going live.<br />
<br />
Easy for Invensys to say, only Baan V and iBaaN....what about Triton users and BaaN IV users???? :confused: <br />
<br />
Bien le bonjour<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">22nd September 2001, 04:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Not forgetting the updates to porting sets, databases and clients and the fact that this all runs on a server that may not be the most stable of systems to start with (NT anyone?:D )<br />
<br />
A true, stable system has to be defined and structured, and NEVER ALTERED WITH! Only then can you say that it is totally stable. Can anyone see this happening on a Baan system?</div></div><hr />
