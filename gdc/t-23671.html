   You can go ahead and let us also know the results too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">8th April 2005, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">BAAN with Linux has not only been tested, it is already being used in operational environments.<br />
BAAN officially supports Linux (Suse8) on BAAN IV, BAAN V and SSA ERP LN 6.1.<br />
Together with the databases Oracle9, Oracle10 and Informix9.40.<br />
For BAAN IV the BISAM database is also supported in combination with Linux.<br />
<br />
To my knowledge two BAAN IV customers are already live with Linux. One in Germany and one in The Netherlands.<br />
The most interesting thing is that in both cases the users &quot;complain&quot; their BAAN system is too fast now and they have less time to get a new cup of coffee.<br />
The other advantage of Linux with BAAN is that the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) becomes drastically lower. This is due to the concept of OpenSource and allows companies to save additional money on the purchase of the hardware and maintenance costs.<br />
<br />
The whole idea of using Linux in a business environment is not new as many SAP customers have already seen the light here...<br />
<br />
I have personnally experienced the interest for Linux is increasing among BAAN customers and also with customers that are considering a migration from BAAN IV to SSA ERP LN 6.1.<br />
Together with two other technical guru's, Patrick Van der Veken (the founder and owner of BaanBoard) and Rob de Jong, we have come up with a new concept for Linux and BAAN: &quot;The AutoBahn Experience&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you are thinking about replacing your hardware and upgrading your Operating System and database you can also save a lot of money on your TCO with our 'Linux for BAAN' proposition.<br />
Please contact us at edwin@qtris.com for details.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">10th April 2005, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully SSA BAAN will soon also support Suse9 and the MySQL database.<br />
Then the cost of ownership for customers will be a lot less compared to what competitors will offer.<br />
Let's hope BAAN Development will become as innovative as their SAP counterparts and makes sure all these features (the most recent Suse and MySQL versions) can be offered to the BAAN installed base.<br />

i think the given information is not what the question was about.<br />
jr.ferreira asked for software like bw for linux on the client side . As bw means Baan Windows you can't use it on Linux. The alternative is  Webtop (Webtop-Version 4 onwards). This Version is independent of MS-JVM and MS IE. It should also run on Mozilla (f.i. Firefox) with Sun JRE 1.4.x and upwards (both on Windows and Linux).<br />
I have just ordered this Version and will try.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your comment and information.<br />
You are correct that the real question of jr.ferreira was not answered properly.<br />
However, I was triggered by the remark that SSA BAAN does not support Linux. This is not correct.<br />
<br />
Please let us know the results of your tests.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

As administrator I noticed that e.g. the development sessions don't work. Other like user administration is no problem.<br />
<br />
Webtop itselfs runs fine on linux as well.<br />
<br />
Although Baan doesn't support it, the portingset for linux runs fine on my professional Suse 9.0.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catwalk</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Is SLM available on linux? As the webtop needs to be licensed, when we installed webtop 3.0 sometime back on Linux, SLM port for linux was not available. Hence, webtop screen keeps giving the message of license.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">12th April 2005, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">SLM is centralized licensing. So while your webtop install might<br />
be on linux, you can install SLM onto a PC, or some other server.<br />

SLM is available on LINUX. I installed Version 2.2 and it works perfect.<br />

<br />
First of all let us know, whether you are likely to change your baan server ip address or just a baan client.  If it is server then you need to change the hostname of all other baan client PCs but in case of client there would be no effect.<br />

<br />
actually I just want to know that what would happen if i change the IP address of BaaN server?<br />
<br />
In fact we had a demo system(BaaN Server) which has an IP of 10.10.10.5, now I want to change it to 192.168.25.3, running on Windows NT with SQL.<br />
