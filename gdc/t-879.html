<br />
Here is what she had to sayWe are having a presentation on the Engineering Data Management module by<br />
one of the users. Bar code add-on software presentations from both a user<br />
who implemented an in-house system and a software vendor.  Also Tri-net will<br />
be doing a presentation on Baan training.  Are you a Baan user or a<br />
consultant?  If there is room, non-BWU members are welcome. <br />
<br />
I am planning to be there. Anyone else on the board who will be there? For more info click here (http://www.bwu.org/EventsActivities/regMeetings.html)</div></div><hr />

We have a representative going there, but I am not allowed out of my cubicle.  Certainly not to S California!  We are in Illinois.    I believe we have a big snow storm coming up, so you guys have fun in the sun out there while I build igloos.  Say Hi to Reca Saedi our rep if you see her out there, she should have some literature on our products if you want to take a look.  If you all have anything to pass on, she can bring it back to our offices.  I am always interested in what people are putting out.<br />

After 2 years I guess I have taken good weather for granted - including a walk by the harbor when I feel like :). But then ofcourse we cannot build igloos or snowmen. Put a red-carrot on the next one you build... will ya?</div></div><hr />
