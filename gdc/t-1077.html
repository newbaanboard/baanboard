<br />
Baanboard has brought order to the chaotic world of Baan forums. Now that we have a group of responsible/professional people posting on the board, probably it is time we extended the scope.<br />
<br />
The idea of a book is interesting. But let's all write that book. We could collaborate using a Wiki (http://c2.com/cgi/wiki) on this website. Start pages for various topics that need to go into the book and then throw in the various threads we have had on the subject. Edit them to look more like technical documentation. This would then be a living book. If we are more ambitious we could write SGML documentation in Docbook (http://www.docbook.org/). For other collaborative projects look at www.ibiblio.org.<br />
<br />
Baanboard has proved we love the tools we work with and would like to better understand them. Should this kind of a project take off it would help the community to have decent documentation and individuals &quot;have a life&quot;. I know this does not provide a way for people to make money on royalties. I am sure this posting will not appeal to anyone out there who has always dreamed of writing the best selling &quot;Baan Book&quot;. Everyone else, I am sure you are capable of adding your 2 cents - and at todays board count, that is more than a $20/- book :).<br />
<br />
I think the time is ripe for this concept to work. I would love to hear your support or criticism for the idea. The floor is yours.</div></div><hr />

I think it is a very good idea. I have been looking at Wiki since you mentioned it to me and I like the concept. The only stumbling blocks being the fact that this an 'open-source' type of project and how to setup/integrate it with the current setup. It is one of the topics on my list to check but my time is limited :( Bottom line is that I like the concept but need to think how we can get around the obstacles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">16th February 2002, 01:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem that I keep running into is the issue of copywrite.  Any &quot;Book&quot; would have to be written to look like an educational source.  It would be under the &quot;Free....  Free...&quot; oh I can't remember.  But this is an area of copyright that is still not defined.  You would be able to use Screen Shots under this clause, but you would not be able to use any existing material. (But why would we want to do that?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th February 2002, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is a great idea and would love to help out. If it was available in digital form as well as the hard copy if you wanted it, it could become the 'HitchHikers Guide to Baan'...</div></div><hr />

 But this is an area of copyright that is still not defined.  You would be able to use Screen Shots under this clause, but you would not be able to use any existing material.  <br />
<br />
Are you sure you can use screen shots?  My understanding is that a screenshot is just as copyrightable and protected as say the text.  The only way to use them (in the US) is under the 'fair use' rules - which basically means for things like reviews etc.<br />
<br />
If you go to the M$ sites and search for 'copyright screenshot' you will see that in certain circumstances they forego their rights.  It appears to be the same with most of the bigger software companies.<br />
<br />
However I can find no 'exemptions' with Baan.  <br />
<br />
Just because they have chosen not to exercise their rights in the past doesn't mean that they don't exist.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be a wet blanket as I think it is a really great idea, just make sure you all understand the full implications.<br />

And we could even just write without screen shots.  Like I said in the whole of my message, Copyright with Baan is difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I've created a BaanWiki over at http://www.baanwiki.info<br />
<br />
It's in its very very early stages, with virtually zero content.<br />
<br />
I don't want to distract from this brilliant forum, but I would like to distil the excellent info contained on this forum.<br />
<br />
Check out www.baanwiki.info, edit it if you like, and remember I'm still learning it too!</div></div><hr />

If anyone has an interest in writing articles, white papers or topics in a structured way then this can still be done in our baanboard CMS.
