Of-late I have been hearing that ERPLN is picking up due to its features and functionality in different parts of the world. Many BaaN IV customers are migrating to ERPLN. Also many new customers are getting added.<br />
What are the success stories for ERPLN? What do you think? Will it take on head on with SAP / Oracle? Will it be more successful than the previous versions because of its new features?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan user</div><div class="date">18th August 2008, 08:38</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion from a functional point of view ERP LN will meet and in many cases &quot;beat&quot; SAP. User interface/usability, integration with MS office and the dashboard functionality are much better modelled in ERP LN. Oracle is only nice with regards to user interface. Functionality wise Oracle is way behind SAP and ERP LN. All above is for retail and distribution/manufacturing companies. In some industry branches (insurance/banking and chemical/proces industries SAP has far more functionality. In project industries ERP LN is the best of the three.<br />
However, Infor is lacking the marketing power, that in my opinion is the greatest thread for major succes of ERP LN</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every ERP has its advantages and disadvantages, however ERP Ln , in my view is definetely very robust in functionality  for discreete manufacturing companies(especially FP3 and FP4 versions) , However I feel apart from marketing efforts from Infor , what is lacking is the efforts on training and certification from Infor for ERP Ln , unlike in SAP / Microsoft -ERP's where we have  so many companies offering education and certification. Let us hope they improve on these lines.</div></div><hr />
