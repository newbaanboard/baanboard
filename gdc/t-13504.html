<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanfive</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 07:27</div></div><div class="posttext">We are triton users currently and our company has plans to upgrade to Baan V ( if not to Gemini) . As a user i am going to be involved in this decision process.<br />
<br />
However, very less info is available about Baan V product for reference purpose from the actual end users.<br />
<br />
I have heard that there are majority of the Baan V customers are in the US and have been running this application successfully for over a couple of years now. <br />
<br />
I would like to have some idea about the Baan V customer base in the US, which industries are they from ? are they only smaller guys or bigger ones like us? ( 200 odd licences) what are the problems they facing while running their applications ( this might help us look at some other vendors if need be)? Do they feel the need for a versuion upgrade to gemini ? ( so that we may start thinking on that lines already ) <br />
<br />
any inputs from you would be of immense help<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
So far, as far as BaaN (anywhere in the world) licences are concerned...? How much MAXIMUM they have given at a site ?<br />
<br />
Does anybody have an answer to this ?<br />

There is an installation in the public sector in Germany with roundabout 16.000 Users.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure but I heard somewhere that it was with about 30,000 users. If anybody can confirm/correct that, it will be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acapulco</div><div class="date">7th November 2003, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Mabe is the largest customer in Mexico.  Also Kenthworth Mexico has 800 seats. <br />
All other customers are under 500 seats, and most of them under 50.<br />

<br />
Surprisingly we haven't had anyone from the US spoken so far as yet.<br />

Hello  baan customers/users/consultants in the US....wonder what's stopping you ?<br />

<br />
mmm..I was wondering, what would be the DB size..what kind of mechanism they might be doing for Admin work...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">10th November 2003, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">They have more than one Baan system, and several different configurations. That would break up those 35,000 users but I don't know what the largest single system would be.<br />
<br />
The Baan - NT - SQL7 ports were created especially for Boeing, since Baan got the account through Microsoft. Their &quot;mechanism&quot; would (in my imagination) be no different from any other properly maintained system.</div></div><hr />

Somethings cannot be posted due to Corporate Information Security and Disclosure rules. And I hope you understand the role of ERP and data security for a company.</div></div><hr />
