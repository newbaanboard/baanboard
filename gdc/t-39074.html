Because every time I look top of the threads.<br />
It made me bored. Am I right All friends ? If not ! there are lots of major threads that should be on top.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">It is kept at the top because we hope others will post undocumented functionality that we do not know.  By making it a sticky thread then when new users enter the forum it is there for them to see and maybe add to.  This is a common thread that can benefit newbies as well as gurus. George and I discussed it early on and I think we agree it should be a sticky thread.  This will keep people from having to search the forum - and it something that they might like to read on occasion.  So we the moderators like it where it is. <br />
<br />
So I have trained my eyes to scan the first post to see if it needs to be read and then I move down the forum.  It just does not bother me.  Usually I am using the &quot;new posts&quot; features to see what to read.</div></div><hr />

However, I have moved the posts to this new thread since we are interested in keeping that (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=36550) thread focused on its issue &amp; &quot;clean&quot;. <br />

This kind of threads are available in all forums which helps newbie users substantially . Is it visible in other way besides searching through forum .</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thread was made &quot;unsticky&quot; per user request. Undoubtedly, we could find a population of members who would be in favour of making this particular thread sticky and another group of members who do not want to see this as a sticky thread. In this case I intervened but have told myself not to do this anymore as to avoid such discussions. From now on, it's a moderator's decision whether or not to make a thread sticky.<br />
<br />
The ideal solution to keep this kind of knowledge in the picture is to convert it into a Wiki entry. That way the information does not get lost between the multitudes of the other threads. Once done, it is easy to link to the Wiki page from forum posts.</div></div><hr />
