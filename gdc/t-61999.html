<br />
Our company recently lost our Baan application programmer. <br />
<br />
We are using Baan 4b2 with a SQL 2000 database on a Windows 2003 server. Many other applications integrated with Baan for payroll, printing, and EDI. I’m unsure of how much documentation there is. Some customizations have been done. The position and need is being evaluated. Nothing can be offered at this time but contract work is definitely an option as problems and needs arise in the immediate future.<br />
<br />
I am the Network Administrator looking for support solutions and people with the Baan 4b2 knowledge / skill set. I’m hoping that I can look to members of this board for support ideas. <br />
<br />
Please contact me via this board for me information and I will post more as a direction get formulated.</div></div><hr />
