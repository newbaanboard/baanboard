On the other hand, it's not that easy and if you have never done it before it's probably wiser to ask for assistance.<br />

I just used that document as a guide for moving our production LN FP3 environment to a new test server. <br />
<br />
We ran into a couple of issues along the way, but all solved by logging incidents with Infor. <br />
<br />
Specifically, we had an SLM issue and with Infor's guidance wound up sharing licenses with the production server. Also had a MS SQL Server issue with orphaned users. Found a stored procedure to run that solved that issue. <br />
