<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">14th August 2001, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">From a Baan Tools consultant in Portugal, he quit his job and started is own company, not Baan related, mentioning that the market was still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">15th August 2001, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">With Invensys posting major problems at the moment, you can't expect the Baan garden to start smelling of roses at the moment. Okay, there might be some blooms but I think things are bad for all Baan connections at the moment. <br />
<br />
With Baan trying to plug the IBaan solution at the moment, which is basically trying to sell an idea as no-one I know has seen the product actually working live yet, if makes me wonder if Baan are preening themselves for the next owner?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krazykriz</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 12:33</div></div><div class="posttext">As a product consultant with Baan Automotive in Hannover,<br />
all I can say is that evidently the information flow to the outer<br />
world is not the best.<br />
Problems in Invensys are with their construction and power <br />
divisions, the IT segment, including Baan, is alive and well.<br />
Baan got back into black figures ahead of schedule, while other<br />
ERP providers suffer from big losses.<br />
And Christopher, if you haven't seen i-Baan solutions live, then that doesn't mean they don't exist. Check out Husco and Komatsu to see how good they work. At Husco, you can order yourself a beer can holder for your car at the same time.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I'm just saying that I-Baan is still in development (even if it may be in some sites) and its only available to those with a large user base and willing to take the rough with the smooth while its been developed. I am all for the forwarding of the technology and software (as long as I can keep up after all)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krazykriz</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a little irritated now, because to my knowledge, all i-Baan products are officially released and the only development is to get them ready also for the extensions, which will be end of this year for automotive.<br />
But if you are interested in certain products then let me know and I'll be glad to find out for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thats strange as, according to UK sales teams, I-Baan is not offically released until Q1 next year. We've all been told thats its in beta development at some sites (which we are not told about) and there are no training sessions or 'real-life' demos available. <br />
<br />
Sounds like something odd is going on here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krazykriz</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">That is strange indeed. Let me check into this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krazykriz</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Naw, that stuff is out. Check yourself: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">22nd August 2001, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Will check that out later this afternoon, however, having made a few calls and emails, I can't find one person in the UK who is really interested in the product at the moment (most are still considering Baan V upgrades in the near future)</div></div><hr />
