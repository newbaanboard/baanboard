<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">23rd June 2009, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps a useful idea is to compile a small 'directory' for ERP LN partners on our own site since Infor does not supply this info. Interested parties can send me relevant (contact) information to patrick@baanboard.com and I will create an overview page.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd suggest that you contact Infor directly if you need new/additional licenses. I'm sure they will also give you information about partners in your area.<br />
