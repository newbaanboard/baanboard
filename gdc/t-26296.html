We are expecting at least a hundred or so attendees.  OST can also provide customized training based on your needs.  I am actually based in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area, and we can provide additional resources for anything that I myself cannot cover.<br />
<br />
If you would like more information, feel free to contact David Gerrity at dgerrity@ostusa.com.  For information on the OST Education Symposium you can visit http://www.osteducation.com.<br />

Thanks,<br />
