<br />
I am new to BaaN and looking for some good text resources. I've read several threads about perhaps writing a manual for users just like myself, but haven't discovered any such gems.<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me in the direction of some helpful materials?<br />
<br />
My questions are not specific at this point - I am looking to develop my basic knowledge and use.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th March 2007, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">First use Baan support site to download documentation - some of it is not that bad.  Second once you figure out some specific questions search this board and the appropriate forum.  <br />
<br />
OH YEAH - do not forget you can search the WIKI attached to this board.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the board!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm afraid my questions are going to seem really quite elementary, but I will try to gather info before posing them.<br />
<br />
That said... What is the URL for the the support site?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LeanneS.</div><div class="date">8th March 2007, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">oops... please disregard, I found the URL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th March 2007, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Here it is http://www.support.baan.com/.  You will need a login that you can get from the support center.  <br />
<br />
Well - sometimes I like easy questions. :)  Just keep in mind the people logged into baanboard may not know the answer to your question and you might have to be patient while waiting for an answer.  Also remember to try searching the forums first - some members get a little cranky on repeat topics.</div></div><hr />

I'd be interested in getting my hands on the Baan student training guide.  Can you help me out, or direct me to where I can find the advice I need?  I have asked for a manual, but told there wasnt' one to give.  We have to use the help for questions.  I'd like to know the expected path for a make to order facility in Baan.  We have minimum production requirements, but don't ask the customer to purchase the extras.  So one problem I see is that Baan expects a customer order to generate a production sheet, but I wold like to produce some parts just for stock.</div></div><hr />
