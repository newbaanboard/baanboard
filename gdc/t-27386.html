<br />
I'm a new member of BaaNboard, I really interesting to the BAANXL created by Mr Vamsi. I have followed the instruction based on the thread #5880. I've created the forms, but I didn't find the program scripts of the form. Are there someone help me? :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finally, I've got the program script and I can run the BAANXL as the device choice. But, now I face a new problem. When I try to preview.report, the result is only the num=&gt;  characters. Lines of the file were blank. Did I make any mistake?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ciptadi.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ciptadi</div><div class="date">19th June 2006, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess that I didn't create the file correctly. When the first script execute, it must be create a file (fp1) then this file directory copied when the session started. I guess, if the action success it must give result a file that can be viewed with command preview.report.<br />
<br />
Are there someone has any idea?<br />

Did you download and follow the instructions in the word document attached? If so, describe what steps you have followed so far and where you are running into trouble.</div></div><hr />

Now, I could run this BAANXL until converted to become Excell file. But it because I modified the First program script:<br />
<br />
I've change your prog script  zusfwexcel  with &quot;cbcomexcel&quot;, and this prog script  starts the session &quot;cbcomexcell&quot; with prog script &quot;cbcomexcell&quot;.<br />

ret = seq.unlink(input.file)<br />
}<br />
|*******************************************************<br />
<br />
The problems are:<br />
<br />
When I run this program script, it can't create the input.file.<br />
<br />
I've tested this by showing the message when the session cbcomexcell started. This session import the input.file and argument.  So, at the first this session starts, I show the message that contains the input.file and argument. The message showed only &quot;&quot; (blank). <br />
<br />
There are two possibilities in this case:<br />
1. The process create &quot;input.file&quot; was failed<br />
2. The process import variable &quot;input.file&quot; was failed<br />
    The process import variable &quot;argument&quot; was failed<br />
<br />
Actually, I can solve this problem, by create new button in session, to replace the process create input.file. And it was created succefully. <br />
<br />
The next problem is:<br />
- When I run &quot;save.default.values&quot; for the first time. So when, run the BAANXL for the second time, etc, it will perform directly. It because the syntax in the before program, to perform the process.file if the argument isn't &quot;ADMIN&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, I confuse, how to import the argument into the session. because the result is always &quot;&quot;.<br />
<br />
Do you have any method, how to recognize while the session performed from BAANXL,  or from BAANXL-ADMIN?<br />
<br />
<br />
The other problem is:<br />
<br />
The result of the report (in excell), for the numeric data is irregular.<br />
<br />
for example:<br />
*   86.900,0000  (eighty six thousand an nine hundred) <br />
If I set this data (In the fill details) with string it will become  86.900,000<br />
*   2,0000         (two)<br />
If I set this data (In the fill details) with string it will become  20,000<br />
<br />
<br />
OTHERWISE,<br />
<br />
*   86.900,0000  (eighty six thousand an nine hundred) <br />
<br />
If I set this data (In the fill details) with numeric it will become  86.9<br />
<br />
*   2,0000         (two)<br />
<br />
If I set this data (In the fill details) with numeric it will become  20000<br />
<br />
<br />
Ho to set the data type &quot;date&quot; ?<br />
I follow your example, set the data type for date to numeric, but when the file converted, I can't format the data(in excell) to become date type the result is #########<br />
<br />
<br />
For example :<br />
<br />
date    03062006 (3rd   June 2006) it will become      3062006   in excell<br />
date    14062006 (14th June 2006) it will become     14062006   in excell, but I can't set this data to become date type.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if my question is too long.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help, God bless you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank's &amp; Regards.<br />

As a first step could you please troubleshoot why you cannot create a file as specified in the script. This could have consequences later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I can finish my problems. Now, I can convert BaaN to MS Excell. But  I have a problem, when I convert a text which contains comma (in one column), it will separated as some column, whereas it's a part of one column.<br />
How to solve it :confused: ?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Ciptadi.<br />
<br />
Note: As can as possible, I don't want to change the column separator with other character, because MS Excell will recognize comma as column separator(standard).</div></div><hr />
