This is what I found at one of the sites -</div></div><hr />

I am not surprised for the Baan bit but then again do those figures reflect the true situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">19th December 2002, 11:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Can not comment on that. But, if you search the net for ERP jobs, this is the sequence of the demand -<br />
1. SAP<br />
2. Oracle<br />
3. PeopleSoft.<br />
4. JD.<br />
<br />
Mind you, NO fifth option!!<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">20th December 2002, 11:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The number of jobs posted in a decent site should be representative of the segment.<br />
<br />
For example, I went to www.dice.com and searched for keyword 'baan'  (in US) for the past 30 days. And it returned 30 jobs, which by itself is not relevant for everyone. So effectively a 'Baan Tools' requirement will be say 2-3.<br />
<br />
But for a search by keyword 'JDE' fetches 158 jobs for the same span of time. Though not accurate, it strongly depicts the trend in the market.<br />
<br />
Let's hope for a better market by 2003!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanassist</div><div class="date">20th December 2002, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
The reason why you cannot find many jobs in Baan is because Baan's focus is to milk their installed base and not to sell new software licenses to new customers.<br />
<br />
The milking is done by selling products like iBaan Portal, iBaan Business Intelligence Suite, Crystal, Supply Chain, Open World, etc. to their existing customers. For example Baan USA just laid off 10 sales people and there are only 20 left. Out of these 20 only one guy is focusing on selling new iBaan ERP licenses and the rest of the guys are focused on the products just mentioned.<br />
Perhaps Baan also realizes that after their announcement at the 2002 BWU Fall Workshop in LA  to release Gemini (Baan VI) in September 2003 they will no longer be able to sell new licence deals for Baan V_c anyway.<br />
Baan's situation in the market is still not good and this information will give existing Baan IV customers a good reason not to go to Baan V_c soon. In fact they will say they are going to wait for Gemini.<br />
The only hope Baan has here is that one of their resellers can still sell new iBaan ERP licences but also they are not really doing a great job.<br />
<br />
The other issue with Baan jobs is that since Baan is scrambling to get revenue they have now entered the after-sales market (consulting and education) themselves by stealing away business from their partners. This is a process that is happening worldwide and will for sure drive partners away from Baan. Perhaps that is Baan's hidden agenda but definitely not good for their customers.<br />
<br />
As long as Baan can only keep their costs in sync with their revenue more lay-offs in Baan are expected as their revenue is decreasing. This circle can only be broken if Baan is coming up with new inovative ideas and is really committed to fix their bad reputation in the market. The current management of Laurens, Susan Heystee and friends have to be replaced and a new fresh wind is necessary to give the company new blood and new ideas.<br />
Unfortunately Baan's parent company, Invensys, is also sleeping so if nothing happens Baan will no longer exist in 4 years from now.<br />
Since Baan's competitors are not sleeping at all it is no wonder they are already talking about existing Baan customers as a 'replacement market'.<br />
 <br />
Despite all of this let me wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.</div></div><hr />
