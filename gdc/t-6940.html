That one is also no longer listed in the DNS. I think that message about 'experiencing problems with the disk ' is an old message.</div></div><hr />

 Yes since we are not the first message board to emerge on the web for 'baanfans'. No because we believe our message board offers many advantages over the already existing bulletin boards:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
there are no other already existing bulletin boards any more ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">2nd October 2002, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point, but let's wait and see for a while. The old demon may still come back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd October 2002, 17:19</div></div><div class="posttext">The BaanAssist board(?) still exists and there use to be a baanfans.co.uk, but it came up empty.  So it is close to being the only board and of course it is already the best. :)<br />

Hello All <br />
Unfortunately we could not recover the data from the disk.  <br />
<br />
It might take a while to get the data from the disk as we are sending it to Data Recovery Labs. <br />
<br />
In the mean time we are going to upload the files with the old backup we have.  We will be back online very soon. <br />
<br />

Baanfans had trashed its archives more than once on purpose. There was no way to get to the useful information that got accumulated over time. This time around they just do not seem to have a backup. Lets see what they come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th October 2002, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I hardly dare to ask,... Pat... you do have enough reduncency in machines / disks + a good back up I suppose ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">14th October 2002, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Lucas,<br />
<br />
Yep. All data is stored on RAID-1 disks. Backups are taken daily which includes a mysqldump plus all files from the httpd document directory. The backup file is then also copied to a second machine for redundancy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th October 2002, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">.... which is stored off-site?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">14th October 2002, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">The second machine is located 20KM away from the first one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th October 2002, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">just to be sure and confident... and all depends on you allone? Can someone else restore baanboard in case of calamity?<br />
<br />
I do not know where baanfans.com failed, but losing information is never nice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">14th October 2002, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, the advantage of the way I set up the backup is that it delivers a packaged bundle of data and application so that it is just a matter of unzipping everything in the right place, uploading the data in the database and checking the configuration (if necessary).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th October 2002, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, certainly now everyone knows the procedure, there must be members that are able to able to restore, in case the baanboard server explodes in your face... :-)</div></div><hr />

You say unsubscribe? I can't - my out going email address does not match theirs. My email address used to have a &quot;_&quot; in it and it is now a &quot;.&quot;, but I can receive both.  When I try to unsubscribe to these things I get messages back telling me I can't. So I do the next best thing and delete'em. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark !<br />
<br />
Hmm - I think I know how you feel<br />
<br />
I used to receive their email twice ,as the company I work for changed its name and therefore emai,l--- until yesterday when on entering the site to print the &quot;extract&quot; I posted here they asked for my details again ! <br />
<br />
I sent them a polite email pointing out the problem of 2 copies which I am already receiving and the fact I had been unable to amend but then received back a system generated email saying &quot;thank you&quot; I would be added to their subscribers ! <br />
<br />
So next week I am &quot;looking forward&quot; to 3 -- I think<br />
<br />
Hey ho &quot;<br />
