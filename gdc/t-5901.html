<br />
Is there any cost involved in upgrading? We have a 40 seat license and have a maintenence agreement with Baan, but do we have to pay Baan any additional fee to get the Baan 5 Software?</div></div><hr />

Does your support contract mention something about &quot;innovation fee&quot;?<br />
If you pay the innovation fee, the update should be free.<br />

As far i as know the software is free because you have agreement with BAAN, but you have pay for the procedure of nigration baan IV-&gt;V. I guess Baan doesn't provide these methods for free. We also are planning to migrate and the problems are the same. :)</div></div><hr />

From my understanding, Baan usually does not charge for software. But migration toolkit maybe required, which Baan would like to sell. Plus you got to spend money on getting consultants, which maybe different in different parts of world!!</div></div><hr />

Yes I've heard just the same about the circumstances of migration. The point is in what  way  local Baan representatives would perform migration (qualification, prces , etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please be more specific. As other friends have suggested in this thread...it all depends. Add some more like customizations, etc and I can help you with can be a rough budgetary estimate. If you are in the US you can call me at 408 551 4910, else email at Maxdixit@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

The cost would be to migrate and implement any new functionally, Customizations or training required in the upgrades version.</div></div><hr />
