<br />
I mean: starting from tomorrow, the item A will be known with the code B. All the data related to the item A become related to the item B (order lines, inventory data, historical data,...). <br />
After this step, the item A does not exist anymore into the system.<br />
<br />
Thank you, very much!</div></div><hr />

This is a hehind the door thng.  You need to find out all the tables involved and write a personalized session to change it in all tables.  Make you  you map out the sequence of references.  We write a session to allow the user to put in the old code and the new code.  We first make sure the old code exists and create the new code if it does not.  If the new code already exists, you need to warn the user and ask the user to reconfirm.  You should try one item first and have all related parties check out to make sure it works.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanconsultant</div><div class="date">26th November 2002, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We created a program for a customer of us that finds out where a domain is being used, and than, with a conversion table, converts all the tablesfields that use the domain. There are however a few things to look into: runtime, &quot;other&quot; domains for itemcode, standard &lt;=&gt;customized items in pur and sls tables (the program doesn't care about the project, it would just convert the itemcode), Statistics (would have to be build up again since the item code is &quot;coded&quot; into the statistic base tables without the use of domain tcitem. (there might be more). <br />
<br />
A much faster solution whan the one we build, might be to create a program that dumps the tables into ascii files, and creates scripts to convert the asciifiles (replace the itemcodes, it knows from the data dictionary where the itemcode in the asciifile is located) and than load the tables again. We had this as a &quot;plan b&quot; for the case that the needed performance would not have been reached.</div></div><hr />
