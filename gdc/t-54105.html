One of the Infor representative wanted to know if anybody is using the newly created portal in infor365.com. (If you didn't then it is similar to a user forum). The response from the audience was that they signed up but not quite using it.<br />

Some of the comparision points raised were that.<br />

<br />
 Infor365.com has a highly moderated forum where you are allowed to only say nice things. <br />
<br />
 Mosaic user group is fee based and has very limited members. <br />
<br />
 Baanboard is free and the the most active forum for Baan users.<br />
Congratulations Baanboard!!</div></div><hr />

I seem to have missed your post originally. Thanks for the kind words. I have always said that there is no reason why Baanboard.com could not be an encompassing [virtual online presence for ALL Baan users globally (apart from language issues perhaps). But experience has shown that people rather prefer fragmentation rather than co-operation. It's a sad truth but something I no longer get upset about.</div></div><hr />
