I am soooo not sure anymore if they still do that.  You can contact them at least they may know where you can still get it.  <br />

Baan had a certification program several years ago that consultants could go through training and then pass a test to be certified in certain areas of the Baan solutions like Manufacturing, Distribution and Finance. <br />
<br />
Since SSA acquired Baan they have re-structured the old Baan partnership program and they offer training and certification for its certified channel network program. You must be a certified channel partner to attend so I donÂ’t think they have plans to offer this to independent consultants.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in training, I sent TriNET an e-mail and they called me back and they offer classroom and on site training for all SSA/Baan solutions.<br />
<br />
Here is the contact info for TriNET:<br />

<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Certificated BaaN consultant! <br />
<br />
&#8220;I sent e-mail to trinet by they don't want to answer. May be they don't need for money.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Our question to Adriano &amp; Learner are:<br />
<br />
What was the subject line on the e-mail you sent?<br />
When did you send the e-mail?<br />
What address did you send the e-mail to?<br />
<br />
Someone responded to the post but I thought I would include the following link that is on the SSA Global website that explains the certification program for the certified channel partners of SSA. <br />
