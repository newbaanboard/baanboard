It contained references to several types (compositions) of Service Packs.  In this document it says that the 'Delta' type contains changes implemented during the build period of the concerning service pack.  The 'Cumulative' type not only contains changes of the concerning service pack but also all changes of the preceding service packs.  and The 'Full product' type which not only cotains components which were changed during the maintenance stage, but also the components which were not changed.  It is still not clear to me exactly what the differences are among these types of Service Packs.  I am on IVc4 Service Pack 5.  If I want to upgrade to Service Pack 9 which would be best for me? (I dont have source and therefore customizations are not an issue for me).  You can contact me at<br />

<br />
The earlier Service Packs (SP1-4 I think) were cumulative which means that by installing SP4 it would also install all changed components of SP1 to 3.<br />
<br />
Delta Service Packs (SP5-9) can only be installed in sequence as each SP depends on the presence of the previous one. So for upgrading to SP9 you would have to install SP6, SP7, SP8 and SP9 and in that order.<br />
<br />
The full Service Packs I believe, are 'updated' master CD's/tapes that can be used to install the core version and SP version in one go. But I might be wrong on this one.</div></div><hr />
