<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">15th October 2007, 13:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a good article on how existing user of a pure data warehouse only finds DW <br />
capabilities of SQL  2k5 very interesting .<br />
<br />
Do u need a data warehouse (http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Design/doyouneedadatawarehouse/2460/)  <br />
<br />
There is good price comparision in favour of SQL 2k5 done in this link .<br />
<br />
Flying high with BI  (http://www.intelligententerprise.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=167100274&amp;pgno=1)<br />
<br />
Even Oracle too has OLAP DW features but are available only in its enterprise edition <br />
whereas SQL 2005 offers good data warehousing capabilities in it's  standard edition <br />
itself . OLAP / BI  capabilities of SQL  2k5  has been one reason for increasing dominance <br />
of MSSQL in both database market (relational as well as multi-dimensional).<br />
<br />
Increasing influence of large BI  vendors (in comparision to pure play BI <br />
vendors ) had been predicted by Gartner this year .<br />
Business Intelligence market growth in 2007 (http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=500680)<br />
<br />
And its acknowledged in current year's magic quandrant.<br />
<br />
Microsoft is Positioned in Leaders Quadrant of Latest Magic Quadrant for Data Warehousing (http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/prnewswire/AQF021A12102007-1.htm)<br />
<br />
Probably the increasing dominance of MS SQL can be a reason behind recent takeovers of hyperion <br />
(by oracle ) and business objects (by SAP).</div></div><hr />
