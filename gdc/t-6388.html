The OWC's ActiveX controls have several vulnerabilities which an attacker could use to run arbitrary commands, access the clipboard, or read any file on a victim's system. An exploit could be embedded in a maliciously crafted web site or HTML e-mail, although users who have set their Outlook and IE security settings to view e-mails and untrusted sites in the Restricted Sites zone would be safe. Microsoft has marked all of these vulnerabilities as 'Critical' so be sure to download the patch immediately: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-044.asp</div></div><hr />
