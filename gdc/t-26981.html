Glad to see you were at the conference!  I'll double-check on where we are on posting presentations from the conference to our web site.  It will likely be in the secured member library.<br />

How about making these presentations also available to the larger public of Baanboard? Surely, SSA can only benefit from it?</div></div><hr />
