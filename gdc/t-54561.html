our company was engaged by a IVc4 site, who were having issues with the integration between their Baan and salesforce.com. We were selected because we're able to update customers, prospects, addresses, sales orders etc.. (any baan transaction or series of transactions) back &amp; forth from salesforce/Baan without the need for custom code or traditional interfaces, functions etc.... Implementation was only a matter of weeks and they've been up &amp; running stable for years now. If you'd like to know more, let me know and I could show you how it's done. <br />
<br />
have a good afternoon<br />
