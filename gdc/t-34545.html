<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medin74</div><div class="date">19th April 2007, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, first of all allow me to apologize if I make some silly assumptions; I am an SAP developer by trade and was asked to help figure out how to make something happen in a Baan system (which I know very little about).<br />
<br />
  Basically, they have a need to programmatically post production order confirmations into their Baan (IVc4 is the version they told me) systems from an external application.  The external app being in-house developed can be made to  output the data in any fashion/protocol: XML, delimited files, API calls, DB inserts etc.  Unfortunately, I am completely in the dark as to what is available as far as external interfaces in Baan.  Is there somewhere I can find documentation for these?  I've googled around a bit and searched the boards here but I am having a hard time making sense of things since so many Baan-centric terms are new to me.<br />
<br />
  In case any of you are also SAP developers, I am looking for the equivalent of an SAP BAPI call or IDoc. :) <br />
<br />
  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hpadode</div><div class="date">14th June 2007, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">You can make this by making a session which will input of file on the client server location with specific name and path on a definate location. Then directly insert/update the data into the post product table. For this you have to have a programming knowledge of baan for new session development and coding.</div></div><hr />
