Okay some of you may already have had these in an email, or seen them somewhere, but for those that haven't, have a go at answering these little questions.....<br />
<br />
The idea is to answer them quickly in your head, right the answers down and then re-read the questions....<br />
<br />
Q1: You are competing in a race, and overtake the runner lying in second place. In which position are you now? <br />
<br />
Q2: If you overtake the last runner, what position are you now in? <br />
<br />
Q3: Take 1000. Add 40. Add another 1000. Add 30. 1000 again. Plus 20. Plus 1000. And plus 10. <br />
<br />
Q4) Marie's father has five daughters: 1. Chacha 2. Cheche 3. Chichi 4. Chocho 5. ????</div></div><hr />
