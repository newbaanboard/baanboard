<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">24th June 2007, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor showed on its presentation that there was more than 700 Ln clients up to March,2007. 600 install base already moved or moving to Ln, this is not bad. Among this number, only about 100 are new clients. <br />
<br />
Considering Ln is there since 2004, so after 3 years, only 100 new clients. There is something wrong with the Sales &amp; Marketing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">27th June 2007, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem i think is the reluctance of establishments in changing their existing well oiled setup to a much more complex and costlier Ln. Erp these days form just a part of the business tools employed by an organization and so there would be other applications which are dependant on the existing setup and the cost(software + manpower) of upgrading all these would be astronomical...<br />
 <br />
dont you think?<br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaushikC</div><div class="date">6th September 2007, 10:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I do agree, the thought of a new system implimentations itself would send jitters down the org. <br />
Such is the case in every aspect of life. Its the ability to improvice that makes one to show affitnity towards moving on to somehting new. And the people who do this improvisation are the sales team, for every product irrespective of ERP or not.<br />
As always we tend to stick to the thing that is used by the majority, unless ofcource someone convinces us differently.<br />
<br />
Talking of dependencies and existing setup and cost of integration, well i guess all products have that, don't you think so?<br />
<br />
Its high time infor really gears up to do something for its sales and distribution.<br />
<br />
And above all if change is not inevitable and all is stable ... i guess there would be no need for you and me. lol....</div></div><hr />

Hi Mohit,<br />
<br />
That looks quite interesting...but migration from &quot;Old BaaN versions&quot; to LN is not an easy task and customers look at it as a task of migrating from one ERP to another. This has made them to shift to other better-known ERPs like SAP.<br />
<br />
Why cant Infor create a migration tool for existing customers? I know its not an easy task....but we have to ease the process of migration to retain existing customers.<br />
<br />

Customers must request Infor for this migration planning.<br />
The Infor SOA which was announced in June this year helps customers integrate multiple solutions without the need of an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The migration tool developed is for std purposeand product. I know Infor maintains separate servers for every client and makes sure that the database is kept as same as the client one :) . Big Clients expect Infor to develop the tool based on this database....Also, the localization is still an issue with LN and localization testing/development is still going on....</div></div><hr />
