<br />
More and more Baan IV and BaanERP customers are considering what to do next with their backbone ERP system. So the time has come to experience a fresh and new way to look at the possibility for migrating your Baan IV and/or BaanERP environment to ERP LN. We all know that an implementation of an ERP system from a totally different ERP vendor will be so much more expensive than a migration to ERP LN. With easybaan the migration to LN will be easy and cost-effective and will give the Baan users at your company the ability to learn LN so much faster than the traditional way of re-inventing that wheel again.  <br />
<br />
Benefits of the easybaan migration methodology and framework include:<br />
<br />
<br />
 At the first day of your project a pre-configured ERP LN system will be available to you containing zero-error business processes in Order Management, Enterprise Planning, Manufacturing, Warehousing, Central Invoicing and Finance and you can use your own Baan IV and/or BaanERP data right away<br />
 ERP LN training of key users will be done with your own data from Baan IV and/or BaanERP<br />
 The data migration takes place in the first phase of the project allowing customers to focus on the optimization of the implementation of ERP LN in the second and third phase of the project<br />
 The data that is migrated out of Baan IV and BaanERP can be cleaned up and optimized during the migration process. No &quot;as-is&quot; migration is needed<br />
 Early successes are visible at the beginning of the project<br />
 Drastically decreased implementation time of ERP LN<br />
<br />
<br />
Easybaan supports the following data that can be migrated from Baan IV and/or BaanERP:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Common and MCS tables (logistics and financial)<br />
 Product/Manufacturing related data: Items (standard &amp; customized), Bills of Material (standard &amp; customized), Routings, Operations, Project Data<br />
 Business Partners related data: customers, suppliers and addresses<br />
 Sales Orders: open orders and history<br />
 Purchase Orders: open orders and history<br />
 Inventory Stock Positions<br />
 Open Entries from Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable<br />
 Account balances: customers, suppliers and ledger accounts<br />
<br />
<br />
