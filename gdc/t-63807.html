<br />
This is my first post, so if it's in the wrong forum, I apologise!!!<br />
<br />
I have spent many hours trying to find an answer to my question. I have seen a few (not many though) posts sort of skirting the issue, but still I am doubtful.<br />
<br />
Quite simply, I need to integrate functionality from BaaN 4 to a web application using VB.NET.<br />
<br />
In days gone by (and forgive me for saying this) I used SAP. SAP provided BAPI’s. These were a comprehensive set of functions that could be referred to and utilised in 3rd party apps – quite successfully I might add!<br />
<br />
My vision is that BaaN would have a similar functionality where as a function can be called within the code, a few parameters passed and the results generated directly on Baan – for example I would call a function that generates a sales order header, passes the customer and contact details and Baan would create the sales order and return say the sales order number to the calling application.<br />
<br />
Now, the crunch is .... how the devil can I do this ????????</div></div><hr />
