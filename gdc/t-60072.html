<br />
I was surprised today, and yesterday, by Infor's attitude towards it's customers. Their &quot;vision&quot; is : <br />
&quot;At Infor, we work with a core belief. We believe in the customer. We believe that the customer is seeking a better, more collaborative relationship with their business software provider. And a new breed of business software: created for evolution, not revolution. Software that's simple to buy, easy to deploy and convenient to manage. Our 70,000 customers in more than 100 countries stand with us. We look forward to your sharing in the results of our belief. There is a better way. For additional information, visit www.infor.com .&quot;<br />
But in fact:<br />
- they suspended my access to www.infor365.com due to &quot;Some combined unlucky events&quot;; the truth is they accused me I didn't paid the last support invoice &quot;I received confirmation from your account manager  that the maintenance invoice for 2011 has not been paid yet&quot;; in fact the invoice was paid; as they said &quot;unlucky events&quot; ....<br />
- they re-granted my access to the site today, but I can no longer post incidents and I can no longer download manuals. What should I do with the access in that case ? to read their &quot;vision&quot; ?<br />
- I called directly in the USA; they redirected me to some manager responsible for EMEA; I will contact him also but to be honest I am very disapointed about their attitude.<br />
<br />
Anybody experienced such &quot;unlucky events&quot; also or it's just me ?</div></div><hr />

Infor support from Grand Rapids always helped us ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bogdan</div><div class="date">19th February 2011, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I know Infor's support is ok; that's why I was surprised !<br />
Eventualy it was fixed, but I still have the sensation that behind my back were some discussions between some levels of support, and I think this is not nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmartin</div><div class="date">8th June 2011, 12:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Here in Spain they are engaged in a &quot;suicide&quot; strategy by trying to catch money from good old customers still using BaaN IV via some software usage audit procedure , which comes simply into a money requirement for using the old BaaN IV source code (provided by them long ago as a sales argument, and even under written source code usage agreements) based in legal tricks in general purpose common clauses about intellectual property in the license contracts. Even the procedure followed looks more like a mafia lawyers film (hidden menaces, frightening messages, ...) than a normal customer-supplier negociation .....  This fool attitude removes completely any confidence in the Infor company and obviously eliminates any doubt about discarding LN or any other Infor product as replacement for Baan IV in the next future..<br />
<br />
This is really sad for people like me , who have bee working with Baan for more than 15 years now..  <br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this true ? Are they still doing this in Spain ? Then it is really sad.<br />
<br />
Like you I am also an old Baan user/consultant more than 14 years.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmartin</div><div class="date">27th January 2012, 09:29</div></div><div class="posttext">That's as true as they 've done this with my company, an small multinational spanish group., with more than 100 BaaN licenses. Instead of being the logical alternative to BaaN IV update , we're now evaluating moving to MS AX or SAP, and loosing chances everyday as they now say that no source code will be provided with LN, (without some irrational payment, I suppose). As I told, our former objection to move to LN was the very voture of the company and the product. Now , when they seem finally to have a &quot;safe&quot; roadmap, they seem to push customers out of the BaaN world...<br />
<br />
It's really sad for me too.<br />

<br />
in Portugal we assist the same attitude from Infor.<br />
<br />
They don't respect their customers, and are now trying to make money using the excuse of scripts present in the application (even if the script was installed with standard solutions).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">27th January 2012, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I know there are good reasons why you should want to have access to source code. However is it always necessary? <br />
<br />
Changing source code always gives you the problem that you have to update it again as soon as Infor brings out a solution in which the component is changed.<br />
<br />
Since developing code is probably not your core business wouldn't it be wise to leave that to a company who does this all the time? <br />
<br />
Furthermore a development license is not very expensive anymore and with using AFS you can achieve a lot. With it you don't have to do the check your code if a newer solution is installed. Also using user exit dll's can be used to perform specific updates automatically if you insert new data or update it.<br />
<br />

I agree with Han.<br />
Just recall what Infor LN product was 3/4years back.<br />
This is a development phase and Infor is releasing lot of good functionalities. Although i do admit that progress is slow followed by poor marketing, but still the product is very user friendly compare to SAP/Oracle.<br />
<br />
Getting source code is easy but changes in any dll can cause major impact on standard processes &amp; functionalities.<br />
Sometimes I experience frustration due to delay in feedback from Infor but still neverthless this is very rigid and robust s/w , and thats the reason its still surviving n competing.<br />
<br />
Cheers ..:cool:</div></div><hr />

LN is very difference then BaanIV. More features, more functionality, very good solutions for customer personalization, and for customizations without source code. For example, we implemented LN for very big manufacturing plant (more than 700 users) without source-code. <br />
<br />
And what about LN road-map. Infor now investing more money in LN development. And has very good and long term product road-map. <br />
<br />
What about SAP and Axapta. On previous job one of our ERP system was SAP. And we had source cod. But it didn't help us, because any time you can't understand what result you will have in system with 30 years source code history((((. About Axapta more simple. You can develop more and more customization, this is Microsoft policy. Because you have smaller functionality, than LN. But Microsoft can/t warranty to you, you migrate from release to release. What do you want?</div></div><hr />
