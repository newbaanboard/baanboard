I am not a consultant and am not looking for replies from any, I would just like to team up &amp; collaborate with other LN users in the hopes of assisting each other with abit of LN guidance based on our own specific training &amp; experience.<br />

Your suggestion is good.<br />
However, to be honest I am not sure whether BaanBoard is the right place for your idea.<br />
In the event you would like to do this with just users your best bet may be to do this via SSAU, the &quot;independent&quot; user group for SSA BAAN customers in North America.<br />
If I were you I would go to http://www.ssaglobalusers.org/ and sign up with them. They also organize regional meetings for SSA BAAN users where people actually physically meet.</div></div><hr />
