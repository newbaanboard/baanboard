<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">31st May 2013, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Check with Crossroadsrmc (http://www.crossroadsrmc.com/).  They have some tools that do that type of thing.  I am sure there are others, but I can't remember any names.  <br />
<br />
We automated our 4c4 system ourself - so instead of 3 to 5 sessions with many fields to input - we might have 1 or 2 with just 5 or 6 fields of input to do it all. Not the same type thing you are looking for or what RMC did at the time, but good enough for us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AndreNoel</div><div class="date">19th March 2014, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all<br />
Unfortunately, I don’t log in very often so please forgive my tardy reply. <br />
<br />
I work for Xpert Technical Services  www.xpert-inc.com We’ve been a baan technical shop since ’96. We focus on Baan IV. We’re a full-service technical shop but we market our own proprietary transactional workflow/integration layer.<br />
<br />
It’s a direct integration platform and it also enables ultra-simplified transactional workflows in all areas of operations. We can do anything live  /transactional without custom interfaces, BOIs, functions etc… and no source code change!  <br />
<br />
If you’re curious, email me your contact info and we can set up an overview webex. No salespitches or powerpoints needed… I'll just show show you some actual working examples. The technology is very interesting to see, since no one has anything like it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />
