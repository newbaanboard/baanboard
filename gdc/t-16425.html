<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">31st August 2004, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Denver, Colorado, August 26, 2004  Open Systems Technologies (OST) has selected Enterprise Cyberquery (eCQ) as the end-to-end Reporting and Business Intelligence solution for its customers.  The relationship is expected to significantly improve the choices offered to the Baan community by combining OSTs Baan expertise with the innovative BI technologies of Cyberscience.<br />
<br />
OST has consistently delivered the highest quality services and solutions to the Baan community.  For many years, OST listened to the requests of Baan customers searching for a high performance, flexible BI solution.  Cyberscience is the only solution provider listening to the Baan community.  The scaleable architecture of eCQ, combined with its superior functionality, performance, and honest focus on end-users make the choice easy, said OSTs David Gerrity.<br />
<br />
Cyberscience Corporation is looking forward to building a lasting relationship with OST.  In a statement on Friday, Cyberscience EVP Nigel Brownjohn stated, In evaluating potential resellers, one of the biggest challenges lies in identifying objective organizations that are 100% focused on the needs of the customer.  OST is just such an organization. We are impressed with OSTs dedication to the Baan community, their technical expertise, and their ability to solve the most difficult business problems through innovative methodologies.<br />
<br />
Both Cyberscience and OST stress their commitment to the Baan community.  When asked what is driving eCQs success in the Baan environment, Market Development Specialist David Gurule stated, In speaking with hundreds of Baan sites, the comment that is made more often than any other is that current tools are not providing the performance and functionality needed to address growing and evolving businesses needs.  OSTs eagerness to resell eCQ is proof that the solution dramatically improves both the time to information and the quality of actionable insight for Baan customers.<br />
<br />
OST will resell Enterprise Cyberquery (eCQ), and will provide installation, consulting, and training services in an exclusive reseller agreement with Cyberscience Corporation.  <br />
