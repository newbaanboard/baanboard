<br />
My company has embarked on a new system to setup bills of materials for future products.  Up to this point, all of our products were run through a MAPICS system, some as straight bills of material and others as base numbers with a feature and option configuration string.  The configuration based setup allows for far fewer item type numbers as well as the ability to quickly and efficiently setup multiple build combinations for customer orders with little to no manual intervention.<br />
<br />
As our company is global and we have multiple systems the decision was made to go with some home grown programs which will build bills of materials outside of the MRP system and then import these BOMs into the system as dedicated bills for each build (i.e. no configuration options, just straight builds).  At that point manufacturing routings will also have to be assigned at the point of order entry.<br />
<br />
Can anybody here tell me does Baan have a feature and option configuration engine and if so how does it work?  Additionally it is a base number/option string build-up or does it work on different paramaters?  Our other major locations do run on Baan and it has been said that the Baan system cannot work with feature and option based paramaters.  Some reading I have done indicates this may not be the case.<br />
<br />
Any information would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

However if u uses constraints and are able to generalize ur product structure through constraints , u can be able to generate product bom/routing with ease .</div></div><hr />
