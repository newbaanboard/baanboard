<br />
Do the CEO's fear the verdicts of the analists on the Nasdaq? Do they take measures just to satisfy the demand of a small group of people or is their reasoning pure economical?</div></div><hr />

Most of the people know them as french fries but they really are belgian fries. Since they were invented by french speaking Belgian, people commonly make the mistake of thinking they hail from France. Make no mistake, we make the best fries in the world!<br />
<br />
PS: Belgium lies between France, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK (North sea).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">26th September 2001, 09:02</div></div><div class="posttext">for saying french fries instead of belgium fries.<br />
Belgium uses a special fat to fry the potatoes that I never saw in other countries, and (take this with a lot of salt) the french copied the belgium but they use oil instead, and then this spread to all the rest of the world... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">26th September 2001, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">The French have a better marketing department than the Belgians do.  (or do a better job of taking credit for things :) <br />
<br />
BTW -- I KNOW that some software companies are following the dictates of the analysts.  We are a reseller (non-Baan) and one of our partner companies was willing to drop the price of its products by over 60% in order to get it into the quarter (for a customer that was definitely going to buy anyway).  Now in a rational society, $400K next month would be better than $160K this month.  But NO, got to meet the needs of the stock market. Oh well -- short term thinking.<br />
<br />
Finally, here is a link all of you will like (to change the topic again) that is a great joke on all of us in the consulting community.<br />
