They call it the silver bullet for the next financial year of SSA. It has a new name, called SSA ERP 6.1. No more Baan. <br />
They plan a Linux port for this version and the support of MySQL.<br />
<br />
Will you move to it?  In this summer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">12th May 2004, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">They will call it SSA ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Q: what is LN.<br />
A: LN has no meaning. There are 1001 rumors, but nobody knows. The new name of the other ERP product of SSA (BPICS 8.3) will be called SSA ERP LX<br />
<br />
BTW: LN should be written in uppercase subscript. If this is not possible, it should be uppercase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">26th May 2004, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Support for Linux &amp; MySQL (planned) was also stated on SSA's roadmap presented yesterday at the Baan UK &amp; Ireland Annual User Conference.<br />
<br />
Will be called &quot;SSA ERP LN&quot;. SSA ERP LX is for the BPCS line - the reason for the LN and LX was meant to stand for nothing. But SSA UK couldn't understand the reasons and when pressured SSA Marketing said the &quot;LX&quot; stood for BPI&quot;X&quot; and the &quot;LN&quot; sounded like Baa&quot;n&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">27th May 2004, 06:26</div></div><div class="posttext">:)  Thanks for the info !<br />
<br />
Maybe indeed LN means the BAAN Line and LX means BPCS Line...  could be anything , ha, ha, ha.....<br />
<br />
Linux and MySQL would hopefully make this product price competitive for smaller companies.</div></div><hr />
