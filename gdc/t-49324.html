<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jdboer</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">They told me that there will be no FP4 but a FP4/5 at the end of the year 2008.<br />
Originally FP4 should have a lot of outsourcing and VMI improvements <br />
The main reason for this change in release schedule was to put all development capacity on the SOA stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">13th March 2008, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">What I heard is that developers are currently facing a heavy load from support incidents which is delaying the schedule. It's also pretty hard to get quality related incidents into development, the support consultants are currenty heavy &quot;firewalling&quot;. In other words: Development seems to be understaffed, at least for the ERP core product.</div></div><hr />
