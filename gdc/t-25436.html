http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/news/article_976.html<br />
<br />
From the article:<br />
<br />
Industry Support for MySQL 5.0<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
SSA Global, a leading global provider of extended enterprise solutions and services, will certify SSA ERP LN 6.1 with MySQL Network 5.0 before the end of this year. &quot;MySQL 5.0, with its enterprise-class features, represents a very cost-effective and proven database alternative capable of meeting our customers' toughest requirements,&quot; said Rick Bernard, vice president Solutions Management, SSA Global. &quot;SSA Global is committed to Open Source solutions, and support for MySQL is the next significant step in delivering value to our customers.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">25th October 2005, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
From the same article the following quote from Chicago Metallic, an existing BAAN customer in Belgium:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;MySQL 5.0 represents a huge leap in features and functionality for the MySQL database,&quot; said Gunter Rombauts, European IT manager for Chicago Metallic. &quot;As a worldwide leader in metal ceiling systems, it's critical that our database supports heavy-duty enterprise applications with speed and reliability.  We are looking forward to using MySQL 5.0 as a key component of Chicago Metallic's global IT infrastructure.&quot; <br />
<br />
The comments of SSA Global in this article relate to certifying MySQL 5.0 as a supported database for LN6.1.<br />
It would be great if the same can be done for BAAN IV any time soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technology is a commodity and it is the solution that matters&quot; is a statement often made by Mike Greenough, CEO of SSA Global.<br />
That is why we at Qtris are looking forward to supporting the combination of SUSE (Linux based Operating System) and MySQL (OpenSource database) for LN6.1 customers as they would not have to pay one cent on their license costs for the database.<br />
<br />
Check out our website http://www.qtris.com/ to find out more on our current BAAN2Linux program for BAAN IV, BAAN V and LN6.1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mr Greenough is well-known for his commodity speech. I don't accept this standpoint, but he must admit that it is, at least, persistent.<br />
<br />
CEO's are transient, at best.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">17th November 2005, 05:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I am amused by the quote credited to Greenough that :&quot;Technology is a commodity and it is the solution that matters&quot;. If it is true I think that it would be equally true to say that &quot;solutions&quot; are commodities, and indeed you can buy a whole bunch of ERP solutions that are each lauded by many uses across the globe from the same guy. <br />
<br />
I am prepared to give Mike credit for being an outstanding bean-counter and/or Charted Accountant (UK term).  He has very cleverly collected the Legacy ERP systems that people still love and are prepared to pay SSA an enormous amount in annual support fees for systems that do not need much  support at all. He has even floated the company and raise cash for he and his pals to pocket in return for their small initial investment.<br />
<br />
As to running a software company, I think even he would not claim any special expertise or flair.  Without going over our earlier debates on the topic, SSA are not a serious developer or marketer of software and show no signs of ever becoming one.   <br />
<br />
The certification of MYSQL supports the notion that SSA are not big league players or even serious at competing with the big guys.   What will MySql give them ?  A few small customers who don't want to or who can't pay a reasonable price for licence seats. Will the the Fortune500 companies rush to SSA software so that they can avoid buying Oracle RDBMS licences?  <br />

<br />
Development teams from both companies plan to release MaxDB 7.6, which will support 64-bit Linux and HP-UX, said Edwin DeSouza, senior director of product management at MySQL, whose headquarters is in Sweden.<br />
<br />
&quot;SAP sees this as very important to reduce the overall TCO of an SAP implementation,&quot; DeSouza said. &quot;And SAP is protecting itself also -- by having MaxDB as an alternative to the other vendors out there. The customer can spend most of their dollars on SAP rather than give a whole bunch of it to Oracle or Microsoft or whoever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe SSA is doing it to reduce the total cost of ownership. They want<br />
to get rid of tbase due to obvious limitations (2GB filesize). but it seems<br />
that the big-boys all have some strategy for releasing a &quot;free&quot; DB with their ERP. Working with MySQL saves them development cycles and gives them a &quot;brand name&quot; Free database.. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">18th November 2005, 00:00</div></div><div class="posttext">...Maybe SSA is doing it to reduce the total cost of ownership...<br />
<br />
Is that what SAP are really doing? Or is Mr DeSouza saying 'me too'. They may never sell a site using MySql but may like to be able to get a tick in a comparative analysis.  <br />
<br />
...but it seems that the big boys all have some strategy for releasing a &quot;free&quot; DB with their ERP...<br />
<br />
In the analyses I see the big boys after SAP are No1 ORACLE and No 2 MICROSOFT. Both have pproprietry RDBMS neither of which are free but each claim to be able to prove lowest total cost of ownership.  <br />
<br />
The fact that SAP can offer MySql counteracts to some extent the negatives I saw with SAA adopting it.  <br />
<br />
However, I am of the mind that you 'get what you pay for'.  If you don't pay for it you can't expect to get much. But will you really not pay much in the long term?  May be the company will pay the employee or consultant who pushes the 'free-ness' of MySql for open ended support.  I think there is always a case for 'top-drawer' products. <br />

<br />
I think the line is getting thinner in that area though. MySQL isn't too bad from what I've seen although I prefer PostgreSQL. I honestly think that MySQL is better than tbase though! and there are still plenty of people on tbase. I think that overall SSA sees it's market in the mid range and companies in that lower middle range like these types of solutions. <br />

It is supported by Infor SSA BAAN to up to 50 users for LN (hence &quot;limited availability&quot;). <br />
But since the service partners are only interested in selling SQL Server, Oracle, etc. to get their commissions, MySQL in combination with LN is going nowhere.<br />
There are some people in BAAN Development who care about MySQL but everybody else do not care at all.<br />
I do not want to sound pessimistic about the chances of MySQL in the BAAN world but as far as I am concerned it is already a lost cause.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:D <br />
<br />
I want to say something fair about we as service partners. We do want to push the Linux+MySQL platform to the customers. We prefer them to spend more money on ERP licence and service, rather than spend on the handware, OS and database. But it seems the customers are glad to hear the ERP can support Linux+MySQL, but they just not choose this platform at the end.<br />
<br />
So far, the most popular platform among our new customers is Windows 2003 + SQLserver. The second popular is AIX + Oracle.<br />
<br />
If any new customer in Greater China region can commit to try the Linux+MySQL or Linux+Oracle on Ln, we can offer them the best discounted price we can offer on Ln licence and service for them to be the pioneer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">31st January 2007, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone already mentioned, there are still many customers on tbase. <br />
And as a matter of fact, in small environments tbase performs fine and it is the most stable backend for baan, requiring hardly any maintenance and thus not only saving on license fees but also on the cost of hiring someone with sufficient DBA skills.<br />
<br />
Now the benefit I see in supporting a linux/MySQL environment is that it allows baan professionals to run a simple baan environment at home. This would do wonders for the (re-)adaptation of baan as a major player in the ERP field as creativity and innovation will be boosted by the user base.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we all know how Infor/SSA feels about sharing their precious licenses and oh so secret sources.</div></div><hr />

we have less than 50 users. so any way i can use MySQL for Baan IV?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. The MySQL driver is only (limited) available for ERP LN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">steventay</div><div class="date">9th August 2007, 15:08</div></div><div class="posttext">No. The MySQL driver is only (limited) available for ERP LN.<br />
<br />
