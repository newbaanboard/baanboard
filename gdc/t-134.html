How much are/were HP and Compaq still geared towards Baan? What can we expect now that one of the leading IT players has gone?</div></div><hr />

Quite a surprise - I'm still getting used to the fact that DEC has 'gone'! <br />

Not much feedback yet to your post - this surely has a major impact in the IT arena though.</div></div><hr />

It has often been the 'My server is better than yours' with these two players, now, they are one in the same. I think that it will not effect the market until the first hybrid product is released, lets face it, compaq had a few nice touches on thier servers that we could now see creeping into HP machines...<br />

But in this enviroment at the moment.... heed my words... this is not the last!</div></div><hr />
