Vishay is running Triton 3.1 with BISAM.<br />
The entire server migration has been executed by Qtris BV.<br />
As the back-up solution Qtris also installed Bacula, an open-source back-up software product.<br />
<br />
By mirgrating to the new environment Vishay will save at least 75% on their annual maintenance costs compared to the old environment.<br />
Other significant and immediate benefits of the new environment are:<br />
<br />
-	Month-end closing now only takes 5 minutes instead of 200 minutes compared to the old system. This is 40 times faster!<br />
-	An increase in the level of user acceptance.<br />
<br />
In case you are planning to replace your current Triton 3.1/BAAN IV/ BAAN V server and also would like to save at least 75% on your annual maintenance costs you can contact Qtris at info@qtris.com to learn more about our BAAN2Linux program.<br />
<br />
Please also visit our website at http://www.qtris.com to discover more on how Linux and Open Source solutions allow you to stay in complete control of your environment and therefore the control of the success/failure of your SSA BAAN system and ultimately that of your company!</div></div><hr />
