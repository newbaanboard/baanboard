We provide service to migrate from Baan IV to LN 6.1 in Asia, mainly China. We have now two such projects in progress. If your company is in Asia and if you have interest, you could send emails to info@ziaps.com.</div></div><hr />

We are in combo mode, Reger ERP, Gemini/LN Tools, OW, DA. There are few tools changes between Reger &amp; Gemini like MMT, PMC, DAL2, Common Installer etc.</div></div><hr />

When 5.2a is published, it claimed that it is not multi-byte enabled. As I remembered, the difference between 5.2a and Ln is really not that much. And since porting 8.2b, 5.2a using the same porting set with LN.<br />
I think there are less than 10 or even 5 customers running on 5.2a.<br />
Barco? Meno-logistics? Who else?</div></div><hr />

As far as I know there are three customers on 5.2a Reger: Barco, Menlo and Boeing.<br />
Perhaps somebody from Infor/SSA BAAN can confirm this.<br />

Hi Dick,<br />
<br />
&quot;nog&quot;?<br />
<br />
I do not believe our non-Dutch speaking BaanBoard members understand that word.<br />
This must be one of those famous Benglish (Baan-English) expressions:).<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Edwin</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it was a typo &quot;nog&quot; should be &quot;not&quot; (as too many in my postings). As I just found out that there is a spellings checker I hope the amount of errors will go down.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Dick</div></div><hr />

No problem.<br />
I may be confused as well here because now that I think of it isn't Boeing also using 5.1 instead of 5.2?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michiel Leerkes</div><div class="date">11th October 2006, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">The only customers on &quot;Reger&quot; (ERP 5.2a) are (to the best of my knowledge):<br />
1) Barco<br />
2) Sperry Marine<br />
3) Manlow<br />
<br />
Boeing is using the ERP 5.1a version, which is also known under the project name Verdi and at this moment they are also implementing LN (FP2) for the production of their new airplane.<br />
Verdi and Reger differ a lot, but the same goes for Reger and LN.<br />
If you want to go from Reger to LN, then you need quite some migration logic to perform that task. This migration logic is not present to complete that task. At this moment there is migration logic available from BaanIVc (standard, multi currency or german extension) to LN (only single site).<br />
Recently also the migration logic has been completed from the Corelli version (SSA ERP 5.0c, no localization) to LN.<br />

I assume you mean the SSA BAAN Migration tool in this case?<br />
It surprises me that no multi site is supported for LN.<br />
Do you have any ideas as to when this will be available?<br />
<br />

<br />
Edwin,<br />
<br />
I believe it is still supported. I found a document on the LN CD:<br />
<br />
Document code : U8423A US<br />
Release : SSAÂ® ERP LN 6.1<br />
Document title : Reference Guide for Multicompany Structures<br />
<br />
Michiel, We/Menlo Logistics are on Reger ERP and Gemini/LN Tools.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The migration tool can migrate a multi-site environment from BaanIV to LN, but just as it is. What you see is that more and more customers would like to go for a &quot;single logistic - multi finance&quot; structure in LN. This scenario was not very well supported in BaanIV. So if you have a multi site structure in BaanIV and would like to change that in LN, then that is not possible. If you are happy with the multi-site structure in BaanIV, then with migration, you will get exactly the same multi-site structure in LN. <br />
