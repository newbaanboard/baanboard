<br />
People should not try to belittle Soth Koreans achievement.  The win was due to hard work and a never say die attitude.  Italy were victims of their usual policy of trying to stifle a game once they have taken the lead, instead of continuing to attack and extending their lead.  Statistics show that although Italy are highly regarded and have achieved much success, they are one of the most likely to either win 1-0 or throw a match away by trying to sit on a 1-0 lead.<br />
<br />
However, I do agree that Totti did not dive and should not have been sent off.<br />
<br />
As for Brazil, their defence is about to be severly tested.  Belgium were the first well organised side they have faced and could have won the game.  The Brazil defence is all over the place when corners or free kicks go in.  Wait and see.<br />
<br />
As for not being impressed by England.  They have done what has been required.  If they needed to beat Nigeria, they would have done.  They dominated Argentina and coasted past Denmark.  Brazil will be a hard game, because of the sheer attacking talent of Brazil.  As England have the best goalkeeper &amp; two central defenders in the tournament, we have a great chance.</div></div><hr />

I mean there is every possablity that England will go through but they will have to work hard and have a strong attitude towards the match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smiffy</div><div class="date">20th June 2002, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought Id posted in the previous World Cup Thread.  Hope I haven't upset any Italians.  You need to let it go and hope that your team builds on the talent that you've got and stop looking for conspiracies.  We in England know what its like to feel cheated.  Unfortunately, its the British media that whips up all the fuss and keeps raking up old incidents (i.e. Maradona - hand of God).  Mistakes happen by referees &amp; officials, its just bad when it happens in the most important games.<br />
<br />
Fifa have made several blunders with this World Cup, the seedings were a joke, playing in the hottest part of the day in Japan &amp; the ticket allocations.  Hopefully, pressure will be put on to put it right for the next tournament.</div></div><hr />
