The problem is that a solution requested to be installed may have some dependency to an older solution that need to be evaluated and approved by the business analysts or the developer before the requested solution is installed.<br />
<br />
Is there a particular third party or Infor software that I can use to track the dependencies outside of the PMC module ? We have a MS Sharepoint solution web site that we created in-house so that business analysts/developers can place their requests to install solutions. However, it is lacking a dependency tool so that I cannot just install the solution onto production without ensuring all dependencies have been approved.<br />
<br />
Please let me know what you have been using.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">10th December 2009, 03:07</div></div><div class="posttext">PMC is one of the good tools where you can easily gather the dependent solutions as well as generate/evaluate the dependencies for your in-house development if you use PMC Distributor module with it.<br />
Refer to the PMC documentation for more info, you can also create co-requisites for your custom PMC solutions linked to the Baan stnd solutions.<br />
You do not just install any solution into Production. With the proper Change Management and Code Migration processes, the solutions have to be deployed from Dev -&gt; QA -&gt; Production. If you have proper dependencies/co-requisites generated for your solution, it doesn't install if they are not present in the target system.</div></div><hr />

I am going to make an assumption that you only process the solutions that you need and not the monthly dumps.<br />
<br />
You can create a second Update VRC from the standard VRC.  In this second Update VRC process the monthly solution files.  From this Update VRC you can run reports, or extract the dependency information and populate the web site.</div></div><hr />
