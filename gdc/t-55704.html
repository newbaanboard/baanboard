I would like to update our ERP LN database once per day with data stored on a field service engineer's laptop.<br />
For example, a field service engineer would log on to ERP LN in the evening, using the Internet from home.  He would transfer all his daily hours accounting and service order text into the ERPLN database.  Then, he would  download any new service orders (including BP number, name and address) to his laptop.  At this moment his laptop and our database would be &quot;in sync&quot;.<br />
Then, the next morning, at the customer's site, our field service engineer would enter his daily hours accounting on his laptop.  At day's end, he could print a field service report for the customer, to include service order text.<br />
In the evening, when he has Internet access, he would once again log on to our ERP LN server and transfer his daily hours and service order text to our database.<br />
Is anyone familiar with a similar process?</div></div><hr />

Based on your request I would recommend to take a closer look at Infor Mobile Service. This add-on product from Infor is doing all the things that you are looking for and more.<br />
Currently I am involved in implementing this solution at Rolls Royce Marine for their Field Service and Depot Repair units across Europe.<br />
The solution is available on a laptop or a wireless device (like PDA and Blackberry).<br />
<br />
In order to know more about the Mobile Service application please contact your Infor sales rep.<br />

Thanks for the information.  Iâ€™m glad to know that Infor Mobile Service works with ERP LN.  I have tried to find more detailed information about Mobile Service on their website in the past, but without much success.  I will take your advice and contact my representative.<br />
Thanks again.<br />
