<br />
Dear Customer, <br />
<br />
On January 18th, 2005, we officially welcomed you, a valued PeopleSoft customer, to Oracle. Now we'd like to provide you with details of our long-term plan to support your investment in PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards products. <br />
<br />
Our Long-Term Commitment to Your PeopleSoft<br />
and J.D. Edwards Products<br />
<br />
In collaboration with our new PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards team members, Oracle has developed a clear product roadmap and strategic support plan with a single purpose in mind: to ensure your technology future. Our product development and product support roadmaps exceed or maintain PeopleSoft's previous policies. We plan to enhance and support PeopleSoft Enterprise, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, and JD Edwards World until at least 2013, allowing you to benefit from your past investments for years to come. And we are pleased to announce that we plan to release PeopleSoft Enterprise 9.0 and JD Edwards EnterpriseOne 8.12 in 2006. <br />
<br />
Exclusive Advantages of Oracle's PeopleSoft<br />
and J.D. Edwards Support <br />
<br />
Through the combined talents, technologies, and long-term vision of the PeopleSoft, J.D. Edwards, and Oracle support teams, you now have access to the largest and most advanced software support organization in the world. With over 6,000 support engineers-including approximately 1,000 from PeopleSoft-and over 8,000 application developers, we can provide support from 16 global hubs and in 27 languages. Only Oracle can provide this global coverage and provide your business with the stability and continuity it requires. <br />
<br />
With Oracle Support, you receive these exclusive advantages: <br />
<br />
Continued access to the latest software releases and enhancements that maximize your investment in PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards and ensure that you won't need to switch software platforms-unless you choose to. <br />
The same support interfaces, people, systems, and infrastructure you relied on with PeopleSoft. Indeed, over 90% of PeopleSoft's developers and support professionals have joined Oracle. <br />
Even faster problem resolution. With our integrated case resolution and escalation processes, we leverage each other's support organizations and technical infrastructures to more rapidly resolve your product and technical issues. And if you are running Oracle technology, the combined expertise of our application and technology support teams will further reduce the steps and time needed to resolve questions or issues. <br />
A single point of contact for all your support needs. No longer do you need to rely on multiple organizations to resolve an issue. Through the global scale of our support organization and by leveraging our third-party relationships and reseller agreements, Oracle works on your behalf to manage all parties to ensure prompt and efficient resolution. <br />
We recognize that with change comes questions. We are here to answer them as quickly and clearly as possible. Over the next few months we will communicate with you regularly to provide you with more details. As a first step, click here for important information concerning our long-term product development and product support roadmaps. At Oracle, our commitment is to support your PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards products for many years to come. <br />
