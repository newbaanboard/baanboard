<br />
 Presently  we are using BaaN IV c4 only one location.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am interested to know following details:<br />
<br />
I have installed BaaN IV licences on my central server with 20 concurrent licenses. and we are accessing through thin client software from other city.<br />
in this situation the data is stored in the central server.<br />
<br />
I have branches in Mumbai,Chennai,Delhi,Kolkata,Pune.<br />
my central server is in pune. <br />
<br />
In case of Pune central server goes down , rest all the place will not be access the system. but i want other city user should work independently on their site and finally transfer to central server.<br />
<br />
Can any guide me how to set   multi architecture options  in Windows 2003environment.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

<br />
If u have a database and application mirror at another location/city which too have good internet backbone , then users can work on other servers with some changes in in their bwc and then work on server in other city . Maintianing db and application mirrors  across geographies is difficult.<br />
<br />
Another option could  be to increase redundancy in Pune itself , say procure leased line from two ISPs  , implement failover clustering at Pune so that it may not get down . This too is costly and complex  but very practical and feasible .Many mission critical application use combination of failover clustering and mirroring for extreme cases .<br />
<br />
Another option could be to analyze all possible activities ur users at branches do and then  get a third party application to run at the time Baan is down and then have interface using Baan exchange at the time Baan server is available . This requires lot of planning and effort from IT Team .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">14th January 2008, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the multi-site options that Baan offers is Exchange and Audit Tables.  Your remote sites can run Baan localy, and Audit captures the changes to the database and then is exported and copied to the other sites.  There you import based on indicators in Exchange to update, instert, or delete the same rows of the table.  This is more of a batch process and your data will only be as current as the night before (or whenever you schedule the update).</div></div><hr />

<br />
True . But that will require the separate hardware , OS ,DB  and finally Baan to be purchased and installed at all other 4 cities(Mumbai,Chennai,Delhi,Kolkata ) .</div></div><hr />

Hitesh, the point you are trying to make is what?  The original requirement was stated that they wanted each site to be independant and transfer to the central server.  That is what this part of multi-site with Exchange does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Can you please advise me how to set multi site setup.<br />
If you have any sample diagram with details ,  please send it to me<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">15th January 2008, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">From the original posts , there is only 1 baan installation at Pune City  and other cities do not have Baan locally . If one has Baan at all locations then only multi-site exchange will help . In this case , baan is not installed at all in other 4 cities (only baan clients bw are available probably).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically you have a consolidated server installation with BW clients on all dependencies. It is a cheap solution that serves well your 20 concurrent users. To get a higher service level you need to go for the option of data replication (as mentioned or others) or have your system clustered to provide redundancy (having a replicated backup on another location) - any of these solutions will increase your setup price way up.<br />
<br />
Your best option is to improve the reliability of the link that the central server location provides to the others by ensuring that its downtime is reduced: having a second ISP service provider as backup and improve your systems UPS may just ensure that at a fraction of the cost of the other solutions.</div></div><hr />
