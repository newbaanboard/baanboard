Some friends in Baan Development showed me this  &quot;hidden session&quot;  -   :D</div></div><hr />

Maybe the development guys who are also a member here can disclose some more of them? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">4th December 2002, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny you should say that Pat. I was told that Navision Axapata has a wide selection of hidden games built into it, tetris and others. Is there a few hidden extra running around inside the Baan application that are waiting to be found?</div></div><hr />
