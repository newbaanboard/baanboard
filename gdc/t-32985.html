I mean from port the application to writing the customizations in 4 GL and functionality etc? Any one knows about LX? <br />
<br />
The reason why we are asking is we are one of the biggest customers running Baan on AS/400 (I heard overall 5-10 AS/400 people are running Baan on AS/400). Now our management is thinking about to move LN or LX, if we move to LX&#61664; we have huge AS/400 base (80% customers) running BPICS on AS/400..any way any one have any idea?<br />

Thanks for your input.</div></div><hr />

I would say they differ for 40%. They both have the same owner, but have different roots and different main markets, but both have modules in same areas. And both are ERP packages.<br />

And another thing, as per guru's feedback going from LN to LX is totally different installation and not worth it seems to be. :confused:</div></div><hr />
