<br />
Here is an interesting link to OST's SSA BAAN Education Symposium:<br />
http://www.osteducation.com//ContentPage.aspx?name=home<br />
<br />
It is going to take place in Nice, France from October 16th until October 18th and the schedule has a lot of interesting educational topics to offer for both technical and functional European SSA BAAN users.<br />
<br />
In February 2006 OST held a similar event for SSA BAAN users in the US and this initiative was well received by the people who attended.<br />
  <br />
As far as I know this is the first time an event like this is organized specifically for European SSA BAAN users.<br />
On Monday October 16th there is an opening reception and this would be a great opportunity for European BaanBoard members to meet each other as well.<br />
This would be the first time ever since we started BaanBoard in August 2001.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bspcanada</div><div class="date">7th September 2006, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We sent 12 people from our company to the American event in February.  It was almost all Baan IV stuff with a little LN information.  What I liked was tha the sessions were 2-4 hours long!!  There was a feeling like the old BWU events (I think I heard the company that ran BWU is somehow involved in these events).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">18th September 2006, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I have booked already for the event. Only thing is that unfortunately I will not be able to attend the opening reception on Monday the 16th; I will be arriving only Tuesday morning. Will there be some formal BaanBoard meeting? Would be great, of course I vote for Tuesday evening...<br />
<br />
What's with the rest of us? Are we going to be there? I'm curious to get a feeling about the number of participants...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">18th September 2006, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know no decision has been made when we can have the BaanBoard meeting during this event and for me Tuesday October 17th will work fine too. If we have a BaanBoard meeting it will certainly not be a formal one:).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">18th September 2006, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Edwin, of course I didn't mean formal in the essence of the word... :) I will be very happy with Tuesday the 17th, or if necessary even Wednesday-evening the 18th after the OST-program...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikkie Dik</div><div class="date">18th September 2006, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">As bspcanada mentions, the slots are pretty long and have no (to hardly) any sales intent. The length of the sessions gives the possibility to put a huge part of course material in that time frame. <br />
<br />
I have been requested by OST to give some presentations about performance and architecture, tracing, tuning and SQL. As we train our developers internally as well I am really happy to do this for the field as well. Especially the 4 hour slot on SQL is in my opinion a nice one asit lets you think differently on the SQL you generated so far.<br />
<br />
The relation to BWU is in my opinion that project structure is done by the same organization.<br />
<br />
Regarding a BB reunion: Is the opening/reception not the best place to do?<br />
<br />
See you there,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimbo1</div><div class="date">25th September 2006, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">The OST Event early this year in the US was a great forum.  It was like the early days of Baan World Users (BWU).  There were 100 to 200 attendees and everyone was focused on Baan.  There was a lot of great content provided.  I had several Baan customers tell me that they got more out of the OST event than they did out of SSAU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justone</div><div class="date">13th October 2006, 09:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I've looked at workshop plan and schedule seems impressive. I'm really looking forward to attend some of those workshops, especially development part. <br />
<br />
@DikkieDik: As I saw on symposium homepage, you Baan career is quite impressive. Ithink it's great for me to learn something from such an expert.<br />
<br />
See you in Nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 08:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that the event is over I am curious to know whether people liked it and if they got ouf it what they expected.<br />
<br />
Personally I enjoyed the opening speech of Mr. Jensen, a top executive of Infor in Europe, about Infor's plans with &quot;BAAN&quot; and the roadmap of Infor ERP LN.<br />
It was also great to meet almost 40 people from 14 different countries at the event. This reminded me of the good old days :).<br />
<br />
OST is planning to organize two new Education events in 2007:<br />
<br />
- in Phoenix, Arizona, USA in February<br />
- in Europe (location to be announced) in May<br />
<br />
I am already looking forward to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I have enjoyed the symposium very much. I find meeting with co-colleagues from throughout Europe of tremendous value. Of course the main purpose, the educational sessions, were also great. <br />
<br />
Since I was rushed to leave a bit earlier than originally scheduled, I didn't manage to thank and see goodbye to everyone. I hereby then want to extend my appreciation and admiration to all involved in making this symposium such a success. <br />
<br />
A special thanks to Jim and Dick, for their excellent sessions, for their friendliness, their readiness to give all their time and energy to assist and advice the participants.<br />
<br />
Also the organisational teams deserve our compliments. They were friendly, helpful and efficient; everything was extremely well organised.<br />
<br />
The main point for future improvement: THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS!!! Come on guys, don't miss such opportunities!!! I hope on double the amount for next year's symposium...!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justone</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 13:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree with en@frrom (Eli). I'm very happy for the opportunity of being part of such a great event.<br />
<br />
Symposium was of great value on educational side, as well as it's a great experience to meet and talk to other people from Baan community. It was great being part of such event.<br />
<br />
At first I'd like to thank Vince, Ron and Dick for well prepared sessions and readiness to discuss every single open topic. They help me solve some existing open issues and showed me better route for my future work (especially regarding performance issues).<br />
<br />
Organisational team was also very kind and helpful, they really did their best to make us feel well. So compliments to you to ladies and guys.<br />
<br />
I'm glad to point out that this symposium met my expectations completely and they were high before the event.<br />
<br />
The only thing that dissapointed me a bit was number of atendees, so as en@frrom said, DON'T MISS SUCH EVENTS,<br />
they are definitely time and money well spent.<br />
<br />
I hope I'll have the oportunity to  meet you guys on some future events.<br />
<br />
For all you who didn't attend this event, check BaanBoard, I believe Edwin will post more data about next year's event as soon as he gets them.<br />
<br />
With Regards<br />
<br />
Peter</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would just like to reiterate that we hope next year's attendance is double (or more...).<br />
<br />
Thanks again to all of the attendee's that asked such excellent questions!<br />
