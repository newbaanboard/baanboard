<br />
You haven't played patience with real cards in years.<br />
<br />
You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of 3.<br />
<br />
You e-mail your work colleague at the desk next to you to ask &quot;Do you fancy going down the pub?&quot; and they reply &quot;Yeah, give me five minutes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Your reason for not staying in touch with friends is that they do not have e-mail addresses.<br />
<br />
Your idea of being organised is multiple coloured post-it notes.<br />
<br />
You hear most of your jokes via email instead of in person.<br />
<br />
When you go home after a long day at work you still answer the phone in a business manner.<br />
<br />
When you make phone calls from home, you accidentally insert a &quot;9&quot; to get an outside line.<br />
<br />
You've sat at the same desk for four years and worked for three different companies.<br />
<br />
Your company welcome sign is attached with Velcro.<br />
<br />
Your CV is on a diskette in your pocket.<br />
<br />
You really get excited about a 1.7% pay rise.<br />
<br />
You learn about your redundancy on the 9 o'clock news.<br />
<br />
Your biggest loss from a system crash is that you lose all your best jokes.<br />
<br />
Your supervisor doesn't have the ability to do your job.<br />
<br />
Contractors outnumber permanent staff and are more likely to get long-service awards.<br />
<br />
Board members salaries are higher than all the Third World countries annual budgets combined.<br />
<br />
It's dark when you drive to and from work, even in the summer.<br />
<br />
Interviewees, despite not having the relevant knowledge or experience, terminate the interview when told of the starting salary.<br />
<br />
You see a good looking, smart person and you know it must be a visitor.<br />
<br />
Free food left over from meetings is your staple diet.<br />
<br />
The work experience person gets a brand-new state-of-the-art laptop with all the features, while you have time to go for lunch while yours powers up.<br />
<br />
Being sick is defined as you can't walk or you're in hospital.<br />
<br />
You're already late on the assignment you just got.<br />
<br />
There's no money in the budget for the five permanent staff your department is short of, but they can afford four full-time management consultants advising your boss's boss on strategy.<br />
<br />
Your boss's favourite lines are: When you've got a few minutes..Could you fit this in...?...in your spare time...when you're freed up I know you're busy but...I have an opportunity for you...<br />
<br />
Holiday is something you roll over to next year.<br />
<br />
The only reason you recognise your kids is because their pictures are on your desk.<br />
<br />
You only have makeup for fluorescent lighting.<br />
<br />
You read this entire list, kept nodding and smiling.<br />
<br />
<br />
(And before anyone moans about these, they are just friday funnies and in the General Discussion section, so just have a laugh)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for those!  So true.<br />
<br />
We were just joking about a couple more of the boss's favorite lines:  <br />
&quot;Let me know when you are done with that&quot;<br />
&quot;Can I get you anything for lunch while I am out&quot;</div></div><hr />
