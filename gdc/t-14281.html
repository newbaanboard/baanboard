<br />
Is there any training center in asia region?  We are planning to have a training in Baan V Development.  We are versed with the development and customization with Baan IV versions, will it be hard for us to cope up with Baan V prog'g methodology?</div></div><hr />

The only new feature with baan5 is the DAL, data access layer.  Put simply, it is a dll which executes code against a specific table.  Aside from that, everything is pretty much the same.  You shouldn't have a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that the differences between Baan IV and Baan V - development, are not so major, although there are quite a few &quot;small&quot; changes which can cause a lot of heart-ache if ou don't know about them, and you're trying to get things working.<br />
<br />
There is a Baan manual available with the differences between Baan IV &amp; Baan V, for both functional and tools. <br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />
