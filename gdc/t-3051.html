<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Clarke</div><div class="date">14th May 2002, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a list of triggers that create the Transaction Types?<br />
<br />
I am looking for a large list or at least the answer for &quot;Purchase Revaluation&quot; AS A MINIMUM<br />
<br />
For Example, experience has shown that the following are some triggers for these transactions:<br />
<br />
Purchasing<br />
Receipt	- At the point of receipt of the purchase order, the value of product on Purchase Order for Lot Price Items or at standard price for FTP (Standard Cost) items is recorded.<br />
Inventory Adjustment	- If the product is adjusted out before paying supplier, and when paying the supplier and the value being paid is different to that on the purchase order. <br />
Result	- At the point of receipt of the purchase order, for FTP (Standard Cost) items only, the difference between the standard cost and the PO cost.<br />
Lot Result	- Occurs only when the item is not in inventory when paying the supplier and the value being paid is different to that on the purchase order.<br />
<br />
Production (SFC)<br />
Receipt	- All receipts against the production order be it partial or complete<br />
Issue	- When you release the outbound, the standard price of the item is recorded.<br />
Revaluation	- At the point of cost rollup<br />
Lot Result	- When you release the outbound, if the lot price is different to the standard price the difference btween the two is recorded for Lot Price items only.<br />
Production Result	- At the point of closing the production order, the difference in accumulated costs of standard prices of all items used for the build from that of the standard price of the manufactured good.<br />
Subcontracting	- Either recipt of subcontracting or receipt of invoice for subcontracting<br />
<br />
Warehouse Order<br />
Revaluation	- At the point of cost rollup, the change in standard price is recorded	<br />
Inventory Transfer	- At the point of transfering the product the standard price for FTP (Standard Cost) items or lot price for Lot Price items is recorded.<br />
Inventory Adjustment	- At the point of posting an inventory adjustment, the standard price for FTP (Standard Cost) items or lot price for Lot Price items is recorded.<br />
<br />
Sales<br />
Issue	- At the point of releasing the outbound<br />
Revaluation	- When you backdate a delivery<br />
Lot Result	- At the point of releasing the outbound</div></div><hr />

I think you have started a very good thread.<br />
Documentation on this matter is not very good. Perhaps at yhe end, when completed all possibilities, it can be resumed in one post.<br />
<br />
What i have seen for purchase-revaluation, this occurs when there is a new cost price between two steps in the order procedure.<br />
<br />
When a new integration transaction is booked, BaaN writes one negative to the prev and a new for the new step. If the transaction is related to standard cost, there is also a new line with the standard cost difference if this price is different between date related to stetp 1 and date related to date 2 (dates related to the step produced).<br />
<br />
This is possible in purchase because you can introduce transactions with a date before system date.<br />
<br />
Let us wait for other users in order to complete the list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
have a look at Baan Help, e.g. the windows help files. <br />
There you will find e.g.....<br />
Combination Purchase and Revaluation<br />
This transaction ensures the revaluation of items, receipts or goods due to receipts of goods which are registered with a date on which the cost price was less than the cost price that was entered earlier.  <br /><br />
<br />
WHERE AND WHEN CREATED  <br />This transaction takes place when arrivals on a purchase order are maintained with a date which is earlier that the latest update of the cost prices. It is carried out in the following sessions:<br />
- Maintain Receipts (ILC) (tdilc4113s000)<br />
- Maintain Approvals (tdilc4123s000)<br />
- Maintain Purchase Orders (Direct Delivery) (tdpur4102m000)<br />
- Maintain Purchase Order (Direct Line Entry) (tdpur4105m000)<br />
- Maintain Purchase Order Lines (Fast Input) (tdpur4107m000)<br />
- Maintain Receipts (tdpur4120m000)<br />
- Maintain Approvals (tdpur4121m000)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abennett</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">A Purchase Revaluation is the difference between the standard cost today and the standard cost on the date entered into the receipt.<br />
<br />
As Baan allows you to back date receipts it has to have the ability to balance the books and this revaluation is that transaction.<br />
<br />
There is some good help in the integration module on triggers but you have to dig for it. <br />
On Baan IV you need to go to the help in GL/Integration/Misc then&quot;Maintain Inventory &amp; WIP Accounts&quot; Go to help then move to the bottom of the help text and there is a further drill down not sure what it called, but each transaction is in there and you can drill down further to see the trigger/posting details etc.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps</div></div><hr />
