If anyone has any experience with this I would like to discuss.  We are currently running Baan 5c but if you have any history with this type if functionality on any other version of Baan any suggestions you have will be helpful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are right in the middle of implementing such thing for the Indonesian branch of a multinational heavy machinery manufacturer BaanIV user. What aspect would you like to discuss, btcytec?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">btcytec</div><div class="date">6th September 2006, 20:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I am interested in the following:<br />
Can you easily add links to other web applications from Baan sessions? <br />
Can you customize the look of the sessions for the web?<br />
Will it work from a PDA (i.e. PocketPC)?<br />
<br />
We are also looking at xml solutions.  Does your current implementation include such a solution?  I have also just begun investigating the potential for products such as Openworld.  Bottom line, we need a robust solution as we are very heavy transactional users.<br />
Thanks,<br />
