<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rreichenbach</div><div class="date">3rd June 2008, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">We will have a rollout at our site in Denmark in a few moths with ERP LN and we intend to leave the server in Germany and connect via Citrix from Denmark to ERP LN located on the server in Germany. Now our guys from Denmark told us that from Denish law it is not possible to locate the server outside of Denmark as the company has to save and reproduce the data from its site.<br />
<br />
Could someone tell us if this is really true or has someone a similar situation where the server is located outside of Denmark? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

This is not  true. I am quite sure that I can find another Baan customer with a similar setup. Also in Baan. <br />
You may contact me for details.</div></div><hr />

So we would really appreciate to get details about it. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not certain about Denmark but it might be similar to Germany where it was neccessary to have server located on site.<br />
<br />
Solution was quite simple <br />
<br />
First we bought cheap intel machine just for replication purposes in Germany.<br />
Live enviroment was located in Denmark and our technician made automatic data transfer from operating enviroment to German &quot;legal&quot; enviroment. Basically ftp transfer of compressed data dump from one server to another during weekend. Question if you have enough time during weekend to make a dump.<br />
<br />
I know this was sufficient for German authorities. Possibly you could do the same in the opposite direction.</div></div><hr />
