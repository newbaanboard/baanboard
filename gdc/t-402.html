Taking the chance of this to become a very long thread, what do you think about the cause of the accident and the effect it will have on the economy and people?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smiffy</div><div class="date">12th November 2001, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously, at this time it is too early to tell what might have caused this disaster.  It's understandable that people do jump to conclusions at this sensitive time and with it taking place in New York.  There are reports that the engine fell from the aircraft, which I find hard to believe.  Most fires in engines are caused by a bird strike.  I hope that this is an isolated incident and that it is not the start of a continuation of terrorist atrocities.<br />
<br />
The important thing is to be vigilant, but not to let the events of September 11 and the Anthrax attacks ruin the way we live our lives, (those of us that are lucky enough to live in a free democratic society).<br />
<br />
My sympathies go to those that have died and their families.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My sympathies also go out to those that have died and their families.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggis</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I see they have suggested that it is an isolated incident and there seem to be no signs of terrorism involved.  Thank heavens.  It just seems very unfair that lightning hits the same place twice!!!<br />
<br />
My sympathy's go out as well to those who have been hurt in anyway by this tragedy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">13th November 2001, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Good luck that it is not another terrorist attack, bad luck it's New York again. Well even the good luck bit isn't really good luck :(<br />
<br />
Stock exchanges seems to be still suffering  from it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">14th November 2001, 00:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Any loss of life is a tradegy given recent events though this seems even more so. <br />
<br />
I too add my sentiments to those above.</div></div><hr />
