Or are there a suitable AddOn fot it?<br />
 <br />
background:<br />
We have often related to the SEPA payment method error messages in the Sepafile &quot;the BIC (in InforLN it is the code of the bank branch) does not match.<br />
Therefore, a review of these codes on the accuracy would be very helpful, precisely in order to avoid this error.<br />
 <br />
Can you let me get information about it?<br />
 <br />
Many thanks!</div></div><hr />

unlike IBAN the BIC is not determined when calculating the checksum, by a mathematical method. The procedures contained in BaaN / LN allows the examination of the IBAN, at least on the formal specifications. The BIC is a specification (in Germany by the Bundesbank, is updated quarterly). As far as I know, there is no room for the Sepa payment universally accessible data source to the system could access at a record in the table for the bank branches or creation of Sepa XML file. This respect is not to provide readily capable of an examination of the BIC available Infor (and other software manufacturers).<br />
An alternative way would be viable offense, at intervals to check the bank details in each case to determine whether to detect deviations from the specifications are each nationally valid. For domestic banks is comparatively easy to implement. For banks abroad obtaining the reference information is probably more difficult. Possible that banks give to calculate the verification of a data base provided as a service. But even here there would always be a selective examination.</div></div><hr />
