What I want to say is ERP customers normally are reluctant to upgrade to new version.  The main reason is  because the risk and cost for migrating to the new system.  The situation for Baan system is even worse, because of SSA 's poor ability to sell the ERP system into new accounts.  The new quarterly finance report shows that they gain 40 new accounts. But how many of them are Baan customers?</div></div><hr />
