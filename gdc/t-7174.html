<br />
Does anyone has more details about this or is it just a hoax?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">15th October 2002, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We at Profuse made a Baan SME version based upon iBaanERP 5.0... but that is not what you mean I think? It is a lean interface over the standard iBaan ERP 5.0c engine. Cheap, fast to implement, full scalable growthpath (towards full functional iBaanERP5.0), and a lot better than Navision, because only it's interface is lean, the engine is Baan...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 08:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, my friend, but Baan promised a long time ago that BaanIV would only go as far as c4 and Invensys hasn't said anything different.  So it's probably just a rumour:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually BaanSME is not gossip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My employer has plans to implement Baan 5.0c into c. 60 site many of them small</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">18th October 2002, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">BAAN Company has recognized that in today's marketplace the biggest opportunities are in the Tier 3 market. In other words the Small and Medium sized companies.<br />
Together with BAAN we have been involved in an initiative to develop and market iBaan for SME based on b50_c.<br />
Please let me know if you are interested in this and I am sure I can help you.<br />

We are asking Baan to have these changes imported in the standard... but no agreement so far yet.</div></div><hr />

It sounds very interesting, do you have some screen shots available?<br />

<br />
I understand from OmeLuuk that Profuse in The Netherlands has been working on a b50_c solution. Lisa (lbencic) is talking about b40_c5.<br />
I know that BAAN USA does not want to work with a b40 version for iBaan SME because they don't like that GUI and as far as I know they will not pursue iBaan SME in North America any further.<br />
<br />
Are we talking about the same solution here?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Edwin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">2nd January 2003, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, I don't think so.  I was posting to the original question - I have not seen reference to Baan IVd anywhere, just the code references to Baan IVc5, which does not officially exist.  My posting(s) have nothing to do with Baan V or SME.</div></div><hr />
