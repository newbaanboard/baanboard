<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an old legacy system being used in our Swiss company called &quot;MANIC System&quot; something or other. The system appears to be written in BASIC and sits on a SUN server. This system was inherited and is extremely old as dates in the BASIC scripts refer back to 1984. We have copies of the data files taken from the server but do not know of a way to view the data outside of the host system. Has anybody ever come across this system and do you know if there is a way to export the data to a format readable by say.......Oracle or another dB environement.<br />
