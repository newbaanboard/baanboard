<br />
I would first excuse myself for my direct approach, but some informatic projects are not so distant away from my firm as i thought/hoped.<br />
<br />
Because, i would like to oversee as much as possible in my firm, even though some subjects aren't easy to follow. I like to try to do my best.<br />
And in this case, i hope you can help me, or show me the right path.<br />
<br />
As i'm going to let my ERP-system renew on my dutch business, i would like to have some information regarding Baan, that would satisfy my needs.<br />
<br />
Info would regard:<br />
- modules <br />
* standard functionality like : accounting, the supply chain, product developpement, ...<br />
* extended (newer) functionalities like : CRM, HRM, workflow, ...<br />
- dbms use <br />
- ...<br />
- ... whatever you think is usefull<br />
- ... Resource sites to learn more, ... <br />
<br />
I'd also appreciate the main differences with Microsoft Dynamics NAV, but this isn't required yet.<br />
<br />
With friendly regards,<br />
Nico Sap<br />
General Manager</div></div><hr />
