<br />
Based on ur background u can go for Java or .Net<br />
<br />
Both technologies are used extensively by clients<br />
<br />
.Net is new there are not lot of consultants around<br />
<br />
I'm  going in the Java/Web services route.....<br />
<br />
Other possibilities are u can get trained in another ERP or CRM that might help<br />
<br />
If u like to learn java this is a good site www.javaranch.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanlegend</div><div class="date">1st June 2003, 02:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking about Java also. But there are too many experienced people are around. I see lot of Java people are loosing jobs also. Do you think Baan and Java can make a good combination or Is there any special area of Java programming that can help getting a job. <br />
<br />
Do you think .NET will gain popularity ?<br />
<br />
I really appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks Baannow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanow</div><div class="date">3rd June 2003, 19:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically I'm looking into ERP integrations.<br />
<br />
Integrating Baan(or other ERP) with B2B/EAI and other applications. <br />
<br />
Open World is based on Java and XML.<br />
<br />
With SSA GT maybe Open World can be used by more products.<br />
<br />
<br />
So in short move to an integration project which has some Java and with lot of Java certifications(SCJP,SCEA ..etc) u can move to Java.<br />
<br />
(This is my plan ...but I don't know in reality whether it will work.<br />
But I don't have any other choice)<br />
<br />
Regarding .net as long as Bill has $ it will gain popularity...</div></div><hr />

There are many opportunities out there.  I am functional, but a week doesn't go by without being contacted regarding an implementation, rollout or optimization project.  <br />
<br />
The sale should effect the market positively.</div></div><hr />
