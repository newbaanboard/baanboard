<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">17th June 2007, 01:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Terry, I think you get to believe Baan was put as the flagship ERP product at Infor, if you look at their website. <br />
       http://www.infor.com/solutions/erp/<br />
Only Ln's information is put there. <br />
<br />
Infor now uses the term &quot;Infor ERP Ln Fast Start&quot; to promote pre-configured Ln solution. It seems now they emphasize on quick implementation rather than cheaper licence price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Migration Labs</div><div class="date">17th June 2007, 12:47</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea of a pre-configured ERP system for BAAN customers is not new as we, Migration Labs, have promoted this idea for 8 years already and that is why we have come up with our Easybaan solution for ERP LN so that existing Baan customers can save time and money to implement and migrate to LN.<br />
To give an example, if a customer with 25 concurrent users sticks to the Easybaan template a full implementation of and data migration to ERP LN can be successfully completed within 3 months.<br />
<br />
In our philosophy, for 60 - 80% the business processes run in any typical  manufacturing company are the same and therefore those processes have been standardized in the ERP LN environment as part of the Easybaan bundle. Besides that, Easybaan also provides migration templates for Baan IV and BaanERP customers to migrate what makes them unique compared to their competitors. This is the 20 - 40% of their Baan IV/BaanERP data. <br />
Once the Baan IV/BaanERP data has been loaded in the new ERP LN environment the customer can execute all their business processes in ERP LN without errors. That is what we do with our Easybaan methodology as we believe Baan customers learn ERP LN faster when all their Baan IV/BaanERP data has already been loaded in the ERP LN environment before the actual training of key-users and implementation start.<br />
<br />
However, it is not only migrating the data and executing the business processes in ERP LN that matter to the customer and so our Easybaan bundle contains all the necessary features a customer needs to start with a fully operational business solution as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Our Easybaan bundle includes the following features:<br />
<br />
* A pre-configured Easybaan company in ERP LN with more than 300 static- and master tables pre-defined<br />
* The Easybaan company contains pre-defined business processes including all related financial integration transactions mapped<br />
* Data migration templates for exporting data out of Baan IV/BaanERP/any other business system and importing that data into ERP LN<br />
* A module for standard reporting and controlling of financial data in ERP LN for Cost Center Management and Margin Control<br />
* A module for cube reporting to support data and business analysis<br />
* A module to automatically print all business documents to PDF, e-mail and fax in MS Office quality (no customizations of reports is needed as the lay-out of the documents will be handled in this Easybaan module)<br />
* A module for KPI reporting on 70 ratios about the results and the core of the business<br />
<br />
The Easybaan migration solution fully supports single-site and multi-site (single-logistic/multi-finance and multi-logistic/multi-finance) environments for:<br />
* Common and MCS-Tables<br />
* Product related data (Item, Bom, Routing, standard and customized, Project data, all PCF related data, etc.)<br />
* Business Partners (Customers, Suppliers, Adresses)<br />
* Sales Orders (Open Orders and History)<br />
* Production Orders (Open Orders and History)<br />
* Purchase Orders (Open Orders and History)<br />
* Open Entries ACR and ACP<br />
* Inventory Stock<br />
* Account Balances<br />
A customer can pick and choose what Baan IV/BaanERP data they need in ERP LN and we can bring that over. Partial data migration is not a problem and no need to migrate all Baan IV/BaanERP data per migration event.<br />
This is especially useful for customers who would like to do the implementation of and data migration to ERP LN mainly/partially by themselves. <br />
<br />
Therefore, we offer a standardized 5 day on-site workshop to show customers our Easybaan solution is not fiction. During the workshop we perform a mini-migration by bringing over a subset of the Baan IV/BaanERP data and at the end of the workshop we show the customer their own data in ERP LN by executing the business processes embedded in the Easybaan template company. This will help them better understand the new system and will give all stakeholders at the customer site a chance to see what ERP LN can really do for them. The other benefit is that the customer can already experience the quality of our people so the risk of bringing us on board will be minimized.<br />
&quot;We walk the talk&quot; as they say!<br />

Migration Labs, your idea is not bad. Do ur company only focus on migrating existing baanIV customers? Any preconfirgued solution to new customers?  <br />
<br />
We are also something similar in Hong Kong and South China, but for new customers.</div></div><hr />

We focus on two specific sides of the business with our Easybaan bundle:<br />
<br />
- A pre-configured ERP LN environment (including all the data migration aspects) for Baan IV, BaanERP and &quot;new-to-LN&quot; customers<br />
- Only migration services for Baan IV and BaanERP customers that do not want to use the pre-configured ERP LN company but still would like to take advantage of the benefits of our migration methodology.<br />
<br />
Having a pre-configured ERP LN environment is one thing but what about the migration side of the house? I wonder whether the data migration is part of the &quot;Infor ERP Ln Fast Start&quot; offering but my guess is that Infor will charge separately for that. We will have that definitely included in our Easybaan solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">25th June 2007, 04:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Infor's fast start only targets for new clients.<br />
<br />
For installed base, the cost on migrating static data or history data to Ln is minimal.  Many Baan IV customers has done quite a lot customization on the BaanIV application. They just treat BaanIV as a development platform. <br />
That's the reason why they have hesistation to migrate.</div></div><hr />
