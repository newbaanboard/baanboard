Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we use this tool for more than 5 years in a windows environment with Baan4 and Ln and it works really good. Installation is not easy but support of Nazdaq is very good. it is worth its price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skennedy</div><div class="date">13th June 2007, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an integrated solution which you may find interesting.<br />
 <br />
Not only does it include the typical features of fully automated internal/external distribution and archiving of BaaN documents weve added additional functionality, via ingenious interactive elements and workflows that bring entirely new functionality and logic to BaaN reports <br />
<br />
For instance, emailed POs can be sent to vendors with an Acknowledge button, which vendors can simply click to send email acknowledgements directly to the issuing buyer. Failing to do so within an allotted time triggers the automatic sending of a reminder email to the vendor and the issuing buyer. Any document can be routed through internal approval workflows, each based on data within the given report, as per the rules you define. <br />
<br />
There are also signature capture features, full audit trails and archiving of all documents processed within approval workflows, Sarbanes Oxley compliance auditing features etc.. <br />
<br />
