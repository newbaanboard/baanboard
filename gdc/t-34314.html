<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ash Gajjar</div><div class="date">16th April 2007, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently looking at third party Service products to run our worldwide Field service. This is currently managed within Baan (5.2a version). <br />
<br />
One of the prime candidates is Metrix. They specialise in all things Service, including Remote devices, web portals etc. We are hoping to retain the Inventory management and all financials in Baan. Basically, this product will be a front end Service solution. The proposal is to use Baan tables in most cases, but also allowing transactions from this product to flow into Baan. A lot of the Baan lookups would have to be real-time, especially inventory<br />
<br />
Metrix has an XML interchange module for connectivity with ERP type systems.This is one area that we do not have any expertise at all. All out development to date has been within Baan using Baan4GL. <br />
<br />
My questions are:<br />
<br />
1. What kind of interfaces are out there which would aid this implementation. I have heard of Openworld, but am not too familiar with its capabilities.<br />
<br />
2. Are there any firms out there that specialises in such an interface<br />
<br />
3. Is it possible translate Baan data to usable XML format using standard Baan tools ?<br />
<br />
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
We have developed a software layer that Baan sites use as bridgeware between their Baan and external applications. It was originally designed for B2B and integration with trading parter's ERPs but it has also been widely used for internal 3rd party applications, taking care of securely querying live Baan data, validations and Baan transaction processing. They way it's set up, it can perform literally any validated transaction without piles of custom Baan code. <br />
<br />
One such site uses it for both their E-commerce needs, as well as to enter and validate warranty claims from an external application. We use it internally for our technicians and programmers to maintain service order data, tasks, activities etc.... in a java point &amp; click GUI. <br />
<br />
And yes, the most common method it uses is XML within SOAP/XML web services, which allow for very simple integration. If you would like to know more feel free to contact me for a webinar tour or more information.<br />
<br />
Thank-you</div></div><hr />
