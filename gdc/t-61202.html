<br />
We just went live on LN FP6 in May.  Infor guided us towards BIRT as our main reporting tool.  While we have been able to succesfully use this for some of the simpler reports, we are struggling with the more difficult ones.  What I think would benifit us, is to have someone come in and help us/show us how to write some of these reports.  Really we just need to build the skillset on the table linkage and sql.  With Infor moving away from the BIRT tool, I think this knowlege can transfer of to the new tool.<br />
<br />
Can anyone recommend a consulting firm in the Northern IL area that would be able to provide someone for 3-5 days to do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
