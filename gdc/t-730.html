<br />
Thanx for replying. You are right that for writing queries, knowledge of SQL is a must. Please also guide about doing customisations. I mean to say, which programming language should I learn for doing BaaN Customisations as a Tools Consultant and as a Application Consultant. You can assume that I want to Become Manufacturing or Distribution Consultant. Keeping that in view please guide which programming languages or package, should a user learn to become respective consultant<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">James</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 10:47</div></div><div class="posttext">4GL would be a must to know.<br />
<br />
Additional 3rd party report writers like Crystal Reports, Safari, even Excel would also be useful, of course depending on the company - these report writers all work in a similar way though.  <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">For a technical consultant I would also like to add UNIX shell scripting as I think you can reasonably expect the majority of the Baan environments to be running on UNIX servers. In that case it is also handly to be able to accomplish small tasks in an automated way using shell scripts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 11:05</div></div><div class="posttext">To become a manufacturing consultant you would need generic knowledge of manufacturing practices and planning.  For distibution you would need to have knowledge of warehousing, inventory control and ordering of goods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 00:11</div></div><div class="posttext">The syntax of Baan coding is very much like the c language.   I started with a good background in SQL and c, with event driven language concepts (such as VB, PowerBuilder), and was able to pick up Baan easily.<br />
<br />
However, the Baan development environment is unique - it has it's own language and form/report writers.   There are no books available, aside from the Baan Programmer's Reference Guide.   Baan offers a range of classes to take for Baan training.  This includes Tools subjects like System Setup, Reports, SQL and Development, as well as the functional areas, Manufacturing, Distribution, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abennett</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">You state that you want to be an application specialist in Manufacturing &amp; Distribution - I therefore would suggest that you need to concentrate on these areas and not programming skills.<br />
<br />
The best &quot;Application&quot; consultants are the consultants that understand the business requirements first, then the software - not the other way about. I firmly believe the expertise required to be a good application consultant can only be gained by working &quot;at the coal face&quot; for a period of time in the real world, and not gained from a text book. <br />
<br />
If your skills lay in the technical arena, then I suggest that is the area you concentrate on.</div></div><hr />
