Any decent way to fix it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">13th November 2002, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, use the Mozilla or Phoenix browser. Both support the option  to suppress pop-ups.<br />
<br />
Mozilla: http://www.mozilla.org<br />
Phoenix: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/<br />
<br />
Phoenix is a light-weight version of Mozilla, without all the bloated email/newsreader add-ons. I have been using it for while now and I highly recommend it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">no, oh yes, if you did not make your personal profile, some hint screen pops up... but it uses some MS specific functions that need IE5+ to perform correctly... at least that is what I was told</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">ah that could very well be. Of course if you need to access a website that uses IE-only features :rolleyes:, well then you have no choice I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim s</div><div class="date">14th November 2002, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me comment that when I first came to Baanboard, I thought it was a good site, but found getting around difficult. It took a long time to go from one screen to the next, go back, etc. I felt like I had a bad dial up connection.<br />
<br />
But when I switched from Netscape to IE, performance went through the roof! Now I get around quickly with no problems at all.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Would this be caused by Netscape being a poor browser or by this site using IE specific optimisations?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But have just started to get them on Baan Support ,!!!!!<br />
<br />
Do not know if this since i sigened up to Pro-Active or coincidental with something else !!<br />
<br />
It is very , very annoying</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know, vbulletin tries to be as much as possible cross-browser compatible. However we do have a feature  that is IE-only, which is the ability to collapse/expand posts.</div></div><hr />
