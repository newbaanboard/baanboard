Im student in University and I have small project about Baan Software. I dont know any thing about it, so I want from you some help to be able to complete this project.<br />
<br />
I need to evaluate the software from the following perspectives:<br />
a.	Decision making technique used/implemented<br />
b.	Features of the software and comparison with other software using the same/similar decision making technique.<br />
c.	Hardware and software resource requirements to make this software operational.<br />
d.	Training/Customer support/ other kinds of help available from the vendors.<br />
e.	General information about its popularity (mainly reasons for being successful or not so successful)<br />
f.	What are the limitations of this software??<br />
g.	Case Studies of the firms using this software<br />
h.	Cost-effectiveness or Cost-benefit analysis.<br />
<br />
I will be very thankful if you help me<br />
THANKS AND GOODBYE</div></div><hr />

<br />
This site is full of useful information. However you might not get them all here in this thread. Since you have many questions, and the answer for each one is very long, you might have to post a small specific question in the related thread.<br />
<br />
For a start check out the Polls &amp; Surveys Forum (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=70). There are some good statistics there and some of them might answer some or your questions.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your project ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">26th April 2007, 02:06</div></div><div class="posttext">:D  We should help students to complete their homework<br />
<br />
a.	Decision making technique used/implemented<br />
Baan is not for decision making, but a source for decision making software.<br />
<br />
b.	Features of the software and comparison with other software using the same/similar decision making technique.<br />
Hard to compare since it is not a decision making software<br />
<br />
c.	Hardware and software resource requirements to make this software operational.<br />
<br />
min. config. A Windows/Linux server with a pentium CPU + 1GB memory + 50GB hard disk<br />
<br />
d.	Training/Customer support/ other kinds of help available from the vendors.<br />
Software training, implementation service, customer support<br />
<br />
e.	General information about its popularity (mainly reasons for being successful or not so successful)<br />
The vendor says there are 4000 customers in the world. The number is decreasing. The reason why it is not successful, should be the bad management since Mr Jan Baan. <br />
<br />
f.	What are the limitations of this software??<br />
The GUI is not nice. No Industry focus. <br />
<br />
g.	Case Studies of the firms using this software<br />
You should get one or two on the vendor's web site. http://www.infor.com<br />
<br />
h.	Cost-effectiveness or Cost-benefit analysis.<br />
Difficult to answer. <br />
<br />
Sorry. It seems my answer is not so helpful.</div></div><hr />

The best thing is you visit an already baan implemented site and understand there. The best answeres you can get is from the key users of baan in that company. Might look difficult to approach but many companies do support.</div></div><hr />
