We have a received a drirective from Infor to pay a colossal amount of money for source code. We can't afford the money and need to start planning to work live without source code. I need to know if there is anyone who has been affected by this directive. How have you managed to live without source code.<br />
 <br />
Let me have your experiences out there !<br />

<br />
Working without BAAN source code<br />
<br />
We never had source Code.  Never wanted it.<br />
<br />
Keeping Baan free of &quot;Customizations&quot; has allowed clean updates without issues.<br />
<br />
What I did instead is to write a considerable amount of software in my own environment that accesses all my Baan Data in Oracle.  I add the additional functionality I need there.  I do not own any third party reporting package.  Everything I need is provided by my own software including P&amp;L's.<br />
<br />
NOTE:  I only Read the Baan Database.  I never have and never will make changes to the Baan Database outside of the Baan Software.<br />

Generally there are several ways to overcome that, a common way is to add new sessions or external program and utilize AFS to simulate the functions. The penalty is the performance.<br />
Another way is you can approach service partners of Infor for the customization which cannot be avoided. We are an Infor service partner at Hong Kong, http://www.ziaps.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">12th September 2008, 21:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Use AFS and customize other programs. I like Baan better without source code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marwest98</div><div class="date">12th September 2008, 21:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The only problem with not having the source code is when a problem arises, you must contact Baan to make any changes necessary.  Our problem is, we have the source code, and can look at it, but cannot compile or make any changes to it.  In relying on Baan to make any changes, delays occur.  Sometimes the users want a change in a hurry, and you cannot make it.  Usually it is a change to a report, but, it still has to go through someone that can change the baan source code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">13th September 2008, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">i seriously think you need to change your customization strategy, bearing in mind that you will never have a source code. a report is even easier to customize because you can create a report script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">20th October 2008, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many ways to implement customizations, even to the standard sessions without the source code.  Having read access to the source code makes the process of customizing easier, but not entirely necessary.<br />
<br />
If you need customizations and will not have the source code, please contact me.</div></div><hr />
