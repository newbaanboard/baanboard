<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">1st March 2002, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard of a product called Object Magnifier from Luminux www.luminux.nl  that was similar to a decompiler for Baan.  I went searching it out and found that they had sold all the products back to Baan.  I called some contacts there who were surprised that I knew about the product as they just returned from the NL being trained on the product.  It is now called iBaan Smarteye and incorporates the Object Magnifier.  I have downloaded a verson from the Baan Support Site and will try it out.  I think that there might be a validation key that will only let it run until April 1, 2002.  If anyone tries this out, please post what you did and what results you received.  There is not much documentation on how the product works yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">1st March 2002, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We used Luminux last year. When installed you have to call the program through Iexplorer or Netscape, calling IP adress. You have to install it in server side.<br />
<br />
Installation was documented in the zip file downloded.<br />
<br />
The product was free, you can validate software any times you want. The first thing to do is examine the system to read VRC's etc. Also the program gives you information like OS, Porting set, etc.<br />
<br />
Other features were not free, when called, produce an output to send to lunimux and they give you answeres; after you pay. (*)<br />
<br />
Object magnifier is free. When you ask a session or an object as an input the program returns you: parameters used, tables declared, includes, functions dll and selects statements used in object/session. The program DOES NOT decompile code, but gives you a lot of information. Also includes existing tables lock.<br />
<br />
We left using it because we contracted codes, and if we can see codes, Luminux is only like an old mirror.<br />
<br />
Other features of the program were something like Examinator(do not remember right). This produces a file and... (see point *), the goal was tunning and system setup.<br />
<br />
It included to Euro Analizer. Also (*).<br />
<br />
In general, if you have not codes it is a very good tool.</div></div><hr />

This product contains the object magnifier, which is a kind of decompiler for baan objects.  iBaanSupportEye is the luminiux tool with some baan logos on it. <br />

But looking through Diagnostics manual, I can't see decompiler there anymore. Am I right?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">16th April 2005, 04:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info, Dave. So, if I really need object decompiler right now (some bozo deleted an important customised program script), would you happen to know any tool I can use? I understand from Baan Support web site that Support Eye also needed license that was only granted if you were using the latest supported version. Hence, since Support Eye is being made obsolete, no license can be issued for it, and it can't be used anymore. Right?<br />
What am I to do?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">16th April 2005, 07:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, its licensed.. you might be able to find someone who has a current license for the old SE..   (not me though..)<br />
<br />
But the thing to keep in mind is that even this decompiler just basically gave a list of basic functions, not logic. so you couldn't extract the code and recompile it..<br />

Then from where we can get the license software copy please tell, and is there any other method to recover the scripts?<br />

<br />
Yeah - I was sort of thinking you could send them the object if they<br />
had a licensed copy.. <br />
<br />
But guys - like I was saying. It will not decompile your object. Other than a &quot;ohh, so that's sort of what it was doing&quot; it's worthless.<br />
<br />
The best way to recover scripts? _BACKUP YOUR ENVIRONMENT!_<br />
c'mon guys, isn't that the first thing we learn as sysadmins? ;) <br />

I'm consulting with a client and happened to realize that one of their important script was accidentally deleted by some dufus 6 months ago. They'll need this script one of these days, either to enhance the customisation or troubleshooting. Anybody knows how I can recover it from the object? Thank you<br />

Even people in Infor/Baan (who may be in possession of sources of compiler) , may be unable to do something concrete on decompiler unless there is structured organizational backing  to it . <br />
<br />
If u want sources, then get it legitimately from Infor . They are very co-operative and will help u .Why risk time on matter not needed by anyone .</div></div><hr />
