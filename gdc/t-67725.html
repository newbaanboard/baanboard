<br />
<br />
Upgrading Focus Day<br />
<br />
Tuesday 16th June 2015<br />
<br />
Upgrading Focus Day: We are working on an agenda to cover all aspects of upgrading for the Baan LN community which will be for members and non members.  More detail to come very soon, in the meantime, save the date!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Spring Conference<br />
<br />
Wednesday 17th June 2015<br />
<br />
Spring Conference:  The SyteLine and Baan LN User Group committees are working together to organise a combined event.  This has worked well in the past enabling us to take advantage of a larger audience to gain access to senior Infor presenters.  There will be sessions common to both systems plus breakout sessions which are completely focussed on the specific software.  This will be a great opportunity to come together with SyteLine and Baan LN users and network within your own community.<br />
<br />
We are finalising the agenda at the moment and the booking office will open shortly, in the meantime â€“ save the date!</div></div><hr />
