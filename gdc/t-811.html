<br />
Two ways of reaching what Baan calls iBaan:<br />
<br />
- Baan IVc4 + BFO (Front Office) + all the e-suite --&gt; iBaan<br />
- Baan V      + ditto                                               --&gt; iBaan<br />
<br />
Would like to see differing views!!  :D</div></div><hr />

The main points are that, Baan is now 100% web enabled.  (we have it running on the internet) it integrates with Baan Open World to all the other Baan products (ibaan for CRM, iBaan for PLM etc...)<br />
<br />
It includes colaboration and a broad offering of new tools<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanassist</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 06:41</div></div><div class="posttext">iBaan has been created to milk the installed base of existing Baan IV customers. If you look at all of the hype from a marketing perspective you can clearly see Baan IV is at the end of its product life cycle and is about to die. So, iBaan was invented to extend the product life cycle of Baan IV. This was particularly handy in a time when no new Baan licenses were sold. Especially in the Americas!<br />
<br />
Now that the market is finally picking up again and b5.2 will be available fairly quickly we can only hope that for all new and existing Baan V customers the new functionalities in b5.2 will make Baan V more mature and interesting. Unfortunately all Baan IV customers will never be able to benefit from these new functionalities. So, unless they migrate to b50_c or b52_a, they will die together with the Baan IV product.<br />
Sorry guys because I know it is an unpleasant wake-up call.<br />
<br />
iBaan and its Open World adapters are also not true collaborative commerce.  These are merely Baan's interpretation of collaboration.<br />
The Open World adapters are based on EAI (Enterprise Application Integration) and can only be used for integrations to and from Baan IV and Baan V.<br />
Nowadays the technological developments in the marketplace go so fast that within six months all iBaan Open World adapters will be obsolete. The reason for this is that more advanced platform independent integration tools are being released. All companies considering implementing iBaan Open World should think about this aspect. Baan's Open World adapters are already becoming old-fashioned and by implementing these new integration tools you will be able to save yourself a lot of money. You will also be able to integrate much more systems than just your Baan environment. These new tools can easily integrate Baan to everything else but at the same time you can integrate everything else to everything else.<br />
So, the wake-up call was not too bad after all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeyaseelan</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 13:32</div></div><div class="posttext">iBaan  What Is It?<br />
<br />
Baan launched its Internet-ready e-Business set of products, iBaan. (i for Internet? Or i for Invensys?) Now the company applies the name  with i for Internet  to its entire suite of business applications, as an umbrella designator for what used to be called BaanERP in conjunction with OpenWorld (the application integration tools now in their second generation), the Dynamic Modeler, the B2B business server, the portal (is this also iBaan?), and the reporting tools. This packaging is now apparently referred to as iBaan Enterprise.<br />
<br />
Confusing enough? Heres the scoop: iBaan succeeds Baan Enterprise Solutions as the new name of the entire family of Baan products, built on the foundation of the existing ERP, CRM, and SCM suites. The initiative introduced the thin-client Internet architecture and added the new e-Commerce products and the iBaan Portal  referred to as iBaan Collaboration. <br />
Clear enough?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you kidding?????  Baan IV has a sales date through 2005.  Baan V b and c only have sales dates until 2002 and 2003.  Support for Baan IV is currently targeted until 2008.  With more than 80% of Baans customers on IVc3 and IVc4 I don't see it comming to an end.  With Baan 5.2 on the Horizon Vb and Vc will be obsolete first.  I suggest a visit to the Baan Support site to look at their retirement notice and matrix.  As most everyone in this post has said.... iBaan is Baan's web enabled product without using the bi server.</div></div><hr />
