While, SAP's strength is finance. Anyone can tell me what is the gap between BaaN and SAP in their finance functions?<br />
<br />
BaaN is also a very large ERP system, and a lot of global enterprises are using it. BaaN also provide &quot;multi-logistics, single finance; multi-logistics, multi-finance; single logistics, single finance; and single logisitics, multi-finance&quot; modes. I cannot imagine how strong SAP's finance is that even much stronger than BaaN!<br />
<br />
Any answers will be highly appreciated.<br />

<br />
I also had the same thought with you. But for hardcore accountants and finance people, BaanERP Finance module design can be viewed as rather simplistic. SAP is actually very kind to open up its whole software on line help to the web. You can access it from help.sap.com (look under R/3). By looking in there, you'll see features in its accounting and finance which are far ahead from what BaanERP has (inflation accounting, bank interest calculation, beautiful Chart Of Account implementation for multi company set up, user - not Tools consultant - customisable accounting screens, collapsible tree approach to financial statement design, and many, many more). I was sort of surprised that they managed to design and develop such complex accounting module<br />

<br />
Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
Below are some of my points,<br />
<br />
1. For simply application, there are no important differences; however, if for complex application, great differences will appear. That is true for almost all things, Pentium VS. Celeron; Oracle VS. SQL Server; and etc, <br />
<br />
2. For detailed points. I summarized three of them.<br />
2.1 In area of finance control, which includes finance data mining, analysis, managemental accounting functionalities, and decision support;<br />
2.2 Ease of financial statement customization. Users who are not technical, for example, the finance user, can customize the statements easily. In BaaN IV system, it also provide such a way. However, it is much more stronger in sap than in baan.<br />
2.3 Strong multi-company finance support. Baan system also supports multi-company finance, however, it is realized by sharing tables directly in database, baan system just provide an interface for assigning those tables. It is not realized by integrated applications. Sap does this much better than baan.<br />
<br />
Should there are something not very correct, pls feel free to write down your opinion. Thank you.<br />

<br />
Unfortunatelly, I have to say: SAP is really the best ERP on the world in all aspects, even in planning and everything else.<br />
<br />
That´s why SAP is the most popular and valuable ERP and one of the most respected marks on the TI world.</div></div><hr />

You are very brave making a statement like this and I applaud you.  Many of us live with the false hope that Baan will regain the market position it had 6 or 7 years ago.  When SSA managed to get the product for almost nothing our expectations were wrongly re-ignigted. We hoped that SSA would actively market the product and invest in its development and in so doing regain the stature that the Baan brothers enjoyed for a brief period.   <br />
<br />
It has long been clear that SSA just isn't in the software development and marketing business.  Baan 6 or SSA LN is itself now an old product yet it has less than 100 implemented customer sites around the world. Whilst it has some 'cute' new features it doesn't seem to have much additional functionality to offer. Indeed for may of us it does not even have all the BaanIV functionality that we currently use.<br />
<br />
I understand that SSA are now prepared to provide existing customers with demo software for evaluation. This is a change of attitude but maybe too little to late as many Baan sites now see SAP and/or Oracle as better long-term propositions.  <br />
