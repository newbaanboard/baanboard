<br />
I don't know where you are located but you can get all the exercises you need from your local BAAN Education provider.<br />
Of course it is much better to learn more about all the functionalities BAAN V has to offer by taking classes. If you only would do the exercises you should ask yourself what you are  actually learning? By following classes and the interaction with the instructor you can discuss the situations that are specific to your environment as well and that will give you a jump start.<br />
<br />
In case you are based in North America I can help you further with this as I am working for TriNET, one of BAAN's Education providers.<br />
Please feel free to mail me at evanderborg@trinet-is.com.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
