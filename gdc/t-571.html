<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone recommend the best (and not necessarily the largest) Baan outsourcing companies, i.e. someone who manages a Baan installation as though they were part of the customer's IT organization, from installation, integration, ongoing 24/7 management, etc.?<br />
<br />
I'm also curious as to if there is much demand for this type of service.</div></div><hr />

In the Netherlands there are several, since I work for one of them I think that I am not the right person to tell which one. If you send me a private message I can name some.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
I am working for TriNET, one of the ASP Alliance Partners of BAAN in the US. Since the last six months we have been experiencing an increased demand for Outsourcing services.<br />
We deliver three types of services: remote, on-site and a mix between remote and on-site.<br />
<br />
Our motto is: Do what you do best, outsource the rest!. This will enable your IT department to really focus on the work they were hired for. We as the outsourcing company will take care of the BAAN installation and all the activities that deal with that.<br />
<br />
The advantage of working with a full service partner of BAAN, like TriNET, is that you have a one stop shop for all your BAAN needs.<br />
<br />
If you would like to know more about our offering please contact me at:<br />
