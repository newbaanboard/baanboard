<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Which aspects of performance will be the core of the course?  I've run into vastly different problems in the initial loading og Baan data (conversions), running MRP/MPS (performance boosters) or ongoing performance issues.  Occasionally the database DBA was my chief &quot;enemy&quot; because the better he tuned the database, the worse my Baan performance became (telling them to tune the database so everything was &quot;wrong&quot; was always my greatest challenge.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your courses though.<br />
