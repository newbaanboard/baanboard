<br />
Actually on the forum, most of the discussion are based on technical points.<br />
<br />
I would like to ask a very basic question to all of you:<br />
<br />
Why having an ERP software is a must and an advantage for a Company ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for answering honestly !<br />

<br />
It can use this information to forecast material requirements, sales projections, inventory, etc.<br />
<br />
It can also roll up all of those activities to allow a good financial picture.<br />
<br />
The alternative of which is doing all of the above by had, pencil and paper.<br />
<br />
<br />
If your question is more along the lines of why do we need 1 system (like baan) to do all that vs a best of breed, or homegrown. well that's a debate, <br />
and is really up to the specific company and it's needs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">12th December 2007, 02:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Although we provide service on ERP systems, we should admit that ERP systems implementation is not easy to be success. <br />
<br />
Three major problems,<br />
<br />
1. Complexity of ERP, a single big system to handle the business in different departments, different industries, different countries. <br />
2. ERP is broad in functionality, but lack in the depth of functionality, which results in quite a lot of customization.<br />
3. The difficulty of change management across multiple departments<br />
<br />
So?<br />
<br />
1. Give up your unrealistic expectation on an ERP system. It is just a general purpose single big system. Buy it to fulfil your basic business operations like GL, AR, AP, inventory management, order management. <br />
2. If you need more than that, source some specific business system like CRM, SRM, MES, APS. The specific business system should be fit to your industry. A MES system for electronics industry does not fit the requirement  of electrical appliance manufacturing company.<br />
3. How to integrate them? SOA!  SOA is a new IT bubble need to be fulfiled. :&gt;  Check Mulesource or Iona Fuse.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">13th February 2008, 05:42</div></div><div class="posttext">The ERP entry on Wikipedia has a list of the advantages and disadvantages of ERP.<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning<br />
<br />
The disadvantage part actually indicates some of the problems of an ERP system.<br />
<br />
I especially agree with these two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many of the integrated links need high accuracy in other applications to work effectively. A company can achieve minimum standards, then over time &quot;dirty data&quot; will reduce the reliability of some applications&quot;<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
&quot;The blurring of company boundaries can cause problems in accountability, lines of responsibility, and employee morale.&quot;</div></div><hr />
