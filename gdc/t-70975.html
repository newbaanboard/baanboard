<br />
So I am a new user to BaaN, never used it before in my life and the previous IT guy left little to no information on the hidden gems like B2Mail Merge. I do know that we no longer have a support package with Nazdaq due to management not seeing a need.<br />
<br />
My problem is that recently the one user has reported that the program (Mail Merge) is taking ~4 minutes to send the email. The server is not under load in any fashion and nothing has changed on her PC or the server in terms of updates. How do I go about investigating and improving the performance on B2Mail-Merge? The only change was a password change and that issue is now resolved. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any assistance :).</div></div><hr />
