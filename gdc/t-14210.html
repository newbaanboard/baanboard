They say that ERP vendors do not have a strong hold on their customers which makes it hard to sell them additional software. The study ranks different ERP vendors.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">16th January 2004, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the reason behind buying an ERP system (and having a support contract)? You want to have a system that get's updated when new technologies arrive. That's the reason for an ERP system - not the need for &quot;best of breed&quot; business processes or whatever else the marketing guys do think of. <br />
<br />
Trying to *sell* those updates to the customer base it what Baan was trying to do all the time and what SSA is still doing. I don't think that was/is a good strategy, I know many customers that were/are really angry about that behaviour.<br />

<br />
The irony of it is that Baan failed to sell much additional software to most of its customers but the sure did generate ill feelings.<br />
<br />
I think we need to give SSA a bit more time before we pass final judgement on their modus operandi and business ethics.  <br />
<br />
If  Version 6 is free and the upgrade straight forward and SSA don't try to extort conversion charges or rescind source code, then they will be good guys.  I think they still have to clean out a lot of the ex-Baan employees yet.  In my view they need to rid themselves of all ex-baan peple who were managers or above and all those who dealt with customers.<br />
