After searching long for the topic. Landed here on BaanBoard.com.<br />
<br />
Iam new to this stuff and is responsible for taking care of Basic Administration of Baan IVc4 here in my organisation.<br />
<br />
Can anyone of you guide me where to start and if possible provide with some docs to read.<br />
To add into this, i have no info on the software/manual CD's of the same as the person before me has left and is no more accessible.<br />
<br />
I would be very grateful to you people.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all welcome on baanboard. <br />
<br />
Via www.infor365.com you can ask for a account for https://infor.subscribenet.com on which you can find the software of your baan release. That software does contain a documentation cd. However your company need to have a valid support contract in order to get an account.<br />
<br />
Second option is to get a training. Not sure what the possibilities are in your region.<br />
Third option: get an experienced consultant for a couple of days to get you up and running. Probably this is the most efficient way to get the knowledge.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
As always I would recommend to search in this forum for your questions or if you don't find answers do not hesitate to ask questions.<br />
<br />
To start in general you can read this tutorial:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/node/1718<br />
<br />
And for further Programming and Tools info Baanboard kindly provides the Programmers Manual that you can find here:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp<br />
<br />
But Han is right, that you should get a professional training.<br />
I mean: No one likes it, if the system crashes because of unexperienced administrators. ;)<br />
