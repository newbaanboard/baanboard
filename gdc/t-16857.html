I would like to know what are the advantages of SCM over the ERP applications. Is it that SCM provides good interaction and collaboration with the outside entities or it also gives an advantage to the internal processes also?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">21st October 2004, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say that the SCM is MOSTLY an internal benefit when you have multiple developers that are often stepping on each others work.  This was a great tool for Baan development, where you had many programmers working in all areas of the software.  Your internal developers can check things out and make changes, and other developers on the same VRC will not see those changes until they are checked in.  Other developers can also then not make changes on those same objects while they are checked out.<br />
<br />
For your live environment, if there are some serious problems that need to be debugged in live, SCM provides your developers or Baan support the ability to compile scripts in debug for themself, and others do not see the debug.<br />
<br />
When working with outside developers, it is not so much of an advantage, because usually what they have is developed on their own system and needs to be put into a test environment for everyone to see/test.  If the outside developers are dialing in and developing on your system, then they too can use SCM so that's helpful.</div></div><hr />

Did you mean Supply Chain Management?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">21st October 2004, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">O ehe - maybe they did.  I was talking about Software Configuration Management.  Shows where my head is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jksandy08</div><div class="date">27th October 2004, 07:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Yes I meant supply chain management and not software configuration management.<br />

       we are working on Baan5 and ERPLN(win2k,SQL Server2000).<br />
we want to activate SCM(Software Configuration management) but unfortunately we came to know that SCM works on only unix OS.Is it true?<br />
Does it depends on OS? <br />
Can u comment on the same??<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">31st December 2004, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan SCM relies on VCS, a version control program that is included in most (if not all) Unix installations. <br />
As far as I know there is no Windows equivalent for this program, since MS pushes SourceSafe to handle version control under Windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">4th January 2005, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Just agreeing, as far as I know Software Config Mgmt is only supported in UNIX.</div></div><hr />
