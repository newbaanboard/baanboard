The same situation was with my organization. We r having 5/6 plants having different locations &amp; servers too. We have done all customizations incl reports, domains etc. on our old server. Only specific VRCs and package combinations are exactly maintained same.<br />
We take export dump of particular session and import as it is to our target plant server.<br />
<br />
It is possible with very cool way with 99% accuracy some way we have to modify some sessions after import.<br />
<br />
Hope it will help you!</div></div><hr />

Please give more detailed information on your setup of baan, whether multisite setup is done (MFML or SFSL etc.)?<br />
Whether you want to have server centralised at one site or you want to keep servers at each site?<br />
How do you want the connectivity?<br />
then I will be able to advice on that.<br />
