<br />
On some PC's (using my password and user ID) it is OK.<br />
<br />
BaaN say they can access the site using my password and user ID so therefore there is no problem.<br />
<br />
I have tried deleting all cookies and offline content but this has not helped.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 21:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same problem. The BaaN Support guys can access with my login/password and I couldnt. So I contacted our Desktop/Network administrators and they resolved it. They found that someone had accidentally changed my Internet Access Right and reduced my authority and they reset it back. <br />
<br />
Everything is fine and I can now be at the BaaN Support Site and the BaaN Board too... :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andrew.page</div><div class="date">25th October 2002, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">NPRao - do you know what your support guys did.<br />
<br />
I have emptied all offline contents, deleted all history, cleared cookies but still have no luck.</div></div><hr />

You should check with your network admin to see if your permissions have been changed for internet access at the network level (i.e. on the proxy server).  The problem may not be with your PC at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">25th October 2002, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Andrew, I dont know what did they do... I guess they restore back my Super-Power :p might have changed some Windows Domain Properties or something.<br />
<br />
You need to contact your network and desktop administrators and let them handle it.</div></div><hr />
