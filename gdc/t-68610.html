<br />
I have a weird situation on Xtreme portal. Despite the fact we have paid the maintenance invoices in time, the support is no longer active.<br />
<br />
Did anyone had this situation ? How to deal with it ? The Global support refuses to discuss it.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

Do you have direct maintenance agreement with Infor or via Partner? You can write to my mail vk@iplc.ru.</div></div><hr />

I know we have had some issues before, but nothing like this.</div></div><hr />
