<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">8th February 2010, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Department is being moved and we have quite of bit of old Baan documents.  We have several sets of Baan Training spiral-bound books (the ones that came in the cardboard lunchbox style boxes) and an entire set of documentation in Baan three-ring binders circa 1996.  I can't see the need for them as we are 10+ years into an installation, but wondered if anyone had any thoughts on if we should try to keep it.  I do reference some of the tools books occasionally so I will probably keep those, but thinking I should toss the rest.  Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
I did happen to find a few of the old Baan training post-it note pads and scratch pads.  Those are definately keepers!</div></div><hr />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I know I eliminated some of mine several years ago - they just no longer resembled what we were running since baan had changed so much from 4c3 to 4c4. Some of the older stuff might really confuse someone - I do think it is nice of you to offer first.</div></div><hr />
