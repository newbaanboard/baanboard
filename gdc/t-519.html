<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamapollo</div><div class="date">1st December 2001, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">My company is co-locating with another company that runs BaaN A&amp;D 4C. This co-location is unique in that the 2 companies desire to share services in some areas (purchasing, mfg,shipping) under a common overhead rate structure yet have the ability to segrsgate the finances in order to report P&amp;Las 2 seperate companies. In other words act as 2 seperate companies living together and sharing services under a common rate structure. In our initial meetings with the (BaaN) host company the financial people and IT staff believed that the proper approach would be to run under one instance of BaaN, use the dimension features to provide the detail necessary to cull out the finances. After a more thorough examination the finance people discovered that the menon feature did not provide the single solution global discriminator that they needed to create 2 sets of books in the backend. For example: we desire the ability to enable  purchasing to place a single purchase order for mixed jobs of both companies without losing the segregation in the GL. <br />
I'm looking for people or recommendations of others who have any experience with company consolidations under BaaN for the purpose participating in a round table discussion  determine the best approach for this project. Formal requests have already been sent to BSP and  few others but I'm open for suggestions. <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

However when I see your problem, my first reaction is to create 2 financial companies, linked to one logistic company. Your single Purchase order can be shared for your 2 financial companies, but not one single PO line (at least not directly). I f you need any assistance just mail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">3rd December 2001, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">The solution posted by &quot;invensys user&quot; is correct in terms of Baan functionality.  It is termed &quot;multi-financial/single-logistic&quot;.  However that configuration is somewhat rare and you may have some trouble finding examples where it has been implemented before for guidance.  That is opposed to &quot;single-financial/multi-logistic&quot;, which is much more common and includes a set of standard Baan documentatrion outlining how to configure your logical tables.<br />
<br />
If you cannot find a good example for the above for guidance, then I would suggest for &quot;Plan B&quot; would be to create two seperate companies.  The first would be &quot;single/single&quot; and the second would be &quot;single-financial/multi-logistic&quot;.  This &quot;third logistic company&quot; would be your overall demand planning companyu (the fact that it is linked to one of tghe companies should be irrevelant.  creating a third &quot;single/single&quot; would be another option).  All purchasing would take place from this thir company, which would be the overall suplier to the first two cokmpanies.  This way you could aggregate demand in one place for purchasing and tracking.<br />
<br />
I have set up similar systems before both for purchasing and sales.  It is not too difficult and offers some tracking advantages as well as making the assimilation of future organizations easier.<br />

It really depends on your requirements to make a well thought decision.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">3rd December 2001, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Does Baan have a &quot;standard&quot; list of logical tables available for &quot;multi-financial/single-logistic&quot; available on help the same way it does for &quot;single-financial/multi-logistic&quot;?  If so, it would help setup a great deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">invensys user</div><div class="date">3rd December 2001, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I've attached a list of tables/ modules shared for a financial company, not beeing the group company. Group company is the financial group company, and the logistic company as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamapollo</div><div class="date">3rd December 2001, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I appreciate the response here but does the A&amp;D version limit my options? <br />
The version we are running is BaaN 4.03C with A&amp;D 2.2B and it is currently set up as a single log/single fin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">3rd December 2001, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">The A&amp;D 2.2 version does effect how you do table sharing.  I have clients that have run into this.  I have discussed the general topic with them but due to the work I was doing for them never got into the detail of which specific tables could be shared.<br />
