We are looking to use riverbed as a tool to improve our Baan performance across our WAN connection.  Has anyone had experience with this tool?  If so, i would really appreciated if you could contact me at ecartier@junoltg.com.<br />

Thanks!<br />

Elaine, Did you receive any feedback about riverbed/BAAN ?<br />
Could you share it with me ? <br />
We are using baan for a couple of years (10) and we are introducing some riverbed appliances on some of our branch offices to optimize LAN to LAN traffic. We would like to make sure that baan traffic is also optimized...<br />
Do you have any value for % of optimization for baan traffic?<br />
<br />
I leave my PM if anyone which to drop some valuable information: carlos.franco at efacec.pt.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Carlos Franco</div></div><hr />
