<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ehabos</div><div class="date">3rd June 2002, 12:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome to Nazdaq's newsletter, with updates about our utilities for Baan <br />
<br />
<br />
New Product - Baan Hot Link<br />
<br />
This new product from Nazdaq allows users to access files on the network from within Baan Maintain Sessions.<br />
<br />
For example, while maintaining an item in Maintain Item Data you can access its AutoCAD drawing, Ms-Word Specifications, MS-Excel Costing Data and JPG photo, all in a click of a mouse.<br />
<br />
This easy to configure product makes it easy to link any Baan entity with related files on the network. The product can be activated from any Baan Session, without touching the source code. Linking Baan Data to Files on the network is automatically done using mapping schemes, based on different company naming conventions.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Version of B2Win<br />
<br />
The popular B2Win product for taking output from Baan into Excel and Word is released in a new version - B2Win 3.5<br />
<br />
This new version is much more easy to install and maintain for system administrators. It does not require defining the Excel and Word path for every single user. B2Win will automatically launch the applications.<br />
<br />
The new version includes a Macro that allows you to add your company logo to Word Documents, and the ability to attach a customized macro for Excel Sheets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Extended functionality of B2Email<br />
<br />
You can mail an output to yourself with just a click and send faxes with automatically generated coversheets in B2Email Plus 3.0<br />
<br />
The B2Email Standard and Mail-Merge products continue to get improved to match different needs<br />
<br />
<br />
Strategic partnership with TriNET <br />
<br />
Nazdaq has announced a strategic partnership with TriNET, a Baan services Alliance member. TriNET will implement NazdaqÂ’s solutions for Baan customers in North America. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you are interested in our products but would like to get local support, please contact us and we will recommend a local Baan Value Added Partner in your area.<br />
