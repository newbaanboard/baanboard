I'm currently working in Infor LN v10.5, on an ERP implementation that's due to go live in a few weeks.<br />
Previously I'm from an IBM AS/400 background and our team has been developing a number of interfaces to connect our AS/400 into the new LN system, using custom BODs transported through ION.<br />
It's been a challenging learning curve, getting into 4GL and developing DLLs as well as Custom BODs, also configuring a complex ION setup with connection points going out to third party servers as well as our own AS/400.<br />
Initially the systems will run in parallel and exchange data as LN takes over some of the AS/400's tasks in the manufacturing area of the business.<br />
Hopefully I can share some experiences on this forum, together with knowledge that we have gained, as we go through the live implementation.<br />
Cheers<br />
