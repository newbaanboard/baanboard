<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">3rd August 2006, 03:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The announcements says: &quot;...Infor, the fastest growing enterprise software company in the world, now has annual revenues totaling $2.1 billion, offices in 100 countries and approximately 70,000 customers -- more than InforÂ’s two largest competitors combined in its target markets.   In addition, the company has the largest number of customers in the fastest growing segment of the market: mid-size companies...&quot;<br />
<br />
Looks like SAP and Oracle are not in this race.  <br />
<br />
I wonder if and where Baan fits in ?<br />
<br />
It will again (still) be interesting to watch and wait !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dev099</div><div class="date">3rd August 2006, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Having checked the websites under the solutions links the only 2 products that are listed are ERP LN and LX. All the other solutions are general info only with no product names(unless I missed them)<br />
<br />
I would take that to mean LN and LX are here to stay and everything else is under review.</div></div><hr />
