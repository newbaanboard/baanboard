<br />
Not sure General Discussion is the right place to post my Q.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have been told to explore on how we can deploy BaaN for blind people. There are softwares like screen readers out of those most popular is JAWS. But the problem with JAWS is, it just reads keyboard strokes for BaaN whereas it should read field name/menu name too.<br />
<br />
Has anybody came across similar kind of requirement or has anybody any idea on this?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards,<br />

I was just going across the features of software - JAWS .<br />
<br />
<br />
• Supports Internet Explorer with special features: links lists, frames lists, forms mode, reading HTML tables and graphic labels and more.<br />
• Includes a unique scripting language for further customization with nonstandard Windows applications and proprietary software. <br />
• New tools for easier customization without the need to write scripts.<br />

<br />
It can Read IE - Hence you could try with Webtop.<br />

They provide employment to people with disabilities so they may have experience with this issue.</div></div><hr />
