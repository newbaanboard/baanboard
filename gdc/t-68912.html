&quot;An open technology stack to run on any infrastructure<br />
<br />
Infor LN is built on a unique virtualized architecture that enables you to run the same ERP on a variety of hardware platforms and operating systems, giving you maximum flexibility for how you choose to deploy and manage your operations.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Does this mean, LN development will be done on Open Source like VC++ in years to come. I do understand, that this might be very absurd of idea, but look at it from Infor's perspective.<br />
The tile based UI matched with MS-CRM, so somewhere in the architecture the system is supporting the .Net code for sure.<br />
Migrating to Open Source would surely improve LNs brand value, and help them getting into different sectors.<br />
<br />
Few Advantages<br />
A) They get Lacs of developers instead of select few.<br />
B) Porting becomes easy<br />
C) The ERP will now have more global recognition to compete with SAPs and Saleforce etc. Functionalities ported in say NAV can now be ported to LN too.<br />
<br />
Disadvantage:<br />
A) Customised deployments might be difficult to migrate initially.<br />
B) Transitions without LN to say C++ compilers will be tough.<br />
<br />
What does it mean for a typical Baan developer.<br />
1) I hope it is not true, but you will now be competing the Open World.<br />
2) The DALs and DAL2s might remain the same, till some day INFOR deicides to migrate them too.<br />
3) Reporting would be much better with Open world tools.<br />
<br />
Would need opinions if the landscapes are really changing and if these are signs of things to come.</div></div><hr />
