One of my customers was checking out their products and asked me what I thought, but I have heard rumors that they are not doing well.<br />

Any insights?<br />

One of our customers had  a contract with Luminux to have a system analysis done every so many months. However they received notification a couple of weeks ago that Luminux would cease all activities and that their business would be taking over by Baan Support. <br />
<br />
If I am not mistaken, there is a new link on the Baan Support website called optimization tools and I cannot remember that seeing before. So I can only guess that this new section would be an entry point for the former Luminux tools.</div></div><hr />
