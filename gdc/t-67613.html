We face lot of issues in Baan4c like problems in WIP mismatch,not reflecting correct position,lack of average costs etc.So in these respects is SAP better over Baan?<br />

I have never worked with SAP, but I am sure it will have its own issues in the code - it could be wip, etc.  I do know Oracle EBS is more complicated that BaaN - again with its own set of issues at times.</div></div><hr />

Hello, The problem you maybe facing is that no one has actually sat down and gone through all the problems in this area, I believe.  Their maybe fixes available for some of your issues.<br />
<br />
I use to code in all areas of Baan, and had to back port solutions for some customers it was more like sticky tape and plastic solutions, ie only fix the bug reported as the customer didn't want all the solutions.  <br />
1. I would either upgrade and thoroughly test before you use any new system.<br />
2. Or create an internal personalisation, get a GOOD coder to go through all the problems and fixes them and the user team keeps testing.<br />
This depends on how much system code you have, ie if you software code for debug available.<br />
<br />
best regards</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sameer.don</div><div class="date">14th August 2015, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, I have worked on both Baan (Almost 6 years) and SAP (4 years) as a developer and interacted a lot with users/functional consultants. <br />
If you want to compare between Baan and SAP, it would be fair to compare between Baan IVc4 &lt;=&gt; SAP 4.6  and ERP LN &lt;=&gt; SAP ECC6.<br />
<br />
But, trust me, SAP ECC6 is far more evolved in terms of functionality as well as technical architecture than ERP LN. It provides just too many options on platter. And being a developer or a functional you don't have to break your head working on small things. Instead one just needs to focus on the Business need and the solution.<br />
<br />
However, the huge list of options makes it difficult to troubleshoot. If you miss out a single configuration, sometimes it may take ages to identify. Such incidents can cause similar problems what we get with Baan/ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Baan IVc4  v/s  SAP 4.6 :<br />
Both are equally stable and users face issues on equal frequency. Just like Baan needs to be patched with solutions, SAP 4.6 needs to be patched with &quot;Notes&quot;. I have observed that number of issues are almost the same.<br />
<br />
ERP LN vs SAP ECC6<br />
Surly SAP surpasses ERP LN in all terms. Things work smooth and with higher consistency in SAP ECC6.<br />
Requires less frequent updates through Notes, though there are too many notes provided to meet customer needs.</div></div><hr />

I think, that you compare old LN fp3 with SAP ECC6. But if you compare ECC6 with LN 10.4, your results will be different.<br />
We evaluate ECC6 and LN for Automotive and IE&amp;M companies. LN always has more functionality for Automotive (for example Assembly control), and now has more features for A&amp;D and Project industry. In terms of platform, ES 10.4.1 is a fully different product, than old ES. And LN UI + Ming.le user interface is a very customer friendly.</div></div><hr />
