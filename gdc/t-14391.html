<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doclee</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 01:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to hear from anyone (Baan customer) who implemented a third party Quality s/w (such as iBaanTQM (Guardess), TIPQA, Pilgrim, etc.) interfacing with BaanIVc4.  Whether it was a successful one or a major disappointment, I'd like to hear.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hpadode</div><div class="date">14th June 2007, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I think baan QMS tool is quite powerful. For further enhancment or customisation in the standard module will be a good buy rather than going for a 3rd party interface. There are many compaies which provide the customisation on standard baan. I think this will be more benificial .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QA_TIP</div><div class="date">15th June 2007, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Paying for customization may provide you with functionality you desire, but it will be static and expensive and with the lead time for the customization, your process may have already evolved. Since Quality and Business processes are continuously improving, going with an Off the Shelf solution that is being maintained and kept current in the long run will be a far batter way to go.</div></div><hr />
