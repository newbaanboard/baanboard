<br />
It's been more than 10 years since I last visited this board and I am happily surprised to see my account is still active. <br />
Wondering if anyone of the old crew is still around. Patrick still running this place?<br />
<br />
As for the reasons for my return, I recently switched to the wonderful world of self employment, bringing my MS Dynamics skills to the market. Wouldn't you know, I have a meeting on Monday with a prospect about a Baan-job. Needless to say that my knowledge after 10 years is as rusty as ...uhhh...something that's really really old and rusty. So I came here for a brief refresher course and to see if the community is still active.<br />
<br />
Glad to find it alive an kicking, because if all goes well on Monday you can expect a lot of dumb questions from me in the near future untill I get  back at my old level. Or maybe it's like being a bike and I'll just pedal my way through it as soon as they put me behind a bshell once again.<br />
<br />
Either way....hello to all.</div></div><hr />

Good luck on Monday.  PS - we just switched to Oracle EBS this past January. But I am still hanging around.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately they decided to keep looking for someone with fresh knowledge. If anyone happens to be in the market for a long term freelance contract in the Utrecht area (Netherlands), I'll be happy to refer you. Just give me a ping at francesco@frenco.nl.<br />
<br />
I guess my return was short-lived, so all the best to you and maybe see you in another 10 years ;)</div></div><hr />
