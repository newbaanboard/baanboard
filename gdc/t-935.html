<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Look at http://inforum.baan.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">11th February 2002, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we thought about it a good while but for us baanboard guys, the whole event is too expensive to pay out of our own pockets. And we did plan to make special Baanboard T-shirts and walk around in them! So there will be no 'official' baanboard representation :( But any promotion at the conference by our visiting members would be much appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">11th February 2002, 20:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I will definitely encourage people to visit the best Baan Board around!<br />
<br />
(and I am trying to arrange my travel to extend to Belgium to visit the FAMOUS patvdv!)<br />

<br />
Thanks for the promo help :) You are most welcome in Belgium! Euh, famous? Just a hard working Baan fella will do :) *nudges Jim*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a way for those who go to inForum to get a baanboard t-shirt?<br />
I will definitely be there.  It will be great for all bb supports to meet in Rome and to have a nice glass of good Italian wine.<br />
Just to celibrate La Dolce Vita!!!<br />

I've stopped counting the amount of people I've met that say they have met you, talked to you, got a t-shirt with your pic on....<br />
<br />
Might be going to Rome, not sure yet, but any UK people should be considering going to the BaanUsers UK conference the week after up in Warrington (not as plush as Rome, but must have been visited by the Romans at one time). Check out www.baanusers.co.uk for the agenda and details....<br />
<br />
And Pat, send over some t-shirts for Baanboard and I'll try and get a few out (even wear one myself after I have finished wearing my 'fcuk sap' t-shirt :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 20:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we'll see what we can do where t-shirts are concerned :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 21:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I just want to let everyone know that as far as Tshirts go, orange is not my color :D<br />
<br />
At the last BWU show all of the Baan people were in suits.  Do y'all think that conferences in Europe will be more business attire versus casual?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">20th February 2002, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">So when's the first Baanboard conference / social event? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 14:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually thats a great idea. Would you mind Pat if we held an informal meeting of the UK Baanboard people sometime?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it just have to be the UK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">21st February 2002, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
That's a good idea! But I agree with James' comment: why not make it a global event?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">24th February 2002, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, firstly a meeting of minds for the countries would be a start, and then lets face it, globally where would it be held, which company would pay for their baan people to pop off to it for a jolly etc.... <br />
<br />
A global one would be nice but would be one hell of a planning nightmare... and who of us has the time to start planning that (Unless its held at your house pat!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">25th February 2002, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Most conferences have a place where messages can be posted.  Perhaps we can simply put a note on that board saying where and when a Baanboard group will be meeting for lunch, dinner, drinks, or whatever.  <br />
