How many AS/400 Baan users in Europe? I am just curious. I know in North America our self and one more User. I would like to build relationship with rest of AS/400 Baan users by that we can address our &quot;AS/400-Baan problems&quot; collectively to SSA.<br />
<br />
Please respond.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in Europe seem to be much more people using the AS/400 (or noe iSeries) as the platform for Baan. What problems do you get? Which problems are not handled correctly by SSA? Do you have a summary?<br />
<br />
Bye, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garfield ruhr</div><div class="date">30th June 2004, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi mraguthu,<br />
<br />
1) Support eye is not working on AS400. OK, that is true.<br />
<br />
2) tmboaserver. Is this true? I am not sure about this but never tested it by myself.<br />
<br />
3) What do you mean by running more than one job scheduler for a company? You can start multiple job daemon, you can start multiple jobs at the same time scheduled by the AS400 scheduler. So it depends on what you want to do and then there is a solution to get what you want in the job area.<br />
<br />
Let us continue to discuss.<br />

<br />
We are using Baan 5c on an AS400 (820 iseries) in Italy. We have been live since Jan 2002. We also have Baan world (boaserver does not run for us in job mode either!).<br />
Our main problem however is sizing..does anyone have any guidelines for sizing of an AS400. We have huge performance problems.<br />
Also regarding table cleaning of temp files.<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from some other 'poo' AS400 users soon.<br />
<br />
Shaun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garfield ruhr</div><div class="date">1st July 2004, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Shaun,<br />
<br />
so there is also an AS400 user in Italy. Nice.<br />
<br />
What do you mean with &quot;tables cleaning of temp files&quot;? What is not cleaned? Maybe we have a problem and do not know.<br />
<br />
Bye,<br />
<br />
Garfield :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mraguthu</div><div class="date">1st July 2004, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Garfield ruhr,<br />
I know I can run multiple jobs through AS/400 jobs, but the problem is each AS/400 job consumes a license. That is the reason why we would like to run multiple job demons in same company. Baan said that we couldnt run more than one Job demon in one company.<br />
<br />
Other issues we have:<br />
1)	Open World issues: We are using MQ Series instead of XML connector. We would like to open multiple ports/multiple bus components. But no luck we able to succeeded in only one. (But through XML connector we can open more than 5 ports as per as I know)<br />
2)	Since tmboaserver is not running under job mode, we are running in fore ground and appointed a helpdesk person to watch that session to see error or fatal errors. If we have any tool to run under background and notify those errors, we dont need to spend one person for this. (We get 1500 Sales orders every day through OW)<br />
3)	Not all Unix commands are working in QSH<br />
4)	Some have Convert runtime session not working. Always I have to use create run time session.<br />
<br />
Shaun,<br />
We recently brought 840 AS/400 Machine, and migrated our Baan from 730 AS/400 to 840 AS/400. So far we didnt find any performance issues. If you find the info about Data sizing please let me know. That also help to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garfield ruhr</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mraguthu,<br />
<br />
nice issues.<br />
<br />
I still have a problem in understanding the job problems you have. A licence is taken by a bshell. So if you run several job daemon then you have multiple bshells and you consume multiple licences. The Jobdaemon is designed to get the jobs serialized. Only one job is running at the same time. If you want to start multiple jobs for one comapny at the same time then you can use the scheduler of the AS400 machine. Then the bshell is also only running while the job is executed and the licence is only used for that time. Multiple bshells also means parallel processing if you have more than one CPU.<br />
<br />
About the MQ I have no experience. According to the second redbook of Baan on AS400 this should work.<br />
<br />
OK, QSH is a product of IBM. So the most needed commands are implemented. Which ones are missing? Several of the functionalities of the missing commands can be created with the available commands in a script.<br />
<br />
For all convert to runtime sessions there must be a flag about the items to handle. If this flag does not exist then the convert is not running. So our experience is that the convert does not run if you do something next to the sessions. What says the support about this?<br />
<br />
Bye and greetings,<br />

<br />
Regarding the problem of cleaning files, there doesnt seem to be any documentation of where baan writes its temp files when running on an AS400.<br />
We have found several temp folders on AS400 which seem to contain the temp printer files, however we see that our hard disks are filling up constantly and there must be other temp files created that we are unaware of.<br />
<br />
When mentioning the sizing of the AS, we also require some information on tuning when using Baan......does this documentation exist?<br />
<br />
By the way......do i know you?.... ;) <br />

<br />
What is the configuration of your 840?...what cpw do you have? How many users do you have and how much disk space are u using?<br />
<br />
It would be nice to chat maybe at some point regarding your experiences and ours.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I am sorry for late reply. We have long weekend and yesterday was very busy day for us.<br />
I am giving full details of my Baan and AS/400 configuration as separate enclosures. How big your system is? what are the Baan and AS/400 configurations on your system. You can send the info through e-mail if you wantmraguthu@hotmail.com. I am happy to chat with you and share the issues or successes.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
