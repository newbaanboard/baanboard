<br />
Are we geeks?  Of course not :) but I'm sure my girlfriend will argue otherwise.:mad: <br />
<br />
What are the interests of the peoples here?  Reading 4GL code at bedtime?  Or do you sit by your outdoor pool, (with cocktail),  on some sunny island, using a top notch laptop to remotely access your server from your WAP phone?</div></div><hr />

My hobbies involve anything dealing with computers (especially Linux).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently, geek is a genectic improvement on the human genome system. As technology becomes more important in day to day society, the need for understanding becomes more important. Those that understand will, of course, become more powerful, i.e. Bill Gates. This also is shown with the more geekie style of lifestyle becoming more influencial over time, with more Star Wars/Trek programs appearing and technology appearing more in other programs. Eventually this will lead to a re-evaluating of many historical documents, the greatest retelling of all will be....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there may actually be a difference. A geek can be geek but still appear not to be, in appearance and attitude. They can just be geekie about certain things. <br />
A nerd, however, looks like a nerd and is visible from afar. Also a nerd maynot know all about his subject, just the really boring bits that can kill a conversation in seconds....<br />
<br />
However, we have to be careful about this before we get into the treker/trekie syndrome..... ie<br />
<br />
A treker may wonder what *** in zero gravity is like<br />
A trekie wonders what *** is like</div></div><hr />

How do you categorize and define those sort of people? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">This reminds me of a conversation I had a few days ago about increasing the image of female Baan users and techies by having a calender made called Bikini Baan Babes.... As you can guess, it did not go down to well.<br />
<br />
However, any Baanettes out there wanting to get known can contact myself about the auditions for the photoshoot.. ;)</div></div><hr />

You know how things are, over time things just seem to always be there and are part of your life... Mine is a dancing purple dinosaur... And don't get me started on Pokemon.... :p <br />

<br />
But that doesn't make me a geek... it makes me a father (okay, so sometimes I want to pull the dinosaurs head off, but thats life)</div></div><hr />

Maybe the term is too geeky. But anyway, you know, like doing the ironing, reading a magazine and watching Eastenders all at the same time :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
After all, I opened up the door to the refridgerator, but it was me who filled up with out of date food and strange meats from the deli counter. <br />

Erm, should have slept more last night, either that or its that Friday feeling.....</div></div><hr />

At least I don't need a makeup job to fit in... I've always looked better than Mark Walburg...Warburg.. Markie Mark or Tim Roth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I suspect that the last two posts are a direct result of eating the out of date food and not sleeping....dosen't that tell you something?????? <br />

Quit your havering and go do some work!:)</div></div><hr />

I can post this kind of madness and still work! I don't have to talk to my neighbours about last nights TV or how they look 'positively glowing' in that new shade of makeup....<br />
<br />
No, men sit down, work hard, type rubbish on forums, eat bad food and don't need sleep...... <br />

<br />
Look up Huntsville, AL on the web...we ARE the land of the geeks.  Rocket scientists everywhere you turn.  5 to 1 male/female ratio.  Highest per capita master's degrees in the US.  Boring people!!!  Most are considered geeks because of their personality, not their techie quirks.  And, yes, most are men around here.  The true find is a techie with a personality!!!  A good one, that is!  :) <br />
<br />
I'm new to the Baan world, but if it's anything like the PSoft arena, I'd say consultants are the best of both worlds...personality + techie capabilities.</div></div><hr />
