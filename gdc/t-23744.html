<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 02:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder what SSA would like us to think about this press release.  It seems old news to me. Telair was touted as a LN success story from day one of the official release. I think it was probalby a beta site (may have been a Invensys/Baan customer sale.)<br />
<br />
In an SSA glossy dated August 2004, Telair were quoted as as saying: &quot;SSA ERP-LN has enabled us to gain attractive return on investment, deliver real time information...&quot;. There was also a customer testomonial by Telair on the implementation dated 2004 where they testified that: &quot;The implementation was a breeze. We were able to just install SSA ERP LN6.1 and begin running data with it.&quot; <br />
<br />
I think brochure may be announcing the implementation of some additional branch operations around the world. In another SSA brochure or seminar presentation Telair were shown to be moving to a centralised AS400/iseries box in the US rather than run on remote hardware at the various business sites around the world. (This strategy made think I was young again)   <br />
<br />
I would like to see brochures with some new names to convince us that the figure of less than 150 sites world-wide that have either installed or actively undertaking an implementation project for LN is incorrect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Interestingly, about 50% of these 150 sites running LN 6.1 today are either SSA BAAN Solution Partners or SSA local offices.<br />
<br />
Out of the remaining 75 'customer' sites less than 10% are new customers to SSA BAAN. The rest has been migrated from a lower version.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthil</div><div class="date">23rd April 2005, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
We have started evaluating SSA ERP 6.1Ln, Installed SSA ERP installation was succesful whereas we could not start becos of Process product request in maintenance-only mode.  We want to evaluate under 30 days demo period(normally Baan provides).<br />
<br />
We configured Licensed manager and is it possible to use SSA ERP under demo mode for 30 days or we have to get validation key from support centre.<br />
<br />
Please reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is better you ask that question directly with your BAAN Support Center.<br />

<br />
Is this problem solved?<br />
<br />
We have similar problem. We can work with SSA ERP LN 6.1 using BW client (set NO_WORKTOP). If we try to connect to application through worktop bclm server reported error that cannot request product in maintenance-only mode</div></div><hr />
