<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dkulikow</div><div class="date">24th March 2006, 23:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for a programmers quiz or test that others may use to test the abilities of applicants.  Basically, that would show how relational database work and basic program examples.  Baan used to have all the programmers take a similar test to be on the development teams.  This is what I'm looking for.<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I wish I could remember some of the questions microsoft asked - they were very interesting. Of course if it was a Baan test I would probably fail.  Since I never create anything new and have to always look things up. :)</div></div><hr />
