<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">10th September 2004, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi you all!  Long time since I've been on the board, but internet in South Africa is still a long way off from what you guys/girls are used to in Europe and the US.  (For the rest of the world I can not comment, since I haven't been there yet  :o )  But, I'm sort of back on the board now... since I'm not actively involved in Baan at this point in time, factual postings will be few and might even contain errors  :eek: <br />
<br />
Since it's Friday, lets have some HUMOR! (Pat, if you're read this: maybe we can start a forum for good, clean humor?) We're back in SA now for 9 months, and it's great to be a South African again!  It's a great country, and the weather is just perfect (springtime, you know!)  Some more reasons why the country is great:<br />
<br />
<br />
 You can eat raw, half dried meat and not be considered disgusting.<br />
 Nothing is your fault, you can blame it all on apartheid.<br />
 You get to buy a new car every 3 months and the insurance company pays for it!<br />
 You can experience bad service in eleven official languages.<br />
 Where else can you get oranges with 45% alcohol content at rugby matches?<br />
 It's the only country in the world where striking workers show how angry they are by dancing.<br />
 You're considered clumsy if you cannot: use a cell phone (without car kit), change CDs, drink a beer, put on make-up, read the newspaper and smoke, all at the same time while driving a car at 160 kph in a 60 kph zone.<br />
 If you live in Johannesburg, you get to brag about living in the most dangerous city in the world.<br />
 Burglar bars become a feature, and a great selling point for your house.<br />
 You can decorate your garden walls with barbed wire.<br />
 The tow-trucks are the first on the scene for most major crimes, without being called. The police you have to call about three times.<br />
 Votes are recounted until the right party wins.<br />
 Illegal immigrants leave the country because the crime rate is too high.<br />
 The police ask you if they must follow up on the burglary you've just reported.<br />
 It the country where a murderer gets a 6 month sentence and a pirate TV viewer 2 years.<br />
 The prisoners strike(!) and get to vote in elections!<br />
 Police cars are fitted with immobilisers and gearlocks!<br />
 The police stations have panic buttons to call armed response when they are burgled.<br />
<br />
<br />
 :D Enjoy your Friday!</div></div><hr />

Luckily for you it's spring over there. It's near the end of the summer over here (but still 27C!). Anyway, feel free to drown us in some good jokes and light-hearted messages :D</div></div><hr />
