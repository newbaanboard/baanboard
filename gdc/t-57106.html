Does anyone have a request form that they could share as we attempt to build one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I know the comapany &quot;Azteka&quot; (http://www.azteka.de/ offers a solution for IT service management, which completely runs in ERP LN. I've seen the product presentation at the last meeting of the &quot;German Baan Users Group&quot; which was quite interesting.<br />
<br />
Of course a self made solution sometimes may be better...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd November 2009, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we use a less formal process. We have process owners for each major area - like finance, shop floor, inventory, etc.  Each of these teams have an IT rep on them - so that is how we get what to work on.  A sister site actually has a form that gets completed and routed around.  All it really contains is the suggested change and areas for sign off.  We are working on how we will eventually standardize across the organization.  This will probably be in our maximo system, but not sure at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">13th November 2009, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the help.  Historically if someone put in a request it was done regarless of any sort of basic ROI or any review by that person's supervisor.  With the economic slowdown our staffing has been (like most places) reduced and I am trying to develop a simple process to filter out requests that do not add value.  It will be a big culture change so I'm trying to start small.  I'd like to put more responsibiltiy on the submitter to prove the actual benefit of the request and to think about why it has to be done (time saver, regulator requirement, etc.).  I was just trying to see what other companies had.  Thank you for your input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a situation that is more common than you think.  Request often go from the User straight to IT without a ROI or even proper requirements leaving the person in IT to figure it out.<br />
<br />
I have been in this situation at several companies and have developed procedures. i would be willing to share my experience.  If you would like to meet, I'll be in your area this month and we can discuss this further.</div></div><hr />
