Any updated information on the progress?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">17th January 2008, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - it looks like there doesn't happen a lot. It would be nice to know if someone already develops solutions using the Infor Open SOA. Where are the &quot;best-practice scenarios&quot;?</div></div><hr />

A restricted release of Infor ERP LN FP4 will be delivered by june/july 2008 with Full SOA enabled for early adoption customers. By end of 2008 ERP LN FP5 will be General available with SOA Proof of concept.<br />
<br />
Contact local infor ERP LN sales or support for more information. A FAQ will be sent to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">4th February 2008, 02:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice to hear your feedback! narayana_vvss. Maybe you can consider to publish the FAQ on baanboard.<br />
<br />
It is nice to know that financial statement module is ported to LN. <br />
<br />
But do you mean that FP4 will not be general available?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">narayana_vvss</div><div class="date">5th February 2008, 23:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not have FAQ with me. You can get it from Infor sales people of your country. Just send a mail, they will send u.<br />
<br />
FP4 will be restricted release in july 2008 i think. any customer can take it. Infact they are inviting customers to take part of it. So that they can start with FP4(now any way FP5) in july and finally get GA product with some more functionalities at end of 2008.<br />
<br />
Mean while their feedback will be taken into standard along with FP5.<br />
<br />
if you have any customers you can contact infor LN Sales. If you are really serious give me your mail is i can give you contact information. Because they want to sign these customers with in next 2/3 months.<br />
<br />
Also i FP4/5 will come with built in Enterprise reporting tools for ERP LN with out having dependency with Cognos etc..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seriously wonder whether Infor Open SOA can survive in this world.<br />
The global Service Oriented Architecture market is dominated by super powers like IBM (Websphere), Microsoft (BizTalk), BEA (Weblogic) and Tibco. The market is consolidating as Oracle just purchased BEA and rumours are that Tibco is next.<br />
An implementation of an enterprise wide SOA platform has a major impact on organizations and is much more complex than just implementing an ERP system. Typically it is a lot more expensive, takes longer to implement and there is absolutely no plug-and-play in this business.<br />
<br />
In the past, BAAN customers were promised the &quot;world&quot; with BAAN Open World and look what happened to that one ...<br />
<br />
Let's wait and see what happens :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tritonbaan</div><div class="date">6th February 2008, 02:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Edwin that Infor Open SOA, which is base on Sonic ESB, has minimal market in the enterprise wide SOA deployment. Infor Open SOA has  value for integration Baan software with other Infor software. Due to the delay of Infor SOA, one of our customers finally gives up to use Infor SupplyWeb solution. <br />
<br />
The market of SOA should go to IBM, Microsoft, Oracle,SAP or even MuleSource. Personally, I suggest Microsoft Biztalk after Microsoft revised the pricing on Biztalk server, although I think it will be perfect if Microsoft can come out a solution for master data management.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">18th March 2008, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Anything new about this topic? We have asked LN sales for SOA related information but they didn't reply... Also I haven't seen Infor at the CEBIT - anyone?</div></div><hr />
