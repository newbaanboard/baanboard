<br />
I see two areas:  Baan Jobs that fail, and need corrective attention.<br />
Sessions that generate error messages. <br />
<br />
Other. <br />
<br />
I thought, for jobs, that I would need.<br />
<br />
a) Job name<br />
b) Job Schedule<br />
c) Brief Description<br />
d) Key department - user and contact information<br />
e) step number and name<br />
f) Error message and actions to take<br />
g) When to escalate.<br />
<br />
Have I left things out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">29th January 2005, 00:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Why distinguish between jobs and sessions?<br />
<br />
After all, a job is nothing but an automated session.<br />
Better categories would be functional vs technical, or use the same method that BGS uses and divi it up in tools, warehouse, distribution, manufacturing, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">29th January 2005, 01:59</div></div><div class="posttext">What I am after is operational documentation. That is,<br />
What does the job do, (description)?<br />
What is it's run schedule?<br />
Who are the key recipients/users?<br />
What are the recovery procedures to do subject to job conditions.<br />
Now, a job has steps or sessions.<br />
Sessions have error messages, and we need to know what or how to process the error message.<br />
<br />
Sessions may appear in different jobs, ergo, we need to document at the session level.<br />
<br />
I was asking if there are other things that I need to create as a table of contents, or as a set of forms, (either electronic or on paper).<br />
