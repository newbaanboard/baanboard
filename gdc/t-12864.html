Even if your employer demands it and promises to return it to you after you finish the job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Do not use your right forefinger (pointer finger) in pointing to anything or anyone. User your thumb instead. This finger is use in muslim's prayer to profess their faith to One God, Allah.<br />
<br />
2. Do not stand-up to offer your seat when someone comes in.<br />
<br />
3. When walking with your wives and daugther, do not walk behind them.<br />
<br />
4. Use your righthand when receiving or passing something.<br />
<br />
5. Do not shake hands with woman.<br />
<br />
6. Greet them with Salam (assalamu alaykum).<br />
<br />
7. Instead of saying &quot;Thank you&quot;, say &quot;May Allah reward you.&quot;<br />
<br />
May you have a product job.<br />
