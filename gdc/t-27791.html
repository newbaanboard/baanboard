<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">4th August 2006, 05:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Have just come across March 30, 2000: Wall Street Journal Europe, and noticed an interesting page 1 article on Baan. &quot;In Default Mode: Low-Tech Manager Reprograms Baan&quot; <br />
<br />
The article discusses troubles within Baan at the time and points out: &quot;...Baan was doubling its sales quarter after quarter...and striking fear into its bigger rivals SAP AG and Oracle Corp..&quot; <br />
<br />
It goes on to say, &quot;...The company's market value once as high as $11 billion (Eur11.3 billion) has slipped to about $1 billion&quot;.  By my reckoning the Eur 11.3 billion would be close to Eur 18 billion in todayÂ’s money. Even in greenbacks it would be about $14 billion. <br />
<br />
Makes Infor look small by comparison and the Mr greenough's insider-purchase price from Invensys of $130million miniscule.<br />

The old gray mare  ain't what she used to be !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manbod</div><div class="date">8th August 2006, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you will find that shortly afterward it was discovered that just maybe the figures were so wrong that Jan was quadruple accounting. Look back at the legal issues. A result was that Mr B was persona non grata in the US and as far as I know still is. You will also find that much of sales revenue was switched in reseller market, and guess who owned many of the resellers. Stock value is a wonderful thing, especially when theres a mug around every corner, like Invensys!!<br />
The old Grey mare is still a Grey Mare, different riders and now facing the front of the horse, maybe</div></div><hr />
