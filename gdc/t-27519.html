<br />
I thought this may of interest to you. It is a study by Gartner showing the biggest five players in the ERP market today.<br />
<br />
The study is based on total software revenue as revenue generated from new licenses, updates, subscriptions and hosting, technical support, and maintenance, but excludes professional services and hardware revenue.<br />
<br />
1. SAP - 28.7%<br />
2. Oracle - 10.2%<br />
3. Sage - 7.4%<br />
4. Microsoft - 3.7%<br />
5. SSA Global - 2.8%<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">7th July 2006, 05:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I think these numbers are very discouraging and may suggest that many of  us may be living in denial of the reality of the market despite the many virtues of the Baan application.  <br />
<br />
These figures show that SSA with its numerous packages have less than 3% of the market (Baan, Triton, Manman/x, MK, BPCS, PRMS + + + ) whereas SAP has 10 times that number with its single package. <br />
<br />
I would be interesting to see the figures for say the next 5 or 10 packages which would probably be in the 2.5% down to 1% range.  All probably more than Baan's share of the market. <br />
<br />
The most depressing aspect is that the figures for 'new' customers would  probably paint a much worse picture. How many genuinely fresh/new sales have there been since SSA got involved - a very small number I would expect, probably not enough to offset the unhooks/losses. <br />
<br />
Whilst Baan has been a wonderful investment for Mr Greenough, I can't see that SSA has done anything to enhance or even maintain the longer term prospects of the of the product.   <br />
<br />
I do not deride Mr Greennough for his investment savvy or his cut-and-run strategy but I am disappointed that the package I have worked with for over 10 years has not been marketed as well as it could have been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RameshS</div><div class="date">8th July 2006, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">But the results GARTNER is sad but it is TRUE that BAAN  has lost its market share.<br />
<br />
for example  LN 6.1 is very good Product but the Localisation as done more harm to BAAN than product competitors in INDIA.  Lots of company wanted to migrate for LN but due to bad publicity of  localisation which SSA created by themselves. All the plans are put in the hold by the new customer  or gone with other ERP vendor. <br />
<br />
Even though some new customer have gone for BAAN IVc which are numbered, and  those gone for SSA LN 6.1 cursing SSA for the mess it had created with localisation for the last two year and only INFOR know when the solutions will be found. <br />
<br />
So New customer is avoiding LN 6.1 in INDIA which has very good base of BAAN IVc,  with only licence of BAAN IVc is only main source of revenue how can the market share can increased with the new customers.<br />
<br />
 It is upto the new management of SSA i.e INFOR to steer the company out of the mess atleast put the BAAN within Number 3 brackets.</div></div><hr />
