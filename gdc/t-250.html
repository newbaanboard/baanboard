<br />
Try Baanboard (http://www.baanboard.com/) for better answers than mine :-).<br />
<br />
And here is what I got:<br />
<br />
YOU HAVE BEEN DENIED ACCESS FOR SPAMMING!  <br />
<br />
I would like to see that thread on this forum.... I will post it in the tools section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">9th October 2001, 00:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, the guy behind Baanfans.com has banned all mention of http://www.baanboard.com. I guess it is a natural reaction and as Baanboard pioneer I do not really care. The philosophy of the two web sites are different and also the way we try to achieve our ends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">11th October 2001, 21:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like you found a new way to spam on one of the other forums. Technically you followed the rules. :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 b*a*a*n*b*o*a*r*d<br />
 bannbaord.com<br />
Of course only for those who would still like to promote Baanboard.com on BaanFans :D</div></div><hr />

I am a resourceful guy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smiffy</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Baanfans seems to be falling apart.  I have just discovered this site and will probably stop using baanfans.  I know that you have been a regular contributor to the site and its a shame that the administrators have blocked you.  It is currently impossible to make a posting and the tools forum doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome aboard Smiffy/Bart Simpson! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frans C</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 21:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard that phone lines and electricity is out in Afghanistan, due to bombings.<br />
<br />
I also received very little real spam since the war started.<br />
<br />
I hereby conclude that most spam came from Afghanistan! :D - real spam that is, not emotional cr*p from someone (some begrudged administrator) who simply label a post as spam...<br />
<br />
Patrick, how about a tools topic (where you don't have to register to post, if possible).<br />
<br />
Vele dank!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Frans,<br />

We have 2 forums dedicated to 'Tools' topics, one for administrators and one for developers. Feel free to post your tools question in the appropriate forum. <br />
<br />
As regards to your question about permission to post with being registration: this we will not allow for the simple reason that we do not want to end up like many other Baan help or forum sites. Registration doesn't cost a thing and it is a little commitment we ask from our members in exchange for a spam and no-nonsense free forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frans C</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Patrick,<br />
<br />
Pardon me for not checking out the board properly - I just found the tools discussions.<br />
<br />
I just wondered if a not-registered user could originate a topic (to get anybody to ask a question), but only registered users could respond (to prevent insults and other garbage).<br />
<br />
I personally have no problem with registering - I already have and that is why I am here.<br />
<br />
BTW, this is a very nice BB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">7th November 2001, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Well nice to be back in the forum and to find out some odd things are happening in the Baan hints and helps community...<br />
<br />
So I'm off to see if I can spam a few other boards</div></div><hr />
