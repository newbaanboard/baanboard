<br />
I'm currently at a customer who loves his Informix (9.4!) database. They're using it under Baan IV, they are migrating to LN (FP5), they want to keep it.<br />
<br />
Now we are facing really big performance problems. We get locking errors all over the place, simple updates on an 8 processor multimegasuperdupermemory server are ten times slower then on my virtual linux machine running in my laptop. We get locking errors when one process updates record A, while another process is updating records B-Z. Except the speed issue (informix log file configuration etc. has been checked and looks ok) this is all very unreproduceable. <br />
<br />
And then I'm reading in the Informix driver technical manual, that the driver can avoid dirty (uncommited) reads only by waiting that all locks on the records to be read are released. (and that the default mode is &quot;read uncommited&quot;, which would be even worse!) Now Baan is doing buffered updates and all that stuff, so it's really hard to tell what happens under the hood. I tried to trace SQL statements today, but with disappointing results.<br />
<br />
So it boils down to one question:<br />
<br />
Is anyout out there using Informix under ERP LN 6.1 FP3 or FP5 in a production environment with &gt; 50 users?<br />
<br />
If so, please, please, drop me a line (you can also send me a private message if you don't want to disclose anything here).<br />
<br />
I would be really glad to get into contact with people using Informix in *reality*, not on test systems.<br />
<br />
