<br />
Can SSA ERP LN be accessed using remote connectivity ? Our SSA ERP LN is installed and running at a central location.<br />
<br />
In the days of hi-tech connectivity option - RF Link, ADSL, DSL, Broadband etc., with speeds touching gigabytes, this option might sound very stupid. <br />
<br />
But we have some plants at very far-flung places. All the telecom service providers have either given up in providing hi-speed connectivity to our plants or have quoted too high costs. Mobile/Cell-phone service is there. But the mobile company too has given up.<br />
<br />
So the only option remaining is dial-up, using land-line.<br />
<br />
Currently, our people use dial-up connectivity just for e-mails. But this connectivity is found to too fickle and too slow and un-reliable. Speed at times is found to be not even 16 KBPS. !!<br />
<br />
If dial-up connectivity problem is resolved, can a user at the site log on to SSA ERP LN directly from the site and work on SSA ERP LN ? Can Webtop work on a dial-up connection, with such a low speed ? What will be the infrastructure required at our central location ?<br />
<br />
Please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">21st March 2006, 08:47</div></div><div class="posttext">My advise would be to install Webtop on the LN server and the people accessing LN would only need a web browser (IE or Mozilla Firefox) to work with the system.<br />
I do not think a dial-up connection would be a problem in your case. The only issue may be if the dial-up users are heavy users in LN and need to pull a lot of data over the line.<br />
The other advantage of installing webtop on the server is that you do not need to install anything on the client side.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
we have an ISDN backup, if the VPN over DSL is down and the people are working on Terminal Server or Citrix. Aspecially Citrix works fine. There you can reach every application you want. <br />
