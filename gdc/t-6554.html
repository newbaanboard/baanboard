Fall Workshop 2002, October 14-17, Los Angeles, California.<br />
<br />
Maybe we can get a chance to meet each other there and also attend those breakout sessions/presentations/discussions etc.<br />

<br />
Yes, Vamsi and I were planning to meet in LA during the 2002 BWU Fall Workshop.<br />
It would be great to meet all BB members who are attending this workshop.<br />
I will be wearing a Baanboard t-shirt during the opening reception on Monday evening October 14th so that is how you can recognize me.<br />
Maybe we should setup a meeting on one of the conference days for those attending.<br />
Any ideas are welcome!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Edwin</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why dont you think on the idea of selling the Baan Board Tshirt on-line? <br />
I would buy one for sure !!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have thought about it along with other merchandise but we are not sure if it would be financially and logistically viable. We would need a pretty large volume of stuff to be sold to cover the costs and to keep the prices at a reasonable level. But we never say never :)</div></div><hr />
