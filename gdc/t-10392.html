Today on CNET (http://marketwatch-cnet.com.com/2100-1016_3-1017719.html?type=pt&amp;part=marketwatch-cnet&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news):<br />
<br />
SCO Group on Monday said it revoked IBM's license to sell its version of Unix, called AIX, and requested that a judge permanently block IBM's Unix business. <br />
&quot;We have terminated IBM's right to use AIX in their business, development, distribution and sales,&quot; said Chris Sontag, head of the SCOsource effort to derive more revenue from the company's Unix intellectual property. And in an amendment to the company's March complaint against IBM, SCO is &quot;seeking a permanent injunction from IBM's continued use of our software in their business.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
I am sure most of you have been picking up on this 'soap' over the last couple of weeks but I'd like to hear your opinions. Personally I believe SCO management are a bunch of morons who are - supported by M$ - trying to attack the *nix world and filling their own pockets in the process. Anyone still considering doing business with them should be shot :)<br />
<br />
Here are some funny clips from slashdot today:<br />

Welcome to Adventure!<br />

&gt; threaten linux_users<br />
You get a lot of press. A group of angry penguins can be seen gathering torches in the distance.<br />
  <br />
&gt; examine penguins<br />
None of them are actually doing anything much that would interfere with your plan.<br />
  <br />
&gt; threaten ibm<br />
You get a lot more press.<br />
  <br />
&gt; threaten ibm_customers<br />
You get even more press.<br />
  <br />
&gt; examine ibm<br />
Looks like you made a mistake. More lawyers than you can shake a stick at are headed your way.<br />
  <br />
&gt; beat ibm lawyers<br />
That is not an option.<br />
  <br />
&gt; kill ibm lawyers<br />
Come now, don't be ridiculous.<br />
  <br />
&gt; xyzzy<br />
That doesn't work here.<br />
  <br />
The IBM lawyers have caught up with you. Your company is bankrupt, and sharks are considering revoking their offers of professional courtesy towards your employees.<br />
  <br />
You scored 0 of 357 possible points. <br />
Judge: So, um, SCO, you're claiming IBM stole your code, right?<br />
<br />
SCO: Yes, and we will defend our intellectual property to the ends of the earth, to the moon and back, to the universe -<br />
<br />
Judge: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, can we see this source code?<br />
<br />
SCO: Um, well, if we showed it to you, you might steal it as well.<br />
<br />
Judge: Huh?<br />
<br />
SCO: You're in it too - we know it! How much did IBM pay you to betray us?<br />
<br />
Judge: Are you on drugs? I just want to see the supposed code theft -<br />
<br />
SCO: Master betrayed us! No - Judge is our friend! Nobody's our friend!<br />
<br />
Judge: Case dismissed.<br />
<br />
Microsoft: But - but we licensed the code...</div></div><hr />

<br />
(The US Justice department has previously failed to win cases against IBM.)<br />
<br />
UNIX has come a long way since it was originally developed by Bell Labs.   The initial attraction was that it was not IBM and it would allow the other computer manufactures to jointly get a reasonable installed base to compete with  IBM's ppropietary os's in a market that IBM had a virtual stranglehold of. <br />
<br />
I think it is ironic that most of those other companies no longer exist but UNIX and IBM are flourishing. The fact that UNIX is flourishing is due, in no small part, to IBM entering the UNIX market with AIX in the early 90's.  This had a similar effect to that on the PC market when IBM introduced the IBM-PC and legitimised what until then were considered to be mere toys.<br />
<br />
Whilst UNIX is owned in a legal sense and as a means of standardising/controlling it, I think that it should be considered to be virtually public-domain product.  SCO are perhaps trying this case as the one-last-gasp before they whither away.  Their PC product has had it day - Mircosoft has won that market. For those who really want UNIX on PC's there is Linux which has IBM behind it. Perhaps this is the cause of SCO anti-social behavior.</div></div><hr />

Would probably just cost them to write some specialized drivers and they would be up and running!<br />
<br />
As a side-effect to this, Baan would be forced to release a portingset for Linux! :D  (There is an old version of this, but it is unfortunately way outdated, and Baan still refuses to consider Linux as a real OS.  This could change their attitude!)</div></div><hr />

IBM WILL phase out AIX, that's already decided. Linux will be the heir of AIX's throne.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 13:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Similar to SCO claiming Unix code in the AIX software, I think many similar claims could be made: like for using GUI, mouses, computer screens, upto similar things like telephones, lightbulbs, whatever... There must be some ancestor of Henry Ford who can claim that everyone should stop to build cars with 4 wheels... Because of that being the initial idea of his family member.<br />
<br />
Then the other issue... because SCO acquired the code ownership because of a number of acquisitions... it was not even their own idea. I think this stinks. First steal an idea, then force anyone to pay for the use of the idea.</div></div><hr />
