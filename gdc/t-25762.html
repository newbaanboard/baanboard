This part of the release sounds like they are new: &quot;...The increased number of assignments, locations, and people meant that Thrane &amp; Thranes former ERP solution was no longer sufficient. Based on analysis made by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Thrane &amp; Thrane selected SSA ERPLN...&quot;  <br />
<br />
But is is clear from the following paragraphs that they are an existing customer who was not happy with the Baan inventory planning and forecasting funtionality: &quot;...Since our implementation of SSA Baan six years ago, Thrane and Thrane has become much larger, doubling the number of products being produced and growing in revenue, number of employees and transactions by nearly 400%, said Per Skov-Madsen, head of IT at Thrane &amp; Thrane.  It was clear the time was right to upgrade and it was equally clear that SSA ERPLN delivers the incremental functionality we need to manage our much larger and more complex global operations...Thrane &amp; Thrane was especially interested in the reduction of inventory and a more efficient forecasting and planning...&quot;<br />
<br />
I wasn't aware that the LN inventory planning and forecasting were markedly improved in LN.  ie: I thought they were pretty good in the previous versions.<br />
