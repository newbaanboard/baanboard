<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Richard</div><div class="date">7th December 2001, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We are looking into upgrading form 5b to 5c and are interested in hearing from someone who has migrated to or is on 5c.   Mainly we would like to know what you think of the stability of 5c.  5b was extremly buggy when we were going through that implementation and we spent a considerable amount of time finding and having bugs fixed.  We are hoping not to experience the same thing again, and would appreciate anyone who is using the software's opinion on it's stability.  We use most of the packages including Enterprise Planning, large Projects, PCF, distribution, order management, etc,.....   Also, if anyone has gone from 5b to 5c, what were the pluses and minuses you had in doing so.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any input<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Commandeur</div><div class="date">8th December 2001, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We are live with Baan 5.0c on a little subsidiarie and we will go live on our main company the 7 january.<br />
<br />
We did begin the project with sp4, we are now between sp5 and sp 7 (we have not installed any sp from the beginning but we have instal thousands of solutions, and we know that we hav all solutions included in sp5).<br />
<br />
We did open 250 cases on baan support, we have still have now 25-30 case still open, all other was solved by solutions. I did some project with baan 4 before and think that 5.0c is not as stable as 4c4. But it i heard from another cutomer that it is more stable than baan 5.0b.<br />
<br />
We don't have very few technicalm bugs, one is link to the last porting set (bdbreconfig problem) and another is specify to AS/400 printing. We have some problems with developments sessions.<br />
<br />
In finance and industrie we have near zero bug (normal it is very near baan 4, onky few finance integration bugs). We use also EDI (here we have few bugs), planning (no bugs), central invoicing (no bugs). Most of bugs comes fom order manegement, general data (especially item management) and warehousing.<br />
<br />
For most of case support is very good. We have some old issues taht are not solved, most comes from bgl0 localization.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acapulco</div><div class="date">8th December 2001, 22:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I   have been using 5c since service pack 6 (we are a brand new user of Baan).  I believe that the product is stable, we use Finance, manufacturing, service (my favorite) and distribution.  We do not use projects but we are starting to test the module (quite powerful)  <br />
We have had reported around 6 bugs but 4 of them were resolved really quick, one took them around 2 weeks and 1 is still open.<br />
<br />
Baan told us that the migration roadmap is to migrate everyone into Baan IVc4 or Baan 5c in order to then migrate everyone into Baan 5.2</div></div><hr />

With service pack 6 it is stable and reasonable bug free (as opposed to b).  Go with c.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">14th December 2001, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been live on 5.0c for about 1.5 years and overall it has been pretty stable. We had some issues initially but they have been resolved and we are down to a minimal number of open cases with support. Let me know if you would like any more info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Richard</div><div class="date">19th December 2001, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to thank those of you who replied, the information was very helpful.  It appears at this time that we will be migrating from 5b to 5c.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
