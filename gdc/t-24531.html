<br />
Does anyone have an extra copy of BaanERP Business Solutions (by Jendry)that they are willing to sell?<br />
<br />
Amazon sells this book, but I really can't wait 1-3 weeks for delivery.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for any responses.<br />

The first half covers ERP in general (not Baan(!) ERP), mentioning all the ERP and project management buzzwords, just to have them mentioned. The second half is a very high level overview of the Baan ERP Packages (like &quot;The sales order module is used to enter sales orders&quot;). Don't waste your money.<br />

<br />
<br />
The help with Baan is much better for the case.</div></div><hr />

Yes, there is no BaanV or BaanVI books. The one written by Yves is fine but it is on BaanIV.  Baan has a tradition to make good reference manual. I don't know whether anyone is interested to write a book on BaanV or Baan6, or being one of the authors for such a book.<br />
<br />
If you have interest, let me know. We can do it together. You can write the part you are familiar with. I can be the editor. This is not for money, just for fun. The only difficulty I can see is whether SSA would allow to put the screen capture in the book.  The book can be printed in China, cost is low.<br />
<br />
You get to share the knowledge, or it will be lost, become part of your memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rita Kotecha</div><div class="date">13th July 2005, 07:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi tritonbaan,<br />
<br />
I know very little of Baan V tools. But I can share whatever knowledge I have for the book.<br />
<br />
Start Counting. You are 1. I have agreed No. 2. Lets see how many more to join us. We can enquire with a SSA Consultant about the permision for screen shots when it materialses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">13th July 2005, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">It'a already in the works.

That is nice, Rita. I count you as no. 2. Toolswizard, nice to hear you are writing a book. If you can share more the content about your book, that will be nice.<br />
<br />
On the train from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, I start to think about the content of the book. The target readers should be someone new to Baan.  It should not go too deep as a general introduction book. Chinese says, &quot;You throw out a piece of brick, someone may return you a peice of jade&quot;. Therefore below is the content of the brick I drafted on train. Have a look. You can turn it to be a piece of jade.<br />

That book was written based in BaaN IV package and currently partly finished. But about SSA ERP LN, as far as I know, is much more powerful than BaaN IV or BaaN ERP. So I want to re-write the book's some chapters, and replace BaaN IV as SSA ERP LN.</div></div><hr />

Interesting!  <br />
<br />
Now we know we will soon have a new book written by Toolswizard on tools and development. And a book by Gigaman on consultant reference guide.  I still prefer to write a dummy's guide since this will be more interesting and challenging job. How could we write a book that is easy to understand without dropping the necessary details? <br />
<br />
I have put the dummy guide as a Wiki page, hosting on my own web site. The address is http://erpcollege.com/baanbook .<br />
<br />
<br />
The cost to publish a book in Hong Kong starting from HK$20000 (around  US$2500) for 1000 copies, including a ISBN number. This is for your reference if you have written a book and would like it to be published on your own cost.</div></div><hr />

Please make sure your material put in the book will not violate the copyright of SSA. Try to avoid copying directly from SSA published material, like training manual, user guide, on-line help. Digest what you have read and use your own language to present the same meaning.</div></div><hr />

HI ! FOLKS !<br />
               I've been going though all the letters written by all the members of BaaN Community , on this subject. It's good ! there's a lot of enthusisasm all around to write this book !<br />
              I've been going through a similar book in SAP, written by  two consultants from a consulting firm from Mid-west , in U.S. &amp; I'm really impressed with this book !<br />
              BaaN book should also run on similar lines ! Take one imaginary company ,  How they used to work before implementing ERP , each deptt wise , what difficulties they used to face at that time ! Module by Module ! After ERP implementation , how their work got simplified , after implementing ERP ! <br />
           Each Module should be explained in detail , using several Screen-shots ! Use imaginary conversations between the imaginary employees of that firm from various Deptt's , their interactions ! <br />
         It should be woven like a nice story , interesting to read , the reader should never get bored , while reading it!<br />
         It's better , if people from consulting firms , of various Modules come forward for contributing to this book ! Because , they have more implementation experience ( Having worked on several cycles , in different types of industries ). They r more suitable for this job !<br />

<br />
You will learn when you will actually put your hands on Baan. When you face problems, you can search threads on board about the similar problems and you can learn about the solution for the problem you faced. For a book, you can always use Programmer's Guide, Developers Guide, Administrator's Guide and you can also refer to Online Manual (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp).<br />
<br />
If possible, get a training on tools, that will solve your basic problems and will let to start with the real implementations.</div></div><hr />
