<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mick Andrus</div><div class="date">26th March 2008, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">We are embarking on a long-term project to get up-to-date with our Baan service packs on our installation of Baan 5.0c. We expect this to take well over a year.<br />
<br />
As part of the process, I have forewarned a half-dozen of our departments that they need to provide a skilled person to test each service pack and that this person will need to supply (on average) two full workings days a month for testing for each service pack.<br />
<br />
The user-management community does not believe this is realistic (mostly for their own perceived shortage of resources). I am asking for feedback from others who have done or routinely do service pack upgrades as to how much user involvement you get in the testing of each service pack before it goes into production.</div></div><hr />
