<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 09:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Aubert&amp;Duval, a global company and world-leading producer in alloys and super alloys, has selected a Baan solution with iBaan ERP 5.0 for 110 users and iBaan OpenWorld in a win-back against Oracle.  Aubert&amp;Duval has 4000 employees and 6 productions sites and is a major supplier in the aerospace market with customers like SNECMA, Airbus, Boeing, and also in the automotive, oilfield and petrochemical industries.  The company had complex requirements in which the major expectation was optimization at all levels from shop floor to MPS in order to have a better and more adaptive response to their market needs.<br />
<br />
During the sales campaign stiff competition was faced from Oracle.   iBaanERP with OpenWorld was selected by Albert&amp;Duval even after having Oracle Applications implemented.  Baan won the contract back because of the completeness of the Baan solution, as they needed to manage production activities based on multi shop floor and multi sites organization.<br />
<br />
This project representing 430 K$ in licenses and 680 K$ in consulting for Baan, is planned to go live in mid 2004 and extended within other subsidiaries during the next 3 to 5 years.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to the French Presales and Sales team with Agnes Touboul as Sales Manager, Philippe Guittard as presales and Jean-Yves Masselot as Sales Account Manager.  They did a tremendous job in a very hard environment to close this deal for Baan France.  For more information, please contact Jean-Yves Masselot</div></div><hr />
