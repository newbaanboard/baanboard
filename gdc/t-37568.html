I guess the cost of sending from Charlotte, North Carolina to France would depend on weight, specific location in France and transport mode. I would guess that the weight of each book would be approx 1 pound but still variable. Perhaps you should identify which books you're interested in and I'll get their specific weight for you. Then an online lookup at various deliverers (UPS, post office) could be done.</div></div><hr />

The total weight of your book list is 21 pounds. I didn't know where in France you were so I selected Paris. I set commercial value as $0. Given this, the cost is either:<br />
<br />
U.S. Postal Service  $142.50<br />
FEDEX                   $184.50<br />
<br />
Also, 'collect on delivery' is not possible so I would want shipping paid in advance. If still interested, I have Paypal or you could send money order.<br />
<br />
Finally, you have disabled &quot;private message receipt&quot; so this is all public. Perhaps you would want to turn it on.<br />
