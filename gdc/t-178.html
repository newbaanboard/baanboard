<br />
I got it from a Tools training course a long time ago.  Think the course was near Manchester, UK somewhere.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the mug is really cool.  There's a blue car on the side, and when you pour hot water in, the blue car disappears to reveal another logo that says something like &quot;Triton Automotive&quot;.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else seen these mugs?  Surely another piece of Baan magic? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's pretty heavy and saves my nightstand from getting those wet circles that ruin the wood....LOL.<br />
<br />
Other than that - I have a Postit note bad that reads BAAN from the side....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW - I'm new to this site - and so far ---- it's very interesting.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, there was a Baan convention that had the theme of &quot;Crossroads&quot;.  I used to work for SE Tech, which put out special shirts for that conference.  They showed the SE logo (SE) next to a RailRoad crossing sign.  It didn't take long for the folks at the convention to figure out the shirts said SEx.  They went like hot cakes - marketing swears they didn't realize.  I have one of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">20th February 2002, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">'Crossroads' eh... Well that theme would not go down to well in the UK. Crossroads was the name of a really bad soap opera here set in a hotel... Could raise a few interesting comparisons (for those that don't know it, it was far removed from the UK's other hotel legend, Faulty Towers)<br />
<br />
Well at the moment I am trying to find someone who can make up a 'FCUK SAP' t-shirt for the April conference (bound to be a collectors item in the far distant future)<br />
<br />
Now, if only I could come up with some more ideas for logos based around the '80s t-shirt slogans, I could have a nice little sideline in Baan based t-shirts.... <br />
