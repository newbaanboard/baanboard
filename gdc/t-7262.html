<br />
Just got back from the BWU in LA. It was great meeting some of the BaanBoard members and Gurus..<br />
<br />
Edwin, thanks for the BaanBoard T-Shirt. I hope you did not give NPRao an XXL T-Shirt like you gave me.... <br />
<br />
I think the most dramatic thing said in the conference was the announcement of Baan 6, dubbed &quot;Gemini&quot;, to be released in Q4 of 2003. It will have a browser interface and will replace Baan 4 and Baan 5 at one point with A&amp;D extensions too.<br />
<br />
Laurens van der Tang, the president of Baan was asked about Support of Baan 4c. He said that it this support will continue for a while... No need to worry too much.<br />
<br />

<br />
Bader, now that you mentioned I found that it was indeed XXL size.  :D <br />
<br />
The browser interface -  WEBTOP  is already available for the BaaN-5.2  Reger release.<br />
<br />
It was very nice to meet some of the BaaN Board members like Bader, Edwin, Jim, Denise Wallace, Leen Roleveld, B.Madhu, Kathy, Brendan Shine, David Clark, Sudhir Hasbe, few BaaN &amp; Boeing guys. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately we only had the XXL sizes available so all of the people that received a t-shirt were at least in the same boat.<br />
And for your info b40_c4 will be supported until 2008.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

I was on the planning committee but didn't hear about any Baanboard meeting..LOL. Maybe I'll plan better for Charlotte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gfasbender</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 01:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Have we reached a &quot;cult&quot; status yet? I know a few of the moderators on the board were going to get together during the conference. Wasn't everyone running around wearing their nice BaanBoard tee-shirts at the conference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately that meeting never happened and the cult feeling is not there yet.<br />
Hopefully after one more year we can organize something at the 2003 BWU event.<br />

I saw a bunch of Baan Board people as well, but I was too busy (spoke three times and manned the OST booth, plus meetings) to hang out too much.  <br />
<br />
Since I am 6'6&quot; and &gt;250 lbs, XXL is just fine for me :).<br />
