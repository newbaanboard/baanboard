<br />
I have been working with several ERP systems out in the market, including Baan and have noticed that several organizations still waste several hours a day assembling, printing and requesting updates to their business documetns as well as other document types exchanged between the supply chain.  The result is incorrect shipments, invoices that don’t match, lost time, wasted money and strained relationships.<br />
<br />
B2B Connex (www.b2bconnex.com (http://www.b2bconnex.com)) has a better way. Easy and secure Web-based document exchange using the B2B Connex Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) portal. Installed in days – guaranteed results – amazing return on investment.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions about my solutions and how I can help your organization please feel free to contact me directly through www.b2bconnex.com (http://www.b2bconnex.com)<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
