: Anyone had experience with Baan IV c4 changing back ground colors.<br />
: I know there is a product called Nasdaq available to change the colors but I want to try without using that. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 13:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope. You have to use the windows colors. Many people tried to change in different ways, the only notice I have of something working is Nazdaq product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AndyBarratt</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are looking to provide some sort of visual reference that you are on a Test or Live server, or in situation where you have several installations each with live and test servers, you can edit the icons used by baan and change the colour, e.g. all our test servers have red icons in the Baan menus, each of the different live servers has a different icon colour, Yellow (std), Blue etc. so you don't inadvertantly start to enter data on the wrong server.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this will only provide an indicator per installation, not per company, which would be more usefull. For that its back to Nazdaq<br />

I did change the colors of the icons earlier. But I want to do the change the background colors and I guess I got to buy a product from Nasdaq. <br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Another very visual way is to change the font using the -font=courier on the bwc config, search the board for more information</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 00:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Every element on the desktop in Microsoft Windows is a &quot;window&quot;. Each window has a handle. Communication between the OS and the window takes place using messages. Some of those messages involve the painting functionality. It is possible to intercept these messages and change or discard them - just like QKey/rush/RMCgen do in Baan :).<br />
<br />
So a program which changes any GUI elements would have to:<br />
- have a procedure which keeps track of windows being created and destroyed.<br />
- keep track of the company number based on the window title, by parsing the text.<br />
- have a Windows &quot;hook&quot; that monitors messages being sent to these windows and change the background color as required. <br />
<br />
That is what I found in my research over the weekend. Also this gave me an opportunity to get my feet wet a bit in Windows programming.<br />
<br />
For more information search for &quot;subclassing&quot; and &quot;hooking&quot; on everyone's favorite search engine www.google.com.</div></div><hr />
