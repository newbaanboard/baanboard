<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noname</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a copy of KQ which doesn't seem to work with Intel's Pentium 4 (1.4G).  It works fine with other chips but runs into dll trouble with the newer chips.  Has anyone encountered this problem?  Is there a workaround?   I found none at Baan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The Knowledge Quest installation will put the .dll files under:<br />
<br />
Program Files\Common Files\Folio Shared<br />
<br />
You must copy these .dll files into the Knolwledge Quest directory.<br />
<br />
Then try to run it again.<br />
<br />
I don't know why, but that is what the small Post-It note in our Knowledge Quest CD case says to do (I had to recently install it for a new Cost Accountant at our company so that he could  learn Baan costing.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">it gave error like &quot;*.dll not found&quot;. i just searched for that dll and copied to the directory where it was looking.<br />
<br />
for some reason it does not install properly those dlls in the correct folders.<br />
<br />
it should work fine.</div></div><hr />

Even with the trick that Eddie described above the program would just stop working and a reinstall was the only way to fix it up again.</div></div><hr />
