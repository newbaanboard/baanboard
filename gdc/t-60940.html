<br />
Today I noticed that Infor (completely) changed its homepage www.infor.com.<br />
<br />
One of the things that surprised me, is that they apparently renamed most of the erp systems that they own.<br />
LN is now called ERP Enterprise, for example.<br />
For me it is quite unclear what ERP system is what, for example, what happened to infor.com?<br />
<br />
A positive sign for the Baan-community is probably that LN is listed as the first ERP system...<br />
<br />
What do you think about the new homepage?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />

ERP LN will be branded as ERP Enterprise; Visual as the ERP Business for small (10-25) implementations etc etc.</div></div><hr />
