<br />
BaaN (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baan_ERP) is an ERP (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) system which integrates functional units of an organization into a single system.<br />
Below are the few functional units...<br />
<br />
1. Manufacturing<br />
2. Logistics<br />
3. Planning<br />
4. Finance<br />
5. Service<br />
6. Project management<br />
.<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Any ERP system (like BaaN, SAP, Oracle Apps etc) comes with standard functionality but one can customize it according to their business need.<br />
The hierarchy of BaaN ERP from older to newer version is as follows...<br />
<br />
BaaN Triton<br />
BaaN IV<br />
BaaN ERP (Also Known as BaaN V)<br />
ERP LN<br />
<br />
BaaN is a pioneer in manufacturing thus mostly used in manufacturing industries &amp; it's implementation cost is much more effective in comparison to other big ERPs.<br />
BaaN is a product of Infor Global Solution (http://www.infor.com/solutions/erp/).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand what is Baan.That I am clear.But What i want to know if i want to fetch some Data from Baan using external application like asp.net web application what i have to do.<br />
<br />
Means Anything I need to install for integrating Baan into my web application.Or it provide any API so i can use that and access the data.<br />
<br />
Or there is any Webservice Baan provides so i can simply call that webservice and fetch the data and show into my application<br />
<br />
Sorry for any thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">3rd February 2012, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan itself can be accessed over browser using baan webtop. Knowing data structure takes time. U need to have expert functional consultant for the same. In baan u can print ttadv4420m000 to get table structures.<br />
<br />
Also it may be good case to discuss ur requirement with an external agency as long complex configuration kind of question can not be answered in fora like this.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
as the former postings say, BAAN is an ERP-System like SAP, MS-Dynamics, Peoplesoft, JD Edwards a.s.o.<br />
You have to buy and install it. For setup and configuration extraordinary knowledge is needed.<br />
<br />
