<br />
OST (Open Systems Technologies in Grand Rapids, MI) is hosting its second annual Education Symposium in North America from February 12th 2007 until February 15th 2007 in Scottsdale, AZ. This year OST organized its first annual symposium both in Savannah, GA and in Nice, France already and they were a big success.<br />
<br />
The symposium in February 2007 will be a very good educational experience for all the companies that are considering to upgrade to LN or that have already made the decision to move forward. It will be a must attend event because during this event you will:<br />
<br />
- receive an overview of LN in your area<br />
- create an LN environment for your company<br />
- convert some of your current SSA BAAN data into your new LN environment<br />
- perform exercises using your new LN data<br />
- take this environment with you when you leave or continue to have access after the workshop<br />
<br />
OST will provide more information on the exact schedule and registration details soon so please stay tuned and keep checking BaanBoard.</div></div><hr />
