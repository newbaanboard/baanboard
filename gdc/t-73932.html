<br />
I am looking for feedback on how was the experience of moving from BAAN IV to LN. <br />
<br />
We are evaluating this option and would like to hear from other businesses that have already gone through the same experience. I would really appreciate if we could have a brief call on the matter. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">22nd July 2021, 08:22</div></div><div class="posttext">We went from BaanIV to LN 10.2. It took literally years. But that’s because of us. Migrating from LN 10.2 to LN 10.7 still took a year. We're still using a highly customized installation.<br />
The main problem is, you must migrate the addon programming. So basically, you have to redo every source, you have touched.  If you're going to LN 10.7, I strongly advice to switch to extensions. This will be no less time-consuming, but it will make things easier in the future.<br />
Infor will provide standard migrating tools. This will migrate a standard BaanIV installation to LN. But if you want to convert data in a specific way (i.e. converting order numbers) you will have to modify those tools.<br />
In the end we kept the old BaanIV installation as an archive system. Only open orders and basic data has been transferred to LN.<br />
That’s how we did it. On the end users’ side, it’s been a drama, because you can't use the old terminal client anymore. ASCII mode heroes will suffer.</div></div><hr />
