I'm curious about the difficulty level of integrating these tools.</div></div><hr />

This might be an opportunity for somebody because SharePoint is getting more and more popular among businesses in North America and Europe.<br />

It is based on MS SharePoint and they have a Web part which <br />
can interface to Baan IV and Baan V. <br />
<br />
They want to show the first release on their seminar Nov 17th. <br />

<br />
It's build on top of Windows SharePoint services (WSS).<br />
This is the part that comes for free with Windows 2003.<br />
Because Windows Sharepoint Services lacks good navigation<br />
tools, workflow, integration parts etc., the total solution<br />
deliveres a set of webparts to solve these issues.<br />
<br />
You don't need Windows SharePoint Portal, however if <br />
your company already bought this license it's certainly an<br />
added value, but not mandatory. <br />
<br />
The unique additional webparts in the solution are:<br />
-workflow build within SharePoint<br />
-navigation, enhanced maintainable tree structure<br />
-consolidation webpart, gives overview over multiple sites<br />
-interface with SSA Baan V (Baan IV to follow, depending on demand)<br />
<br />
The interface with SSA Baan goes via the business logic layer,<br />
so it will also work on a customized environment. <br />
<br />
Current release displays SSA Baan data within your SharePoint <br />
environment, next version will also support inserts/updates. <br />
<br />
Detailed information and demo's will be given on the seminars <br />
in Zeist (Netherlands) on November 17th and in Belgium on <br />
November 24th in Niel (Boom). See also www.actnow.nl and <br />
www.ometa.be<br />

regards<br />
