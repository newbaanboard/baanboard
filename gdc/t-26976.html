for finance,distribution,projects,manufacturing and some customised sessions.<br />
Any Idea?<br />
Please advice.<br />

<br />
I have heard stories that a typical migration should take about 8 months and that the costs will be at least EUR 100.000 for the entire project. At least these are comments given to me by existing BAAN IV customers who have spoken with SSA Global.<br />
<br />
Personally I know of a SSA BAAN partner who is offering a template migration in less than 2 months and the costs should be less than EUR 50.000.<br />
Of course this depends on customer requirements as well and in your case it may be 3 months in total.<br />
<br />
As you put it correctly moving from BAAN IV_c4 to LN6.1 is a migration and not an implementation.<br />
Only when you want to introduce new business processes and new ways of working you are talking about an implementation.<br />
If you go over 1:1 then it is a migration.<br />
Please contact me if you would like to get in touch with my contact at the SSA BAAN partner.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think the typical duration for a BaanIV to LN migration at a single locaiton will be around four to five months. The cost will be much depend on the customization you have made.  If you have internal developer who can handle the report customization, it will reduce the cost a lot.<br />
<br />
Another investment will be on the new hardware.  LN need more powerful server than BaanIV.  If you want to save cost, use Intel processor based servers, i.e, Windows 2003 or SUSE Linux.   If your IT guys are familiar with Linux, I would recommend to use Linux.  <br />
<br />
Always do more testing. You don't need to be in a rush.</div></div><hr />

I agree with 'tritonbaan' that in case of necessary customizations the implementation time will be longer than 2 months.<br />
<br />
Indeed, running LN6.1 on SuSE Linux is cheap and if you also add MySQL 5.0 on top of that as the database then you can really save a lot of money.<br />
MySQL will officially be supported for LN6.1 by SSA Global starting in June 2006.<br />
Pricing of SuSE Linux and MySQL does not depend on the number of users and you only pay an annual maintenance fee: EUR 900 for SuSE Linux and EUR 500 for MySQL (basic package). Of course support is not only given by SSA Global but also by the vendors: SuSE Linux is supported by Novell and MySQL by MySQL AB.<br />
