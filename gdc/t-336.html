Otherwise, war, hate &amp; non-interest is going to bring it down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">How about a Baan version with built-in MP3 player? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frans C</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 22:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool! Yes, I love to listen to music when I do some BaaN work. A built-in mp3.player (or a BaaN musicplayer) would be wonderful.<br />
<br />
However, both BaaN / mp3.com has joined the loser's circle. Especially mp3.com, who almost had the music industry by the short hairs...<br />
<br />
But, with a little bit of excitement, maybe it can be lifted - who knows?</div></div><hr />

I would not call Baan a 'loser' after recent months. I think we all the bad period Baan went through but under the wings of Invensys they seem to be recovering quite well. The management finally seems to have a realistic grip on things and the product in itself is still good. As a Baan consultant I have a lot more confidence in Baan's future now than one year ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frans C</div><div class="date">31st October 2001, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;loser&quot; part is mainly my disappointment in the owners who have lost confidence in their own product - in my opinion, BaaN is fantastic software, and the owners should have restructured and weathered the storm. Instead, they sold out...<br />
<br />
But yes, it is a wonderful product - I worked on it since Triton 1.something. My only personal problem is that I do not see that recovery yet... and the war is not helping anything right now. That is why I am asking for something exciting :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">31st October 2001, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow Frans,<br />
<br />
From Triton 1.x? Then you must have grown up together with Baan :) I think most people are not happy with the way both Baan brothers did and still do business. Last week I head that Luminux/Vanenburg ceased operations, yet another failure where the BB were involved. Nevertheless, the recovery is and will be long and troublesome but I am keeping faith!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes! I have been a BaaN programmer for more than 8 years - and still enjoying it...<br />

I am sure that BaaN will be OK in future. BB, however, has accomplished more than many others will ever accomplish in an entire lifetime. And they also made history...</div></div><hr />

Not relevant to your reply but I thought I'd make you aware that the board has a special quoting feature so that you do not have to use the '&gt;' :). See below!<br />
