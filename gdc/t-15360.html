<br />
Just a quick intro. Heard a lot about this forum. And have decided to register and see whether I can be of any assistance. I worked at Baan for 10 years, and now working almost full time in a logistics mgt role at the largest Flower Auction of the world. In remaining hours my company (&quot;NextStep - Practical Logistics Strategies&quot;) focuses on getting the most out of your Baan systems, by advising you on taking the most relevant small effective steps with quick ROI. For example process compression in the warehouse &amp; production (barcoding PLUS...).. or in the way you use Baan (DEM, Workflow, etc.)<br />
<br />
My baan background relates to Tools, Multi-site, DEM, Workflow, Warehousing, (Manufacturing), Transportation, CAPS, Supply Chain, and related partner products ADC, RFID, WMS, Portals, ReportingTools etc. <br />
<br />
So if you're deciding what you should do next, contact me (see website) and I should be able to help.<br />
<br />
I hope that I might be of value in many of the posted questions.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
