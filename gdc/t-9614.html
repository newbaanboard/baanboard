<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jose Banuelos</div><div class="date">13th April 2003, 06:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I work at a school bus manufacturing plant. The plant uses Bann to print the process papers traveling down the line. Each department has several feature that they has to accomplish in their department. The area were I work has 7 departments and all 7 departments feature list is printed in the same traveling paper going down the line. This become problematic when each department has to look for their features, missing some. I was thinking that the solution will be adding seven ceros (one for each department) to the feature number. Each cero will represent each department. For example if Floors is the first department the first cero will represent them, and if a 1 appears instead of the cero the worker will immediately will recognize that that feature needs to be done in his department. This way the software will pull the feature of each department and the worker dont have to read the complete 12-13 page feature list.  Now my questions are:<br />
How difficult is this to do? <br />
Is the software design to reconfigure this way?<br />
Who should I talk in the Plant ? the IT guys?<br />
When this software is sold does the company that buys this software program it to their needs?<br />
Is this a data base software?<br />
Can somebody give me and idea how to proceed .<br />
Thanks <br />

Depends on the area and level of customizations probably.<br />
<br />
&gt; Is the software design to reconfigure this way?<br />
Baan applications are very configurable (customizable) or, when a feature is not available, it can be built.<br />
<br />
&gt; Who should I talk in the Plant ? the IT guys?<br />
Yes, they can check who is responsable for application and then get things ongoing with them or the installation/development partner<br />
<br />
&gt; When this software is sold does the company that buys this software program it to their needs?<br />
Usually yes.<br />
<br />
&gt; Is this a data base software?<br />
Yes, data is stored in a backend database, Baan is a frontend.<br />
<br />
&gt; Can somebody give me and idea how to proceed .<br />
See above...</div></div><hr />

<br />
To me it sounds like the departments should either pay better attention, or that their &quot;instructions&quot; are scattered throughout the document.<br />
<br />
In the second case, it would only require minor modifications by somebody who is somewhat knowledgable of the Baan configurator and possibly can do a little report modification.<br />
That way, rather than marking the different steps, you can group your features by department and even provide page breaks between the groups so each department has its separate set of &quot;instructions&quot;.<br />
<br />
The best thing about Baan is that anything is possible and any scenario can be accomodated.<br />
