<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">19th January 2006, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that the New Year has just started Qtris offers SSA Global BAAN customers a way to save lots of money on the purchase and maintenance costs of new hardware and additional Operating System.<br />
For that reason we have developed our BAAN2Linux program that will allow you to run your SSA BAAN system much faster at lower costs. Our solution of SUSE Linux in combination with new hardware will be a huge improvement compared to your current UNIX, Windows and AIX environment.<br />
Another advantage of our BAAN2Linux program is that you will not need to purchase new database software and can safely upgrade to the following database versions:<br />
<br />
&#8226;        Oracle 9i or higher<br />
&#8226;        Informix 9.40 or higher<br />
<br />
In case of BISAM/TBASE there is nothing extra you will have to do or purchase because of the SSA Global support for Triton 3.1 and BAAN IV in combination with SUSE Linux.  <br />
<br />
What exactly is your benefit?<br />
BAAN2Linux is our answer to drastically decrease the TCO of your BAAN system. TCO stands for Total Cost of Ownership and involves the total costs of purchasing, using and multiple years of maintaining IT systems. <br />
Because of our specialized focus and unique composition Qtris is the only SSA Global BAAN partner in the world that can cost-effectively translate the new Linux and Open Source opportunities to a lower TCO for its customers.<br />
<br />
In case one or more of the following questions apply to your BAAN system we strongly recommend you to contact us today:<br />
<br />
* Have you been running your current BAAN system for more than five years already?<br />
* Are the maintenance costs of your BAAN system too high?<br />
* Is the database version you are running for your BAAN system no longer supported by the vendor?<br />
* Did you mirror the hard discs of your system?<br />
* Do you currently have enough disc space to perform a new Service Pack upgrade? <br />
<br />
By making the strategic decision for Linux as the Operating System for your BAAN system you will make a new and important step for your company.<br />
SSA Global has finally committed itself to Linux and Open Source solutions for its customers after the successes in the SAP and Oracle e-Business Suite areas.<br />
As per June 2006 SSA Global is planning to also support the Open Source database MySQL 5.0 Enterprise Edition for SSA Global ERP LN6.1 and has plans to do the same for BAAN IV and BAAN V within two years from now.<br />
 <br />
In case you are interested in our Linux and Open Source propositions and would like to start saving on the TCO of your BAAN system we invite you to get in touch with us today.<br />
<br />
With kind regards,<br />
<br />
