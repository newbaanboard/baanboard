<br />
While helping ourselves with some snacks at the cafeteria, I noticed the sign above the exit door -- the Baan's Save and Exit icon. Getting more curious I checked all the doors I can access and found the same thing.<br />
<br />
Seems like the Save and Exit icon is &quot;standard&quot; sign for Exit in the Netherlands. Everytime we get out of the door I would tell my wife to &quot;Save and Exit&quot; then... <br />
<br />
BTW, we went on to Germany and found that the Exit from the highway is called Aushfart...but that's another story...:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sign is a baanism and indeed commonly used as exit sign in The Netherlands.<br />
Another BAAN colleague from Asia told me once he noticed the same sign at every railway station in Holland when he was overthere for a visit.<br />
I guess you have to be non-Dutch to really notice this.<br />

<br />
'Ausfahrt' would kind of translate into 'Drive Out' so that's a sensible description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">14th June 2002, 08:42</div></div><div class="posttext">... that Baan dropped the &quot;Saloon Door&quot; (or the &quot;Butterfly&quot;) with Baan V. How do you call that bloody Group Selection Button now?<br />
