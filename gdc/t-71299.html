I am not sure how Pat blocks some of the spammers we get - not sure by domain or what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">15th August 2018, 08:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Use any email ID other than Gmail. This domain is blocked due to multiple spam accounts being created on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately we had to block the entire gmail e-mail domain for signing up. It just simply throws out too many spammers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th August 2018, 14:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess I never really looked at the email addresses when I was busy banning the spammers.  I do know what ever you all did cut them WAY DOWN and I appreciate that. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">15th August 2018, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Now this get me curious. Why do you think Gmail has more spammers. I also noticed Hangouts. Why so many people are luring you to go to Google Hangouts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th August 2018, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't say for sure - but as moderator there for a couple of months every time I logged into the board I would have any where from 10 - 20 spammers that I was having to ban.  And this would be multiple times a day.  Those days I spent more time banning spammer than probably reading threads.  Here lately it is only maybe 5 or 6 - not many.  I suspect that was the reason.  I never looked at the users email address just what they were spamming.  My best guess.</div></div><hr />
