<br />
We found out a defect in Infor LN software and case been launched to them but feedback from them is really disappointed, Infor keep on saying the defect will be fix in new version and not the current version.  So you need to upgrade to latest version.  If this kind of execuses keep on, how many times we need to upgrade, is it fair for customer?<br />
<br />
My question here is do we as a user have right to ask them to fix it or any legal action we can take or any Infor Top management that we can write to?<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Generally if the same issue has been reported by more customers then it will be fixed immediately by Infor and will provide a solution, incase if its for only a single customer they keep it aside till next release and during next release they will provide the required solution. This all depends on the reproduction of the defect/issue raised by the customer, that needs to be reproducible within Inor server then only you have a chance.<br />
<br />
Other way is to retrofit that session code. (Which most of the companies does for their convenience.) <br />

Thanks<br />
