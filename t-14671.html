<br />
My company currently have a lot of cost items which we need to change into purchased items.  We were told that cost items can not easily be changed to purchased items and that cost items can not be deleted as they have history attached to them.   Is it possible to archive the current cost items with their history, and then to create purchased items in their place with the same part number?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />

I have changed cost items to purchased a vice versa using general table maintenance and it seems to have always worked o.k.<br />
<br />
However, test it on your system for 1 item first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've been advised that doing it in table maintence could get us in bigger trouble down the road.  I'm tempted to try it though.<br />
<br />
It's good to hear that someone else has had success that way.</div></div><hr />
