We are using Vertex Sales Tax Q Series with Baan IV C 4. We use destination (ship to location) tax and we need change it to &quot;Origin&quot; (ship from location) for state of Ohio staring next year. <br />
Has anyone had to configure BAAN to allow based on &quot;Origin&quot;<br />
state tax when retrieving tax rates from the Vertex system? Baan passes the company address defined in the company paraemters as &quot;Origin&quot; address so the orgin address is same for all orders. Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />

We use Vertex too, but we dont have that kind of scenario..<br />
You might want to look at the TDM (tax decision make, which is part of vertex), there you will be able to set up overriding rates, so you might be able to set up some special rate for OH (never attempted it, but thats an area you can research on)</div></div><hr />
