&quot;http://www.ozdevelopment.com/ozexe/&quot; is third party software company that could interact with Pitney Bowes and Baan.<br />
<br />
What we would use this for is to allow the barcode to be scanned once, and it would allow the shipping information to be pulled up on the Pitney shipping station, but would also &quot;scrape&quot; over to the Baan barcode session and allow that session to kick off to confirm the pick and shipment of that particular barcode.<br />
<br />
Any one have any feedback on this OZ development products? Please let us know. We are kind of evaluating the software.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
