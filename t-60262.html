<br />
I believe this is the appropriate place to post our solution, B2B Connex Supplier Portal.  The B2B Connex supplier portal solution can hook directly up to any ERP system, including Baan.<br />
<br />
B2B Connex supplier portal functionality can be used to publish documents such as purchase orders. Suppliers are notified by email of the new order. B2B Supplier Portal sends out email reminders to ensure a timely acknowledgement from the supplier. The buyer doesn’t have to waste time chasing suppliers to verify purchase order delivery. Suppliers view the order through web pages and can take actions to acknowledge, accept, request a change, or reject the order. Buyers are immediately notified of the supplier’s actions and can review any change requests from the supplier immediately through a web page.<br />
<br />
