<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">candle1113</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 03:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I am writing a visual basic application that will reside on the client's computer and I want to send the information from the visual basic program to BaaN, creating a BaaN transaction (maybe update sales orders or update replenishment orders or create new job-managment job).<br />
<br />
I was planing to generate function servers on several BaaN sessions using the &quot;generate function server&quot; session in BaaN4c4 (we use HP Unix as our BaaN App Server and Informix as our database). And I want to connect to these function servers with my visual basic program.<br />
<br />
Is this possible? (we don't have Open World or BOI). Oh, we also don't have own any source code.<br />
<br />
How can I make my visual basic program talk to the BaaN function servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Check out the Ole automation examples that usually come with the client. At least they did on our version of the client.  <br />
<br />
I played with this for a while using Excel.  What the Excel code did was call a DLL which used the stpapi commands to run the session.  We also do not own the source code. I will try to find the code and post an example.<br />

<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
