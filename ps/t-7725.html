We are facing a problem that we have inserted a installation manually. The location of the components come under this installation has been changed on the later date. We want to know, how to record this change, so that we can track the component history with location and location info when ever it is needed.<br />
<br />

Please check whether session tssma1106m000 will work for you.<br />
In this session you can maintain the component history.<br />
If that does not work for you give us some more info on what you are looking for.<br />

<br />
I am Adding Dummy Components and replacing the existing components (whose location is changed) with the dummy component. <br />
<br />
But when I try to delete the original installation it gives the message &quot;Unable to delete record; record being used in other table&quot;.  As we are having a Service order for the component when it was linked with the original installation.<br />
<br />
Can you please guide us what to do in this case. As we don't want to retain the original installation with the system, because it will affect our planning.<br />
<br />
One thing more, right now we are not having any links with the Inventory. Whenever in future we will do so, do these dummy components will affect our inventory.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
As long as the service order has not yet been posted to History you will not be able to delete the installation that is linked to that service order.<br />
There may also be other references in Service that will not allow you to delete the installation. This all depends on the situation on your environment.<br />
<br />
If you modify (add, replace or delete) components for an installation it will have no impact on inventory.<br />
You should be okay.<br />
