The surcharges are never on an item, only on the project as a whole.<br />

If we are talking Project it is not. Surcharges can be calculated and result in actual cost during the processing of direct cost like hours, materials and the like.<br />
They can also be calculated over the budget but surcharges can be defined differently for budget and actuals if you want it like that.</div></div><hr />

So I was talking about pcs, not tp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Surcharges will be posted from TP to TF if surcharges per costs are being in use. Surcharges will be posted TOGETHER with every transaction if linked by surcharge definition. I recommend to test it with hours registration.<br />
(Define a surcharge, type labor, give it a % - Value, dont forget the status)<br />
<br />
When you do the process transaction (tpppc4802m000), the surcharge record will be created and posted to Finance and to Monitoring.<br />
<br />
If you have any question, feel free to ask.</div></div><hr />
