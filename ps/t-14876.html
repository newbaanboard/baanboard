We are looking for a way to use the subcontracting as Cost type in maintining calculation serviceorders (session tssma3110m000). It is possible to add an item that has itemtype subcontracting in the pre calculation. However, if we generate a purchaseorder from the precalculation, it is not possible to match the prurchase invoice to the order. The system comes up with error 606 to table ticst002. This seems logical because this table holds the pre and post calculation for the sfc orders for which the subcontracting has been originally designed. It seems that using the subcontracting cost type in service has not been fully programmed in Baan.<br />
Does anyone has experience with the matter?<br />

<br />
You are correct in saying that the Cost Type &quot;Subcontracting&quot; has not been fully programmed in BAAN IV Service.<br />
There are other pieces of functionality that have also not been fully programmed in tssma.<br />
The reason for this is that a long time ago tssma was developed as a customized module for a customer and in Triton 2.2 this so called customization had been &quot;upgraded&quot; to the BAAN standard.<br />
Only with BAAN V Service new and more robust functionality was introduced and in case of b50 Service you would not have the issue you have in tssma today.<br />
<br />
I guess there is not much you can do other then find a work around using standard BAAN IV Service or build a customization for this. I am not aware any BAAN Solution Partner solved this issue with some sort of an add-on solution.<br />
