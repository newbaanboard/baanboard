<br />
I am on BaaN IV c4.<br />
<br />
I am having a doubt in Hours Accounting. <br />
I am posting my Service hours from the session tihra1101m000. My start day of the week is Saturday as this is the system in the Middle East.<br />
<br />
When I book hours on Thursday, then Friday and then Saturday BaaN allows me to book hours without any problem till Wed after which the message comes &quot; Employee occupied with other task, continue?&quot; ..<br />
<br />
My question is there a way to prevent hours from being booked in the same week when the end of the week is crossed. The problem here is that the user forgets that he has to key the hours in the next week when he crosses Friday and continues booking on saturday as well thinking he is doing it for the next day whereas in the system he is actually booking on a date previous to Friday.<br />
<br />
I hope I am clear in my doubt.<br />
<br />
Thanks a heap in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that tihra1101m000 is actually not a good session to use for the complexity of your kind of hours registration.<br />
A week number has to be given but there is no zooming capabilities to a period and also the transaction dates are not visible.<br />
<br />
If possible you may want to consider using the Hours Accounting capabilities in Project (tphrs1100m000). This offers a much user-friendlier way of booking hours on a service order.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you are open to discuss this possibility.<br />
<br />

<br />
I agree with Edwin's sugestion of using BaaN TP Hours Accounting session to solve UR users issue.<br />
<br />
the advantage in BaaN TP is that U can see the  data fed in for the days of the week and the user can very well know for which week and the day of the week is he/she, feeding the hours.<br />
And accompanied by the task level Analysis.<br />
<br />
hope I am clear.<br />

<br />
You can register hours in BAAN Project and have them posted to tssma3110m000.<br />
For this you do NOT have to set the parameter &quot;Baan Project Implemented&quot; to 'Yes' in tppdm0100m000.<br />
<br />
I will give you a high level overview of how to set things up in Project and suggest you try yourself after having read this message. In case you get stuck please reply to my post and I will help you further.<br />
<br />
Sessions to execute in tp:<br />
<br />
1. Create an Hourly Wage Type in tpppc2120m000 with the &quot;Hour Type&quot; set to 'Normal Hours'<br />
2. Generate cost control periods and hours control periods in tpppc0210m000 for the years desired. To be safe for possible future use of BAAN Project it is better to also generate the Cost Control Periods with a Period Type of &quot;Month&quot;. The Hours Control Periods are per week. You can view the periods after generating them in tpppc2121m000 (Hours) and tpppc0110m000 (Cost Control)<br />
3. Create an employer in tphrs0120m000<br />
4. Define a Wage Component by Employer in tphrs0110m000. Make sure the Type is &quot;Hours&quot; and the Default Allocation Code is &quot;SMA (Services). You also have the possibility to check the field Hours Check and this will allow the system to let you know an employee worked more than 40 hours per week when you are booking his hours<br />
<br />
Once this is set up you can start registering hours in tphrs1100m000. As soon as you open the session and click the new group button you will be able to zoom to the Hours Control Periods you generated earlier. By selecting a week the system will default in the dates and you will exactly know in which week and for what day you are booking the hours.<br />
<br />
One important note in this scenario: the unit for booking hours must have a Physical Quantity of &quot;Time&quot;. This unit is defined in tcmcs0101m000 (Units). The base unit for &quot;Time&quot; must be set to a second in tcmcs0100m000 so that when you define the conversion between a second and an hour the value will be 1:3600. This is done in tiitm0120m000.<br />
<br />
