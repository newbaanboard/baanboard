Has anybody made such a customization before?<br />

In the copy session, just check the (estimate data)is okay.<br />
<br />
The rule is also applicable with the Activity structure. In another word, when you copy the activity , just check the estimate data.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DFisch</div><div class="date">26th February 2009, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, Henk was right.<br />
I found no way in the standard and we want to make a customization for it.<br />
Our customer uses tp with app. 7 levels of elements an some thousands of budget lines in several elements. (called a maximum structure). When we create a new estimate, we first want to copy the maximum structure in a new project, delete all elements that we do not need and after that (and that's the problem) copy this structure to a new estimate. This all is the work of the engineer, now comes the sales people and make the prices and margines and so on with the estimation and excel combination. <br />
Changes in the to build structure are only done in the budget, but the estimation is more flexible for text positions and so on. Also we separate the technical from the commercial structure.<br />
When this all is ready, the project manager comes and creates the third structure, the activities. It is a really complex using of LN Project...<br />

<br />
I would consider copying the Estimation Version with its structures and lines (interactiv?) per Element(?) to a new Estimation-Version of a new Project. Change it and then copy to Project Budget.<br />
The project could be copied from a Template containing Activities already!<br />
<br />
Check if you can assign in Estimation Lines Activities (defaults) before you copy it over to Budgets. Activities should match in the lines with existing activities in the plan.<br />
<br />
This requires some costomization, but I would guess, it less difficult than the other way around.<br />
