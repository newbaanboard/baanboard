<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ajjugarg2</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">A warrenty is attched to the object in specific configuration with material term for a particular service type. When service order for that configuration is created and service order activity is defined in session tssoc2110s000, the warrenty flag is also set by the system. But when the relevant ,material is issued to the service order, the amount is covered by the warrenty (in the session tssoc2121s000 second form). However 50 % of amount shall be covered by the warrenty becuase in warrenty coverage term 50 % discount was specified.<br />
<br />
The above is working very much fine with contracts.<br />
<br />
Anybody pleas help me out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- What Service Type did you use in the Warranty Coverage?<br />
- What Cost Types did you select when setting up the Warranty Coverage?<br />
- What Warranty did you link to the Object in tscfg2100s000?<br />
- Did you link this Object to the Service Order Activity in session tssoc2110s000? and what is the Service Type of the Reference Activity that you used to create the Service Order Activity?<br />
<br />
Please provide answers to these questions. <br />
I just tested your issue on my system and it works fine here. Only 50% of the Warranty is covered in tssoc2121s000.<br />
<br />
