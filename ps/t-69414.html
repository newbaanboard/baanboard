Version: BaanVc SP 58<br />
<br />
When entering a new Service Order Activity line, the line number has a limitation of 3 digits only.  The Domain for Service Order Activity Line number (tssoc210.acln) is tsmdm.acln with 3 digits as length and format ZZ9. How to increase this to accept 4 digits ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">31st October 2016, 21:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Well any change like this requires a lot of work.  I would first ask infor support before attempting and baan seeded domain.  When we first went live with Baan we changed the item default to 32 characters.  To this day we still have standard reports that only print 16 characters.  Not only do you have to change all the tables that might be related to this, but you also need to change forms, reports and maybe even some baan code.  Luckily the other domain changes are have been rejected since we do not own code and this would impact what happens with future SP's and patches.  If you are lucky enough to have a play ground you can try doing this and just see what all needs to change - plus what works and does not work.  This is not something I would do lightly - my opinion only.<br />

Maybe a baan V expert knows something I do not, we are on 4c4.</div></div><hr />
