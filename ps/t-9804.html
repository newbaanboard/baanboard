I have a planned activity with labor requirements. The labor requirements( by Planned activity) has two tasks and the first task has efficiency rate 2 and the second task efficiency rate 4.<br />
<br />
When I transfer the planned activity to create a service order, the labor requirements are automatically copied to the session service order:estimated labor costs(tssoc2530m000).<br />
<br />
When I run Global SRP and then Detailed SRP there is only one engineer displayed in session service order engineers(tssoc2105m000) and the same is the case in other sessions 'service execution assignment', assignment list etc.<br />
<br />
As per my labor requirement there must be multiple engineers required(atleast 4 in my case) to complete the activity. Can anyone help me how to make the set up so that multiple engineers are planned for the service order activity?<br />
<br />
The relevant service center has adequate no. of service employees attached to it. The baan version is Baan Vc with SP9. Planning method is by activity in SOC parameter. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
I was wondering why you are using Detail SRP to release service orders and service order activities.<br />
Can you please explain?<br />
I would also like to know if you are using the Planningboard in Service and/or if you are using the Service Scheduler.<br />
As you may know you can also release service orders and service order activities via the &lt;Released&gt; button.<br />
<br />
Based on my experience I know Detail SRP is a very difficult session to work with because it only works at the service center level and you should only be using this if your business is scheduled maintenance.<br />
Most companies I work with are more in a &quot;reactive&quot; mode and do not really schedule their service orders. They wait until the customer calls or sends in the equipment for repair. In those situations it is best to just use the Planningboard and/or the &lt;Released&gt; button in service orders and service order activities after running Global SRP. <br />
Only if you are really in the preventive maintenance business you should be using Detail SRP.<br />
<br />
Please let me know and I will help you further.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you very much for the reply. <br />
<br />
As you have guessed, it is a scheduled maintenance environment and we are using the graphical planning board. <br />
<br />
Our Service centers are limited. Just only 2 service centers and all the employees are attached to these service centers. Usually we send persons in a group. We do release service orders instead of running DSRP. When we release a service order, an engineer is attached for that service order in the session service order-engineers. My doubt is whether it is possible to make the system attach more than one engineer to the service order automatically without manual intervention. (Because the efficiency rate for the labor requirement of the service order activity is 4.)  Is it anything to do with a foreman? We have not attached any foreman in session service employees(tsmdm1140s000).<br />
