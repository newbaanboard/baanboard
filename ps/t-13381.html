<br />
- Baan Manual suggest that Condition Base Maintenance is possible with Baan5.0c, however we could not yet, with our system do one simple thing:<br />
 <br />
    A car as to change tyres when the tyre tread hits 5mm , usually we know that this value is true when the car runs 25000Kms.<br />
So i think that w`ill have mesurement type :<br />
<br />
        indepent var - Kms run ( Km )<br />
        dependent var - tyre tread ( mm )<br />
        follow up activity - Change Tyres<br />
        norm value ( depend Var ) - 5mm<br />
        norm value  ( independ var ) - 25000Km<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
 - Can baan correct the predicted inspections based on the past inspection registration ?<br />
- Can baan trigger the follow up activity once we reach the depend variable norm value ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
In reply to your questions:<br />
<br />
- Q: Can baan correct the predicted inspections based on the past inspection registration?<br />
- A: This should be possible when you run the session Generate Predictions and should work only if you have been very disciplined in registering your historical inspection registration information.<br />
<br />
- Q: Can baan trigger the follow up activity once we reach the depend variable norm value ?<br />
- A: No, you have to do this manually.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Since I wrote a big part of the Student Manual myself when I was still with BAAN Company I know it should work according to the procedure you can find in the book.<br />
Obviously it does not work that way for you so in order for me to help you further I would require access to the system you are testing on. This may be a problem but it is the only way for me to see with my own eyes what is going on.<br />
This is the best answer I can give you at this time. <br />
<br />
Did you log a case with BAAN Support already?<br />
Since they have access to your system they should be in a better position to help you further.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
I would really like  you to access my system , and iÂ´ll be working on that. <br />
<br />
Yes i did log a case do Baan Support, and they say :<br />
- &quot;there is currently no feedback flow from inspection registration on Baan 5.0c&quot; <br />
and more:<br />
-  &quot;... there will be some degree in Baan 6.0c&quot; .<br />
FutureWare ??<br />
<br />
What is happenig to those people, can they rigth a manual saying that the system has this funcionality, and then its not there and they say its Std Functionality ?.<br />
<br />
Please comment, and i will be in touch.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I am more than willing to help you here and suggest we continue our conversation off-line.<br />
I understand you are upset but right now the best thing to do is to look at the issue and to get a resolution for you.<br />
Please send me an e-mail at evdborg@hotmail.com and we can discuss further.<br />
