Is there a way we can disable tax on Service Contract invoices? I found that if we set the Tax field to No Tax in Customer table, that will do the trick but we do not want to do that way as it will effect other tax processing. We can also take off the tax code on the form 2 of Maintain Contracts (tssma2120m000) session but this is prone to errors as these fields get defaulted with customer and the user might forget to remove it. <br />
<br />
On the Maintain Contract Type (tssma2124m000) session, If I look at the help of field Sales/Service/Rental indicator it states:<br />
<br />
&quot;The Sales/Service/Rental indicator indicates the type of tax processing required for each contract type since service and rentals can be taxed differently.&quot; <br />
<br />
Could anyone explain to me how we can use this field to control the way tax are processed on service contracts.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.</div></div><hr />
