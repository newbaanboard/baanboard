<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">6th February 2009, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm here in a project where we want to plan different engineers on one service order activity. However, these engineers will not work all the time together on one activity. For example, first there will be five guys working on it, then two of them will go to another project, and then later again three other specialists may join.<br />
<br />
Eventually the planning data (start and end times) in ERP LN Service and with Infor Service Scheduler are by *activity*, not by *assignments*. The assignments just mirror the dates on the activity. If you move (in time) the assignment of one engineer in the scheduler, the assignments of the other engineers are moved as well. So, no two different engineers may be planned on the same activity, but with different times.<br />
<br />
Having one activity by engineer is not an option, since this would be violating the concept of an activity as indicating *what* has to be done, not *how*.<br />
<br />
Any ideas / experiences how to solve this issue?<br />

<br />
let me explain an approach being a bit different from what you might expect!<br />
<br />
There is a possible solution using Open Plan, (information: 3th party solutions)<br />
<br />
Open Plan is a top class Scheduling tool that is linked to Baan (IV,V,LN)<br />
<br />
Open Plan is capable of planning resources, being attached to the same Activity, at different times. One resource at the beginning, one in the middle of the duration and another one at the end. Or overlapping, or starting at the same time, but colsing the word at different end dates.<br />
<br />
Currently Open Plan is linked with TP, PCS, SFC and Procurement. We discuss with several Clients to come up with a link for TS too, linking Preventive Maintainance and Service Order / Activities / Tasks to Open Plan as well.<br />
<br />
So, if this approach is of interest for you, lets talk about it.<br />
<br />
