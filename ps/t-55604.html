Take a example. <br />
The power generator need maintenance after every 300 hours of use. But the generator is used only when there is power failure, hence there is no daily use. Is there any session in service module in which i will record use of generator hours date wise and once the maximum limit is crossed, the system will create new service order.<br />

<br />
you can tryout the combination of TRP(Tools Requirement planning)and Service.Make an Item &quot;Generator&quot; having both tool and services data.keep its refubrishing point 300 hrs.<br />
<br />
Now what you have to do is keep its life cycle,maintenance cycle properly. Generate its prediction properly.Now you have to link this item as the Estimated tool in the production order of any item in which generator is used.when it will be processed you can give how many hrs are booked.When it will rech to its refabrusing pts.(300 hrs) it will generate a service order (you have to link it with cluster,referance activity,prediction first).<br />
<br />
I think this can fulfill your requirement.And regarding report you can customized it.<br />
<br />
If you have any quary please let me know.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cleydek</div><div class="date">19th June 2009, 11:26</div></div><div class="posttext">You can incorporate into the maintenance plan the concept of production hours as an additional indicator for reaching a maintenance threshold. It is not completely automatically generating the service orders, for that Infor needs to finish this item or a customization needs to be built. But without that still in combination with some business procedures you can come a long way.<br />
<br />
Here is what out-of-the-box available is and how you can set it up:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Define measurement type: e.g. Operating Hours as dependent variable / Time as independent variable/ Increasing   <br />
 Associate this measurement type with Service Item/Serialized Item. <br />
 Define Reference Activity (Inspection) with measurement type. <br />
 Define Maintenance Concept and set the time and (norm) usage interval. <br />
 Define Inspection Template for Reference Activity and Service Item (create one Operating Hours inspection and some condition measurements with cyclic increasing/decreasing trend with define follow up activity) <br />
 Generate Predicted Activities and check the increase in usage norm for each activity. <br />
 Generate Planned Activities and check the increase in usage norm for each individual planned activity <br />
 Transfer to Service Order (NOTE: this is an area for Roadmap improvement to further automate the comparison of actual value on serialized item with nom value on (non executed) planned activities) <br />
 Release Service Order and check Inspections <br />
 Fill usage inspection and check the value modification on serialized item (this also works in PDA) <br />
 Fill condition inspections and check the outside limits report (should highlight outside norm inspections) <br />
 Create Service Order for defined follow up activity from Specific menu in Inspections History. (NOTE: this is also an area for Roadmap Improvement to make a batch session for this step)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Let me know how you proceed and/or if you need more help getting it to work.</div></div><hr />

I had the same scenario in Ln FP5 as mentioned above.<br />
Actually i had to raise the service order once the motors running hour crosses the value of 3000 hrs.I tried ur steps but not getting the Service orders.<br />
Actually i am not understanding the following step -<br />
<br />
* Define Maintenance Concept and set the time and (norm) usage interval. <br />
In maintenance Concept Where we set the time and Usage Interval?<br />
Please can u elaborate this?<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance<br />
