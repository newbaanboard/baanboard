<br />
I would like to know how it works the &quot;issue stock&quot; button in the tssoc2521m000 session.<br />
<br />
When I link a material to a service order and select the option &quot;from warehouse&quot; in the delvery type field, this button doesn´t works. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
I have defined in the whinh0520m000 session a issue order wich just  need to generate outbound.<br />
<br />
I thought that the &quot;Issue stock&quot; button would have generate automatically in the background all the process, but what happens is that I must go to generate the outbound process manually, so the &quot;issue stock&quot; button it isn´t necessary. That´s ok?. In which case it works?.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In case you want to issue stock for a service order and out of a warehouse it is important the service order, service order activity and the cost line have the right status.<br />
As long as these are either &quot;Free&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot; nothing will happen. The minimum status has to be &quot;Released&quot;. If this requirement has been met you can use the &quot;Issue Stock&quot; button.<br />
<br />
If you want to issue stock on a service order automatically then the right way to do this is via Generate Outbound in Warehousing. In case you defined a warehouse order type with activities to just generate outbound then this done in Warehousing and not in Service.<br />
You can issue stock on a service order and out of a warehouse without going through Warehousing. Then you should not use  Delivery Type &quot;From Warehouse&quot;. This has to be &quot;From Warehouse in Car&quot; for example.<br />
<br />
My question to you is: What do you want to do? Go through Warehousing and run Generate Outbound (automated process)? or use the &quot;Issue Stock&quot; feature in Service (manual process)? <br />
<br />

<br />
What I wanted to know was when is possible to use the &quot;Issue Stock&quot; feature in Service, because I thought that it would be able with any &quot;Delivery Type&quot; but I see it isn´t.<br />
<br />
I would like to use the manual process and you say that it´s possible with &quot;From Warehouse in Car&quot; and I´ve seen is possible too with &quot;From service unit&quot;. <br />
<br />
There is any other one?<br />
<br />

<br />
There are several Delivery Types available with each different consequences,<br />
In case you use &quot;From Warehouse in Car&quot; the system will take inventory out of a warehouse without going through the process in Warehousing by using Generate Outbound.<br />
If you use &quot;From Service Inventory&quot; then you will issue stock without using a warehouse at all. This is more meant for srews, nuts and bolts.<br />
<br />
I do not have BAAN V Service in front of me so I am not able to explain the rest of the options here. If you want to know more about the other Delivery Types I would like to refer you to the help text or the BAAN V Service training manual.<br />
<br />

<br />
You have explain me what I wanted to know. <br />
<br />
I thought that the functionality of the &quot;issue stock&quot; button was greater and in any case, but I see that it depends on the &quot;Delivery type&quot;.<br />
