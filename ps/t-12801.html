Create a service order activity and add estimated material / labour<br />
<br />
Now just before releasing the order , I remembered that I havent given the engineer. When I put the engineer and try to save the order it gives me an error <br />
<br />
&quot;reschedule option is not active. Service engineer must be assigned&quot;<br />
<br />
a) Why am I getting this error??? any suggestions<br />
<br />
If I go through Service order&gt; specific &gt; Engineer and assign engineers I am able to release the order. but wait...once its released I can delete the engineers again.  <br />
<br />
b) what effect will this have ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I am not paid to defend BAAN's Service functionality please log a case with BAAN Support for this.<br />
As far as I know there is no logic here at all and the functionality seems to change with the SP's.<br />
Every time it is difficult to explain why the system works the way it works.<br />
<br />

<br />
but I thought of bouncing off the question here first because I am sure there would be very few in support who would be able to answer this question too..</div></div><hr />
