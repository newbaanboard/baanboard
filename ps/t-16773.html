<br />
My main problem is that, even though we don´t estimate costs, when i run the batch if the estimated cost line is not created, the line is not inserted because it doesn´t find the tssoc230.cmbb field.<br />
<br />
Does any one know a way to work around this situation without being to estimate a cost line for all activities.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />

<br />
The functionality regarding the booking of costs in BAAN V Service has changed so many times with the different Service Packs.<br />
It is not easy to say anymore why a certain procedure was intended to do this or that.<br />
My suggestion is that you built a script such that whenever you want to register hours in tssoc you first create an estimate line of zero dollars and then execute the transaction you want to do.<br />
In that case you will follow the business application logic and will be sure that with new functionality in the next SP you most likely will be safe.<br />
If you try to work around the zero dollar estimate line you will run a big risk of bumping into future problems.<br />
