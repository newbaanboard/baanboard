<br />
I know in Baan V the system generates the purchase order automatically but in Baan IV I can´t find it, perhaps it´s a manual process but in this case it seems you don´t have any relation between the purchase order and the service order.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
In BAAN IV there is no functionality to generate a purchase order for subcontracting out of Service.<br />
However, you can generate a PO for material out of the estimate lines in BAAN IV Service. So please test whether it is possible to set up a 'cost' item as subcontracting and create a PO for this item. I am not sure whether a cost item will work but perhaps you are lucky here.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this worked.<br />

I,m afraid is not possible what you suggest. I´ve tried it but system doesn´t allows to define the line as subcontract and use a cost item.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway</div></div><hr />

Perhaps that other members have a better idea for you. Otherwise you have to come up with a manual process and have a disconnect between the purchase order and the service order.<br />
