<br />
After implementing BaaN Projects, Here is small note on that.<br />
<br />
BaaN Projects Functionality takes care of almost all of the functionalities of Civil Construction Industry. In fact, we felt every Module in that is meant for Construction Industry itself.<br />
<br />
Few Good ones are Budgetting and Control, <br />
1. From a Single Budget - ELEMENT BUDGET, one can derive      ACTIVITY BUDGET &amp; COST COMPONENT BUDGET and also Control the Project by ELEMENT, ACTIVITY and COST COMPONENT. <br />
This infact helps very much for Project Control by different Roles.<br />
<br />
For Senior Management  - Project Control by COST COMPONENT<br />
For Quantity Surveyors - Project Control by ELEMENT<br />
For Planning Engineers - Project Control by ACTIVITY.<br />
<br />
2. The Project Planning Board might not be as flexible as Primavera but scores a point over Primavera in Network planning (critical Path Analysis).<br />
<br />
There are many other points to note the good ones, But Let me also tell U few drawbacks.<br />
1.The Invoicing Module needs extensive Custmoization.<br />
2.The Parameter Project Budget/Project Control in Maintain Projects does'nt allow U have Project Control by ACTIVITY and also PROGRESSIVE INVOICING. This is the major drawback of BaaN as a Solution for Construction Industry. I am not aware whether BaaN has taken care of it in BaaN V OR...<br />
<br />
Well, seeing most of the Construction Industry Clients going for JDEdwards ( may be agrresive marketting), As BaaNits we can very well recommend for BaaN as a Tailor made ERP for Construction Industry. <br />
<br />
The above are few points for BaaN - Civil Construction Industry<br />
<br />

<br />
We are very interested in implementing Baan for a construction company here in Latin America.  <br />
In which country did you implemented the solution.  How long did it take.  How large is the construction company ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sri_baan</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 05:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Pl find below answers for UR querries.<br />
<br />
1. We implemented BaaN for a Construction Industry in Middle East (UAE).<br />
<br />
2. It took us nearly 8 months (but Clients involvement is a key factor in implementing BaaN in less or more than 8 months).<br />
<br />
3. The Company'S turnover is around 200 Million US$<br />
<br />
4. It manages around 20-25 Projects at a time.<br />
<br />
If U have any further querries Pl feel free to mail me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">20th March 2002, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Over and above the standard product, there is a construction specific version based on Baan IVb and c that has a lot of customers in the Netherlands and surrounding areas.  I don't know its present status, because it was part of the BBS/VBS stable, and briefly was its own company BBCS (Baan Brothers Construction Systems).  I know there were a lot of enhancements, particularly in generating subcontract orders for work packages.  It only used Element Budgets, but did have installment invoicing.  I have seeen it integrated to PowerProject - a PM package commonly used in UK construction, which worked in a similar manner to MS project integration in Baan ERP.  One problem that is likely to be encountered is that almost every country has different regulations to ensure that self-employed construction workers actually pay tax, so the first implementation in any country will take a customisation hit to cope with this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you know of any out-of-the-box package in the UK that interfaces with BAAN Project and deals with a correct way of: <br />
<br />
- handling subcontracting without invoicing?<br />
- cost based revenue recognition?<br />
<br />
I liked your final comment and agree with you there. However, I believe BAAN Project is a very good fit for construction companies all over the world and not just The Netherlands.<br />

<br />
I know that VBS contracted Origin to provide a UK solution for subcontractors.  This included recognition of subcontractor status, and provided for a schedule of expected payments. claim processing, retentions and tax handling.  Not quite out of the box, but it probably still exists on a system somewhere!<br />
<br />
In terms of revenue recognition, the construction project I worked on used milestone achievement as a trigger for revenue rather than recorded progress, absorbed costs or earned value.  I suspect that the A&amp;D version has rather stronger functionality for claiming installment payments on the basis of work done than does the construction variant.<br />
<br />
I agree that the Project package, with or without the Construction add-on, offers a sound platform for construction opportunities.  I've even noticed the 'c word' reappearing on Baan.com recently!<br />
<br />
