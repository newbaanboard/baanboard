Can anyone tell me how to do invoicing having Contract Type &quot;Cost Plus&quot; and Invoice Type &quot;Unit Rate&quot;.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulrich Hofmann</div><div class="date">27th February 2014, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Sanjay:<br />
Cost Plus: Applies to Contract Lines / Extensions<br />
Cost Plus has no (real) limit. Invoicing is allowed, till the job is ready!<br />
How does it work: under cost plus agreement, for each recorded hour, material or other cost object an invoice record will be created in Cost Plus Invoicing.<br />
Assume: 100 hours recorded in TP * 20 Euro / h = 2.000 Euro / hour.<br />
Invoice: 2.000,-  Euro<br />
Now the next hours can be recorded and invoived<br />
Note: For Hours there need to be a sales price (from Employee, Task, Trade Group..)<br />
<br />
Now Progress Invoicing:<br />
Contract or Extension<br />
But not on Cost Object Level, but from Element (direct) or Activitiy<br />
In the Element / Activity a Sales Prices can be inserted.<br />
Progress can be recorded on Element / Activity<br />
The Sales price * Progress is calculated as the Unit Rate<br />
Invoice Amount Unit Rate * Quantity * Progress<br />
<br />
Hope, this will help!<br />
Cheers<br />

I just want to know can we invoice having contract type &quot;Cost Plus&quot; &amp; Invoice type &quot;Unit Rate&quot;. If it is possible , then how we can do it .<br />
<br />
As System allows us to keep this combination of contract type and invoice type in project definition, it should work , but how it will work in system I just want to know that.<br />

<br />
Personally, I think it will not work, because cost plus is on Cost Objects, Unit Rate on Elements, so I doubt it something useful is coming out!<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was also having the same feeling that it will not work. Just wanted to confirm from others also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotjens</div><div class="date">18th March 2014, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">It will work. With contract type Cost Plus 2 choices are still possible for the invoice type: Cost Plus (detailed invoicing as explained by Ulrich) and Unit Rate (either based on elements or activities as also explained by Ulrich). Using unit rate there is less detail for invoicing as not the individual (cost) transactions are considered for invoicing but the higher level prices as set on element (or activity).</div></div><hr />
