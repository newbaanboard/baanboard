<br />
Initially we created a contract for 24 months. This Service Contract was cancelled after 4 months because the customer did not pay.<br />
<br />
Now customer calls back again, pays the dues and wants to continue with the service contract, so what the user has done is he created a new contract  with pending duration of the initial contract ( 20 months), but after this 20 months the contracts needs to be renewed again for 1 year.<br />
<br />
So what the user tries to do is:<br />
Create contract with duration = 20 months in Terms tab  through session tsctm3100m000. <br />
<br />
And in contract changes tab under contract renewal period field put 1 year.<br />
<br />
Test Server Simulated Case<br />
After this Configuration lines is created, here the effective date and expiry date is as in the contract header i.e for 20 months.<br />
<br />
Below is the effective date and expiry period of both service contract and configuration line no 10.<br />
<br />
Effective date : 30/04/2012<br />
Expiry Date : 29/12/2013<br />
<br />
Now when we try to activate the contract changes, the system show the following message.<br />
<br />
&quot;The effectivity of Configuration Line 10 must fall within the effectivity period of Service Contract &lt;Service Contract No&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
The below case is in production server and same case when simulate in test server we get the scenario as stated above.<br />
<br />
Production Server Case<br />
If we check the configuration lines it takes the dates with renewal period and not the Service Contract Period .<br />
<br />
Duration of Service Contract<br />
Effective date : 30/04/2012<br />
Expiry Date : 29/12/2013<br />
<br />
Duration of Configuration Lines<br />
Effective date : 30/04/2012<br />
Expiry Date : 29/04/2013<br />
<br />
If we try to change the expiry date in Configuration Lines from 29/04/2013<br />
 to 29/12/2013 it gives the following error message :<br />
<br />
&quot;Configuration Line expiry date must be earlier or equal to the expiry date of the header&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please let me know how do we tackle the issue, if this is a bug and any standard solutions needs to be installed to fix this issue. Is there any other way out to handle the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radhagkrishna</div><div class="date">4th May 2012, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I also observed the same situation in Contract changes. See details below. <br />
<br />
Renewal is always for the Contract period. In case if we change it manually according to our requirement, the configuration lines will work based on renewal period. See the example below.<br />
<br />
Scenario 1: <br />
<br />
Effective date: 30/04/2012<br />
Expiry Date: 29/12/2013<br />
Contract period: 20 months<br />
And Renewal is: 20 months. <br />
<br />
In the above scenario you wonâ€™t face any problem. Because Renewal period is equal to Contract period. <br />
<br />
In case if the Renewal period is only 12 months, system will treat the configuration duration as 1 year, though the contract period is 20 months.<br />
<br />
And also we can enter renewal field when we create the contract. Try to create a contract and attach configuration lines etc... Then go to renewal field and remove and select the same field again. Then system will directly take the contract period as renewal period. We cannot modify that field also.<br />
<br />
This is what I explored from system and system behavior. Unfortunately I did not get chance to log an incident with Infor. But practically speaking, this is a bug. It does not solve business requirment. Please log an incident to Infor for the solution. I would be happy, if you can let me know the solution from Infor.<br />
<br />
