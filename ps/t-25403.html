<br />
In service, for a spare part item with one serial number if it is replaced with another serial number using Replace Components session in the Maintain Actual Service Order Cost and Revenues, the replaced spare part does not get into stock of To Warehouse. (though in the Replace Installation Component session it asks for a To Warehouse).<br />
<br />
Do I miss any setup or this is a functionality.<br />
<br />
Please help if you have faced this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I think it's functionality.  Service component movement does not create stock transactions; it's a very simplified way of recording which serially numbered assemblies are mounted on which installations.  Say you have a machine shop with three lathes sharing ten drill heads, you can just about record which drill is on which lathe, and of the ones not mounted, which are ready for use and which are in refurbishment.  It's a way of extending the knowledge of the structure of the maintained unit beyond just locations and installations.  From 5.0 onwards the whole concept is scrapped and replaced by a 99 level configuration structure where you do have material movements between maintained assets and the inventory environment.<br />

thanks for ur reply<br />
<br />
we got it ok with a work-around ;<br />
<br />
while maintaining actual costs, record the spare parts replaced as a Return with -ve Qty and go thru Maintain O/B to take add the stock of this spare part in some some DAMAGED location. (there can be a profitablity going wrong with this since it will have a cost and returned at 0 price... we have see it though, if you have any suggestion on this pls)<br />
<br />
thanks again..<br />
