What could be possible causes? Where should I start?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">1st September 2011, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">In order to get a work order you should raise a Maintenance Sales Order of type maintenance.  Then when the item for repair is received into a customer-owned warehouse the work order is created automatically</div></div><hr />

<br />
the message you are seeing is because the item to be repaired has not been received in the repair department.<br />
<br />
As I recall;<br />
Set the W/O to planned - this creates the warehouse order<br />
There is a warehouse process to go through and then the last step is on the work order screen &quot;item receipt&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
hope that helps<br />

PS as Jeff says it is better to use the MSO to create the work order</div></div><hr />

I can set the order to planned, and a warehouse order is created. When I finish that, (go thru all steps and no problem occurs) a new wh order of type issue from the same warehouse as previously one is created. <br />
<br />
I can never click &quot;Item receipt&quot; and I don't have any recepit for the shipped item. It seems to me that the item is shipped out and gone.</div></div><hr />
