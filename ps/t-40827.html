<br />
Our organisation runs fairly major project on Baan 4 currently and we are looking to upgrade to LN.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to find out if there is anyway to handle this situation cleanly in LN. <br />
For every project we prepare our budget on a high level initially because most times we do not have all the details. So we would only know the contract amount and an estimated budget. For example contract = $1,000,000 and estimated budget $800,000.<br />
<br />
As we know further down the track we want to be able to fill in each area (elements) and want the system to be able to draw from the budget $800,000. For example an element we set up is installation so when we put in a subcontract cost object to the value of $200,000 we want to be able to see that we have $600,000 of the budget left to work with.<br />
<br />
Tried looking at using the top down budget method but this looks to only work for activity budget or have I misunderstood the functionality there.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply. When using the activities and Top Down budget, how would the control data be generated? or would I still need to key in the budget at the low level activities for the control data to be generated?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DFisch</div><div class="date">23rd August 2007, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">most of the functionalities are the same with activity budget like by using element budget. On your project header you must setup, that will generate control data on activity level.<br />
Some customers of me are using only activities, but the higher levels of them are used like elements.<br />

<br />
Thanks for you assistance. I will give this a go.</div></div><hr />

sorry I haven't seen that you are on BaanIV.<br />
I'm not sure, but think, that top down an time phased budget is only available for BaanERP and ERP LN. Maybe someone else can tell us this definitively.<br />

<br />
this functionality is not available in IV but as the original question states that LN is being explored that should not be much of a problem. It might be good however to point out that the functionality around activities has been expanded in LN even while compared to 5.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">luke_j</div><div class="date">28th September 2007, 10:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the confusion ... we are upgrading to LN. The functionality I was seeking is for LN.<br />
<br />
We also wanted to steer away from top down budgeting as such as it appears to be quite a bit more work to set up.</div></div><hr />
