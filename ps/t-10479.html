<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
I'm on BaaN IVc<br />
<br />
I'am getting a mistake in TP network planning (session tppss2230m000):<br />
<br />
I have 3 activities:<br />
##001, 002, 003. Originally they have the same start date.<br />
<br />
They have the following relations:<br />
002-&gt;001 finish-to-start<br />
002-&gt;003 finish-to-start<br />
<br />
When I perform network planning (session tppss2230m000), the relation 002-&gt;003 does work well, activity 003 start date moves after 002 finish.<br />
BUT the relation 002-&gt;001 does not work at all, 001 start date remains the same, I'm getting a message like &quot;Relation #(002-&gt;001) is not active&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've found out that the matter is in activity code - like in my example.<br />
<br />
Have anyone dealt with this mistake? What can you suggest?<br />
<br />
Thanking in advance,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />

You can also attach your screen shots in your BaanBoard post. In that case other people (like myself) can take a look as well and see how we can help you.<br />

<br />
The Network Planning doesnt consider the Activty Code for any of its logic, It depends on the relations set up between the activities.<br />
<br />
But still to analyse how Michail is getting a different relationship after network Planning.<br />

Just as a little test, set the status for all activities to &quot;active&quot; and run the generate network session again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
itÂ´s been a while since last working with TP-Project, so I may also be wrong:<br />
<br />
1.) Session tppss0110m000 - Maintain Plan<br />
- Start date Network is 15.05.2003 <br />
- Positioning of activities is  &quot;Earliest&quot;<br />
<br />
2.) Session tppss2120m000 - Maintain Activities<br />
- as you stated, only activity 002 has &quot;Firm Planned&quot; switched to yes<br />
<br />
3.) No relation between activieties 001 and 003 in session tppss2130 - Maintain Activity relationships<br />
<br />
Maybe if you insert a relation between 001 and 003 with Relationsship Type Start/Start, it could work!?!<br />
<br />

Thank you all for the suggestions.<br />
I've worked it out.<br />
We just installed later service pack for TP (#11, if I'm not mistaken) and the problem was solved - everything works well.<br />
<br />
Thank you all once more - your ideas helped me to prove the decision to install new service pack.<br />
