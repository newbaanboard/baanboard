<br />
Quite possibly they could be ERP 5.b functionality renamed or enhanced but having trouble getting a description from Baan web-site.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

E-Service is meant for unassisted service and self-service by customers via the web. They can log their own calls, look up calls (open and closed) and do some queries on product information to see if there have ever been any problems reported on the product they themselves have issues with.<br />
E-Service interfaces with tsclm.<br />
<br />
E-Service Remote is basically a way for service technicians to work on service orders/activities remotely. They have to download their service orders, go off-line work on the service orders/activities, report time and material and then go on-line again to upload the data to a web server. The next step is that the data will be synced with the back end.<br />
This is now only available on a laptop in BAAN V and I expect BAAN to come up with a wireless solution within a year or so for this.<br />
<br />
The Service Scheduler is a new way of scheduling service order activities. It should replace the Service Planningboard and has much more functionality associated to it.<br />
Unfortunately it is not GA yet but I know companies that are (in the process of) installing it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

E-Service is a clientless application and operates purely on a website.  As well as connected to Call Management, it can operate in stand-alone mode, ie not connected to a Baan implementation at all.  It has a diagnostic 'knowledge tree' capability similar (but unfortunately not shared) to that in Calls.  It works with 5.0b and c.<br />
<br />
E-Service Remote is a medium client application.  The client itself is small, and downloads automatically on first log-in and whenever new versions are available.  The supporting master data: service items; configurations/objects; orders/activities etc. is held as a SQL database on the client.  This obviously varies by implementation, but can run into megabytes and is the primary reason it is only a laptop application at present.  It works with 5.0b and c.<br />

The scheduler was GA'd last week</div></div><hr />
