I have a rpoblem while printing the Project Planning Board on Postscript printer because always consider to have a A4 paper size.<br />
I have also submitted the proble to Baan support through Watermark company and the problem was identified in an error of &quot;ttstpconv&quot;.<br />
Due to this the problem has never been solved and I heve never succeded in printing the Plan.<br />
Did anybody of you encountered the same problem ? <br />
Does anybody print Planning Board on plotter (A0 format) ?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any suggestion or information.<br />
<br />
ps. I'm working on Baan IVc4 sp7</div></div><hr />

<br />
We also faced the same problem and logged a case with baan , but no concrete reply till date. It only prints with A4 Paper!!!!<br />
<br />
Only way out is to get the plan data in another software like Primavera or MS Projects and then Print as per the convinience.<br />
<br />
Another advantage of taking the data to another tool is that U can have aggregated Progress of Activities at the Parent Activity level ( which is not possible in Baan planning board ).<br />

<br />
Not only do you need papertype A4 but also a post-script device.<br />
I agree with Sridhar that it is better to invest some money in an external planningboard.<br />
Perhaps OpenPlan Professional is an option as well.<br />
