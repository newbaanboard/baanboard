<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andyhoward99</div><div class="date">3rd February 2004, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">We are attempting to compile a list of Baan clients who are using Projects functionality.  Additionally we are interested in how Projects is being used.  This is not an attempt to sell work, but an atttempt to improve our clients understanding.  If you have any information please contact me.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be interested in such a list, but only for the UK. Your profile doesn't state where you're based, and the usage of projects varies massively by region/country. In the Netherlands there are loads of companies that use it, here in the UK there are very few.<br />
<br />
Also, there are multiple versions of projects. TP in Baan IV and V are very different, and then there is also the A&amp;D version which is different again.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you should be a bit more specific about the information you want, and a commitment to share the information with the rest of us would perhaps encourage people to respond.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andyhoward99</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Fair enough.  The client I am working with is using Baan 5c.  The projects functionality we are looking to use:<br />
<br />
1.  Project Set-up<br />
2.  Budget Management<br />
3.  Cost Management<br />
4.  Revenue Management (Revenue recognition utilizing multiple methods, milestone/progressing billing, margin analysis, utilizing multiple currencies on single project)<br />
5.  Material Planning via. PRP<br />
6.  Procurement both standard and project specific<br />
7.  Inbound and Outbound logistics from the project<br />
8.  Assembly utilizing WBS <br />
<br />
<br />
I would absolutely be willing to share this information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">6th February 2004, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We support one client in the UK that uses Baan V Projects (and PCS). They use fairly large projects (100+ activities, 1000+ budget lines). Project plans are maintained in MS-Project. Element budgeting is not used; invoicing is always fixed price, milestone driven.<br />
<br />
There are customisations to the Baan-MSP interface and customisations to add backflushing functionality for labour cost (as exists in Manufacturing) to Projects.<br />
<br />
The Projects / PCS link is used to make project specific items, but no project specific items are ever purchased.<br />
<br />
To address the areas you mentioned:<br />
Budget management, cost management, PRP all work fine for us. <br />
Revenue management is an issue, the functionality for interim results is limited (it allows you to take interim revenue and cost, but there isn't much to help you establish what the 'cost of sales' was). I suppose that is because there is no standard way of doing this, every client will have different rules for this.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit confused about you mentioning outbound logistics. Projects doesn't do any inbound or outbound really. Materials are outbound from warehousing to a project, but there is nothing in Projects to do the corresponding inbound. You can return items from a project back to stock, but a project doesn't create any 'manufactured' items that you could return to a warehouse. I would not even try to use Projects for manufacture to stock scenarios, use PCS instead.</div></div><hr />

They also use e-projcet and e-time and expense.<br />
