<br />
We are in BaaN Ivc3. Does anyone know why the tssma3170m000 (estimated matierals) session it has only 2 digits and 2 decimals for estimated quantity?. It is only possible to enter upto 99.99 quantity. Is there any reason for this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
I have no idea why that has been decided but this does not stop you from extending the length of the field.<br />
This can be done in BAAN Tools and make sure the same change is carried forward to all the related fields.<br />
<br />
Please ask one of your Tools guys to do this or post a message in the Tools forum of BaanBoard.<br />
<br />

I had no probles modifying the lenght of this field. Also I have not heard from our Service Department so far, since the change. The only think was, we have to modify some display sessions and reports were coming up with some #### sings.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

The ### are format issues I believe.<br />
Please place a post in the Tools forum in case you need more technical help.<br />
This is not my area of expertise.<br />

There will be a format code associated with the form field that defines how the number is shown.  If you change it to a format code with greater length and compile the form, that should change the display.</div></div><hr />

the table field is linked to domain tssma.qana which has display format as Z9VD99. I think it is not ok this format. Anyway, for us I removed it the fomat.<br />
