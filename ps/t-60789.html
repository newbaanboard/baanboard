<br />
I am facing problem while copying activities activities more than 26 times.<br />
<br />
while running sub session tppss2201m000 copy activities, this session copies activity only 28 times but not more than that.<br />
<br />
For eg, i have an activity 001 using the above session it copies the activities<br />
using incremental code as alphabets like<br />
001 A<br />
001 B<br />
001 C<br />
 . <br />
 . <br />
 .<br />
001 Z<br />
001 [<br />
001 /<br />
<br />
after Z it start using symbols mentioned above. Also it copies till 28 times and not after that.<br />
<br />
I have to copy one activity near about 200 times<br />
<br />
Can anybody provide me the solution or any alternative</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you use such a strange range of copying activities?<br />
In my 15 years of TP Project experience I have never seen such a range.<br />
Isn't there another way to define your activities and make the copy process easier?<br />
If you want to load these activities into the MS Project interface you may run into problems later on.<br />
<br />
I am not aware that you can only copy 28 times and have never heard there are limitations here.<br />
In case you get any error messages from the system please share those via a print screen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed very interesting!<br />
I suggest to log a case with Infor Support to find out what is going on here because I have never seen this before.<br />

<br />
I agree with Edwin concerning the coding of activities! It is a rather strange coding system! <br />
Is there any particular reason for it? In most cases planners would create a coding system which is creating group codes for different parts of plans i.e. for Design, Procurement, Assembly etc.<br />
<br />
That would give you flexibility during projects, where - in most cases - creating additional activities is the rule rather then the exeption.<br />
<br />
kind regards</div></div><hr />
