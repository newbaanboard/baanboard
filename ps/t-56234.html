<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">attakarn</div><div class="date">29th June 2009, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Please help!!, I would like to be able to split work order after some activities performed. I try to use creating follow up work order for anonyumous item type but seems like not allow by LN.  Can you give some idea on this?  I cannot use serialized item type because I have quantity of part more than 100.   After split work order, I will not move it back to the main work order.  (for example, qty = 100. At the midle of process, I want to split work order into 2 work orders 60 ea and 40 ea, main work order will go to next activity, 2nd work order will add more activity and go until the end.)<br />
Thx.</div></div><hr />

As per the standard functionality , we cannot split the production order into different lines, however we can short close the order, return back the desired qty and create new work order.<br />

That can be a woraround<br />
