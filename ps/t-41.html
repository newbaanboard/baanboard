Is this a showing of the divide in Manfacturing processes in the areas? How great is this divide in other areas of Baan?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We manage all of our site work with TP; when there is a requirement to perform a repair in our workshops, we create a link between a PCS project and the main TP project, with the TP project essentially being the 'customer' of the PCS  project.<br />
<br />
The Works make use of PCS as they fit in with the more tradition manufacturing concepts of work centres and machines. This is all standard Baan IVc functionality.<br />
<br />
We ahve successfully managed a number of large project using TP. Duration anything from 6 weeks to 18 months.</div></div><hr />
