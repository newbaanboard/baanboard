<br />
I have declared Priority warehouse in Projects (tppdm6500m000) Planning Tap, and also defined Items-Planning (cprpd1100m000) for an item with cluster one default warehouse and without cluster one default warehouse. <br />
     When PRP engine is run for generating Planned orders it is checking only those warehouses which are attached to projects, and Items-Planning not all other warehouses ( where there is more then sufficient inventory in other warehouses) and says no Time phased inventory on those three warehouses and generated Planned Purchase Orders.<br />
     Now the problem is since there are inventory on other warehouses, I like to have Planned Warehouse Order so that I don't want to Purchase materials, as Inventory is there. <br />
    I have attached screen shots of the problem for your reference.<br />
<br />
With advance Thanks<br />

in my oppinion the system checks only the other warehouses in the same cluster like the preffered warehouse of the project. If you have no stock in the prio-warehouse, but in another warehouse of the same cluster, the system generates a planned prp-wh-order from the alternative warehouse to the project and not a prp-purchase-order.<br />
so beware: I am not really sure about this, a had an inquiry sometimes ago about this and I do not remember the details in this moment...<br />
Try it.<br />

I check and found PRP engine looks for the prio.warehouse and then checks for default warehouses in Item planning data with respect to supply relations in EP module, it generates warehouse orders if stock present, else generates Purchase Orders. It is not checking all warehouses of the cluster.<br />
Thank You.</div></div><hr />
