<br />
I need a functional documentation on how to use the Service module in Baan IVc4. Can anyone help me?<br />
<br />
I usually work within Manufacturing and Distribution, but I have involved myself in a discussion with the Service manager regarding when to issue material for a service order.<br />
<br />
I want the Service Department to issue the material at the same time they physical move the items out of the Warehouse, to keep control on Inventory on Hand.<br />
The Service Manager says that is a very cumbersome method, and he want to issue the material for the Service Order when the job is completed.<br />
A typical Service Job is to pick up some items from the Warehouse, fly to the other side of the world for 2-3 weeks to do the Service job, return to the WH when the job is done with some items that's not used and issue the material used.<br />
<br />
Isn't it better to issue all items when they are picked from the Warehouse. If the Service guy bring some items back, they can be received in the warehouse by using a negative issue at the same Service order as the item was issued 2-3 weeks earlier.<br />
<br />
I hope some of you have experieces that can help me.<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />
Sturla</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">16th March 2002, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately there is no documentation available for BAAN IV Service that I know of. You should try with BAAN Support and log a case for that.<br />
<br />
Using BAAN IV Service you are right. As soon as the goods leave the warehouse they should be relieved from inventory and you should not wait for the service engineer to complete his service order. When he returns from his job you can then enter the return goods as a negative quantity against the same service order.<br />
For your information if you would be using BAAN V Service the process could be a lot different. There you have much more functionality and so your colleague will have more visibility of what is going on between Warehousing and Service. <br />
However, BAAN IV Service is limited here and you may want to have another process in place where you keep track of inventory between the moment the service engineer takes his goods from the warehouse and the moment he reports the service order completed. You can build a customization for this or build something outside of BAAN.<br />
<br />
If you need more help let me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">20th March 2002, 13:11</div></div><div class="posttext">The way that the service module is set up  is to issue the items on completion of the job.  The reason for this is that materials usage in service is not as predictable as it is in manufacturing (should that be even less predictable?).  It is common for the estimated material for the service order to include parts that are swapped in or out during diagnostics, or a kit that covers a wide range of possible faults.  <br />
<br />
Issuing items at the point of release from the warehouse would mean having lots of returns to manage, or worse, inventory gradually floating out into the uncontrolled environment.  Allowing consumption on completion gives the best chance of getting accurate usage and cost capture.  As you will probably have found out, if the issuing is not done completely, it is not possible to close the order and produce an invoice.  <br />
<br />
I've attached a checklist I put together a few years ago as an aide memoire when setting up service. Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />
