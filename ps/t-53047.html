<br />
Can we use the Preventive Maintenance feature in Manufacturing? Say like setup a scheduled maintenance for machine/work center/resource.<br />
<br />
Any advice is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

A serialized item is associated with the machine and the machine is defined under a cluster (internal one) and a maintenance plan is drawn up for the serialized item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it is also possible to link that machine to a tool in manufacturing. So during the maintenance that tool/machine is not available in manufacturing.<br />

<br />
Does someone have a workbook on LN Service? I am particularly interested in Preventive Maintenance (Internal). <br />
<br />
Ralf's suggestion of using a machine as a Tools under TRP is excellent but is that the only way of blocking a machine for use when a service order is made. I was hoping that a machine would get blocked directly as soon as I release a service order for it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
