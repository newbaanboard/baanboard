<br />
You can view the Reference Activities as a work breakdown structure of the service order (Reference Activities are the basis for Service Order Activities) and Tasks are the detailed specifications of the work done for these Reference Activities/Service Order Activities.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
&lt;Reference Activity&gt; is Installation and the related Tasks can be &lt;Hardware Installation&gt; and &lt;Software Installation&gt;.<br />
<br />
If you let me know what type of business you are in I may be able to give you some ideas related to your specific cases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 For master data setup you have to define a list of reference activities as well as a list of tasks, <br />
ex: reference activity: changing bulb<br />
                               painting<br />
                               changing glass<br />
<br />
  so if we need to change a bulb as a corrective maintenance activity, then the tasks will be, getting a ladder, removing cover of bulb, changing the bulb, reinstalling the glass cover, where an electrician and a helper are required for this corrective action to be done and it will be refferred to &quot;changing bulb&quot; reference activity<br />
<br />
 then if window glass is broken, and the corrective action is getting a ladder, standing up and  removing the glass, &quot; case window is high &quot; then you see how we used the same task &quot; getting a ladder&quot; but here refferring to different reference activity which is &quot; changing glass&quot;<br />
<br />
 so a reference activity will include a set of tasks that will be performed by a maintenance employee/s, where some of these tasks could be a part of other set of tasks to perfom another different activity leading to the need of another reference activity.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this was helpful,<br />
<br />
