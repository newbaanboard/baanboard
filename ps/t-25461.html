<br />
1. I try to  insert the records from  the session, from a  user login for tppdm6100m000. I am getting error as Fatal Error ; Error 254(Commit transactions has failed on audit server) can not continue tppdm6100M000.<br />
<br />
Ex: Maintain projects all forms (1 to 6 filled) while saving I am getting error.<br />
<br />
However I tried from BaaN Login I could enter and save the records for the same session.<br />
<br />
Please advice how to solve.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems you are having big problems with table tppdm600.<br />
A few days ago you posted the problem with database error 1308. <br />
Today you report error 254 (Commit transactions has failed on audit server) and a problem with the text editor in relation to tppdm6100m000.<br />
<br />
There are too many issues going on with your system in only a few days and I have a feeling you are not giving us all the information regarding table tppdm600 and session tppdm6100m000.<br />
<br />
One thing I do believe is that all these problems are related to each other.<br />
My advise at this point in time is to go BAAN Support and let them fix the problems. Log a new case for each problem and make sure they know you have logged multiple cases for the same table and session.<br />
<br />
BaanBoard is no BAAN Support and the problems you are reporting have nothing to do with a user forum.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mahadevan</div><div class="date">26th October 2005, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I have updated  in ttaad4116m00 .options as All other table , e:\audit\# and executed ttaad4111m000 (convert to runtime).<br />
<br />
Now our user is able to enter the records in tppdm600m000.</div></div><hr />
