<br />
Once the status of a service order in LN is changed to &quot;Released&quot; there is no way to move it back to &quot;Free&quot;. This is how the standard functionality works.<br />
Perhaps it is better to use multiple service order activities so when the status of a service order is &quot;Released&quot; you can create a new activity with the status &quot;Free&quot; and then change this to &quot;Released&quot; when needed.<br />
This will give you more flexibility with a service order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume you mean the user unintentionally changed the status of the service order from &quot;Free&quot; to &quot;Released&quot;. In that case he/she should create a second service order activity. The status of this activity is &quot;Free&quot; and the status of the service order is &quot;Released&quot;.<br />
As soon as the user is ready the status of this second activity can be changed to &quot;Released&quot; and all costs and sales amounts can be booked against this one.<br />
At the moment the service order has been completed the user can change the status of the service order, the first activity and the second activity to &quot;Costed&quot;.<br />
<br />
In LN you cannot change the status of the service order back from &quot;Released&quot; to &quot;Free&quot;. Unless you have made a customization and I would not even think about going that route.</div></div><hr />
