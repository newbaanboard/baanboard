<br />
Please let us know what BAAN version you are using and how tax is calculated in your case. Also provide the session number that you are running for generating invoices.<br />
In case of North America many BAAN customers use Vertex for tax calculation.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">15th October 2002, 20:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt the porting set is the reason. Did you install a service pack also? Have you checked with Baan support knowledge base? (www.support.baan.com). Probably there is already a solution for this?<br />

<br />
Are you using Vertex or any other external tax provider software to calculate tax in BAAN? Or do you use the standard BAAN taxes?<br />
<br />
When you logged the post you mentioned you were having problems with tax and Service but later on you indicated the session that causes a problem is tdsls4404m000. That is a Distribution session and so please confirm whether this is your problem session and let me know how that relates to Service.<br />
<br />
I may have to move this post to the Distribution forum.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 10:01</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue that I have with your situation is that you mentioned your company decided to discontinue your support from BAAN.<br />
I don't know the reasons for that but the fact is you guys installed the latest portingset and suddenly tax is no longer calculated and printed on the invoices for tdsls and tssma.<br />
<br />
Currently I am working with an existing b40_c4 customer who is also using Vertex for invoicing in tdsls and tssma and who also installed the latest portingset. They have no problems what so ever in this area and so it looks like the problem is particular to your system.<br />
<br />
BAAN Support could have dialed in for you and based on their findings would be able to resolve the problem for you.<br />
However, you cannot approach them and so you are kind of stuck.<br />
This is truely a difficult situation.<br />
<br />
In order to really help you I actually need to have access to your system and determine what is going on. Additional info is really required in your case so let me know if you are interested and we can take this problem off line.<br />
BaanBoard is not an official site supported by BAAN that replaces BAAN Support. I know you understand this as well but I had to mention it any way.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you want to do and how I can best help you.<br />

I understand this board is not to replace baan support, we are planning on re-instate our contract with them, but not immediately.  Do you happen to know what porting set they installed?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I think it is a wise idea to get a new contract again with BAAN Support. In the long run it is better for you as BAAN is still building new functionalities in b40_c4. I cannot imagine your company does not want to further leverage their investment in BAAN so that should be another reason to have that contract with BGS.<br />
<br />
I will be visiting my b40_c4 customer late next week. Then I will also check what portingset they have installed and let you know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nigel_hoyle</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 05:16</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue with installing the porting set is that it may have removed the compiled Vertex object for the tax provider. When a new porting set is delivered you have to recompile the tax provider libraries against the Baan library. I don't have specifics with me at the moment but if you need then just reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sasa888</div><div class="date">24th October 2002, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, nigel_hoyle.  Could you please tell me how to where to recompile the vertex tax provider? Thank You!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nigel_hoyle</div><div class="date">25th October 2002, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">If you followed the standard porting set installation instructions then you would have created a backup copy of the $BSE/bin directory. If this is true then copy the file api6.1 from you backup directory to your current $BSE/bin directory. Make sure the permissions are set so that all users can execute the file. Try the interface.<br />
<br />
If it still does not work then you need to find your old 'make' file from the last time you compiled the interface. This may be on your database server. Assuming you find it copy the files libalbsh.a and libtvtx.a from $BSE/api/lib to the directory specified in the make file. Compile the objects and copy the api6.1 back to the $BSE/bin directory. This all assumes you are unix. You need to make sure that any files that are transfered between machines are transfered as binary files.<br />
<br />
If you cannot find you old make file then look in the $BSE/api/taxpmake directory. It includes shells for the makefile. Take a look at make.vertex. You will need to modify the file to specify your vertex directories and also modify paths and includes to specify you database software paths.<br />
<br />
There coukd be one other possibility for your errors. I know that certain patches required a certain porting set. Baan did add a new parameter for taxware which could only be implemented with a certain porting set level. If you are out of step between patches and the porting set then this could be the problem.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
