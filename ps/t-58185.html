The cost can be entered manually in the progress module. As it is not demanding for any business partner and order details but it will allowto process the cost and getting recorded in cost history with out order number and orgin as project. This means you need not to pay to anybody but the cost is charged against the project. I hope this is what you are expecting.</div></div><hr />
