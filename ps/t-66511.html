So best to check these settings first.</div></div><hr />

no specific document that I know of but maybe the help has some pointers. By the way if you didn't want to use the plan and activity it could be that you just should remove the plan from the project data. As said before: if you want to use  activities check the cost control settings for the activity levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just make sure, a project template is in place and set up in the right way - otherwise you have the same prob over and over again.<br />
<br />
- cost control settings - project head - specific - CCS - make them all, then you have max. options for elements and activities (recommended)<br />

They are defaulted from the project template, not from the parameters (KB 1385375).</div></div><hr />
