<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiran Gholap</div><div class="date">29th March 2008, 06:02</div></div><div class="posttext">1.	First you need to have a cluster defined in session tsbsc1100m000. Please  ensure a proper usage class is attached to the cluster.<br />
2.	Attach the appropriate serial numbers to cluster as cluster lines<br />
3.	Define maintenance concept in session tsspc1120m000 for the items in cluster lines and usage class used <br />
4.	Generate maintenance plan from session tsspc2200m000<br />
5.	Planned activities would be generated in session tsspc2100m000<br />
6.	Alternatively one can manually maintain planned activities without following step 3 and 4<br />
7.	Then transfer maintenance plan to service orders from session tsspc2220m000. Please note that status of the planned activities as mentioned in step 5 and 6 should be released for this step to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">31st March 2008, 01:09</div></div><div class="posttext">That's fantastic advice, Kiran.  Thank you very much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">8th April 2008, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, following your advice, I did the cluster and usage class for one serialized item.  I set up the maintenance concept with one activity with a frequency of 4 times a month.  But after Generating the Maintenance Plan until the end of the year, I only got one Planned Activity dated 12/31/2008.  My expectation was to get four activities per month times 9 months = 36 activities.  Anybody know why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiran Gholap</div><div class="date">9th April 2008, 06:50</div></div><div class="posttext">This depends on the Method selected while generating maintenance plan in session tsspc2200m000 and also on the conversion factors for all time units maintained in Service Planning and Concepts parameters tsspc0100m000 session.<br />
<br />
Please check if both above things are correct.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fm_baan</div><div class="date">10th April 2008, 07:26</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also check if the status start date at the cluster line is set correctly, the planning will start off from the date the serialized item has been 'installed' under the cluster. Note that if the delivery time/installation time has been specified at the serialized item then it would have the higher preference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I created the setup exactly as you had given. But when I generate the maintenance plan (tsspc2200m000), I am getting the message:<br />
<br />
&quot;Unable to determine the Workable Planned Start Time at ....&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any idea what could be the problem?<br />
<br />
I have attached the calendar code to the cluster.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
