Delete it or whatever? Its possible to stop inbound and outbound processes, but the warehouse can be seen in all lists and printouts. If there is anything, please let me know! Thank you in advance!</div></div><hr />

I believe there is no way to delete/hide the Warehouse except Blocking it for Transactions.<br />
<br />
By the way, do you create a unique warehouse each time for a new project?</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, i guess your right! There is no such session! This could mean, the idea of using a PWH for each project does not work! The trouble is, that some session only allow a view on PWH - Level, but not to specific Project within this P- Warehouse. So, i guess, we will use one P-Warehouse in general. But if there is a large project, we might create a specific P- Warehouse then. When the project is completed, then we would need to move all items being left to the standard warehouse. So, let us see, how we will end up with this approach! So, we have just identified another field, where Infor has room for functional improvements.</div></div><hr />

Please do let us know if you find any solution/workaround (about the field that you've identified), so the other members of the forum can also use it.<br />

Have a great day!</div></div><hr />
