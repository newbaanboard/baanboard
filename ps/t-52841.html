Does anyone have any documention that explains this simply. Infor have provided some documentation but it is not ideal.<br />
<br />
The main areas I want to understand is the impact around pegged production orders and pegged purchase orders (inc those with commitment and GRNI)<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
