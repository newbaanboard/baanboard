Service kit, I tried but it’s consuming the materials from warehouse only and we can link one warehouse for only one service kit. Once I choose delivery type is service kit in service order line then “outbound/inbound warehouse order line is disabling” and “issue stock for order “will enable. If I use that option “issue stock for order”, I cannot change warehouse order status is “planned” to “open”.<br />
Please tell me the actual concept of service kit and service car.<br />
If you have any process diagram or slide show please can u forward to Me.?<br />

2.	MSO:<br />
Is it possible, from work order I can send child item to scrap warehouse?<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Parent item: X (serialized)<br />
Child item: Y (serialized) and Z (serialized)<br />
Physical Breakdown is generated<br />
<br />
I received item “X” from customer to warehouse and I transferred warehouse to work center. And then, from work center, I have to send “Y” item “To scrap” warehouse and fix new item “A” instead of item “Y”. Is it possible? I am tried but the “serialized item” – “configuration control”tab – “status” will change to “defective”from “active” when i created the MSO order and I cannot change warehouse type ”To scrap”. If I change, it shows error &quot;configuration control status should be in “active” or “workable condition”. Please give me the solutions.</div></div><hr />
