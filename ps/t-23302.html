<br />
We use the service module to account for our servicing of our units.  Most of the transactions that accumulate on our Service Orders are &quot;WIP Service&quot; Transactions types.  These transactions book correctly as long as inventory from a Warehouse is not being issued.  If Inventory is issued to a Service Order, a Service &quot;Issue&quot; Transaction is recorded as well as a Service &quot;WIP Service&quot; Transaction for the same amount; thus, the entry is double booked out of materials inventory to WIP.  When the Service Order is costed, the &quot;WIP Service&quot; transaction reverses itself and corrects the Inventory imbalance; however, this situation is less than ideal.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
