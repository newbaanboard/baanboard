1) When quotation is created and configuration is specified, system does not calculate duration (on form execution).<br />
2) Also when configuration is specified, object is not populated in session tssoc1510m00 (objects and activities by quotation)<br />
3) After entering onject manually, order quoation coverage terms are populated automatically, but cost and sales amount fig. comes only after runnning the session &quot;recalculate prices&quot;. Is it necessary to run this session?<br />
4) In session order quotation coverage terms, for every cost type, I am not able to modifiy cost covering method, ceiling and discount field. By default value is coming as &quot;Fixed Price&quot;. Why this is coming like this and why I am not able to modify? Also for manufacturing cost type, Cost amount is coming but sales amount is not coming by default. Form where system pics the sales value for the material?<br />
5) What is the role of success % in quotations?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on your questions on service order quotations and your thread regarding the transfer of a service order quotation to a service order I suggest you follow training in BAAN V Service first.<br />
I do not want to upset you but I have a feeling that every single time you are &quot;testing&quot; a new area in Service you will have lots of questions and put those on BaanBoard.<br />
<br />
This is not the right way to learn the product. It will be much more useful for you when you sign up for a class and will learn all the things you need to know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
we use B40c4 SP14.<br />
<br />
I could see only Service Contract Quotation; where as we are very much interested in a service order quotation (kind of Maintain Quotation; Print Quotation and Approve Quotation)<br />
<br />
there is estimated cost, but cpatures only cost price and Qty and not a quotation price.<br />
<br />
any info will help<br />
<br />
tks</div></div><hr />
