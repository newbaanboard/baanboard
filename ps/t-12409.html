The plannned activities which are under &quot;release&quot; status are not getting transferred into service order through the session &quot;Transfer maintenance plannning to service order tsspc2220m000&quot;<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me out why this is happening.<br />
<br />
Also is it possible to change the service order status to &quot;Released&quot; without running Detail SRP?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Normally when you transfer a planned activity to a service order in session tsspc2220m000 you will get a report. This will come up both when the transfer works (it will show the new service order number) and when the transfer does not work (the system will show the error).<br />
So, when you run session tsspc2220m000 please take a print screen and attach it to your post. Then, hopefully, we can see what is going on.<br />
<br />
It is possible to &quot;release&quot; a service order without using Detail SRP by clicking on the &lt;Release&gt; button in the service order session. The status of the service order AND the service order activity have to be &quot;Free&quot; or &quot;Planned&quot;. Make also sure both the service order and the service order activity have a service engineer linked. Otherwise it will not work.<br />
Another way of releasing a service order is via the Service Scheduler. This is more a graphical planningboard and here you also need to attach a service engineer to the service order and service order activity.<br />
