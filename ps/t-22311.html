<br />
You can only use Budget Adjestments in tpptc when the status is &quot;Final&quot;. As long as this is still &quot;Actual&quot; you will not be able to use Budget Adjustments.<br />
This is standard functionality and will also give the correct transactions in Project, Finance and other areas in BAAN IV.<br />
<br />
Go to a test environment and see for yourself.<br />

<br />
To work with adjustments you need to specify the elements being effected by a change (assuming, you work with an element structure)<br />
<br />
Then, change the element status to final (one or more elements in the structure)<br />
<br />
Maintan the Adjustment and select the elements hat need to be changed.<br />
<br />
You will be able to see the budget effect the change has coused. <br />
<br />
But, in finance you will only see increased costs for changed costs. You will not see an adjustment code in finance. Only if you can add an Extension (additional contract!!) you would see the change there.<br />
<br />
If you can not use extensions but you like to see changes in finance, you might consider operating with different cost objects (control code!)<br />
But this would increase the number of cost objects!<br />
<br />
If you have more questions or discuss in more detail, send me a note.<br />
