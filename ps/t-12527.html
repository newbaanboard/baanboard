We have the following problem - we input two purchase contracts with two different suppliers for one and the same Item (this happens very often).  Then we try to connect the two contracts with one and the same project (Maintain Item Contracts by Project) and for the second contract we receive the following message: &quot;Record already exist&quot;. This is because of the index 2 of the table tppdm606.<br />
Has somebody experienced this problem? Baan support answered that this is standard functionality and won't be changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish to give few details of the standard functionality.<br />
<br />
Standard Items are purchased not for a specific Project but for all projects requirement+any other requirement.<br />
Hence If U want to have different pricing for an item in a Single project then try using Project Item.<br />
<br />
If U give the details why UR going for another contract for a single item apart from pricing difference in a Project Scenario, it would be helpful for further explanation.<br />
<br />
Baan IV doesnt support UR said requirement becoz of the above functionality.<br />

Project - different suppliers, different delivery dates...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find one work around for UR requirement, see whether it works for You.<br />
<br />
       Make two special Purchase contracts and after Generating  <br />
       Project Requirement Go to session tppss6110m000 &quot;Maintain <br />
       Planned Purchase Order (Material Recommendations) &quot; and <br />
       for each concerned Order line include the Supplier and as U <br />
       tab thru to Contract Field, Select the Contracts available for <br />
       the item / Supplier selected and rest data will be dafault as <br />
       per the Contracts.<br />
<br />
If U have anything better, Pl share the same.<br />
<br />
