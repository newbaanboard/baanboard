Has anyone tried linking a Service Order to Projects (TP)..?<br />
<br />
I'm trying to link a Service Order to Projects (TP), it gets linked properly, but when I release the Service Order, the Sales Price/Sales Amount fields in the Actual Material Lines gets disabled.. Is it not possible to do Invoicing in this kind of Service Orders? Is there a way to do so?<br />
<br />
Any Help..</div></div><hr />

Actually, the scenario is like, the project is completed, all the invoicing for the project is done, and we want to do some servicing/maintenance job on this project for which invoicing has to be done seperately..<br />

<br />
you could try to reopen the Project, do the invoicing, and cose it again. (Change Project Status / Financial Determination) back to active <br />
then you can change the thing and close it again (Check with your Finance guy the results)<br />
<br />
We had to to this in several Projects!<br />
<br />
If not sure, try it in your test company first!<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulrich Hofmann</div><div class="date">20th October 2013, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Elements:<br />
Build the technical Project Structure - (Like a Project BOM) in Projects like<br />
Heavy Machinery, Turbines, Power Plants, Ships etc.)<br />
<br />
Activity: <br />
Entity to build the Scheduling Structure (Like Activities in a Project Scheduling Tool. Supports the Planning in a Project <br />
<br />
Link in two ways:<br />
1. Direct - Via Element Relations (Same Plan for all Budget Lines)<br />
2. Indirect - Via Bottom up Budget Lines (Connected Data, with different Activities, if required)<br />
Depends how detailed you need to plan. I prefere to use 1. detailed.<br />
<br />
You dont need Elements in simlpe projects (pave streets, or so), but if you have a complex project, use them both (Elements) for the design integrity of your technical structure! Activities for the scheduling - in this case dont play with activity types - take Work Packages only - this is good enough.<br />
<br />
Note: Currently (FP8) its only possible to link Service Orders with Activity Driven Projects! This need to be changed by Development!<br />
<br />
For further Questions - send me a mail!<br />

Can somebody please let me know the difference between Element and Activity and the relationship between them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The invoicing can happen on the basis of TP project as well. In that case, you need to copy the activites of the project as the cluster breakdown structure. Then on the service order use the project on the header and select the activity of the project in the item field while creating the reference actitvity lines for the service order. Then the cost of the material, labour and others can be fallen on the project through the activity while invoicing the whole service order or invoicing just the single reference activity.<br />
