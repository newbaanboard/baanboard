<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendra</div><div class="date">25th July 2003, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I'm on Baan 5.0c and very new to Baan Service<br />
<br />
Can anybody give me some explanation about Configuration and SBOM. Are they the same or different?<br />
It looks like the configuration structure is similar to SBOM structure.<br />
<br />
Also, what exactly the object type 'structure' is?<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Level 0 = Train<br />
 Level 1 = Locomotive<br />
  Level 2 = Controller<br />
 <br />
 Level 1 = Carriage<br />
  Level 2 = Body<br />
 <br />
 Level 1 = Dining Car<br />
  Level 2 = Kitchen<br />
<br />
The 'kitchen', 'body', and 'controller' object is of type component and the 'locomotive', 'carriage', and 'dining car' is of type product.<br />
What is the object type of 'train'? is it product or structure?<br />
<br />
Anyone, help please :confused:<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<br />
The difference between Configuration vs SBOM is the following:<br />
<br />
- the Configuration contains all the products/items (objects) installed with a customer. It also has the customer (Sold-to BP and Invoice-to BP) and Service Contract info associated to it. The Configuration is a way to keep track of information at the highest level.<br />
- the SBOM is basically the Bill Of Material of the product (object) to be serviced. It is generic and has never customer info linked.<br />
In BAAN there are three different types of BOM that actually follow a natural flow: As Designed (EBOM), As Build (PBOM) and As Maintained (SBOM).<br />
In BAAN V Service you can copy a PBOM to an SBOM once you are done with the manufacture of your product.<br />
Many companies have different service requirements when products need to be maintained so that is why an SBOM can be different than a PBOM.<br />
<br />
An Object of type &quot;Structure&quot; is actually meant for the top level item in the SBOM. Most people would say at level 0 in the BOM.<br />
Usually this is also the Top Object.<br />
The idea is that no transactions (labor, material and other) are done against an object of type &quot;Structure&quot;. This should be done against products/items at lower levels in the BOM and these are usually of type &quot;Product&quot; or &quot;Component&quot;.<br />
So, in the example you gave us the train is of type &quot;Structure&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this explanation works for you. If you need more help please let us know.<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for the explanation. I now have a better understanding on it.<br />
<br />
So what is the use of maintaining SBOM if, for instance, the company does not produce any products, only provide services to customers ? Because what we maintained is the configuration at customer's site, not the SBOM. Hence, services given to customer will be based on configuration.<br />
<br />
Does SBOM use is for copying product structure to configuration, just to avoid double entry or does it have any other use?<br />
<br />
many thanks again,<br />

<br />
The SBOM is mainly used to copy the bills of material of products that were manufactured (PBOM) so that you will save time inn BAAN V Service with data entry.<br />
In your case if you do not manufacture (and hence also not use PBOMs) then the only good reason to maintain and use SBOMs is when you have to enter many of the same objects each time you create a new configuration.<br />
<br />
Otherwise just do not use them.<br />
<br />
