<br />
Do you mean by shed a place to store equipement/tools but which is not part of a train (locomotives and coaches)?<br />
<br />
If so then I would suggest the following:<br />
<br />
Location: Locomotive No., Coach No. and Shed<br />
Location type: Mobile Equipement (in case of Locomotive No. and Coach No.) and Storage Facility (in case of Shed) <br />
Service Area:Railway<br />
Area:City<br />
<br />
It is all up to you how you want to do this but we are giving you some ideas.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your suggestions.<br />
<br />
Yeh! shed is not part of a train, its a place to store equipements eg. CLW, DLW etc.<br />
<br />
Now what we have decided is:<br />
<br />
Location Info: Coach or Loco no. (which is a no mandatry field, as we are not having coach and Loco No. for each record)<br />
Location: is a combination of Shed, Railway and city<br />
Location type: Shed<br />
Service Area: City<br />
Area: Railway<br />
<br />
Are further suggestions are most welcome........<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Abhivyakti</div></div><hr />
