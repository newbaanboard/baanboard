<br />
In baan I want to write a simple report where I could show the contract amount and spent amount. For example, suppose the project contract amount was 1000. I know I can get the contract amount from Maintain Projects. What I am interested to know is, against this 1000 I want to know how much I have spent. I want to know where the cost related transactions are stored.<br />

<br />
the information you are looking for is already available via tpppc4421m000. That way the cost information is already rolled up/aggregated. If you want to create your own report you will have to access tpppc215, 235, 255, 275, and 295. If you need to include commitments a few more are relevant. Alternatively use tpppc400 (or other tables in the 400 range).<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Good answer assuming this question is not related to tipcs projects because then different BAAN tables have to be used/accessed and this thread will be moved to the Manufacturing forum at BaanBoard.</div></div><hr />
