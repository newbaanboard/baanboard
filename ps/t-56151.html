<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cleydek</div><div class="date">18th June 2009, 21:35</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact eService (24*7 web-based self service environment) was the first extension application for which an integration with ERP LN was released (on FP1). <br />
<br />
The latest release of eService 2.4 - that is certified on FP5 and released in April this year - integrates on more levels. Not only can customers, dealers or internal heldesk employees register Calls (in tsclm) via the use of Service Requests in eService. They can also register equipment (warranty cards) on line - and create serialised items (in tscfg) associated with the appropriate Business Partner in ERP LN automatically.<br />

Feel free to contact me for more information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for the answer. it's really interesting.<br />
At a technical level, how technology is used (Web Service, Infor Open SOA or other) ?<br />
<br />
I work for a Channel partner in France, how is it possible to receive the installation CD and all that is necessary?<br />
<br />
I think, it's a good opportunity for the product.<br />

<br />
The product leverages Infor Open Architecture components for running on an IIS webserver environment, administration, sign-on authentication and ERP LN integration. The installation CD can be ordered from Infor. Then you can download and install the software and test it.<br />
<br />
My company resells this product. I can provide a (webex-based) demonstration or workshop to you and your customer. In addition I can provide training and implementation services.<br />
<br />
If you anticipate more sales in this area I can also train your organization to implement this product going forward. <br />
<br />
If you want you can liaise with me directly so we can discuss more details. See attached file.</div></div><hr />
