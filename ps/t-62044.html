It seems likely that some steps have not been completed in the outbound (or inbound if any) warehouse process. Check the outbound status.</div></div><hr />

Materials are not completely issues against Service Order. Execute all the warehouse orders against that Service order. This issue will be reolved.</div></div><hr />
