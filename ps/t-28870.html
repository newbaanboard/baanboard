In case you have an opportunity to implement in LN this would be the best option. SSA is supporting LN since 2004 so there is also no problem here.<br />
<br />
I have worked with BAAN Project since 1996 and have been involved with many implementations. In case of Project there is usually no straight forward solution because Project is used by companies that are highly involved in a &quot;customized&quot; environment.<br />
Perhaps you can start by checking out this post: http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=10155<br />
<br />
Do you plan on implementing Project yourself or do you require help from an external person as well?<br />
If you have never been exposed to BAAN Project and you intend to do this all by yourself you will be in for a difficult time and a lot of headaches.<br />
<br />
In any event, good luck!</div></div><hr />
