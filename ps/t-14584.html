Based on the technical nature of your questions I believe it would be best to send these issues to your regular BAAN Support contact.<br />
The integration between BAAN V Project and MS Project is not something that many people on BaanBoard will be familiar with and also it is very difficult to help you at this level of detail as we are not able to take a peak at your system and the configuration.<br />
<br />
I assume you installed Feature Pack 1 for the integration between BAAN V Project and MS Project.<br />
<br />
