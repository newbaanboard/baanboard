We are in a TP environment with projects lasting from 2 to 12 months. As additional business and other reasons we send standard products to the end customer related to the project. We do this today using replenishment order processes.<br />
We would prefer to use the normal sales order proces. This proces is more straight and easy. <br />
<br />
Can we use sales orders in some way and still have revenue and costs for such orders should be included in TP.<br />
<br />
Ideas will be apreciated. <br />
<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />

Just going to PCS Projects is not that easy because one has to consider the functionality that will be lost when moving away from TP Projects to PCS Projects.<br />
Perhaps it is better to link a TP Project to a PCS Project and use BAAN as designed.<br />
All non-manufacturing related work like engineering &amp; design, prototyping, installation, etc. can be handled by TP Project and the manufacturing side by PCS Project which has also the sales order(s) linked. One of the activities inside the TP Project is then the manufacturing of the goods.<br />
What BAAN version are you talking about here?</div></div><hr />

Think of a project delivering an installation specified in a contract. During the project you inevitable will be in situations where you need to ship additional standard products from inventory to the customer. This could be additional business, warranty issues and various parts or kits for installation.<br />
<br />
The sales order procedure is good because first of all you have the best external documents like invoices including deliveryadresses, multilanguage texts and packing slips. The replenishment order processes just bring the items to the TP project. Then you need to customize shipping documents.<br />
<br />
Key issue ia that we want to consolidate revenue and cost in one TP project and have streamlined processes for shipping standard products.<br />
<br />
