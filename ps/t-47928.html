<br />
Unfortunately there is no integration between sales orders and a TP project in LN.<br />
You should regard the project as the customer and therefore a shipment to the project is a shipment to the customer. Based on that shipment you can raise an invoice to the customer.<br />
I am not sure whether this only applies to a shipment from a &quot;normal&quot; warehouse to the project and not for a shipment from the &quot;project&quot; warehouse to the project. <br />
It all depends on your set up and what the project is for.<br />
The down side is that you will not be able to use any of the Warehousing functionalities so you cannot create any packaging documents via LN that will go with the final goods if you deliver from the (manufacturing) project to the customer.</div></div><hr />
