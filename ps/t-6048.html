I have been advised that our company is to move to iBaan during 2003. We currently use AS400. <br />
Has anyone got information regarding the capabilities of the service module from the user's perspective? <br />

In this version Baan has worked very hard to integratre very good service functionality.  At the same time there are several service components like, e-service, e-service remote, service scheduler, etc...<br />
<br />
Good luck with your roll out and congratulations!</div></div><hr />
