In the hours accounting session - tssoc2535m000 - we insert the hours per service order activity. When the hours are not exact, we need to convert it for example 30m would be 0,5 hours.<br />
As you can imagine there is precious time wasted in the conversion step of each line.<br />
Does anyone know a way to work around it. <br />
We would like that the hours total would be read in an hourly based metric.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your reply,<br />

<br />
Why don't you enter the hours with a base unit of minutes?<br />
In other words 1 hour and 30 minutes will become 90 minutes. Then you do not have to worry about conversions from for example 1 hour and 3 minutes to 1.05 hours in Hours Accounting as this would be 63 minutes.<br />
<br />
Because I have no BAAN V_c system up and running here I am not sure what the impact will be on rates, etc.<br />
