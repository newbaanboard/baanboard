<br />
Our organisation is implementing LN Projects and there is one area we can't seem to figure out. Our set up is as follows:<br />
1. Budgeting bottom up by elements.<br />
2. We are not entering materials budget since at the time we budget we will not know all the detail make up of the materials list to be issued to the project. So instead we enter a sundry cost to cover the materials requirement.<br />
3. When we know the detail material makeup we enter the material requirements as a warehouse order directly.<br />
<br />
The problem we face is that how can we check in Projects what materials quantity and material costs are committed (well commitment may not be the right word) to the project.<br />
<br />
We seem to only be able to see the actuals posted to the project when the warehouse order is shipped. This would be too late for us.<br />
<br />
Any ideas oh how we can see committments for the open (non shipped) warehouse orders?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Since you do not have material budget lines you will not be able to see commitments. You need to change the mapping. Why is it that you have selected this procedure? This seems to be more tedious than the standard procedure of defining the material lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mvohra</div><div class="date">11th September 2007, 10:01</div></div><div class="posttext">There is another functionality in Project planning where you an see pending budget lines. Here you could see the undelivered warehouse orders. Just an idea do not know much about your process though.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your feedback. The reason we are going down this path is more to do with how we budget for the project. ie. We get a lump sum to budget for factory materials where we don't really know the detailed item list. Then when we do we want to be able to enter this as warehouse orders since if we enter them as materials budget line then the budget amout would double up since we do not see any flags to &quot;consume&quot; what was already budgeted.<br />
<br />
Hope this makes sense. Have you come across any functionality in LN where it will be able to &quot;consume&quot; bugets at a higher level in the element structure?</div></div><hr />

U can also try the budeting module and enter actuals in material budget session..<br />
As such LN has functionality to compare the commited and actual alone..<br />
