<br />
However, whne the new USA employees attempt to enter general hours, they are seeing SUNDAY as the first day, instead fof monday. <br />
<br />
I have looked at employee details, maintain companies etc but am not seeing anything different to the european companies. The Calendars are the same as well<br />
<br />
Any ideas what I should be looking at ?<br />
<br />
We have just gone live in USa, so a tad urgent<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<br />
I'm using LN at the moment.. Not sure if things are different in BaaN 5..<br />
But just to double check :<br />
<br />
1. have you looked at the Period Table Code in the People Parameters, the Periods defined in this Period Table Code should be weekly and starting from Monday.<br />
<br />
2. if you are using Webtop, then check your WebUI version, and consult Infor Support, coz I remember there was a bug/issue in a particular WebUI Version, where the Days didn't use to appear correctly..<br />
<br />
Hope it helps..<br />
<br />
