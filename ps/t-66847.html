<br />
I tried to modify an service item's configuration control &quot;Anonymous&quot; to &quot;Serialized&quot;, I have a probrem.<br />
<br />
the message said:<br />
&quot;Item is used in Work Order %1$s - Activity Line %2$d Material Resource Line.&quot;<br />
<br />
The material resouce line had been issued already, I cant delete it.<br />
<br />
If I use this item code as serialized item, what I have to do?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TJ_iwai</div><div class="date">12th September 2014, 03:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Benito,<br />
<br />
I will try to make a new part number, i also feel that's the only way.<br />
<br />
I wish they make the enhauncement someday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Item is used in Work Order %1$s - Activity Line %2$d Material Resource Line.&quot;<br />
<br />
This normally means that the MWO still owns the item.  You can't do too much with the item until the activity is completed, even when the material resource is a 'to warehouse' with an actual quantity present.  If the activity in the material resource is zero, the MWO has to be closed before using the item in other MWOs.  Don't know of the change to serialized would work once the activity/MWO is complete/closed. This is based on fp7 and 10.2.x.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The activity have been already completed.<br />
<br />
But at FP5, the DAL of Item - Service doesn't check the status of activity,<br />
I couldn't avoid this message.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />
