<br />
Pls define the Periods in &quot;Maintain Periods&quot; in Service Table module then define the Fiscal, Tax &amp; Reporting Periods in Finance Module. Your problem will be resolved immediately.<br />

I don´t use periods at service module. The reporting, tax and fiscal, are already defined at finance.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the financial operation: service order to sales invoice can not be categorized at none of the current periods, due to the invoice not have de date!<br />
<br />
Do you have another solution?<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In case this is the only invoice that causes the problem then you can use table maintenance to fill in the appropriate date and fiscal period.<br />
This solution is not recommendable but given the seriousness of your problem most likely the only solution.<br />
<br />
In case you have more invoices with this problem you should not try to fix this via table maintenance. Then you need to figure out what is going wrong from a more structural point of view.<br />

Thanks for you response. <br />
Yes is the only one service order with this problem. I tried to fill the data in tfgld410, but the error persist. So I´m suspecting that I must fill the data in another table o tables. Do you know what tables must be filed?<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">2nd February 2005, 22:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
What are the dates and periods in table tssma310 for that service order?<br />
Also what is the status of the service order?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Edwin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">2nd February 2005, 23:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Edwin,<br />
The periods for that order are:<br />
Tax: period 1 Year:2005<br />
Reporting: period 1 year 2005<br />
Fiscal: period 1 year 2005<br />
<br />
The status for the order is History.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">3rd February 2005, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that the service order has the status &quot;History&quot; and that the periods have been filled are interesting because as you say there is no invoice date.<br />
I wonder how you got the service order all the way to the &quot;History&quot; status.<br />
<br />
Since the service order is already over the fence into the financial integration transactions it will be very difficult to figure out what tables exactly need to be filled.<br />
Perhaps you can add the invoice date in tssma310 using table maintenance and if that does not work I would log a case with BAAN Support.<br />
<br />
