<br />
I purchased a standard purchased item for a project. The purchase price differs from the standard cost price which is maintained in the item master. The soft commitment entries in session tpppc2810m000 (material commitments) reflect the purchase order price, however the hard commitments (warehouse receipt) are currently valued at standard cost price. <br />
As a result the project cost do not reflect the cost spent for a particular project.<br />
<br />
I hope, the wrong value of the hard commitment entry is related to our configuration. In particular I think about the item master.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to getting some feedback.<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your planning, budget, stimulation or commited price are base on your price calc code method you set up. cp,ap,lp,si. <br />
<br />
However do check with your FC, auditors, IFRS requirements etc, changing valuation method direct effect the account ledger. If full integration been use for warehouse than definately need to becareful.</div></div><hr />

we would like to have correct price in the service order actual costs, but it gives costs as per std. cost price, how to get actual costs in service order instead of variances in finance</div></div><hr />
