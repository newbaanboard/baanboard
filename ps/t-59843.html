We are currently using Baan Service for processing jobs. we have instances where the Service order has been costed, but we have some late costs (Labour and Material).<br />
What is the best way to handle them in Baan?<br />
I would prefer some process that allows Baan to handle late costs. Has anyone else had this issue, and if so how did they mange it?<br />
Thansk in advance <br />

<br />
As far as I can see it you are using BAAN V and in that case you can install a new solution from Infor Support.<br />
This solution will allow you revert the status of the service order from &quot;Costed&quot; to &quot;Completed&quot; and then add the late costs/charges for labour, material, etc. The additional cost lines should be costed and can then be invoiced if needed. After that the service order can be set to &quot;Costed&quot; again. <br />
When reverting the status from &quot;Costed&quot; to &quot;Completed&quot; you cannot add a new service order activity.<br />
<br />
This solution was originally available in ERP LN but has been backported to BAAN V as well.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your response. <br />
I have also added this as an issue in infor365, but they have not come back to me.<br />
Do you know the  number for the patch?<br />
