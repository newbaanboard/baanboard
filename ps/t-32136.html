    we have a need to create nearly 50,000 activities in the ERP LN 6.1 system. Which is very cumbersome. We are using MS Project in this regard. What we do is we will create 20 activities in Ln and transfer to MS Project then we will copy these 20 activites say 100 times while ensuring that activities codes have been changed and then copying to Ln by synchronization. <br />
        <br />
   While updation we are getting only  only activity code, description while unit field, Budget tab details like Budget Qty, Physical progress qty are getting updated as blank and zero respectively. Infact there are the mandatory fields to be field. It is very much paintaking to change this again activity by activity. <br />
<br />
    Expecting workaround or solution from experts.<br />
<br />
    Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Another possibility is to use the Excel-Integration and fill the Baan-Project-tables for activities and their relatinships from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is an Interface between Baan and Open Plan. OP is a professional scheduling tool, used in large organizations, when large numbers of activities have to be managed, in multi - roject mode and or multi user driven.<br />
<br />
There is an interface linking Baan (4,5,LN) to Open Plan, in TP, PCS, Procurement. The interface is used in project driven organizations.<br />
<br />
If you like to know more, send me an e-mail.<br />
