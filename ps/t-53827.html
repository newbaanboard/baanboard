<br />
after some help. Trying to process overheads for financial period end (eek!) and when I come to apply overheads the job fails with the error message stating that &quot;Data not maintained in the session Maintain Overhead. Rates (tpppc9170m00c)'. Does anybody know what the problem is likely to be as we have been through and checked the rates tables and the issue doesn't seem to originate there. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just a guess:<br />
often rates are connected to a period in which they are valid.<br />
Perhaps you found the rates, but didn't check their date?<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

<br />
thanks for the info. I'm not too familiar with Baan, I'll mention that to my person who is looking at the problem and check they have also checked the dates. Thanks again for your advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ben221183</div><div class="date">30th September 2008, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Checked and apparently the rates we use are available for the entire year not a specific period. When a new rate is entered it re-rates all the costs for the year when processing. Any other ideas would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems you have an issue with session tpppc9170m00c and this is not a standard BAAN session. It is a customized session and therefore your time will be wasted trying to find the solution on BaanBoard.<br />
My recommendation is to contact the company that built this customization for you and have them solve the matter.</div></div><hr />
