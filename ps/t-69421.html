<br />
actually I am working in a project in Germany, where we are in a migration from Baan4 PCS to LN Project.<br />
The customer uses MS Project Server intensively and I know nobody, who knows both.<br />
<br />
So we need a programmer and/or consultant, who can help us to setup this interface.<br />
The customers knows MS Project Server and I think, I know LN a little bit ;-).<br />
Has anybody of you a contact, that I can order? We think about 1 or 2 days for the first time, maybe later more.<br />
The customer is located near Frankfurt/Main.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />
Dirk</div></div><hr />

It's not straightforward but doable, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />
