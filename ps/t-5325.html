I would like to know what the system checks to set the Project Status to &quot;Closed&quot; and when this is done ? I have some projects that I think are &quot;closed&quot; too early.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When the project is set to &quot;Closed&quot; a few things are done:<br />
<br />
- all final results by means of provisional amounts are posted to Finance. <br />
- the status of the Financial Result of the project is set to &quot;Result Determined&quot; after you run the Process Transactions sessions.<br />
- all WIP costs and Revenues will be reversed and posted to the ledger accounts defined for closing a project. <br />
<br />
Of course you have to make sure that the statusses of the elements and activities are &quot;Final&quot;. That there are no pending transactions hanging in Purchasing or Distribution (BAAN IV)/ Warehousing (BAAN V).<br />
That all costs and commitments have been approved and posted to Finance.<br />
The system has built in checks for this at the application level but sometimes things may go wrong.<br />
<br />
If there is any specific area in Project that you are concerned about please let me know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Edwin</div></div><hr />
