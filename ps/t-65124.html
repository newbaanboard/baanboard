<br />
Appreciate the help.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Amit</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have seen this before and there were no systems issues related to not having an activity there.<br />
However, the activity is a vital part of the service order containing important data elements like the installed base information which allows the service people to track all consumptions and costs (labor, material, etc.). Also when invoicing it can be a problem for the customer if the activity is missing.<br />
In the end it is more of a compliance matter and whether the user was disciplined enough to add the activity at the right moment in the process.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The implications of not having an activity and then invoicing or processing the service order will only be in the case when you are invoicing the service order on the activity basis and not on the basis of whole service order. Also the tracking of consumption and specially in the case of replacements scenarios, this will definately have an implication.<br />
