Budget lines added after an activity has been set to 100% complete are not added to the allowed cost. This seems to be due to the way generate progress from planning works.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having problems with this in Baan V?</div></div><hr />

As far as I know I have not seen this before in b50_c Project. The best thing to do is to check with BAAN Support. If this is a familiar issue they would know about it and have a solution available for you.<br />
I apologize for not being able to help here.<br />

<br />
I dont have Baan in front of me, but I can suggest few things.<br />
<br />
1. Try running the Control Budget after any lines are added to the Control Budget.  In UR case I understand it is Activity Budget .<br />
After this U book progress &amp; run Monitoring reports and check whether it gives the correct allowed cost.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2. Try using Extensions for the changes happening during the project real progress. The extension functionality is available only for the purpose of tracking by how much the project is deviating from the Budget for the reasons as mentioned in the extensions.<br />
<br />
Pl reply after Your simualtion. <br />
