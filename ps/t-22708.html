<br />
The project module helps the Senior Management by analysing the projects based on the Cost component ( i.e analysis across various projects ).<br />
Helps the Quanityt surveyor to analyse the project by Elements.<br />
Helps the Planner to analyse the project based on Activity progress and related budget Vs actual etc..<br />
<br />
Upto Project progress the user will be reporting to the system, then the key analysis is given by the system to control the project by three different roles ( Project Manager and above, Quantity surveyor, Planning Engineer ).<br />
<br />
The key analysis like Earned Value are very critical for project monitoring.<br />
<br />
As you browse through various reports in project monitoring module, U will find it very useful for each role in the project. You have the facility to analyse by drill down from the project to the last activity or element which is effecting the project. you can also derive the profitability analysis of projects/elements/activity.<br />
<br />
Hope the above note is useful.<br />

Thanks .. It is very much useful . but again it is finance matter.  <br />
I mean is current scenario is the project engineer's preparing the part list in excel format and latter it is sent to procurement to create a PO for that project's items.  very few items are extracted from the stock . always creating  the po.  it is duplicate work from project and procurement side.<br />
is there any short cut options the project engr. create's the partlist and directly assign to PO . then the Procurement will have the approval to release to vendor.<br />
<br />
our project department is not very much impressesed , baan projects module.is there  any way to impress them with short cut method and useful information.  I do not want to the project user to discard the baan and go for the some other ERP.<br />
<br />
Please advice.</div></div><hr />
