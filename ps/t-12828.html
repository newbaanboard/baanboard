<br />
at Baan ERP 5c, customer has parameter &quot;lot number as serial number&quot; (tscfg000.ltnr) selected.<br />
When running session tscfg2210m000, new objects are created with serial number, that it's OK.<br />
He expects similar behavior when running session tscfg2220m000.<br />
Suppose next scenario:<br />
- service order A<br />
- service order activity 10 (change type &quot;install&quot;)<br />
- service order material ITEM X (lot by unit)<br />
<br />
After issuing material to service order (specific lot selected suppose lot Z1), configuration change is made to install new object based on this material.<br />
<br />
He expects serial number Z1 object ITEM X.<br />
<br />
I can reproduce this situation, but I think this is the standard funcionality: system only adds serial number when creating new objects, but on the case reported the object is add as a change on the configuration (it can be type install, remove or replace), and when doing this change object must exist before at the configuration, so is not a new object created at this moment.<br />
<br />
Is this the standard functionality?<br />
<br />
At the other hand, I think customer request is valid in order to have a control of the used lots.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />
Veronica</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a very long time the parameter tscfg000.ltnr was not not working at all in session tscfg2210m000.<br />
It looks like BAAN has finally fixed this.<br />
<br />
I agree with your customer that if they run session tscfg2220m000 the same functionality should apply and the lot number has to be replaced.<br />
I am sure this is not happening in standard BAAN right now so if you want to have this modified you have to log a case with BAAN Support. Your motivation should be that because you use parameter tscfg000.ltnr the same logic should apply in tscfg2220m000.<br />
