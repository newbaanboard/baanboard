How to make predictive and preventive maintenance for a machine?<br />

<br />

<br />
In case you are working with BAAN IV Service there is no functionality at all for predictive and preventive maintenance on machines.<br />
Only time-based maintenance (frequency of x number of times per period) is available in BAAN IV Service.<br />
That is the reason why many existing BAAN IV customers have implemented an external package for used based and condition based maintenance.<br />
<br />
The functionality you are looking for is only available in BAAN V and ERP LN 6.1.<br />
<br />

<br />
In any case a spare part will always need to be defined as a purchase item or a manufactured item.<br />
<br />
A service item is not a physical item and will never be seen on stock level. In service you consume stock for a service order so you can not define it as a service item.<br />
<br />
Service items are used for billing services to a customer such as maintenance hours, etc.....<br />
<br />

There is no issue in creating Service Orders related to Preventive Maintenance. See the attachment it may be helpful to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">11th March 2006, 10:06</div></div><div class="posttext">As mentioned before all maintenance plans in BAAN IV Service are time based and not used based or condition based.<br />
In chapter 9 of the document provided by Ganesh you can read about Periodic Maintenance but this does not provide the solution for Sigit as she was asking about predictive and preventive maintenance.<br />
<br />
In case Sigit is fine with only setting up a maintenance plan based on a time frequency (and therefore not based on usage and conditions of the machines) then there is no problem using the existing functionality of BAAN IV Service.<br />
However, I have been working for 10 years with BAAN IV Service and my experience is that only time based maintenance is just not good enough for customers.<br />
<br />
In BAAN V and ERP LN 6.1 you can set up maintenance concepts based on the usage of the equipment and/or the condition the equipment is in.<br />
Of course also time based maintenance policies are available in both applications.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps to clear up the differences between Periodic Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance and Predictive Maintenance.<br />

First of all, I want to thank you for all the information.<br />
I am very sorry, I mean we are using BaaN Vc not IVc.<br />
For this time, I have set the master data management, planning and concepts. And I also have succeed to run the session &quot;generate maintenance planning (tsspc2200m000) and the result are planned activities.<br />
<br />
But I learn it by myself using menu &quot;help&quot; in BaaN Vc.<br />
would you like to help me how to get the right setting in BaaN Service (Vc) in<br />
1. Measurement type<br />
2. Dependent value and independent value<br />
3. Reference activities<br />
4. Inspection template<br />
5. Maintenence concept<br />
6. Predictive activities<br />
5. Planned activities<br />
<br />
Actually I want to ask about service order too, but I havent learn it.<br />
I will learn as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<br />
No problems.<br />
However, it seems that you want to learn a lot and because BAAN V Service has become a major application my advise for you is to follow a BAAN V Service training instead of trying to learn everything by yourself.<br />
There is just too much functionality in BAAN V Service (a standard training is at least 5 days) and as with many implementations every customer believes they are unique so there may be endless ways of running the procedures through BAAN V Service.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cleydek</div><div class="date">28th June 2006, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">You can create refenence activities for doing Inspections. In Maintenance concepts you can specify for the reference activity an Inspection Template for doing that inspection on that machine type.<br />
You can generate on a time-based interval service order activities for the equipment you have (containing that machine type). As part of that service order activity you can register teh inspection results.<br />
There is a batch report that you can run that will give the inspection results taht exceed norm values and specify the follow up activity to be initiated.<br />
<br />
In ERP LN this is further automated with SO generation capability, but in Vc you need to act based on the by initiating corrective actions through e.g. the Call Session (easy start point for generation of Service Work).<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have further questions.<br />

<br />
Could you help me in setting up a Preventive Plan in LN based on usage for an Automobile?<br />
<br />
I understand that you would have to setup based on number of kilometers run, but am a bit confused on the setup.<br />
How do I set up the system to Generate a Maintenance Plan based on say when the car runs 5000 Kms, then 15000 kms, then 30000 kms etc.<br />
<br />
Broad hints on the steps would be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks a heap in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">riazsayeed</div><div class="date">25th August 2008, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I registered an inspection value of 6000 kms. How and where do I set the measurements so that when I generate the preventive maintenance plan, the system should check that 6000 kms has crossed the 5000 kms first service limit  and should generate the planned activity. The next limit to be set would be 15000 kms.<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly apreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks a heap in advance.</div></div><hr />
