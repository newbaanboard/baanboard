<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amyumyun</div><div class="date">5th January 2005, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I have very serious problem with generating the planned orders (planned purchase orders and/ or planned warehouse orders).<br />
I have been using standard items in budget! We heve defined for every item:<br />
Order policy: To order<br />
Order system: MRP or Manual<br />
<br />
1.I create budget lines!<br />
2.I change budget status to active.<br />
3.I generate control data (in reports we can see created cotrol data for all of budget lines).<br />
3.I try to generate a planned orders.<br />
4.The system generates Planned Purchase Order only for one position!<br />
<br />
I have not tested this problem with different item. We create budget with <br />
particular &quot;Project&quot;, &quot;Element&quot; and &quot;Cost type&quot;. I have been left with the <br />
impression that this problem occure only for items with type &quot;Material&quot;. We <br />
have not problems with a &quot;Subcontracting&quot;.<br />
We generate planned orders once in a year. Last year this problem did not <br />
occure. Untill this case we installed a many different solutions.<br />
There is enough stock for this item, BUT I think that the system must <br />
to generate &quot;Planned Warehouse Order&quot; in this case! Am I right or not?<br />
<br />
I have tried following situation:<br />
I have changed quantity (from 1 pcs to 2000pcs)in budget line for particular <br />
item (the system does not generate Planned Orders for this item). After this <br />
changing the system generates &quot;Planned Purchase Order&quot; with quantity 1999 pcs!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you contact BAAN Support regarding this issue?<br />
It sounds like you may have installed a bad fix with one of the solutions and before we help you here at BaanBoard I suggest you first make sure the issue is not caused by a bug in the software.<br />
<br />
Once you know for sure you are current with all the solutions then we can investigate this further.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amyumyun</div><div class="date">6th January 2005, 09:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the case has been logged in BaaN Support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">6th January 2005, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Did they already provide you with a solution or is the case still being worked on by them?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">6th January 2005, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">OK..I suggest we wait until Baan Support has done its &quot;thing&quot;. Before we make all sorts of assumptions we have to exclude the fact that the issue is not with the software. Then we can determine your set up and see how we can get this resolved for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">12th January 2005, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">As well as the usual order system as defined with the item master data, there is also a definition specifically  for (TP) project item data, where you can choose between 'PRP' or 'Manual'. When you set this to manual then no PRP orders (warehouse or purchase) will be generated for the item. Have you checked that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amyumyun</div><div class="date">12th January 2005, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you tell me the session number?</div></div><hr />

It might be nice for the people on this board if you could add a brief description of how it was fixed though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amyumyun</div><div class="date">14th January 2005, 12:26</div></div><div class="posttext">When we generate control data and then planned orders the first time system creates records in the tables tppss600 - Maitain Planned Material Transaction, tppss610 - Maintain Planned Purchase Orders and/or tppss615 - Maintain Planned Warehouse Orders. If we try to regenerate planned orders the system first looks in the table tppps600 and then in tppss610 anr/or tppss615 if there there are any records BaaN checks-up their status if they are with status Planned they will be deleted and will be recreated again.<br />
If there are records in table tppss600 and the are not records in tppss610 and/or the system &quot;suppose&quot; that the records has been processed and transfered in package Distribution. In this case new records will not be created.<br />
In my case there was no any records in tppss615.</div></div><hr />
