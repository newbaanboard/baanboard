My Project Budget/Control Combination is Element/Activity<br />
<br />
But I am following Element Progressive Invoice.<br />
When I book the progressive invoice the system is taking the complete Element Contract amount and creating installment for this, <br />
This is the case for another project created with ELEMENT/ELEMENT Combination.<br />
<br />
Have i missed anything? <br />
In the the element progress, Progressive invoice says 'Y'<br />
Invoicing Method is the combination of &quot; Progressive Invoice&quot;<br />
Collect = YES &amp; GROSS/NET = GROSS<br />

<br />
My Client's requirement is to have the Project Planning Module (Requirement Planning by Activity Plan) and also to have Progressive Invoicing based on Element.<br />
<br />
If I set the parameter for Project Budget and Project Control as Element &amp; Activity in Maintain Projects, <br />
The first requirement of having Planning Module functioning in integration with Element and also using Activity Plan to get the schedule for the Resource requirement by Project Requirements Module, is met.<br />
<br />
With the above parameter, I am not able to invoice based on the Progress of the Element.<br />
The client invoicing is based on the progress of the Element.<br />
<br />
Hope I am clear,Pl reply back for any more details??<br />
&amp; Pl let me know how can solve this?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Sridhar</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please send me your e-mail address with your contact information. I ran a test and have been able to invoice on the element progress on a non-top element.<br />
The project budget/control set up is element/activity.<br />
<br />
I would like to send you some of my screen dumps so that you can run the test yourself as well and invoice based on element progress as per your client's requirement.<br />
