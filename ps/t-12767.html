Please let us know if this is for BAAN Project or BAAN Service.<br />
Both have the capability of using an external planning board.<br />
If you are doing this in relation to BAAN Project let us know if you want to connect to MS Project. Open Plan Enterprise or another package.<br />
<br />

Please mail me the attachment because our firewall does not allow me to download your document from BaanBoard.<br />
My e-mail address is evdborg@hotmail.com.<br />
<br />
What did BAAN Support tell you to do regarding the instruction to install everything?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Ensure you have the latest Planboard solutions from Baan. <br />
Also ensure that you have the latest tools standard program <br />
( I had a small hiccup recently because of this)<br />
<br />
Also since you installed from your server there can be a problem if the files already existed on your system. Uninstall everything , reboot your system and install again. <br />
<br />
After that register the dll as per installation instructions.<br />
<br />
Reboot<br />
<br />
Now try to connect to planboard..</div></div><hr />

This offers better functionality than the Planning Board and has a more stable connection to BAAN V Service.<br />
<br />
All the companies in the US that I know no longer use the Planning Board and switched to the Service Scheduler.<br />
