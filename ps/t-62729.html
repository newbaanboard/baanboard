<br />
Sorry for double posting.<br />
<br />
I created the service order in tssoc2110m000 in co. 810 and entered the Reported Problem and Expected Solution in this screen.<br />
<br />
But when i go see the table tsclm100 for co.810, the table is empty with no records.<br />
So where is it being kept, i still do not know<br />
Please advise<br />
<br />
thanks n regards,</div></div><hr />

If you register a Call first, Reported Problem and Expected Solution definitely come from the Call table.<br />
<br />
Dynamic Forms Editor for your session shows the fields as frm.rprl and frm.expr. Without source code, I can't tell where the fields are originating from.<br />
<br />
Maybe you could log an incident with Infor and they can tell you where the fields are coming from when a Call is not first registered.<br />

Oops ... It looks like Bernd gave you the solution on your other Tools thread.</div></div><hr />
