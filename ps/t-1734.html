<br />
We also have Service module implemented. For calculation I had tried and did not find any function and then we customised reports based on our own calculation. If you are still interested, please let me know and i will be able to share the same. If you have found another way of doing it, please let me know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Table tssma301 has ddt1 (Orderdate) , dtm1 (Ordertime) and<br />
                            ddt2 (servicedate) . dtm2 (Servicetime)<br />
therefor you have to calculate the difference between date and time.<br />
datediff can be calculated with (ddt2 - ddt1) in days<br />
time is stored in seconds since midnight<br />
calculate difference of dtm1 and dtm2 gives difference in seconds.<br />
<br />
