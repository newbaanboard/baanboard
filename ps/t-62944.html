<br />
Is there an existing report for Working Capital by Project?  (Current Assets less Current Liabilities)<br />
<br />
Such a report would enable project managers to work with the Finance/Treasury to best manage their company's working capital.  <br />
<br />
In particular, this report would help industrial equipment companies that sell valuable goods with multi-year payment plans.<br />
<br />
The report I am looking for would show the information, ideally by period.<br />
<br />
1) The status of the open A/R entries generated by Project (i.e. from Installments)<br />
2) The status of the open A/P entries generated by Project (i.e. from project-specific Purchase Orders)<br />
3) A summary of the aggregate working capital for all projects selected.<br />
<br />
The report would also have specific filters by data on the project header. (i.e. category, geographical area, project manager, etc.)<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />
