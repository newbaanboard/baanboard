In BaaN IV this was not the case.<br />
<br />
Thanks a heap in advance.<br />

<br />
The reason why the BP at the service contract level and the BP at the configuration level are not the same is that in some cases the company that pays for the service contract does not necessarily have to be the same company as the one using the equipment (configuration).<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
1) a lease company may own the equipment and pays therefore for the service contract but another company is than using the equipment. In that case the user will be linked to the configuration and the lease company to the service contract;<br />
2) some companies have a centralized purchasing department and will be responsible for buying the service contracts and another department or a dealer may be using the equipment.<br />
<br />
These are just examples of scenarios I have seen in the field from BAAN V companies using Service. Of course you can have many more business scenarios and it would be interesting to let us know what you would like to do in BAAN V so we can help you further.<br />
Both examples mentioned above are just examples and can be resoved in BAAN V in another way if need be.<br />
<br />

Your second example reflects my business scenario as we have a Centralized Purchase Department for Equipments and the actual usage of the equipments takes place at a Service station located elsewhere.<br />
