Using the Estimate Lines session we can add a generic item, and be asked to configure the product variant options immediately, however the returned cost and sales prices are always zero.<br />
<br />
We'd like the system to calculate the cost price to use on the estimate line based on the configured BOM and routing as per PCS projects.  Is this possible?  <br />
<br />
What can be achieved by using the generic items be used within estimate lines?</div></div><hr />

In the budget after the product variant is created you need to generate the product structure. Depending on weather the generic item is to order or anonymous it will either created a customised item or a standard item.<br />
<br />
Once the standard or customised item is created, then a question will pop up to ask weather you want to cost the item. Only after this then the cost is updated in the budget.<br />
<br />
There may be a similar function in estimates that you could explore.</div></div><hr />
