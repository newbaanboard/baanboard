<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulrich Hofmann</div><div class="date">16th August 2013, 01:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Elements are used to set up a - technical Structure (WBS) of Projects<br />
Activities are used to create an - executional Structure (Plan) of Project<br />
<br />
Elements and Activities can be linked in two ways:<br />
- via the Element Relations - for a global planning of Budgets Lines of Elements<br />
- via Element Budget Lines - for individual planning of Lines<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: In more complex Projects (Ships, Plants, Machinery etc.) the project should be structured with Elements and supported with Activities for scheduling (coming from MS- Project or other Tools like Open Plan)<br />
<br />
The Element Structure can be changed if required if there is Design Changes or add ones i.e. if Scope of Project changes. If there is scheduling changes this can be done via changes in the link of activities to Budget Lines or Element. However, a change in planning does not lead to change in the Element (Build) Structure!) <br />
<br />
This is a very important item that should be considered very carefully. If there is the plan, to set up complex projects with an Activity Structure only, this will lead for sure to conflicts between integrity of the Build (Design) structure and the plan or schedule of the project.<br />
<br />
However, the original item was - Difference of Element and Activity. The Element is the &quot;Lego - Block&quot; that allows the set-up of the Scope (independent from planning aspects) The Activity is the Equivalent to the Planning Activity with Early / Late Start - Early / Late Finish - POC and the link with Resources.<br />
<br />
I hope, this will bring more light in, to brighten things up :) <br />

<br />
Now, I would simulate the linking between Elements and Activities.</div></div><hr />
