<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nanuco</div><div class="date">11th February 2005, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to implement a solution where our service vehicles are also warehouses.<br />
98% of the service orders are internal and do not have business partner associated.<br />
<br />
What we are trying is:<br />
1-to have indeed a relation of the material that is inside the vehicles (working as a warehouse and that is easy to do).<br />
2-At the end of the day create automatic replenishment orders from a central warehouse to the service car.<br />
Do i need the enterprise planning module for this?<br />
<br />
I would like to know if anyone has this working?<br />
Any help would be appreciated,<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />

<br />
The relationship between BAAN V Service and BAAN V Enterprise Planning is only applicable in case you would like to schedule the maintenance of your own machines as defined in the tirou module in BAAN V Manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Since you have indicated you are not using this functionality you can use the Global SRP and Detail SRP functionality in BAAN V Service for replenishment purposes. These planning engines will create the corresponding planned orders in BAAN V Warehousing.<br />
However, this all depends on your set up in Service and Warehousing.<br />
<br />
Almost every BAAN customer using BAAN V Service is using these functionalities in BAAN V.<br />
Please contact me at evdborg@hotmail.com if you need specific help on this issue.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
