Having a system generated project code would create too much confusion if number group/series use was compulsory.</div></div><hr />

The use of the series is optional, as least it was when I last checked.</div></div><hr />

If you are on the TP Project dashboard and insert a new project it appears you cannot key a new code directly into the project code field ( An error message appears about the requirements of the default project group and series).  I found however if you click on the zoom for the project ID then you are presented with a choice of Series to choose from, and if you choose the General series then you can add a free form project code to the General Project list. This can then be used as the TP Project project code.  <br />
I guess this just another one of those extra layers of information required we are coming across as we migrate from Baan IV to Ln :)</div></div><hr />
