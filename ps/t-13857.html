<br />
The choice Project Budget: Activity Budget and Control Budget: Element Budget is not available in standard BAAN and that is a technical issue. BAAN Development has build the package that way. The reason is that when you want to monitor a project (comparing buget with actual costs) you will compare apples and oranges.<br />
<br />
The solution is to have a Project Budget: Element Budget and Control Budget: Element Budget but on the Project Budget side you can still enter Activities and link those to the Elements. This is usefull if you want to work with a planning package and make things visible in a (external) planningboard.<br />
The downside is that for the Project Budget you have to maintain data in two places because you will be using Elements and Activities. This the main reason why most customers do not want use Project in this way.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you and let me know if you have other questions.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

sorry I am late to thank for your interest.<br />
<br />
It gives some clue but still i am a bit uncomfortable as what might be the exact reason. As their inequality; still element budget_setup budget vs activity budget_actual budget  comparison makes one of the bases. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks again.<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />

I've given appr. 25 Baan Project courses between 1996 and 1998, and this question was raised every single course. Besides the reasons that Edwin stated, there may also be a &quot;business&quot; reason for it, although I don't know if Baan meant it this way..??<br />
<br />
In real-life projects, almost every project logically starts with a breakdown of the project by means of the WBS (after the estimate has been transfered to a budget). It almost never occurs that a project is started with a project activity schedule and that a WBS structure (read: element budget) is derived from this.<br />
<br />
From this first (global) WBS, the project is gradually broken down into more detail and finally activities and resources are added, resulting in the activity budget. <br />
<br />
I hope this helped a little.<br />

Thank you,<br />
Combining with what Edwin mentioned, clears most of the question. <br />
Best Regards<br />
