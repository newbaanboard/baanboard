We are using Baan V for our External service calls handling. We have few issues in this and want help from you all Baan expert Guys &amp; Gals.<br />
<br />
I am looking for some details on usages of Service Car. We have a requirement wherein we want to store spares into different engineers Service Car. <br />
<br />
Once a service order is assigned to Engineer and if he completes service order using inventory from his service car same should be consumed from his car.<br />
<br />
We should be able to keep track of inventory based on each service car.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to do so in Baan V (SP22) ?<br />
<br />
Many thanks to you in advance.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
