<br />
I do not know if you already went to BAAN Support regarding this question.<br />
In the past you could use BAAN Automation Server to link MS Project with BAAN IV_c Project.<br />
But since BAAN V they came with a feature pack for making the link between BAAN V_c Project and MS Project.<br />
<br />
This may all depend on the version of MS Project you are working with.<br />
<br />
So, I would first check with BAAN Support because if they have one for you it will be for free (as long as your company pays its maintenance fee of course).<br />

I'm aware of the Baan V standard coupling, but it is not available for Baan IV. I'm also aware of the fact that a number of companies did creat the interface themselves. I do not have the capacity to develop, I just want to buy if it is available!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have coupled MS Project with BAAN IV_c Project before using the BAAN Automation server which is supplied by BAAN for free.<br />
So, why would you look for something to buy if you can get it for free?<br />
I am not aware of anybody who build an interface between MS Project and BAAN IV_c Project and am sorry I cannot help you here.<br />
<br />

<br />
in my opinion the connect MSP - Baan TP with Automation Server is only for BaanERP 5.0c to SP 10. After SP 10 there is only a connect with OpenWorld.<br />
I don't know any connect for Baan IVc4 with MSP, but I'm interested in this too. A lot of my customers are looking for a standard connect Baan IV - MSP. If you found one, please send me some informationes...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
