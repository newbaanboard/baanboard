<br />
I am looking for a good insight of Main Project with several subprojects functinallity. We have several similar projects which we want to control in a centralized way, to reduce data entry in single projects. What are the advantages of having Main-sub project stucture? <br />
<br />
I will appreciate your input on this.<br />
<br />
Kind regards and thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Yes, we have several projects for diffrent customers and these projects are very similar. My concern is that we will have to enter very similar data(cost data) in all sub-projects  repeatedly. Or is there a way to have a centralized data entry to be distributed among projects or replicated across all sub-projects.<br />
<br />
Thanks again in advance.</div></div><hr />
