Is there anyone who also has the same requirements. I am working with Infor to try get a resolution but difficult if we are the only ones with this requirement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps you can suggest to Infor to make this a parameter setting for Service Order Control:<br />
<br />
Do you want gross or net pricing for Invoicing Amount in service order actual labour costs?<br />
<br />
In this case it will be up to the user of the system how he/she wants to drive this and Infor can still handle all possible scenario's.<br />
I wonder how this now works for material and other costs.</div></div><hr />
