<br />
When a service order is planned through session &quot;run global SRP&quot; service engineer is not getting allocated to service order.<br />
no. of service employees are already attached with the cofiguration used in the service order. Also the parameter&quot;allocate engg during global SRP&quot; is yes.<br />
<br />
We have not installed BaaN Automation Server. Will we be able to use Detail SRP. If not then how service engineers will be planned?<br />
<br />
Kindly give some solution.<br />
<br />
thanks ain advance<br />

I'm not sure why your default engineer is not being picked up from the configuration details; I seem to remember it is Preferred Engineer 1 that gets the work...<br />
<br />
If you have not installed Automation Server you will not be able to run DSRP, but you can allocate engineers directly to Service Orders using tssoc2105m000.  If this is done, it will be possible to release the orders with the button on the Service Order session.  Obviously this would not be good if you are processing lots or orders daily.  Another approach would be to use the Service Scheduler available as an extra product.  You then have visual drag and drop allocation of work to engineers, a scheduling assistant to make sure all the constraints are balanced, and can transfer the orders for execution directly from there, including issuing them to engineers with E-Service Remote if you use it.<br />
