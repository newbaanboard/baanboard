In ERP LN, the is a possiblity of the including more than one business partner.<br />
But the unitrate BP can be only one. Why so?<br />
<br />
Can any one help me with the logic behind this.<br />

<br />
in case more than one BP would be involved it would be necessary to know which units are to be invoiced to whom. If that would have been present, multiple bp's by project could be handled. At the time the option was introduced this did not seem relevant and was not catered for.</div></div><hr />
