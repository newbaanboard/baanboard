<br />
If you have some time please go to the &quot;Polls &amp; Surveys&quot; section of BaanBoard and participate in my poll regarding a Warranty Management &amp; Tracking System.<br />
<br />
I have encountered a relatively large number of customers that keep all this information outside of BAAN in a legacy system or in some ocassions have done a customization with rather poor integrations to other areas in BAAN.<br />
<br />
It may be that a more standard solution is appropriate now that will be web based, supports XML standards to allow integrations with dealerships to handle proper warranty claim reimbursements by an OEM and an integration to a PDM system to close the loop for Engineering from the Service organization.<br />
<br />
This solution should of course be integrated to BAAN IV Service and BAAN V Service and help you to run your Service business more efficiently.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Edwin</div></div><hr />
