<br />
We have calculated and estimated values - but nothing in recognised.<br />
We have invoiced a number of periods, with some periods still to be invoiced.<br />
We have run session tsctm4251m000 recognize contract revenue - but no values are created.<br />
<br />
The earned revenue factor is zero - not sure if this is correct?<br />
<br />
Our revenue recognition is set to &quot;number of days per period&quot; in the service parameters.<br />
We have finance posts stuck in interim accounts - and we had hoped that revenue recognition would move them.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
thanks<br />
