<br />
I just want to know that in project Contract there is a field Contract Manager which should come by default or we need to put it manually.<br />
or<br />
Is there any way to set the contract Manager defaults.<br />
<br />
Another concern is in project contract line when we are generating Installments all entities are getting populated in installments except Tax registration number of BP.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your response.</div></div><hr />

Probably you never have defined the tax number as part of your tax setup. Best to check your setup in the Taxation module.</div></div><hr />
