   i have a situation where in B4c3 service call actual costs , parts are booked thru automated process (Customized).<br />
 Due to recent server upgrades the automation failed &amp; what happend is parts , costs booking sent thru file were processed by Baan but due to permissions issue the files didnt get moved.<br />
   This resulted into logging those parts,costs multiple times on same call &amp; inventory got issued to.<br />
We need to handle this &amp; is there any correction program or solution thru which we can revers the inventory issue &amp; set status back to free and inventory be updated for plenty of calls? i know the manual solutions but looking for better solution</div></div><hr />
