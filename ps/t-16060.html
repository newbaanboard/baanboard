BaaN Vc,<br />

I want to ensure that all my users mandatorily use the step 'Completed' for every service order. Right now they Cost the Service Order directly without Completing the Service Order. What would be the best method of doing this?<br />
Is there any way I can force them click on the 'Completed' button.<br />
<br />
Thanks a heap in advance.</div></div><hr />

As far as I know there is no facility to build in a mandatory step for this.<br />
I am interested how you guys are handling the service order activities as they also have statusses like &quot;Completed&quot; and &quot;Costed&quot;.<br />
Perhaps you can manage this at the service order activity level rather than at the service order level.<br />
<br />

<br />
Activities are not given much emphasis here and the main part is for the materials only. I guess as rightly told by tou, there is no possibility of making 'Completed' as mandatory. Earlier in Baan Iv, we used to reverse the status sometimes to make a few adjustments and now in Baan V even that is not possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still see two possibilities here:<br />
<br />
- You only allow them to cost the material lines but not the Service Orders or Service Order Activities<br />
- You have the ability to modify the forms and disable the &lt;Costed&gt; buttons.<br />
This way they will not have the ability to set Service Orders to &quot;Costed&quot; and the only status change they can make is &quot;Completed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Perhaps one of these two help.<br />
<br />

<br />
Your suggestion of disabling the buttons seems ideal.<br />
I am unable to understand as to how I can cost the material lines alone seperately? Can u please explain? Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I can remember there is a button called &lt;Costed&gt; at the cost line level. So, for Labor, Material, Subcontracting and Other Costs you should be able to cost the lines individually. <br />
That can be confusing as we can cost at the service order level, service order activity level and at the cost line level.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
