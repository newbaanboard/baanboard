1)The service order is created and link is established to BaaN Project(tp).<br />
2) Actual service order costs are booked to the service order through Hours registration in Tp(tphrs1100m000)..<br />
3) The service order is costed and invoiced.<br />
4)The cost of incurred against the service order cannot be seen in the project after running build actual cost control.<br />
<br />
 What is the procedure for getting the costs aggregated to the project and the revenues to the project?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming you are using BAAN IV and the integration indicator for &quot;Service&quot; in tphrs1100m000, I BELIEVE there will not be any labor costs booked against your project if you follow this particular scenario.<br />
Right now I don't have access to a BAAN IV system to test this out for you so please bear with me here.<br />
<br />
In fact I have two questions for you:<br />
<br />
- In case you enter data in tphrs1100m000 are you also entering a project number or just the service order number?<br />
- Are you sure you haven't linked the service order to a PCS project?<br />
<br />
Please answer these two questions and when I have access to BAAN IV again later next week I will be able to test and see what is happening. Then I can also answer your question regarding project cost and revenue aggregation. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Edwin</div></div><hr />
