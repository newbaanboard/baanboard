<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kinley</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to understand an integration transaction from TP projects and need some help on it.<br />
 <br />
I have transferred inventory from a normal warehouse to a project site by raising a transfer order in warehousing. <br />
 <br />
When I confirm the shipment on the outbound lines of this tranfer order, the following integration transaction is triggered :<br />
 <br />
Transaction origin : Warehousing (transfer manual )<br />
Financial transaction : Issued to project <br />
 <br />
Debit :    Project deliveries acount<br />
Credit :   Inventory<br />
 <br />
The cost of this  inventory is shown under the project in TP, I confirmed the costs and this triggered the following integration transaction :<br />
 <br />
Transaction origin : Project costs and commitment<br />
Financial transaction : Receipt <br />
 <br />
As per a document on integrations, the debit and credit ledger accounts for the above integration transaction are :<br />
 <br />
Debit : Inventory <br />
Credit : ITBR .<br />
 <br />
This entry would be correct if I had raised a purchase order and purchased inventory directly for the project. <br />
 <br />
But when I have transferred inventory from a warehouse to a project, the ITBR account should not be credited as there is no purchase order or purchase invoice raised here . The ITBR should logically be credited only when the inventory is directly purchased for the project from a purchase order. <br />
 <br />
Also the project deliveries account ( debited earlier ) is not balanced now. If the project deliveries account is credited here, the entry would seem correct . <br />
 <br />
But the problem is the same integration entry : Project costs and commitment - Receipt is triggered whether it is a transfer from a warehouse or purchase of inventory from a purchase order.</div></div><hr />

Did you get the solution for the same!!!!<br />
Sorry was just going through the Board and saw your query<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">25th April 2003, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the second half of the transaction (project cost and commitments / receipt) should be:<br />
debit: project wip (materials)<br />
credit: project deliveries<br />
<br />
The project deliveries is an interim account, holding the balance of goods in transit (and goods physically received in the project but where the project cost has not yet been accepted and posted).<br />
<br />
purchase order receipts for items purchased directly for a project should trigger project cost and commitments / purchase direct receipt, which would use a goods received not invoiced account (assuming that's what your ITBR is)</div></div><hr />
