<br />
We are on LN 6.1 FP6, and would like to use the counters for <br />
<br />
recording meter readings for the Parent as well as some of the child <br />
<br />
components in the Configuration of Serialized item, by default the meter<br />
<br />
reading of the parent is the same as that of the child, but in some cases<br />
<br />
it may differ, we would like to know wether the meter reading of the parent <br />
<br />
can be defaulted to that of the child (with a different measurement type / <br />
<br />
meter) . Also is there any standard session which can display the cumilative<br />
<br />
reading of the meter by a serialized item.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />
