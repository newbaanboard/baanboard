<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sjohnson</div><div class="date">27th November 2008, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Could someone please explain the item breakdown structure in LN service and more specifically why you can only create a item breakdown for a serialized item. If you have a P-BOM that's 4 levels deep, top level item is serialized, and you want to do repair on the item, you need the entire BOM brought into service as a starting point. I can't seem to bring in the level 3 items because they are not serialized. The error message is &quot; parent item XXXX is anonymous. It is not allowed to link child items &quot;. The session I'm using is  Create item breakdown from standard production BOM (tscfg1210m200).<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Session tscfg1210m200 is only used to bring in the main item (end item) and the components that are serialized. It is assumed that in the Service business everything evolves around traceable warranties linked to the item and if the item is not serialized you cannot link a warranty to that item.<br />
<br />
Once you have copied the end item (including the serialized components if available) you can bring in the rest of the BOM items that are not serialized. This is done via session tscfg2210m000 (Create Physical Breakdown Structure) and you need to select the option &lt;As-Built Structure&gt; in the Source tab.<br />
In LN Service the physical breakdown structure is the final structure that is used to capture all preventive and reactive maintenance. The physical breakdown structure can be derived from the item breakdown since in the Service business there may be more to maintain than just what has been manufactured in the TI package.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
