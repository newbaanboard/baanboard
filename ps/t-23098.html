I run several projects and during the execution a certain project I must change the structure and the budget (maybe it is related with some technical issue) of the following project and all project in execution (all projects are with same type for example cargo-boat).<br />
I want this changes to be maded on ship-model level and then scatter automaticly to &quot;copy&quot; projects.<br />
Is there any way to realize that?</div></div><hr />

No relationship between ' source' and 'target' project is stored.<br />
If it would have been possible I would even be reluctant to update all target projects. I could imagine the status or phase of the project would need to be considered.</div></div><hr />
