<br />
At Baan ERP 5c, our customer has found next situation:<br />
- suppose a service order Z with estimated material A.<br />
Material A has default warehouse X1 defined at general item data<br />
- when releasing service order, outbound order line is created but blocked (warehouse X1)<br />
- if warehouse at estimated materials is changed to X2, when releasing service order, outbound order line is created but not blocked (warehouse X2)<br />
<br />
Warehouse X1 and X2 are similars<br />
I can't reproduce it internally. I always get outbound order line not blocked.<br />
So my doubts are:<br />
1- Why is the outbound order line blocked?<br />
2- What is the correct situation? outbound order line blocked or unblocked?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />
Veronica</div></div><hr />

<br />
When the service order is released the outbound order line should be unblocked in Warehousing.<br />
That is standard functionality.<br />
<br />
Please let me know what the types of these warehouses are: &quot;Normal&quot; or &quot;Service&quot;.<br />
The reason that blocking occurs in case of warehouse X1 can be anything and is very difficult to determine with the little info I have now.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">29th August 2003, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Please check the locations in your warehouses X1 and X2.  You can do this in session whwmd3500m000 and then double click on the locations that apply here. This will bring you to session whwmd3100s000 and in the &lt;Transactions&gt; tab you can see whether these locations have been blocked or not.<br />
The goods located in warehouse X1 may be in a blocked location.<br />
<br />
If this is not it then check session whinh6110m000 ((Un)Block Warehouses)<br />

<br />
both warehouses are defined as &quot;Normal&quot; and no locations are used at them.<br />
<br />
thanks and regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">29th August 2003, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds like a data issue on your customer's system and I do not have enough info to explain why the blocking takes place.<br />
It is my experience that blocking of outbound order lines can basically come from any where and in order to find out what is going on I should have access to the system to see for myself.<br />
<br />
Standard functionality is that the outbound order line is not blocked once the service order is released.<br />
As you have seen warehouse X2 works fine and also on your internal system you cannot reproduce the problem.<br />
<br />
Perhaps other BaanBoard members have seen this before and hopefully they can give you a better answer.<br />
Good luck and if you need anything let me know.<br />
<br />

<br />
I had a similiar problem . <br />
<br />
The warehouse from where the material was to be issued ( say x1) was actually connected to a service car.  ( Making it the warehouse in the car!!)  =&gt; tsmdm1545m000<br />
<br />
incidentally, I found it out because the issue button in actual material cost lines was enabled and I could issue the material if I would click on this button.<br />
<br />
As Edwin said,  a warehouse blocking can occur due to multiple reasons like cycle counting , location blocked,  Lot expired and blocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veronica</div><div class="date">1st September 2003, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
you were right, warehouse involved at the problem is linked to service car. I have been able to reproduce that.<br />
Now my q√ºestion is : is this the standard funcionality?<br />
I thought the link was by service engineer:<br />
service engineer-----&gt;service car------&gt;warehouse<br />
<br />
But service engineer used has no service car assigned....<br />
<br />
any idea?<br />
<br />
