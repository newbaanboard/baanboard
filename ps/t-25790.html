<br />
Is there someone who can help me setup the detailled service order planning (Session tssoc2265m000) in BaanV?<br />
<br />
In particular, I don't know how to setup the Baan Automation Server for this programm.<br />
I have installed the software for the BaanGenericAutomationServer and DSRP locally, but apparently this is not enough...<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />
cheers,<br />
Frank :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please check with BAAN Support on this one as there can be many different reasons why DSRP is not running at your site.<br />
I am sure BAAN Support will have documentation available for setting everything up regarding DSRP.<br />
<br />
I have been working with b50 Service since the beginning (1998) and have not yet seen any customer running DSRP. I am sure there must be a handfull out there but all customers I have met only worked with Global SRP.<br />
Why do you want to utilize DSRP?<br />
<br />

<br />
I found the &quot;Detailled SRP Installation Guide&quot; in the Cyberdocs, that describes the steps you have to take.<br />
Filling the Automation Server parameters is crucial (Session asint0100s000), don't forget the Versionnumber there, otherwise things don't work.<br />
<br />
As to detailled planning: I want to test 2 things:<br />
- Engineer assignment to orders or activities based on skills<br />
- Stock transfers to service vehicles<br />
as far as I know, Global planning does not includee these steps.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frank holland</div><div class="date">2nd December 2005, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Although the Session tssoc2265m000 now runs without error messages on the Automation server, my orders are not planned (no engineer assigned).<br />
In the error report I get message tssocs2294 &quot;No capacity in planning calender&quot;.<br />
Both my engineers and my configuration have a calender code.<br />
Does someone have an idea what could be missing here?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Does your calendar have a blank availability type set up?  If not, it needs to!  <br />
<br />

<br />
I'm currently involved  in a B5 Service project, but the customer is going to use only GSRP: the detailled planning is going to be executed in an external FSA using a fancy graphical planning board. Engineers are tooled with PDA's to receive and transfer data from and into Baan for hours accounting and materials.<br />
Whoever might be intrested in details of the project: just shoot me a message.<br />
