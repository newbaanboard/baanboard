<br />
I want to know the function of &quot;To Be Settled&quot; check box at activity level.<br />
<br />
When I check that the settlement price option gets enabled, after defining the settlement Price,  when I create progress invoice, system should use that settlement price to generate the progress amount.<br />
<br />
But its not happening. is there anything else that needs to be set for this.<br />
<br />
Urgently required ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotjens</div><div class="date">20th November 2015, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Differences to the budgeted quantities can potentially be settled for a different sales price, the settlement price. From your short description it is not clear whether that situation applies. Please also check the invoicing method. That should cater for additional work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sanjay2210.msl</div><div class="date">21st November 2015, 07:11</div></div><div class="posttext">the Infor help about the settlement price shows something different.<br />
&quot;Settlement Price <br />
If you decide later on in your project that the sales price you set on this activity is too high or too low, you can settle it here. The old price will remain only for display and comparison.&quot;<br />
<br />
According to this system should generate progressive amount on settlement price. But that is not happening, its generating progressive amount on the basis of Sales Price defined in activity.</div></div><hr />

Actually from what version is your quote?</div></div><hr />
