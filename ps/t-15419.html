<br />
I am evaluating / doing a high level review to see how well Baan service module will fit to be used as a plant maintenence package. When I say plant maintenance I mean:<br />
<br />
1) create maintenance (work / service) orders for breakdowns<br />
2) maintain times when issues were reported &amp; fixed<br />
3) generate orders for preventive maintenance (that is based on schedule set for machines)<br />
4) Track spares used for repairs. Track spare parts level and order spare parts<br />
5) maintain recommended spare parts list for machines<br />
6) assing technicians to calls (breakdown or preventive maintenance orders)<br />
7) Track technician time spent on fixing issues<br />
<br />
I am a newbie to Service and don't know nothing about it so I would love to know experiences comments that you all might have to help me doing the evaluation. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Unfortunately BAAN IV Service has not a lot to offer on plant manitenance (or sometimes referred to as Internal Maintenance). <br />
There are no integrations with MRP for example so when maintenance on a machine has been scheduled via a service order in Service the MRP run will not take this into account.<br />
All preventive maintenance in BAAN IV Service is based on time (x numbers of times per week, month, year, etc.) and not at all based on conditions and usage of the machines.<br />
<br />
As far as I know you can do almost all of the things you required in your list from 1) to 7) but you have to understand that if you  use BAAN IV Service you have to be very creative during the implementation setting everything up (including the integrations with BAAN Finance). It will be very important that all processes in your company regarding plant maintenance have been documented accurately. When you have a good understanding of how BAAN IV Service actually works a gap analysis can be done and you can start implementing.<br />
<br />
If you need more help with this please feel free to mail me at edwin@vdbsolutions.com.<br />
I have created a two day workshop for BAAN IV Service (including providing an initial gap analysis based on your high level requirements).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">8th June 2004, 01:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Edwin has already covered most of the points - I have analyzed the use of Baan IV for internal maintenance, and it does cover your requirements provided you have a separate service warehouse with a planned stock level.  That way, when you consume spares the spares warehouse can be replenished from a central store using DRP.  You need to bear in mind that no allocations are made against estimated materials in Baan IV.  Also, you would have to ensure that installations created for internal assets are covered by a 100% warranty to avoid having to raise invoices on yourself.<br />
<br />
A further point to consider is that companies that wish to do this often want to combine maintenance costs with service with depreciation costs from the fixed assets module in an attempt to monitor lifecycle costs for assets, which can help in repair/replace decisions.  There are no standard links between service and fixed assets, so if you need to do this then it may be necessary to apply common coding in the two modules and then use a reporting tool to extract and combine the data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The requirements that you have listed out below are quite common. I have been working from last 4 years in Service and based on my experience each and every requirement listed can be easily fulfilled in the service module. It can handle from tracking to issuance, replacement, warranty, contracts,maintenance plans, execution of plans, assigning of engineer, having tracking of date and time at each and every point, transaction logs, invoicing of total cost as well as activity based cost.<br />
<br />
So just keep your eyes closed and trust on service module. For any more details you can contact me.<br />
