<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulrich Hofmann</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 09:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't worry, you didn't make any mistake! Baan IV does not book incomming items in any warehouse. This function is available only in Baan V and LN.<br />
<br />
What you see is in Monitoring and in Project History, material being booked to the project. Costs will go directly to the project.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, this function is available (optional) in V and higher, but I think, in projects you don't realy need to work with it. In projects, your aim is it to plan delivery in time. If so, you use the material right on the spot. If you deliver to the project site, well I doubt, if you have a &quot;warehouse&quot; there. <br />
<br />
At the end, you tend to have lots of material transactions but what is the benefit of it? So, don't worry, be happy</div></div><hr />
