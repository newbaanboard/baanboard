<br />
SSA LN <br />
--------------<br />
<br />
I am having a problem in picking up the labor rates in the Service Orders.<br />
<br />
I create a refernce activity and attach the material and labour resources required to it. I attach the task to the resource requirements. To the task I attach the labor rate specific for each task.<br />
Eg Task 1 - labor cost rate is 10 USD<br />
Task 2 - labor cost rate 15 USD etc.<br />
<br />
However when I create the Service order and attach the reference activity to it, it picks up the resource requirements as part of the estimated labor, but the labour rates do not get picked up. In fact the labor rate field itself is empty. When I fill this up, then the cost rates get picked up.<br />
<br />
The problem is I have many such labor requirements for a single reference activity and it would be very tedious if I have to add the labor rate for every resource requirement.<br />
<br />
Can you suggest if I have missed out on some setting or is this the way LN has the functionality or some workaround please.<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Best Regards<br />

So they can be empty on the service labor line but still retrieved from the reference activity if the search path has been defined accordingly.</div></div><hr />
