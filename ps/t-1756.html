<br />
What is your setting for the field &quot;Calculate Surcharges on Purchase Price of Lot Item&quot; in session tdltc0100m000 (Maintain LTC Parameters)?<br />
Did you set this to 'Yes' or 'No'?<br />
Please let me know so that I can help you further.<br />
<br />

<br />
    From the picture ,After I run session &quot;Maintain Outbound Data&quot; (by press Application--&gt; Maintain Outbound Data) I want to issue the material with actual cost from &quot;lot price&quot; but the amount 200.00 on field price is standard price(from field purchase price on session Maintain Item Data).  <br />
<br />
     How can I do?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Viwat.<br />

If you did figure out please let me know.<br />

What exactly is your issue with regards to using lot prices in BAAN IV Service?<br />
The same as Vivat's?<br />
<br />
I have time available to sort things out for you.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">13th September 2002, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Using a lot price in BAAN IV Service is possible.<br />
<br />
For the lot controlled item the field &quot;Inventory Valuation&quot; has to be set to 'Lot Price' in session tiitm0101m000.<br />
After the lot and the lot price have been created via the receipt of a purchase order for example the item/lot combination can be issued via tssma3110m000.<br />
Basically this is executed in ILC and after maintaining and releasing the outbound data for the item/lot combination you will see the cost price of the item master populated in the field &quot;Cost Price&quot; in tssma3110m000. However, not the Lot Price as anticipated.<br />
<br />
In fact this is correct because if you then go to tfgld4510m000 and check your service order after the outbound data has been released you will see actually two lines for your transaction.<br />
One line for the issue against the standard cost of the item and one line for the Lot Result (= the difference between the cost price and the Lot Price).<br />
<br />
So, in Finance the net result is okay but in tssma3110m000 the information is misleading.<br />
In BAAN V this entire process is handled much, much better. As with everything else in Service and the integrations to and from other applications in BAAN.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and if you have any other questions please let me know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Edwin</div></div><hr />
