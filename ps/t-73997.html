as a new user to this forum I have used Search to find information related to my question but haven't been able to find a similar topic. So in case I duplicate a previously reported issue, please refer me to the relevant thread.<br />
<br />
We are using the Service Order process for all issues related to Service activities. From Service activities to simply selling spare parts. <br />
When reading the INFOR LN documentation about Service Orders I get the impression that the primary goal of the Service order process is to manage mainly the Service activities (which may or may not involve the usage of spare parts for the purpose of maintenance of the installed base). <br />
<br />
In the case where no Service activity is planned and it is simply selling spare parts to customer I wonder why the Sales Order process is not used. No one within my company can explain me why it has been set up like this so my curiosity compels me to dig deeper. <br />
<br />
My question to this forum: Besides the management of Service activities, what are the main differences between using the Service Order process vs the Sales Order process. Specifically when it comes to simply selling spareparts?</div></div><hr />

Just a few ... settings in Item - Service (such as price, warehouse, and warranty).  I would imagine that a big driver for keeping them in one place would be the integration with finance.  Aside from setups and finance it can be easier from a user perceptive to keep their actions all with in Service.</div></div><hr />
