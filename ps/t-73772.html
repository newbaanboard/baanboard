<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milk997</div><div class="date">16th March 2021, 22:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there. I'm new to the Service menu of Baan (have a few years experience in other sections) and I'm trying to find if there's somewhere in the Service menu to track product recalls / product improvement programs on installations?<br />
<br />
I don't know if something like this already exists, so I thought I'd ask since this isn't something we currently do in Baan today, so nobody here can answer or help me on this.<br />
<br />
My installation record will already be tied to sales history, customer, location, and warranty for example under the installation control. For when the work is actually done, I assume that I can setup a service order type specific to PIP, but I don't know whether to use the priority table for my different levels tied to the recall/PIP, and if under Service Analysis Control, I also should set something for Recall/PIP as a solution and fix. Both of those would be for tracking/reporting purposes which would be tied back to the installation, but it's the proactive side where I have this group of installations which would be applicable to a recall, which I am having troubles figuring out if that would be possible to setup somehow.</div></div><hr />
