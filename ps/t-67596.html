In 5C great functionality exists in Service for Objects and Relations per configuration.  It allows for 'Install base' to be migrated without the need for items to pre-exist - yet.  Therefore in such cases the derived from item is left blank.  The tool is great for loading 50 years of history without needing to actually migrate a zillion item codes.<br />
<br />
Seems this has changed in LN.  Under configuration management only service bom's can be created requiring item service data.  No more objects and relations.  Is this correct or have I missed something?  If not, how can the 5C solution be achieved in LN? Perhaps in TP?  What we need is a repository to store install base without real items.  Then create items only as and when required<br />

Thank in advance !</div></div><hr />

you can try E items(tiedm0110m000) in EDM and from there you can take to Items general.<br />
It is just a suggestion..<br />
