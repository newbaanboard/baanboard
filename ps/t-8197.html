The projects do get archived.<br />
<br />
The RPL-orders have been processed and deleted through session tdrpl2126m000<br />
(Process/delete delivered RPL orders). Just to be sure I have also deleted the RPL order history throug tdrpl1410m000 (Print/Delete History of RPL-orders).<br />
<br />
For the concerning projects I do find records in table tppss650. These records are also visible in session tppss6820m000 (Display history transactions per cost item). Perhaps this is where the projects-to-be-deleted get stuck. Projects which don't have any records in tppss650 do get deleted correctly.<br />
<br />
Session tppdm7810m000 (Delete Projects) give the same result, but the help text is so short that it does not help me much.<br />
<br />
Can somebody throw some light?</div></div><hr />

Did the session tdrpl1410m000, really cleanup the tables?<br />
Did you first change the value of the field  'Processed' into YES (1) before running this session?<br />

<br />
Session tppss6550m000 (Display Material Transactions) is looking into table tppss650 and when you delete a project as part of your archiving procedure there should be no problems unless you still have transactions open in other applications like Distribution and/or Manufacturing.<br />
So make sure all transactions in those applications linked to Project TP have been fully processed.<br />
<br />
I agree it is strange that only projects without records in tppss650 get deleted without problems and archiving works in any case.<br />
<br />
Make sure that you have all commitments fully transacted (if applicable).<br />
<br />
I advise you to log a case with BAAN Support regarding this issue because they can dial in and see what is going on.<br />
<br />
