<br />
Can anybody help me by sending a dump of the DEM by email. I need help in implementing Service and Maintenance module in our plant. We are planning to use this module for carrying out maintenance of our machines. We already have the other modules like Manufacturing, distribution and finance in place.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
DEM Flows are very specifc to Clients processes and every client Processes are confidential, as might be yours in case of Mfg and Distri, hence its difficult to find out the DEM Flows. <br />
<br />
Rather U can ask for solution of any problem u face during your implemention .<br />
The first thing is u go ahead defining your machines as installations with a Dummy Customer!! and the complete setup.<br />
<br />
System will work as a After Sales service, its for u take it as Inplant Maintenance activities.<br />

<br />
 I understand that DEM is tailored to the needs of an organisation.  My idea of obtaining the DEM is to understand the flow of processes in general.  I believe,  it would also cut down the implementation time as claimed by Baan itself. <br />
<br />
We have only one weeks time to move from legacy to baan.  A standard preliminary DEM model would be of great help to me.<br />
Any documentation is welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
