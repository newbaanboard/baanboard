I am new to service order and I tried to search posts before posting this question.<br />
<br />
How do you receive and issue customer owned item for repairing against a service order. I know one option would be RMA Sales Order at zero price and then returning the repaired item on another sales order. But is this a recommended procedure?<br />
<br />

<br />
It would be very useful for the BB members to know what &quot;BAAN&quot; version you are working with regarding your inquiry.<br />
Perhaps you can also be more specific on the business requirement.<br />
Depending on the version, the answer can be very different in the BAAN IV, BAAN V and ERP LN Service arena.<br />
I assume this is for ERP LN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To elaborate more on the requirement:<br />
- We wanted to repair customer owned item using service order functionality.<br />
- We would like like to receive the Item from customer in our premises without bumping our inventory value then account the cost incurred for the repair.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shekhar_vc</div><div class="date">14th February 2012, 06:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, we are considering the rework production order option.<br />

<br />
Well, b50_c Service is not the best package to solve your requirement.<br />
In ERP LN it would be a different story and a much better fit.<br />
<br />
Instead of using the RMA sales order to bring the customer owned item in at zero price and another sales order to ship it out, I would recommend to use one service order with two activities. Activity 1 has a material line with Delivery Type &quot;To Warehouse&quot; (you can check if you can use a consignment not owned warehouse for this) and activity 2 has a material line with Delivery Type &quot;From Warehouse&quot;. Both transactions should be at zero cost.<br />
Then for the repair you can use activity 30 to capture all costs for the repair but there will be no integration with a rework production order in b50_c. These costs have to be manually entered once the repair is done.<br />
You can use this single service order to capture all costs for doing the repair and also for invoicing if needed (does not matter if it is a fixed price or cost plus repair).<br />
The other advantage is that you can capture all of the above against a configuration and objects and have an up-to-date installed base information from your customer. Using a sales order, all of this will be lost.<br />
<br />
If you have routings and need operations for repairs in a workshop I would recommend to use rework production orders. The challenge will be to link the costs from the production order to the service order without &quot;double booking&quot; of costs. This you should discuss with a Finance person.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for proposing this solution. Appreciate it!<br />
<br />
I will try it out in our test system.<br />
