<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">12th November 2009, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Performance Measurement is based upon top down budget. You need a version in Top Down Budget Version (tpptc5500m000).<br />
<br />
If you use only bottom up budgets then you should use Build Actual Cost Control (tpppc4803m000).<br />

<br />
you can set up Perf. Measurement, at least a very simple form of it, by using only the bottom up budget. You need to register progress for you tasks or for sub contracting. Say you report 50 % of progress, you can compare it with the actual hours / costs recorded. It is not so exact as within the Top Down Budget but it can be set up much easier. Question is, if your organisation is fit for PF or Earned Value Methods.<br />

<br />
There is a way to get Performance Measurement with bottom up budget, by generating Top Down budget from Bottom Up budget the same can be done but it is must to use activities in Project.    <br />
Use the session Generate Structure and Top Down Budget (tpptc5210m000) select the project and select the check box 'copy including budget lines'. and click Generate. This will generate Topdown budget from Bottomup budget. <br />
further by creating TimePhased Budget from Top down Budget with Base Lines and entering Progress, the performance Measurement can be obtained. <br />
It is important that for the Activities with Earned Value methods 'percentage Complete' the Progress entry should be at Activity/Cost Type Level. Topdown budget must be actual and Base Line should be approved for getting Performance in Performance Measurement.</div></div><hr />
