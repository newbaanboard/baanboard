<br />
I have one Scenario of Invoice Type as &quot; Unit Rate&quot;.<br />
Project:- Contract Type as &quot; Fixed Price Contract &quot;<br />
Invoice Type as &quot; Unit Rate&quot;.<br />
Controlled by  and Budget by a &quot; Activity&quot;.<br />
Project Business Partner - Amount is not defined <br />
<br />
In the Activity , i have choosen Progressive Based Invoicing as &quot; No&quot; , this allowed me to insert only the Pysical progress Quantity but not the sales rate.<br />
My query to all is 1) Can we invoice ? 2) if Invoicing is possible what amount will the system take and from where ?<br />
<br />
Please help me finding the solution<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

If you don't flag an activity why bother about unit rates in the first place. Than capturing progress by activity you could invoice this for the sales rate defined times the quantity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Progressive Based Invoicing should be 'Yes' as the definition of unit rate is &quot;Invoicing method based on the progress and element/activity sales rate per unit. Invoices are booked against the contract amount with installments.&quot;<br />
The unit rate invoicing is calculated as the number of units completed * the sales rate given in the activities or element session.<br />
