    In the project of ERP LN,there's several tables: element,activity,WBS,OBS. Of course we can get the description in the doc, but it still anounnus many of us especially the newie such as me.  <br />
<br />
   1) : Hope you give us a clear relationship among these tables!:)  <br />
<br />
   2) : How to organize these tables' data, such as how to define an element or an activity? :confused: <br />
    <br />
    I think these are very important for learn and understand the project module, if you have some good ideas about these questions, hope you give me and all of these with interest to the project of ERP LN a help.    <br />
   <br />
     Best regard to you!</div></div><hr />

element does not relate to activities.<br />
WBS-elements are activities.<br />
OBS is also something stand alone.<br />
<br />
Elements can be used for a physical breakup of your project.<br />
Activities is an activity based breakup.<br />
OBS is a an organizational structure.<br />
