<br />
In SSA ERP LN 6.1 there are lots of different ways to plan for service orders and calls.<br />
This can be done based on a number of times per year but also based on usage and pre-defined conditions. The planning capabilities in Service can also take into account the skill level of the service technician that has to do the work.<br />
You may check with your local SSA BAAN office whether it is better to use 'vanilla' LN 6.1 or the Service Scheduler in combination with LN 6.1.<br />
<br />
I assume your question relates to LN 6.1. If you would like to know more about planning of service orders and calls in BAAN IV and BAAN V the story will be different.<br />
