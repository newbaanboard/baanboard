<br />
Does anybody know the functionality of the task relationship setting in MSP(Microsoft Proect ) with the integrated with TP.<br />
In my testing, I can set the transfer the WBS task from TP to Microsoft Project, while, when I complete the planning in the MSP, I can transfer back from MSP to TP. The task plan date (start date and end date ) are correct, but the task relationship just like (FS:finish start, SS: start and start )are missing. <br />
The problem is : if you want to change the plan next time in MSP by transfer the Project from TP to MSP again,you can't get the task relationship in MSP from ERP, you have to set this again. <br />
<br />
Does anybody can help me? Thank you  in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if its the same activity structure / relations (?) but a different project, connect / create the new project, then open the Column &quot;Relations&quot; in MSP and copy / past the relations from the existing project to the new project. <br />
<br />
If the structure (relations) are different, then you need to set them up again.<br />

<br />
thank you for your information. My meaning of the Project task relation can't be export to MSP via the MSP intergration functionality. <br />
The reverse is same, when you set up the relationship of the task in MSP, and then, import them into TP, the task relationship can't be import into TP.<br />
<br />
How about your testing about this export/import of the task relationship ?</div></div><hr />

Even I ve got the same problem,but the major input for us is the schedule start and end dates which serves as input to the planning engine and the dates are getting transferred correctly, hence we are used to it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy_baijun</div><div class="date">18th March 2009, 03:44</div></div><div class="posttext">we are at the same condition. <br />
first ,export the WBS from TP to MSP and schedule it.<br />
then import the WBS with the correct start /end date from MSP to ERP.<br />
that is okay.<br />
<br />
the problem is , now, you want to adjust the schedule date, you have to re-asign the task relationship in the MSP file although you have had the correct plan start and end date in ERP. if the relation ship lost, it is hard to re-schedule it in MSP. <br />
now,we have a alternative method to manipulate this issue,<br />
keep the MSP file , when update the plan, use the orignal MSP file, in the MSP file, the relationship existed.<br />
<br />
I am confused, since the task relationship functionality supported by TP, why the integrated can't do this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe its of interest to you! We have designed our Interface with a different approach! We build a Project Plan in Open Plan! With Activities, Relations, Resources etc.<br />
<br />
Activities that need to go to TP will be marked in Open Plan. The OPP Interface moves just those Activities to TP, or updates the Activities that where moved to TP till then.<br />
This Approach is strait forward. An Activity is created in OPP and moved with Standard Settings to TP. No set up in TP, only in OPP. In TP we just have the output of the scheduling work in OPP. Thats it!</div></div><hr />
