1)After setting project status to finished and result determined.<br />
<br />
2)In Global Approving(tpppc4200m000) selection tap select the project and check final result check box and ensure all check boxes are checked in Posting Types 1 and Posting Types 2 tap and approve. <br />
<br />
3)Next In Process transaction(tpppc4802m000) selection tap select the project and check final result check box and ensure all check boxes are checked in Posting Types 1 and Posting Types 2 tap and approve. <br />
<br />
4) Check for the report if all your transaction with respect to logistic and finance is completed. this will automatically set the Project to closed. If any transacation is pending it will give the message regarding the pending transaction. once the pending transactions are completed execute steps 2 and 3 then project status will be set to closed automatically.</div></div><hr />
