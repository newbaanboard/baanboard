Hi Adriano,<br />
<br />
Well, there is no problem you have to avoid! <br />
As discussed with some of your colleques earlier, there is no such function! Why not? Because it would be nonsense! A budget is an estimation, not more. It can be right, but in most cases it will be wrong! At the end, its the number of hours that actually have been used to do the job is what counts (together with the earned value)!<br />
<br />
Just think for example of the fever thermometer. You dont want the thing to stop at 37,5 degree as preferable, you need to see if its already 40,5 degree, if you like it or not.<br />
<br />
What would you do with the rest of the hours? Booking it to some other part of the project, why? Or to some specific accounts with the name: Sorry, the budget is worng, but we are clever, nobudy will find it..... <br />
<br />
A project team, asking for such a function, does show little Project Management Skills or Skills in Economics! <br />
The real issue is it to figure out, what went wrong, either with the budget or with the real hours! Inorder to take measures to avoid the same problem occuring next time.<br />
<br />
You should rather &quot;stay with the standard function&quot; and record the number of hours it really takes to complete the job!<br />
