<br />
Let me explain the situation abt the Provisional Amounts.<br />
<br />
We Include an amount (Sundry Costs) in the Budget for an Element (created specially to include this Amount) which takes care of the things (Costs) which are not able to include during the tendering stage. This amount we call as Provisional Amount.<br />
<br />
During Execution of the Project, if we come across any kind of work For Eg. Breaking of Rock which has come during Excavation.<br />
This extra cost of breaking of Rock has to be taken from the Provisional Sum ( which is allready included in the Project Contract Amount)<br />
<br />
It is not a Variation becoz in one of the Elements, the breaking of Rock Cost is inlcuded but only appoximate.<br />
<br />
Pl tell me whether I can use the Baan Provisional Amount functionality for the above requirement.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Sridhar</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks like you are entering the provisional amount against an element as Sundry Costs and not via an extension.<br />
Then when booking actual costs you need some sort of a settlement with the provisional amount.<br />
I do not believe this will work in standard BAAN Project. <br />
<br />
In order to be using Provisional Amounts properly you should be linking Extensions to the project. Also entering the Provisional Amount at that time in session tpptc0110m000 (Extensions).<br />
<br />
Another thing you need to have is a predefined code in the field &quot;Sundry Cost Code for Provisional Amounts&quot; in session tppdm6100m000 (Maintain Projects).<br />
<br />
Then when you book your actual costs the difference between these costs and the provisional amount entered in tpptc0110m000 (Extensions) will be captured against the predefined code just mentioned as Sundry Costs.<br />
Billing will be based on actual costs.<br />
Hope this helps. If not please send me an e- mail with more information.<br />
<br />
By the way, how is your issue with Element Progress going?<br />
