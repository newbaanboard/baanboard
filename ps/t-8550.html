Can you set up maintance shedules for Machines and is it possible to do this with a minimum of customisations?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Unlike BAAN V there is no direct relationship in BAAN IV between service orders and internal preventive maintenance on machines. <br />
I have seen BAAN IV customers that manually create service orders for internal preventive maintenance to register their costs (labor, parts, etc.).<br />
So far I have not seen anybody that tried to integrate BAAN IV Service with things like Resource/Constraint Planning in BAAN IV Manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Planned maintenance in BAAN IV Service is only based on time (number of times per day/week/month) and not based on measurements/counter values and/or usage. These can be planned for in BAAN V Service however.<br />
<br />
Of course, anything is possible via a customization but I expect that building this in BAAN IV will be a pretty big job. Especially if you would like to have maintenance schedules for your machines based on measurements/counter values and/or usage. If these schedules have to be based on time only then the effort will be a lot less.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you would like to have more info to determine whether a customization is something you want to do.<br />
