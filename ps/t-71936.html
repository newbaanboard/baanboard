<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john crystal</div><div class="date">16th May 2019, 03:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the service module I have created kits of parts to go along with various preventative maintenance tasks. The kit items are set up as phantoms so that we can invoice for one kit but have the warehouse pull by component item. The kits contain up to 40 items and we don't want to show all of those lines on the invoice. My problem is that the warehouse outbound process is calling for the main kit item to be picked not the components. Somewhere in the release to warehouse process it is not recognizing that the kit items are phantoms and outbound is happening at the kit level.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if I'm missing some parameter to be set a certain way? Or what it is that I am doing wrong?<br />

Thanks,<br />
