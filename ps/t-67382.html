thanks for the reply. actually i just installed on our test server and i'm struggling to continue testing due to persistent error messages caused by missing setup maybe. most likely to be used for construction projects and the following are my current concerns:<br />
<br />
1.   what is the most preferred to use project budget - activity or elements? <br />
2.   after process transaction (all check marked), only materials has the actual value.<br />
3.   where can i setup the transfer warehouse order type series, like PRI for Project Issue and PRT for Project Receipt. Not mentioned in tppdm and tppss parameters.<br />
4.   i added one extension (active) but not appearing in the extension column of project structures (activities).<br />
5.   how can i use existing fixed assets (FAM) into the project?<br />
6.   when i tried to process project hours and accounting, &quot;fiscal periods are not defined&quot; error message came. i don't know exactly which period is missing bec i setup the period already. our test server financial fiscal year is 2012 and tpppc control period parameters are also 2012. i added periods for 2015 in period sessions.<br />
<br />
thanks again,<br />

hi,<br />
<br />
thanks for the reply. actually i just installed on our test server and i'm struggling to continue testing due to persistent error messages caused by missing setup maybe. most likely to be used for construction projects and the following are my current concerns:<br />
<br />
1.   what is the most preferred to use project budget - activity or elements?<br />
<br />
Depends upon the project - for large, complex, long term projects, use Elements &amp; Activities - to make sure that the element (build Structure) will remain, if there is changes in activity links driven by scheduling changes<br />
 <br />
2.   after process transaction (all check marked), only materials has the actual value.<br />
<br />
Well, you have to operate with hours accounting, progress reporting (maybe) and booking of Receipts for Mat., Sub Contr. Equipment. And you have to book invoices - Financial Integration mu√üt be set!<br />
<br />
3.   where can i setup the transfer warehouse order type series, like PRI for Project Issue and PRT for Project Receipt. Not mentioned in tppdm and tppss parameters.<br />
<br />
In Financial Tables - set up of Number serials<br />
<br />
<br />
4.   i added one extension (active) but not appearing in the extension column of project structures (activities).<br />
<br />
With cost objects linked to Exctensions? If not, you dont see anything in Monitoring!<br />
<br />
5.   how can i use existing fixed assets (FAM) into the project?<br />
<br />
Just as Equipement - but unfortunatly there is no link from FA to Equipement. Yo have to create FA records and use then without any link to EQ - just &quot;Numbering - Links&quot; can be created<br />
<br />
6.   when i tried to process project hours and accounting, &quot;fiscal periods are not defined&quot; error message came. i don't know exactly which period is missing bec i setup the period already. our test server financial fiscal year is 2012 and tpppc control period parameters are also 2012. i added periods for 2015 in period sessions.<br />
<br />
Add 2015 in Finance (Financial, Tax) and in Periods! make sure you have 1.1.2015 00:00 to 1.1.2016 00:00 - This setting can be very painful - maybe you need to create more / all fincance periods in both parts. <br />
<br />
!!! Make sure to have project reporting in Months - and Hours reporting in weeks. Records with no option to be changed! make sure hours periods do start on a monday - (the 1. of something is not alwasy a monday!!!)<br />
<br />
And if its still not working - check your time setting - if there is different time zones involved its not working either - as i said - a pain in the neck - to be polite!<br />
<br />
If you have more question - feel free to come back<br />
<br />
thanks again,<br />
<br />
