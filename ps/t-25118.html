<br />
We are planning to set up an inventory management system for project items (project = tp). What are our options with BaaN IV?<br />
<br />
Situation:<br />
Sessions Maintain Receipts (tdpur4120m000) and Maintain Approvals (tdpur4121m000) do not create inventory transactions for orderlines that have a project(tp) number. How can project inventory be managed in BaaN IV?<br />
<br />
Replies with possible solutions will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
any receipt of material in Baan IV is seen as direct issue or use / cost's in the project. Therefore no inventory stock is build. <br />
<br />
It is different in Baan ERP or LN. You can select if project stock is going to be created or not. Check with your organization, if its realy needed to use project stock or not!<br />
<br />
In Baan IV you can follow receipts via monitoring modul, receipt, costs etc. and in the cost history. Also, financial WIP account's can be included.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziggy Saabel</div><div class="date">1st October 2005, 05:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Uli,<br />
<br />
Thanks for you 'spot-on' replies. <br />
<br />
Yes, managing project inventory is absolutely required for one of our companies. The size of the warehouse, international projects, keeping parts for warranty, customer spares ... a long, long list of requirements that make sense. Currently, they use sub-systems (plural!!!) to manage project inventory. Understandably, they want to come out of all the problems associated with that. <br />
<br />
We are currently developing a BaaN IV solution to 'alleviate the pain'. The main characteristics of the solution are:<br />
- separate company for project warehouse management, only (without tp)<br />
- linked tables for required static data<br />
- exchange schemes for required dynamic data<br />
- planned purchase orders will be transfered back as tp-requirements to tp   <br />
   company.<br />
- tp/tf and purchasing set-up of the primary company remains the same <br />
<br />
The test results are promising:<br />
+ Inventory Lot Control for tp items<br />
+ Lot Tracking Control for tp items<br />
+ requirements planning based on customized BOMs and inventory<br />
+ flexibility of PCS (customized items, BOMS, assembly order mgt etc.)<br />
<br />
The downsides are:<br />
- not real-time<br />
- Maintain Receipts needs to run in both companies (now, considering a modification ; however, almost negligible in comparison to the current workflows)<br />
<br />
All tests and the first presentation of this solution went very well and I am looking forward to introducing this concept to end-users. I am aware of the fact that this  not what you would call a 'state of the art solution' but probably good enough to meet the business requirements.<br />
<br />
LN is at least 2 years away (we have just started). <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time, thoughts and input<br />
<br />

<br />
well, your description sounds interesting. It seems, that you have good reasons for your inventory solution.<br />
<br />
Please keep me updated about solution and progress. <br />

<br />
Thanks again for your interest and here comes the update:<br />
<br />
The proposed solution meets the requirements with a few minor exceptions requiring further investigation. It will be installed on the live system in January 2006 (training, simulation, set up warehouse, prepare data load etc. in Nov/Dec).<br />
<br />
It can be assumed that the advantages of the proposed solution outweigh problems associated with the current multi-system set-up.<br />
<br />
A number of other minor issues were raised.  However these were mostly cosmetic issues and were not significant enough to reject the proposed solution. At the conclusion of the demonstration, consensus to proceed to the next step was achieved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
Ziggy</div></div><hr />
