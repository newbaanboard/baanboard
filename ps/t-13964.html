<br />
We are using, estimated costs on small project module, we have the following scenario:<br />
<br />
Actually when a project is invoiced, we just add a line in sales order for a cost item &quot;SERVICE&quot;,  what I want to do is to start the service order use, creating a service order for the installation linking it to a project.<br />
<br />
What do I need to do if I want that all the service order cost (Material, expenses,other) go directly to project cost.??<br />
<br />
I 'm using Estimated Cost, I think that service costs goes as general costs of the project and it is only important for Actual Cost<br />
<br />
Am I right??<br />
<br />
any suggestion??<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
JP</div></div><hr />

When you book costs to a service order performed on that installation, the project reference will be picked up.  This is tru for both estimated and actual costs, as they are in the same table with a status flag to show which they are.</div></div><hr />
