<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a report that runs that way. It uses the file event feature of Crystal Enterprise. We have session in Baan that tests for the existance of valid data. It erases the file it created from the previous week, and it then creates a file with a specific file name if the data is there. On the Crystal server I set up a scheduled task to first erase the previous occurrance of last week's file, and then at a later time FTP the file over at a specified time. If the file is not there then the file does not get FTP'd. The report is scheduled to run at 11:15 PM and the event file, if it exists, will arrive at 11:20 PM. If the file arrives, then the report runs because that means there is valid data. But if the file does not arrive, then the report does not run.<br />
<br />
ISNULL is not a control that will cause a report to run or not. It only controls data inside the report while it is running, and you want to control whether the report runs or not. And that is what Crystal Enterprise events can do for you.<br />
