<br />
While inserting a new user into BaaN IV with database oracle 10 g we have to dump users into baan <br />
<br />
The seesion we use is &quot;ttdba0110m000&quot; ,&quot;Maintain Linmk between baan users and database users&quot; Now when we click dump users it changes the <br />
<br />
/baan/bse/lib/ora/ora_users<br />
<br />
with a new password with new users into that file now after doing this we are not able to enter into BaaN as the error is &quot;Database error login Denied&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope any one can send me the solution <br />
<br />
Regards and Thanks <br />

<br />
Check if there is an ora_users- file that looks like a back up from before the corruption. That would be ideal.<br />
<br />
Open the ora_users and see if your user is there (it might be missing entirely). See if there is another user for which you know the password. Even if that one is a Normal user you could later edit its $BSE/lib/user/u&lt;user&gt; file to make it a Superuser if it turns out that you can connect with it.<br />
<br />
I don't know about Oracle 10. There is a utility called ora7_admin6.1 or or8_admin6.1 (not sure if there is an ora10_admin6.1) that can be run from the command prompt as long as you have all the right baan and oracle variables set up correctly and can help you build the right ora_users. As long as you have all the passwords it should be an easy to follow tool.<br />
<br />
Another option would be to manually create your ora_users.<br />
ora_users has 4 fields separeted with &quot;:&quot;.<br />
baan user<br />
oracle user<br />
encrypted password and <br />
group<br />
The only difficult field to get is the encrypted password. Use encrypt6.1 to generate it.<br />
<br />
One more thing: I think the ora_* file corruption is a known problem for BaanIV when created from the ttdba sessions. I think the problem is that it chops off part of the file. The option is the ora_admin tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markus Schmitz</div><div class="date">11th April 2006, 09:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree here. Most customer I know do not use the dba sessions at all. The reasons for this are:<br />
<br />
a) The dba sessions did not exist in older versions of baan and the older customers got used to the old style of working<br />
<br />
b) In the ascii interface the dba sessions do not show as an obvious entry in the menu.<br />
<br />
c) By using either ora_admin or directly editing the ora_users file, you can script and therefor automize user administration.<br />
<br />
I also had some strange effects, that the mentioned session sometimes corrupted the file. So I personally stopped using it completely. I actually also stopped using ora_admin and tend to directly edit the file and create oracle users and grant roles directly with sqlplus. But maybe I am just one of these old fashioned guys, who find it difficult to adopt to new tools and ways of doing things.<br />

<br />
Markus - you mention you grant roles - I use the dba sessions to add our users so things are granted automatically as far as I know.  We have SOX auditors in here and they've noticed that in our Oracle database all baan database users can basically do whatever they want if the could get direct access to the database.  The R_BAANDB is a granted role and all the users have been granted it.  This role can insert/update/delete/select on all baan tables.<br />
<br />
Is this something that is necessary for Baan to work correctly?  Can users log directly into the Database?  I'm thinking not because I tried using my baan username and password and it would not let me in through SQLPLUS.  Is the encrypted password in the ora_users file the password that is used to get to the database and it's different than what the user knows to be his password?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if this has been talked about before but I was unable to find anything on it.<br />
<br />
Thanks - Nikki Z</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you arer using the dba sessions, then they actually perform the grants, which I do manually.<br />
<br />
But your auditors are right: Each Baan user has usually a corresponding oracle user and this oracle user is assigned the r_baan or r_baandb  group, so that theuy have full delete/insert/update permissions. All actuall permissions are enforced from within Baan.<br />
<br />
So if a user can connect to the oracle database, then he can see the full data. How to avoid this?<br />
<br />
The oracle password of these users is different from their Baan password. So simply keep this password hidden.<br />
<br />
Secondly depending on your platform you can configure sqlnet not to allow remote connections. For tghis to make sense, yoou have to additionally prevent people from locally logging onto your baan box.<br />
<br />

So - have you needed to prove ever that your users cannot log directly into the database?  If so how did you go about proving that?<br />

<br />
Unfortunately it can not be proven: If the user ever gets his oracle password, then he can indeed see and manipulate all baan tables. On the other hand, if anybody ever lays hand on your system password, then he can do the same and more.<br />
<br />
So to make your system tight, you have to disable SQLNET, but even then somebody could get access to the server directly and the whole games starts again.<br />

<br />
<br />
On Unix shutdown or do not start the listener (lsnrctl stop). On Windows shutdown the corresponding service. But dependig on your setup, you might disbale also the baan access doing this. So be carefull.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecarceller</div><div class="date">6th August 2007, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">On top of disabling SQLNET (closing doors you are not using seems like the right thing to do) here is something else you could try:<br />
BaanV can create the user's password for Oracle for you. It will be a password that you would never know and will only be stored in ora_users (encrypted of course). If the time comes to directly log on to Oracle with that user (pretty unlikely) the DBA can reset it for you.<br />
The same concept could be manually applied in BaanIV. Just get a random password generator to create the DB passwords. Once you are done creating the Baan/DB users/link do not store the password anywhere else.</div></div><hr />
