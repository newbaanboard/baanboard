<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">28th August 2003, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure what you are trying to do, but you cannot create a new item master record with just an item and a description. The session won't let you, exchange won't either. There is a whole range of fields on the item master record that need to be filled in with valid codes, and there are records in other tables related to the item that need to be created along with the item master record as well. <br />
It is possible to load item data into Baan using exchange, but it is far from easy or straightforward. <br />
Updating existing items is usually more straightforward and is a lot less likely to generate an error 606; if it does then it would be caused by data in your import file, for example an item group that does not exist in Baan.<br />
You can find explanations for the error codes in the baan tools help section (I think under programming information, so go to the application development / customisation menu and look at help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danielv</div><div class="date">28th August 2003, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm only trying to update the description. No new items.<br />
It is weird, since I'm not updating any referenced field, just the description.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

Got one more question though :-)<br />
I'm able to read 819 records which 807 are being processed. There is 12 records being skipped.<br />
<br />
Any idea how can I track those 12 records skipped?<br />
<br />
thank again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">28th August 2003, 22:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Under the Miscellaneous / Misc II menu, try the Print Log File session and the others.  I think you can make corrections and resubmit, using the 'Reprocess rejected rec's' option on Import Data (Non-Regular).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danielv</div><div class="date">5th September 2003, 20:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran print log file session with no luck I'm getting &quot;no data within selection&quot;. From what I understand my import is not incurring in any errors, so there is no data in the log file. The import process just skipped 12 records.  <br />
Also I tried to reprocess rejected rec's but seems like it is not doing anything.<br />
<br />
I turned audit on tiitm001, and itÂ’s showing individual changes for each record, but can't seem to find a way to track rejected records. <br />
Seems like those records there not even hitting Baan.<br />
<br />
Any feedback will be appreciated<br />
<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gfasbender</div><div class="date">5th September 2003, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You are getting the 12 skipped records because you have options Overwrite and/or Update Records set in session &quot;Maintain Table Relations (Import)&quot;. The skipped records contain Items that don't exist in table tiitm001. You can't update something that doesn't exist!<br />
<br />
Turn on the option Add Record in the same session, then you'll receive an error record for the 12 skipped ones (since you don't provide all of the required referenced data need in the table)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danielv</div><div class="date">6th September 2003, 04:08</div></div><div class="posttext">gfasbender,<br />
thank for your reply. <br />
You were right. Those records did not exists in table tiitm001.<br />
Even though I know now which records are those, (using Access database), I will like to know what am I doing wrong with my setup.<br />
I added all mandatory fields on my definition including fields with a reference table and turn on the option to add records and still did not worked. I got error 606 on all records. Perhaps I'm missing something on my setup. Did I needed to turn off overwrite &amp; update options as well?<br />
Do you a have a generic setup to update some fields in item master data, without going through all the pain of downloading &amp; uploading all the fields?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
