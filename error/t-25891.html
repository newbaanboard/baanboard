<br />
Below are some error interpretation which may be helpful in your case:<br />
<br />
1.	Any error over 999 subtract 1000 to get the true code.<br />
<br />
2.	After conversion: 0-99 are low level system errors, typically UNIX errors.  The Tools Technical Manual lists all the UNIX errors TRITON translates.  Oracle also has errors below 99, many of which TIROTN also lists.  In these cases, the errors will be coincidental and mean the same thing.  In the case of any errors below 100 and not in the Technical Manual, these are pure Oracle errors.<br />
<br />
3.	100-999 are bdb errors (Baan DataBase).  These usually refer to a problem in BaanÂ’s ability to run (100-199), data integrity (200-299), SQL problems (300-399), System problems not directly attributable to UNIX (500-599), or reference errors (600-699).  Any number not listed in the Technical manual is an outside database error.<br />
<br />
4.	1000-1099: Convert according to 1 and refer to 2.<br />
<br />
5.	11000-19999 are combination errors and should be converted as in 1 before interpretation (e.g. 11500 = 10500).  In  these cases, you take the left three numbers (a bdberror) and the right two numbers (a UNIX error) and use them separately.  This can be a little trickier with Oracle errors as they look a lot like this type or message but are not really.  It is possible to express Oracle error 13509 as 14509 which could be Oracle error 13509 or TRITON/UNIX errors 135/09.  For determining this, it is best to look in the logs for an entry in the Oracle log.  If there is one and it gives the same error, interpret the message and problem in terms of the Oracle error.  If not, it is not Oracle and should be interpreted the other way.<br />
<br />
ALWAY CHECK THE LOGS!  This is the very first step in interpreting the error messages.  Once an error occurs which you do not understand, the very first thing to do is get to a UNIX prompt, change to the $BSE/log directory, and enter the command ls -ltr.  This lists files here in the long (date included) format in reverse order of last update.  Look at the date and time stamps on the bottom lines shown and use the UNIX command tail [file name] to see the last log message in each file you think might be pertinent.  These messages will often explain all you need to know and, if not, are necessary when placing calls to the Global Services Center.<br />
