<br />
Does somebody know how to publish a custom BOD to ION ?<br />
<br />
I had created a BOD via Infor Stuio, and run test, everything goes well.<br />
Also generated in LN.<br />
<br />
However, I don't know how to publish it to ION, so ION can process it.<br />
I found some piece of document about to put XSD and xml file to ION server. But I don't understand how to generate the XSD file and xml file.<br />
<br />
Does somebody know it?<br />
Thanks.<br />
Jeffers</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your input.<br />
You are right, in the DAL or UE, we should put code to generate BOD.<br />
<br />
However, my question is, via Infor LN Studio, I had created the BOD program, and implemented to ERP Ln server. <br />
<br />
But in the ION server, I need to register the BOD to let ION know it.  In some documents or threads said, it's necessary to the XML and XSD file to ION server. However, how to generate the XML file and XSD files?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">9th October 2017, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">You can take a look at the standard XSD and XML files and edit them as required for your BOD. The XSD basically contains the information of the fields in the BOD in terms of name, datatype etc while the XML contains the name of noun, type of BOD and some other information.<br />
<br />
Study the existing files, modify them according to your need and use it to make your own XSD and XML files.</div></div><hr />

I had added the code on DAL level.<br />
However, in the BOD monitor bobod1200m000, I cannot find it.<br />
Any ideas on it?<br />

I had found the bod message in ION server. However, it shows strange:<br />
No title for the BOD message, the standard BOD has title in ION one view.<br />
And if I link the BOD to a file system, it shows no destination. The standard BOD does not have this issue.<br />
Any ideas on it?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">8th May 2023, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
which infor document gives details on steps performed to publish a newly made BOD. I am not yet finding it in bobod1100m000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">11th May 2023, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">There must be some documents in the  Infor Documentation Library.<br />
<br />
If you find your BOD in ttadv7500m000 (where Studio should have put it) and the BOD is checked in (teams - end activity) and the BOD is in your working package-VRC, you should be able to insert it into bobod1100m000. <br />
<br />
What I found to be the most tricky part was to create a zipfile containing the BOD layout to upload it in ION Data Catalog / Object Schemas. Feel free to download and compare one of the other Object Schemas in the Data Catalog to get an idea of what is in the ZIP file. Because only when the fields are known you can build logic in ION.<br />
<br />
The way I currently work my way through that is:<br />
1) In Studio on the Interface Perspective, on the Interface Definition run the Proxy Generator / WSDL and pick up the file created in the \output\out\WSDL directory.<br />
2) Edit this file:<br />
<br />
 Remove all lines NOT containing xsd (or only keep contents of the &lt;wsdl:types&gt; node)<br />
  Remove all &quot;xsd:&quot; occurrences<br />
  Change:&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;Result&quot; type=&quot;bo:Message&quot;/&gt; into &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;BOD_NAME&quot; type=&quot;bo:Message&quot;/&gt; where BOD_NAME obviously is the name of your interface definition (so without BOD).<br />
  Add an XMLheader tag like &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;<br />
  Save this file in ./BOD/BOD_NAME/BOD_NAME.xsd<br />
<br />
3) There is another XML file in the ZIP file by the name of ./BOD/BOD_NAME/BOD_NAME.xml with a contents similar to this:&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;ns2:NounMetadata xmlns:ns2=&quot;http://schema.infor.com/InforOAGIS/2&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Noun&gt;<br />
	&lt;NounName&gt;BOD_NAME&lt;/NounName&gt;<br />
	&lt;IDXPath&gt;/*/DataArea/BOD_NAME/NAME_OF_UNIQUE_INDEX_FIELD&lt;/IDXPath&gt;<br />
	&lt;SupportedVerbs&gt;<br />
	    &lt;SupportedVerb&gt;Sync&lt;/SupportedVerb&gt;<br />
	&lt;/SupportedVerbs&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Noun&gt;<br />
&lt;/ns2:NounMetadata&gt; where NAME_OF_UNIQUE_INDEX_FIELD is the interface identifier for the built interface.<br />
4) Then pack the .\BOD\ folder into BOD_NAME.zip and upload it in the Data Catalog\Object Schemas.<br />
5) Resolve any errors preventing the import.</div></div><hr />

When I had to generate xml/xsd, i made a flat structure of xml nodes/values. And Add to Data Catalog and let it generate xsd either by adding manually or from data. I chose 'manual' and in the end, it did generate xsd. this was the template got into Data Catalog. But am yet to publish successfully. So, i have not successfully executed the full life cycle yet ! :)</div></div><hr />
