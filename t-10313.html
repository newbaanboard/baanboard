<br />
1) An IDno was purchased and issued to a TRO as input material......then the purchase price changed, the new result was processed but the IDno was not revaluated in TRO WIP, so the output will be calculated referring to the old value.  Is there a way (a parameter somewhere) to revaluate the TRO WIP after a price change ?<br />
<br />
2) Labour hours were charged using hours accounting to an SFC Production order linked to a TRO Order .......at the closure of the order &quot;Production results&quot; were generated to close SFC WIP but the hours amount was not charged to the output of TRO Process, which value was only referred to Input Material+Added TRO Surcharges......Is it possible to increase automatically  the output value of a TRO process with SFC hours amount ??<br />
<br />
Thanks......</div></div><hr />
