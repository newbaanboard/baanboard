That is not the problem, however the &lt;next&gt; and &lt;previous&gt; choices have been disabled and that makes editing forms/reports more difficult.<br />

Actually, it wasn't just c4, the original had the buttons not greyed out and they worked.  Some porting set took this away.  You can still run ASCII for c4 - if you do you can probably see that it is a disabled option in ASCII mode as well now.</div></div><hr />
