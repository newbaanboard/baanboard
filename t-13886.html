Here is a free solution to mail documents like acknowledgements straight from Baan with the help of Notes addressbooks.<br />
<br />
Tested on Lotus Notes R5, Windows 2000 and Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
We developed this internally cause no other program or help was available for Notes.</div></div><hr />

I am sure not many will look into it, but if someone does want to use the program in a production environment it gives them peace of mind.<br />
<br />
Have a question. In Notes I can set an option that allows Notes Minder to not prompt me for a password. Is this something that your program can do. I am a little worried about the passwords being in the clear on the hard disk.<br />
<br />
In the absence of a location information, I assumed that you lived/worked in Pasadena, California. Your email and the fact that you program in Delphi suggests you are from The Netherlands. So what is the story :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
We worked with Outlook before but whe have to use Notes now (decision from the headquarters in France) We are part of Square D and are using Baan IV for 5 years now. The headquarters is using SAP so I think we are migrating to SAP in the upcoming years</div></div><hr />
