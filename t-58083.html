<br />
I want to use AFS for the Maintain Backorder session. ( tdpur4130m000 ) . I am trying to cancel a Purchase order through customized script. While cancelling the Purchase order there are two steps -<br />
1) PO lines without any receipt<br />
2) PO lines with partial receipt<br />
<br />
In first case , I will delete the Purchase order line by calling the AFS with Delete po lines functionality . So that the history of the PO line can be maintain.<br />
<br />
For 2nd case , I want to use the standard session tdpur4130m000.<br />
<br />
How can I achieve the 2nd case ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Looks like all you would have to do is put the purchase order and line, do a find, make sure the find was successful, put in 0 in back order qty and do a update or save.  Seems simple enough.  Of course I have not written any code for this session since it is not part of our API processing.  I do not know if it asks any questions or anything like that.<br />
<br />
Plus this is the correct forum for questions around using AFS functionality.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your info. But I was looking for the AFS script in which the maintain backorder session (tdpur4130m000) is being used. we can update the backorder quantity through this session. I am not aware which tables gets updated after running this session, therefore wanted to use AFS.<br />

Thanks<br />

I searched this forum and nobody has posted code for this session.</div></div><hr />
