What should I write in FS Script for TAB key operation and also how to handle non-enterable mandatory fields so that insert and save operation can be performed successfully.<br />
Pl. suggest for solution.<br />

I was hoping someone else posted a reply with a solution.  I gather from your other post you would like to simulate hitting the tab key in the session and I just do see how this could be done.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st November 2002, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Mark - as far as I know, you cannot specifically make the afs call a 'tab'.<br />
<br />
However, as you enter your 'put fields', this should be exactly what is happening.  Therefore, in theory, when you 'put' a field, all the other fields that may get filled by that field entry are also filled.  This SHOULD take care of your problem with mandatory fields - if they default properly in the session without user input, they SHOULD default properly in the AFS.<br />
<br />
Notice I use 'SHOULD' a lot.  It does not always work out that way, but 90% of the time it does.<br />
<br />
As  a side note, the put field commands do not get executed as sent.  They are stored and executed in order when the 'stpapi.insert' or update or other DB action is called.  The first 'put field' opens the session, and performs the before program section, but does not actually put the value in the field, and execute the field sections.  Therefore, you cannot count on doing a 'get field' directly after a 'put field' and think you are getting the proper value that will be written.  <br />
<br />
I believe this is an area they are working on for the future.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />
