<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shelley</div><div class="date">9th August 2002, 20:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Crystal 8.5 to report off of Baan 5c. When this driver is used a file called fs.exe is opened on the Baan server and if using Crystal Reports the file is dropped when Crystal is closed. However the cost is quite high for all users to have Crystal Reports and the report will not compile. Therefore I am using the mickey mouse version of Crystal Enterprise (it ships free with Crystal with 5 licenses) and when a report is run using this Baan Native Driver the fs.exe file does not get dropped right away and many times the report will not run because there is too many instances. The only way to correct the situation is rebooting the Baan Server. Crystal has not been able to help and Baan won't take responsibility so if anyone else has had this problem it would be greatly appreciated for any feedback.<br />
