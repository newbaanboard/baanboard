I would like to know if there is people using BO with BaanERP5.0b ? <br />
If so, I have a question: Do you create a universe for each baan company ? Or can we make a single universe for different companies ? The baan tables (and so the fields ...) contain the company number in our oracle database (ex: ttdpur401500 and ttdpur401600) and we would like to choose the company number<br />
in the universe. Is that possible ?<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
ps: Did you use the RDTs given by BO ?</div></div><hr />

There may be a way around it but the Baan - B.O. Customer that we visited had not been able to.</div></div><hr />
