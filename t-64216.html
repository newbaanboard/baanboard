<br />
The idea came from NPRao's this Thread! (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=1936). The difference is that, this is not a bat file and can be used by any user and it is for Windows Platform. A special thanks to Vamsi again for his support.<br />
<br />
I have developed a utility, that uses a 3GL/4GL script to track the session which a user has currently opened. <br />
<br />
Requirements(On Server):-<br />
<br />
1. Windows Operating System<br />
2. A bat file<br />
3. A text file<br />
4. A Scheduled task on server to run the bat file with administrator privileges.<br />
<br />
The process:-<br />
<br />
<br />
Place the bat file and text file in a folder (in my case &quot;new&quot;) and share the folder across the network. Create a new folder (&quot;new1&quot; in my case) which will store the output files. <br />
<br />
<br />
A.The program reads a text file and adds username to it and creates a bat file.<br />
B. This bat file is executed by using a scheduled task which is invoked using a second bat file (already present).<br />
C. The step B produces a text file which gives the PID of user. This PID is called by a function to get the list of session accessed by user.<br />
<br />
You can either use it as a 3GL script to track a single user or you can make a print session which will call a 3GL script with user name as parameter.<br />
<br />
Attaching the zip file with the contents. (Kindly rename the task.txt to task.bat after downloading)<br />
<br />
Any questions, comments or suggestions are welcomed. :)<br />
<br />
NOTE:- <br />
<br />
Users should have full permission for folder C:\Windows\System32\tasks.</div></div><hr />
