|******************************************************************************<br />
|* <br />
|* This session installs the components of a customization part from one<br />
|* environment to another.<br />
|* <br />
|* An environment is an host with a particular BSE (the same host can have<br />
|* more that one environment, i.e. more tha one BSE).<br />
|*<br />
|* At the moment the session transfer the software from one environment to <br />
|* another.<br />
|* With few modifications it is possible to transfer the software to a batch <br />
|* of hosts simultaneously.<br />
|*<br />
|* Export and Import of the software can be forced on VRC which are not the one<br />
|* of the customization part.<br />
|* <br />
|* Using PMC for the same scope was not possible far the following reasons:<br />
|*      - Too many restrictions<br />
|*      - Too cumbersome<br />
|*      - Too many rigidity<br />
|*      - Going from customization part to PMC solution needed a session<br />
|*      - With the PMC it is not possible to have different origin VRC in the<br />
|*        same solution<br />
|*<br />
|* This ambitious project uses the export logic based on customization part<br />
|* of the famous ttiexdeliverp.<br />
|*<br />
|* The two most important features of the PMC (rollback and log) are present.<br />
|* An optional backup dump is written in the directory $BSE/install/backup.<br />
|* A log file with all the activities done is present &quot;$BSE/log/log.install&quot;<br />
|*<br />
|* The session is platform and configuration independent (or at least it should<br />
|* be so...), hence it works also on NT using the BW services (ottdllbw).<br />
|* <br />
|* Since it is nearly impossible (any volunteer?) from Baan code to know<br />
|* where the BW client files are, if you want to use the BW, and you want <br />
|* to tranfer files on a remote host, you must have the files BWC associated<br />
|* to the executable BW.EXE instead of the executable BECS.EXE.<br />
|* In alternative, you can install on your PC the BW client for iBaanERP.<br />
|* In this latter case it seems that the BECS handle it correctly...a bit<br />
|* disgusting I know, but the ottdllbw functions are very limited!<br />
|* Morover a quite recent BW version is needed (&gt;= 0.48).<br />
|* <br />
|* To save bandwidth (specially useful when you are connected trough a modem <br />
|* line) and you are using a UNIX server (do you really use NT???) with the r*<br />
|* services enabled, the files can be transferred directly from the source host<br />
|* to the destination host with the UNIX command rcp.<br />
|*<br />
|* Please note that, in order to minimize the fingerprint of the installation<br />
|* on a new environment (it is a tool, remember, nothing else) messages and <br />
|* labels are hardcoded in english (this help too)... I know, this is a bit <br />
|* hugly but in this way you only need to install in your system one session, <br />
|* one form and one script on any existing VRC.<br />
|*<br />
|* You must also create the following directories:<br />
|*<br />
|*        ${BSE}/install                Root Directory<br />
|*                      ./common        Various file<br />
|*                      ./import        Used for imported dump<br />
|*                      ./export        Used for exporting dump<br />
|*                      ./backup        Used for backup dump<br />
|*<br />
|* The common directory must contain two foundamental files:<br />
|*<br />
|*	ShellExec.exe			On Windows 95 box I need a small VBS<br />
|* 					exe which runs application files based<br />
|*                                      on their association mechanism.<br />
|*<br />
|*      master.bwc                      A master bwc file for the BW client<br />
|*<br />
|*<br />

<br />
Thanks for the contribution.  It looks like you posted it twice, so I deleted one of them.<br />
<br />
Again thanks for the contribution.<br />

I think this can be a very valuable script, but being paranoid (and I'm told that's a good quality for a system manager), I would like to nose around in the source code before actually installing this.<br />
<br />
Any chance you can share this with us?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Francesco</div></div><hr />

<br />
No problem to publish the source code... also because it is already included in the zip file attached to the previuos message...<br />
<br />
Even if you wouldn't trust your mother you can always load the dump in a temporary VRC (I am sure you have one!).<br />
<br />
<br />
Ciao.<br />
Claudio.</div></div><hr />
