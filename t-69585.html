<br />
I have done these steps<br />
<br />
A)LN Side<br />
1)Created the Customized BOD<br />
2) Created Public and Private Attributes and methods<br />
3) Registered the BOD<br />
<br />
B)ION Side<br />
1)Created a File Template for the New Document<br />
2)Created Monitor for the BOD<br />
3)Activated it.<br />
<br />
Now when i am creating records for the customized Table, i am not getting alert according to the situation....<br />

You need to call tcbod.dll0001.publish.bod() function in order to execute your BOD. You have the option to provide the action code to state the type of table action you are performing.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
RETIFNOK(tcbod.dll0001.publish.bod(<br />
				&quot;MySampleBOD&quot;,			|i.Noun,<br />
				&quot;tfgld008&quot;,				|i.Table<br />

				BOD_ENTITY_DEPARTMENT,   |i.BOD Entity Type	<br />

May I get the example script which you are using now?<br />
I am still struggling in how to write the OnShow and OnAcknowledge hook script etc.<br />
When I run generate Infor LN Implementation, I always got the errors as:<br />
OnAcknowledge/OnShow must have an on Execute hook defined etc.<br />
Also No idenfifiers (for addition of the variation ID) found error.<br />
<br />
Do you still have any ideas on it?<br />

Hi Bhushan<br />
<br />
what is the BOD entity type?<br />
<br />
Warehouse or company? How do i determine it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">9th January 2017, 10:36</div></div><div class="posttext">The entity type defines the way the AccountingEntity is set in the BOD. AccountingEntity relates to the financial company.<br />
Is your BOD representing transactional data then you need to pass the department/warehouse that defines the relation to the financial company.<br />
In case of master data, then there is no financial company relation, you can just set it to Company.<br />

No You understood it wrong.. I dont have this specific subscriptioni,e, Sync for ProjectBOQBOD. Have lot of others<br />

Yes, the Monitor is active and the BOD is marked as a supported document in ION as well..</div></div><hr />

The record is there in tlesb300 but not there in tlesb200 ....</div></div><hr />

If you do not see an entry in tlesb200 then the BOD is not yet triggered. So please trigger the BOD and see what happens. If you think you did trigger the BOD already then you need to debug why it is not getting produced and put into the outbox (tlesb100).<br />

One thing i wanted to ask is that, What is i.Doc.id? Isnt it the primary index key of the table?<br />
<br />
And what is i.identities?<br />
<br />
Also, regarding the Action code,Is it case Sensitive? I have used &quot;ADD&quot;, &quot;Add&quot;,&quot;Replace&quot; etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">12th February 2017, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Document ID is the ID which uniquely identifies the BOD. The identities are the elements which uniquely identifies the records in the BOD. When you create your XSD, you can define the identities for the BOD. Do you have the document ID created in the schema/BII when you customized the BOD?<br />
<br />
And, I guess, the action code is not case sensitive, but its always good to use the standard set of codes.</div></div><hr />

For the moment i have included the two fields into one in &quot;Business Objects&quot; Session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In that case, you need to do some customizations. There is a nice KB on InforXtreme about how to do it with a sample custom BOD. So check if you can find it there. The idea is to add two custom fields in the BOD, write a code to fetch the values, assign the values to these two fields and link them to the Document ID field in the BOD. These things are required for multiple index fields in a BOD. It won't work without doing the above.</div></div><hr />
