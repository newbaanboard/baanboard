<br />
Are the Generate Outbound and Inbound sessions AFS compatible? I have read in this forum that at least outbound it is not but I would like to know if someone has done it before.<br />
I wan't to try making it work with an handheld, wireless scanner. We already have most functions in it (receipts,view stocks,...) but we would like to get inbounds and outbounds in it to remove the PC's from the warehouses. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

Right now it is not working correct, the needed mark in tdilc4515s000 is failing. The problem is said to be solved but not published yet because another error has been found in testing the solution. Baan Peg is working on it.<br />

<br />
Today I was able to make generate inbound, list inbound, and release inbound work. But could I was not able to make inbound work like Klaas sugests. It hangs after I do an insert to call tdilc4515s000 ( I suppose it's the subsession of a subsession symptom again).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the answers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">8th May 2003, 13:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is related to execute(end.program) in after.mark of session tdilc4515s000. Partly this is a problem in the application, partly it is a tools problem which will have to solved in the standard problem. I expect to get a solution for this from support soon, so maintain inbound through AFS can be made operational. I'll keep you posted on the solution.<br />

Read solution text in knowledge base because own script will have to be changed. Also to be installed to make it work: solution 134561, which contains the standard programs of may 9 2003.<br />

I have not yet test the solutions.<br />

Dear Mark,<br />
<br />
I will implement of bar coding system in our warehouse operation such as:<br />
<br />
- Maintain receive.<br />
- Inventory transfer. (we use location system).<br />
- issuing for production order.<br />
- cycle counting.<br />
<br />
As your success story in maintain receive by bar code, would you share how to do thats. FYI we had source code for Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th March 2006, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - it was a success.  Maintain receipts does have some issues with lot controlled items.  It seems like with each service pack release I need to make changes to it.  The inbound and outbound sessions are pretty stable.  I have not done anything with cycle counting.  <br />
<br />
We creat tags at certain points in the process.  At receipt time we generate receipt tags for the stores group.  OH - we contacted our suppliers had them start sending us Bar codes to use at receipt time. At pick time we generate pick tags - used to maintain outbound.  We printed bar codes long before we automated the sessions.  See the attached for some screen shots of what we did at each point.  If you search around in here you will see some of the subroutines I use.<br />
<br />
The best thing I can recommend is that you document your process as best as possible.  See where it makes sense to create tags to make life easier for the users.  Then you can see how you can streamline the process use API code. For all I know you might be able to generate and release outbound all at once.  In our case they had to be separate.</div></div><hr />
