<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th July 2007, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a well established fact that MS Excel is an excellent user-friendly <br />
presentation (as far as quantitative information is concerned) and <br />
analytical tool. With recent enhancements in MS Excel 2007 (http://www.erpjewels.com/excel2007enhancements.htm) and <br />
Duet- JV between Microsoft and SAP, (http://www.sap.com/community/pub/flash/kw11_07_story_2.epx) it has become more evident.<br />
<br />
Already Baan customers know about the importance of MS Excel and try many<br />
ways to provide good Baan data access in MS Excel .There are many ways<br />
and work arounds for data access and transformation of Baan data in Excel .<br />
 But none are complete for many reasons <br />
<br />
1. Complexity of output formatting  either through a tool or manually due to <br />
lack of native data dictionary and deeper integration with Baan objects.<br />
2. Longer lead times for getting data in excel <br />
3. Lack of data transformation functionality in current alternatives<br />
4. Lot of complexity and difficulty in changing backend Baan objects repeatedly.<br />
<br />
All these leads to longer lead times for MIS generations and probable loss of user <br />
Interest in MIS which in turn leads to delayed and inaccurate decisions leading<br />
to more losses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Today&#8217;s world is dynamic and so are the requirements of IT. Practically no <br />
solution can satisfy the complete requirements IT in all situations . Different<br />
situations and scenarios demand different approaches and different solutions.<br />
Multiplicity of solutions to fit diverse requirements of a company is the order <br />
of the day . This is what all leading corporations do to keep it agile and vibrant <br />
moving forward fast. So deploying an integrated tool like ERPJewels will definitely<br />
add to the vibrancy and agility of Baan customers .<br />
<br />
ERPJewels is one such excel reporting solution on Baan which can provide easy <br />
Baan data access and transformation in MS Excel. It provides great synergy <br />
between these 2 great applications by combining their complementing functionalities<br />
and providing deeper integration between these applications. One can view <br />
Specific Native Data dict advantages (http://www.erpjewels.com/nativedatadict.pdf) in Baan terminology for more information.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">27th December 2007, 08:48</div></div><div class="posttext">We have pleasure in making our  wonderful Excel  based reporting tool open source . We have <br />
created ERPJewels open source project  (https://sourceforge.net/projects/baan2excel/) for the same on 24th Dec 2007 . Even download page our website has more information about the same. <br />
<br />
Names of contributors and volunteers have not been added as per request from many of them.<br />
<br />
This tool bring life to dead (static raw)  data in Baan tables and Baan reports by adding the much-needed  interactivity and formatting/multi-dimensional  capabilities of MS Excel and adding further data transformation power to it. This tool lets developer specify analyses fields (including user defined ) &amp;  calculated items (data polishing ) , map it to pivot table / plain excel , describe the field , add selection criteria (including user defined based on Baan 4GL code ) for any Baan table / Baan report .<br />
<br />
As Baan 4GL  functions and reporting flow remains same across versions , the tool can be of use in other Baan versions also besides Baan IV . <br />
<br />
Connector to Baan report has worked across all SPs. It's tested upto SP21. There had been some changes in repgen6.1 about 2-3 times during it's journey from SP8 to SP21.  All the times it has worked by making some fixes to the code within couple of hours so that it works on older SP as well as the new SP .<br />
<br />
Enjoy this new year gift from Jewelex.</div></div><hr />

I wholeheartedly congratulate ERP Jewels team for making such a marvelous tool and further making it open source. I would request all baan users to have a look at it and get benefit. This is very much unique tool from all other Over-hyped BI tools (COGNOS, Business Objects etc) as this is natively integrated with baan iv.<br />
<br />
I just setup ERP Jewels on my live server and I was up and running on the same day as the tool comes with demo analysis which you can import in your baan company.<br />
