<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">15th August 2001, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">As we get nearer to the day when Europe becomes the United States of Europe, how many people out there use Euro's as the main currency in Baan at the moment. Plus how many have moved the system into a fully Euro system?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">15th August 2001, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">3 BaanIV installations (different customers) are undergoing that painfull task, they should be finished before end of September</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PeterH</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We're now in the middle of the euro implementation, it should be ended by the 8th of october. We 've now updated the software to Sp7, coming from Sp4. Users are now testing. Starting week 35 with the euro-update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">So a few are doing it, makes me more worried how many are not. Having raised the issue a few times, most people look at Euro as another currency and don't want the triangulation option to be implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ron Walbom</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 15:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running Baan IVb2 in France, Italy and Germany and have completed testing our Euro conversions for all three.  We are now just waiting to start implementing the conversions on the LIVE systems in two months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found there to be an expectation gap about how customers expect the Euro functionality to work.  <br />
<br />
It seems like more time needs to be spent explaining to the customer how it will work before starting the project so at least everyone knows what the results will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">16th August 2001, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">You have a point, however, sometimes this can take more time that the implementation itself. <br />
<br />
Normally you have to explain it to the finance department (god know why, they should know about it by now), then to the accounts people, then the sales people. This normally means that the Management are then involved and before you know it, you've given the presentation 7 times and everyone still has no idea or is causing 'Chinese Whispers' around the company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_shringarpure</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">i wonder if i am being late (and getting this posting at the wrong place) but - because i have been working on the baan offshoot - mk - does baan support triangulation? <br />
<br />
rather i would be interested in knowing how does it support triangulation? i have been involved in euro support and implementation along with post implementation support... we had a function that helped in the mcs module (tcmcs...)<br />
<br />
are there any currency difference problems that baan faces :) - an expert available!!!  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">21st August 2001, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not really a problem as such, more the amount of time and extra functionality it takes to set it up. You have to upgrade your Baan to get triangulation to work right (although many would complain) but it does work in the end.</div></div><hr />
