<br />
The feature was originally set like that so that purchasing people can make emergency changes to price even though the PO has been printed, countersigned by purchasing manager, and sent to supplier. Any of these &quot;emergency&quot; changes will be recorded anyway in PO line history, so any abuse of this feature can be monitored (but still can't be prevented). But if you are absolutely sure that people will not need emergency changes like this ever, then you can go ahead and customise the script (make use of the procedure mask to handle this)<br />

<br />
I have done this in our organisation .<br />
<br />
We genreate the PO through manual as well as through Contract.<br />
<br />
We have made the price field read only when the price level is manual and contract. This modification is done on form level.<br />
<br />
Due to this whenever the PO is generated and has price level manual or contract no buyer can change the price even though the receipt is not recorded.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
