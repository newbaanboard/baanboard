Specifically, if I understand your post correctly, you are linking a packaging item to another item, by means of an informational field.  <br />
<br />
You really need to undertsand how best to plan for the packaing item and then make a decision as to whether you control it with a BOM concept or not.<br />
<br />
I would not want to be a planner responsible for packaging inventory if I had no visability to demand on the system.  Visual systems are fine and definately reduce order cost but they are prone to human error.</div></div><hr />
