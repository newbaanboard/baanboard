<br />
We are looking into using acknowledgment codes to transmit our customers about any major changes to the sales order. I have turned on the sales order history parameter to ask for change codes. By doing so, now the session &quot;tdsls5106s000 - Maintain Sales Order Change Codes&quot; appear whenever we change some thing on the header. <br />
<br />
My understanding is that there is another similar session &quot;tdsls7103s000 - Maintain Sales Order Acknowledgment Codes&quot; that have, other than change codes, a place to put your acknowledgment code as well. I was actually hoping that this tdsls7103s000 will be the one that pops up as we want to record acknowledgment codes with certain field changes, but the session popping up is tdsls5106s000.<br />
<br />
Can any body shed any light on the use of these two sessions and is there a way we can control which one will be displayed. Any other tips on setting and using acknowledgment codes will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Each time you make a change to an order you can assign a Acknowledgement code to it -&gt; stored in table tdsls703.<br />
At the moment you print the Sales Acknowledgment the last acknowledgment code is written to tdsls704, we use this to print on our Sales Acknowledgements the reason a customer receives a new Acknowledgment (e.g. change in Delivery Date - we also print previous acknowledged date -, change in price, change in qty.), some report scripting might be necessary to print this information.<br />
Because only the last code is written to tdsls704 when you print the SA you can make xxx changes on an order without bothering the customer with it., only when you print the SA the last code is copied to tdsls704 and can be printed.<br />
You can use tdsls7101m000 to automatically assign specific Acknowledgment codes upon certain changes in the Sales orderline, this will work as expected by you: the codes will be assigned automatically.<br />
<br />
Change codes have to be registered manually. As far as I understand Change codes are more for internal registration, and are also filled if you use ORDCHG EDI messages (e.g. the customer sends a changed request date by EDI -&gt; this is processed in the order -&gt; you will want to track where all those changes come from).<br />
<br />
And p.s.: It seems there are still some bugs (yes, still after 15 years !) in some of these sessions: if you use tdsls7504s000 (Display Ack.Codes History) zoomed from a SO line you would expect to see only the history for that SO line, instead it shows the first Ack.Codes for any order that it can find.<br />
And also I would expect that if you zoom to tdsls7504s000 from the header you would see the history for all lines, if you zoom from a SO line you would see the history for only that line, but I have the impression there is also a bug there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">26th July 2007, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I had a similar requirement, and I wrote custom tables \ sessions to handle it.<br />
<br />
What I did was create a master table with customer \ baan session \ acknowledge if changed YES \ NO.<br />
<br />
Then I created a transactional table, that gets populated every time an order acknowledgement is printed.  If one of the planned ship date, total quantity on order, total order amount has changed, then re-notify the customer.<br />
<br />
The notifications are html e-mail that I generate through Baan code.  It is fairly easy to do, just a lot of code.  The quality of the documents is very high, because it is html.<br />
<br />
Then I use a run.prog to actually send the e-mail.  I use a freeware tool called 'Blat' to actually send the mail.<br />
<br />
It is working really well.  I set up the notifications based on order acknowledgements and packing slips (e-mail ship notice).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">31st January 2008, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - I'm trying to user run.prog with the blat program and I'm having difficulty what it's expecting for it's parameters - run.prog that is.  I'm just beginning this project so I've so far only created a library that I'm calling at the end of a report to send a file via email to myself.  Here is the code in my library:<br />
<br />
function extern sendemail()<br />
{<br />
result = run.prog(&quot;cmd.exe&quot;, &quot;blat c:\baan\tmp\BlatTest.txt -to aabbccdd@idlww.com&quot;, RP_NOWAIT)	<br />
}<br />
<br />
It compiles and runs without errors and the result = 0 but I get no email.  I can execute that blat command on the Baan server just like it looks and it sends an email.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
