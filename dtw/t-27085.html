I suppose I have to change something in the orderlines?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">11th May 2006, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">meanwhile we found that, we can do it with tdpur4223m000. <br />
But we get only one record with that try. In the table, however, are a lot of orderlines with a group of four records in which &quot;tdpur451.ckor&quot; ist set to &quot;turnover&quot;. <br />
The question is now: How can it happen, that there exist orderlines, with four records and others with only one record, on which &quot;tdpur451.ckor&quot; ist set to &quot;turnover&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">12th May 2006, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">processing purchase order (tdpur4223m000) can be done before or after matching and approving the invoice in ACP. <br />
<br />
After<br />
If it happens after matching and approving you get only 1 turnover record, directly with the correct invoice amount. <br />
<br />
Before<br />
When processing purchase order is done before matching and approving, you get also 1 turnover record. However, when the order is matched and approved the invoice amount can differ from the amount that is stored in the turnover record. Then the following happens: another turnover record is created against the 1st record, but now with negative values. After that 2 turnover records are logged, 1 with delivered quantity filled and 1 with the invoiced amount filled. So, in this situation you get 4 turnover records.<br />
<br />
I hope this clarifies it a bit.</div></div><hr />
