<br />
How can I move the inventory from Staging location back to &quot;Pick&quot; location.<br />
<br />
The reason why I need to do so is because I confirmed a shipment where the shipped quantity is less than the picked quantity.<br />
<br />
One way I am thinking is using Adjustment order. Just want to explore if there is other possibility.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

      1. picking list (remove item from picking list)<br />
      2. delete the related outbound advise<br />
<br />
By doing the above steps, the inventory will now be made available again in BUlk location.<br />
<br />
Do not do adjustemnt order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can transfer from the staging location to a pick or bulk location through a transfer order. Baan allows such a transfer order. If your next shipment is immediate, you can just leave it at the staging location itself. Baan generates outbound advice for the staging location(from staging location to the same staging location) for the next shipment. Essentially there is no build up of stock at staging location. Our shipping procedure have only generate, release outbound advice and confirm shipment. No picking list is involved. I am talking in that perspective. And we are above service pack 17.<br />
