<br />
Is it possible to update the PO Line price after receipts and the PO is invoiced and approved(Baan Vb). Does baan have a session to change or do I need to write a new program. If anyone has done the price change do let me know the logic and impact.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
It is possible in Baan Vc through session Change Prices/Discount after Receipts (tdpur4122m000).<br />
<br />
But you can cannot change the price/discount, if :<br />
 The order quantity is zero.<br />
No receipts are yet recorded or receipts recorded with 'Final Receipt' as 'No'. <br />
<br />
The order is a subcontracting order, but the status of the production order is not correct (the order is not yet in production or is already closed).<br />
<br />
One or more receipts for the order line are already registered in the order history. In this case you are too far in the procedure to change prices and discounts.<br />
<br />
Purchase invoice matching has already taken place.<br />
