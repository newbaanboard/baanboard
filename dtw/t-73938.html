It seems the production team will use Generate Outbound for a range of orders to get a list of shortages, then cancel the outbound.......most of the time :mad:<br />
<br />
Is there a built in Shortage Report in BaaN capable of this?  Seems like this would be a standard feature.<br />
<br />
If not, I am getting pretty good with the tables so what tables would I use to make my own Crystal Report?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th July 2021, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't recall one - we created our own shortage reports.  That is the one thing we did a whole lot of when we used 4C4 - create reports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StillOnBaan</div><div class="date">26th July 2021, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you happen to know the tables you pulled from?  I know the Inventory tables to get the counts of what is on hand and on order.  I just need some idea where to pull open requirements for shop orders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th July 2021, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Well what we did was use the planning table tipgc500 to generate our supply/demand table.  So not quite that simple - so we generated this table daily after our GRP runs.  It would pull in the supplies and net them. We were running - so these were all the baan tables it used.  I am not sure you use the same tables as we do.<br />
<br />
		table	ttipgc001	| Group Items<br />
		table	ttipgc010	| Pegging Data by Group Item<br />
		table	ttipgc820	| Build Item/Sub Item/Unit/CCN Link<br />
		table	ttpptc100	| Project Elements<br />
		table	ttipgc500	| GRP Planned Inventory Transactions</div></div><hr />
