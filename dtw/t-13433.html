The main problem is that we cannot see/select the appropriate PO lines to match in the session tfacp1131s000.<br />
The order has been processed to history. <br />
There is only purchase/results in integration transactions.<br />
Delivery status and update status of actual purchase in tdpur045 is free.<br />
<br />
thanks for any advice</div></div><hr />
