<br />
Is there any way to change the stock to a past day?<br />
<br />
Ex.: in tdinv700<br />
<br />
Today: 2002/10/17 - stock: 1000 pcs<br />
<br />
Past day: 2002/09/30 - stock: 700 pcs but it was 750<br />
<br />
Have I  put the correct stock adding 50 in 2002/09/30?<br />
<br />
- tdinv1101m000 or<br />
- tdinv1220m000<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Create a cycle count for the part use gtm to change the date of the cycle count to the 2002/09/30 also change the on hand qty to 700 then enter the 750 as the count and process.  Don't know if this would be ok if you have ilc turned on we do not use it so I am not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bizen99</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">If I use cycle count on this way stock of today change to 750, and I don't want it. I want that today's stock will be 1050 pcs, but I have to do operations before correct the stock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">That is not how the cycle count works.<br />
<br />
e.g<br />
<br />
if you create a cycle count today then the on hand would be 1000, then you issue 500 to production order. tomorrow process the cycle count with a value of 1050. <br />
The onhand stock would change to 550 and a cycle counting warehouse order would be created with the date of the cycle count adding the 50.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I'm not mistaken, what bizen99 is actually asking is whether bizen99 has done the correct thing to just enter inventory transaction tdinv1101m000 with type inventory adjustment and past date as transaction date. If indeed that's what bizen99 is asking, then the answer is yes, that's the way to do it. Inventory adjustment can be set to happen in the past, just enter the past date in transaction date.<br />
