We have been using Baan ERP LN (FP5) and we have a requirement when we process Sales Return orders. In a Sales return order if the reason code is a particular code, then we needed the total net Sales order amount to be deducted by 10%. For example if there is Sales order with one line and the value is -1000, how is it possible to have an additional line with +100 so that the value of the Credit note of the Sales return order becomes -900. Let us know if there is a way to have this done in Baan.<br />
If further explanation is required, it could be given. Let us know if there is a solution to this. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
