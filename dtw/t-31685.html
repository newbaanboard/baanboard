we are using baan 4C4, I have a query in processing a sales order.<br />
I have given sales order step as follows<br />
-   Maintain Delivery<br />
-   Caluculate taxes after delivery<br />
-   Process Excise Invoice (Exports) tdind0605m000<br />
-   Print Sales cum Excise Invoice  tdind0460m000<br />
-   PDSO<br />
<br />
i have seen a order whose Process Excise invoice step status is 'No' and Print Sales Cum Excise Invoice is also 'No&quot;. But Invoice was generated. How this is possible.<br />
<br />
can any one give me solution. <br />
<br />
Note : This is happening randomly.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
regards<br />

<br />
I hope by Invoice you are referring is Excise Invoice. If it is so than need not to worry. This is a bug with the software object. <br />
You may have to write an utility which will change the procedure mask and maintain the status as Print Sales Invoice or you can do the manually at GTM Log.<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
Kindly elaborate your problem.<br />
In which service pack you are in ?<br />
Are you doing a export invoice ?<br />
Are you using the same order type for all SOs ?(Local as well as Abroad)<br />
Are you going through the Export control ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
John</div></div><hr />
