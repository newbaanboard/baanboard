<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milsykor</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">We have got following problem regarding delivery status of several lines on sales order :<br />
Sales order has a couple of lines in state : Maintain deliveries but if I try to enter quantity to be delivered system displays Insufficient invetory. <br />
The problem is that the items are customized and it seems that there is inconsistency between tipcs tables and sales order status.<br />
The session tipcs7510m000 shows that delivery has been processed. Except sales delivery we can see PRP purchase order at the same time with the same quantity as sales order.<br />
<br />
Dou you have any idea how to fix it ?</div></div><hr />
