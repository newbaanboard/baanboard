<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">27th November 2007, 14:12</div></div><div class="posttext">BaaN is allowing us to modify the delivery data in Maintain delivery session after executing the Print packing slip (Next step in the sales order)  eventhough the re-execution is not enabled for Maintain delivery. This is possible if the Maintain delivery session is not closed after the delivery and it is open when the next step got executed. <br />
<br />
Here are the steps :-<br />
<br />
1. Maintain sales order for 100 Pcs.<br />
2. Maintain delivery for 80 Pcs and Back order as 20 Pcs.<br />
3. User did not close the session (He needs to deliver other or same item later)<br />
4. Print packing slip shows  80 Pcs. <br />
5. Later, enter 20 Pcs as delivered quantity in the same session thinking that he is entering the balance delivery(regardless of warning : Record modified by other user, still user can continue to edit)<br />
6. Print packing slip shows 20 pcs.<br />
<br />
Here the Delivery of 80 pcs &amp; packing slip got overwritten by subsequent delivery of 20 Pcs. <br />
Regardles of many instruction from ourside, users still repeating the same mistakes. <br />
<br />
Regarding the above,  Could some one please explain the following :<br />
<br />
1. Why baan is allowing us to edit when re-execution of the same step is disabled<br />
2. Did any one came across the same problem ?  what are the pre-cautions ?<br />
3. How can we restrict the user from modifying the delivered items.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards.<br />

<br />
I think you can explore the option confirm delivery in maintain delivery session and ask user to change the same once they print the report.<br />
