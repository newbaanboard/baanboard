<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmcinc</div><div class="date">16th November 2007, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">We have various manufacturing sites with nettable warehouses for MRP planning purposes.  Within the same company, we have replenishment warehouses to supply these manufacturing sites with raw materials.  DRP would be a nice way to automatically move the material, however, it does not allow for normal nettable warehouses to be used.  But it does allow nettable ones of type &quot;Work in Process&quot;.  What are the implications if we would change our manufacturing warehouses from 'Normal' to 'WIP'?  I am aware of the difficulty to change the type if you have inventory in the warehouse.  But let's say there is no inventory and Baan will allow me to change the type, what am i getting myself into?  How are WIP warehouses treated differently than normal warehouses?</div></div><hr />
