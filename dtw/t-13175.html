<br />
When this session is running, if there is anyone doing any transaction in Baan, it causes this session to fail.<br />
<br />
Now if I just have the Maintain PO lines session open, which basically locks the record, will that cause the rebuild session to fail ??<br />
<br />
I believe it shouldnt but just want to confirm.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I am familiar with BaanIVc only. For this version having purchase order maintenance open but inactive and not in the middle of maintenance, should not cause the program to crash.<br />
<br />
However, if a session is open there is always the possibility (from my experience a very high likelhood) of the session being used just when you don't want it to be, or even at the stage where it is updating the planned inventory table.  Therefore I would strongly suggest running the job from the job daemon when you know no users will be on the system.  The help screen also suggests this.<br />
<br />
The program rebuilds the planned inventory table and if any other programs that update this table happen to run at the same time you will invite trouble. Either the job will crash or you may have incorrect figures.<br />

<br />
Performance wise, it may be slower though.<br />
