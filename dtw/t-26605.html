<br />
I have locked the Purchase order for Price that is In Baan till the receipt is recorded you can change anything as it allows to do so.<br />
<br />
But we were facing the problem that Once the hard copy is Printed of PO and the same is authorised for basic rate and other commercial terms that nobody should change the price till the receipt is reorded.<br />
<br />
We have made the Price field read only for the price levels :Contracts ,Manual,SFC so whenever the orders are generated and price level is as mentioned than nobody can change the price even if the receipt is not recorded<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
