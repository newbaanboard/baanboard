<br />
I have problem with distribution of newspapers. The problems are:<br />
-every day I have to deliver newspaper on about a thousand address. I have to have name, address and quantity for  every customer(quantity can be changed every day) . <br />
-the quantity have to be separate by channel of distribution and by carrier (driver)<br />
<br />
If everybody have experience with this type of distribution (bakery, milk product etc.), please give me the framework  how you did it. Any comment will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

For example, does address 1 have a combination of channel 1 and driver 2 at all times.  Are the channels of distribution and driver combinations so that you can schedule deliveries to the addresses?  If this is the case you may be able to use DRP.</div></div><hr />
