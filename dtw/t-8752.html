we insert new sales order for customer AA. But, then the sales order is blocked..<br />
The total amount for this order is $72600. But, when we print out &quot;Blocked sales order&quot;, it comes out like this:<br />
<br />
This order : 25067,100.00<br />
Credit Limit: 150,000.00    (this is correct)<br />
Unpaid Invoice : 132,641.86    (this is correct)<br />
Created Order : 25074,391.03 <br />
Overlimit by : 25057,032.89-<br />
<br />
Reason for blocking is &quot;Credit Limit Exceeded&quot;..<br />
<br />
I've checked table tdsls040,tdsls041,tdsls045,tccom010 and tccom011..<br />
I can't see any problems there??<br />
<br />
So, where is the problem and how to check it??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<br />
I don't know whether this is what happened to you or not. But in our case, this happens many times because of wrong currency. Because, if the correct price is for example IDR 1,000,000 (IDR is the home currency) but it was wrongly entered as USD 1,000,000 (USD 1 roughly equals to IDR 9,000 now), then you can easily exceed the credit limit<br />

Look at form 2.  About half way down the  form are setting for blockin a sales order.  Check to see if block when credit limit is exceeded is set to 'YES'.  If so, then change to NO.<br />
Of course, if you are having problems with currency conversions this may not be what you want to do.<br />
hope this is helpful.<br />

I believe you can run this in test mode first without a real update.<br />
(I do not have baan access right now so I cannot check, sorry).</div></div><hr />
