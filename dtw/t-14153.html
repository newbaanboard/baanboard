<br />
Is it possible to make transactions between 2 logistics companies?<br />
<br />
Example: Specifically to move inventory from one company to another company?<br />
<br />
Both logsitics companies are in the same VRC , but them depend from differents financial companies.<br />
<br />
Which process do I have to follow to achieve this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
You can acheive this by simply posting a sales order to the destination warehouse / company, such that the cost of inventory is transferred by issue the sales order with 0 dollars.  Thus, there is not any revenue impact at all.<br />
<br />
Another combination could also to use the direct delivery feature and trigger a purchase order from the sales order, and achieve transfer of costs.<br />
<br />
Best wishes,</div></div><hr />
