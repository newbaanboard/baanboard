<br />
We are having problems with back orders on PCS projects.<br />
<br />
A purchase order has a back order of 2 for a customized item. However, this quantity is not showing up on the &quot;planned inventory transactions by customized item&quot; session.<br />
<br />
We did a rebuild planned inventory transactions and still it has not fixed the problem. <br />
<br />
Could someone provide any inputs on what could be causing the problem?<br />
<br />
I have attached a word doc. with screen shots and more details.<br />
<br />
This is urgent - so please help if you have a clue.<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />
<br />
Ajit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do we need to confirm backorders on purchase orders?<br />
<br />
I know there are sessions to confirm back orders on <br />
sales orders.<br />
<br />
I could not locate any sessions to confirm back orders on purchase orders.<br />
<br />
Please let me know what needs to be done to confirm back orders on purchase orders.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ajit.</div></div><hr />
