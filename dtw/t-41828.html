<br />
I have the following situation.<br />
Customer has $1 as the credit limit.<br />
Outstanding order balance and invoice balance is greater than $1.<br />
Sales order type has the blocking step at Print Picking List.<br />
Item entered on sales order is a direct delivery item.<br />
Sales order is blocked when order is entered. After saving the order but BEFORE executing any of the order steps - if anything on the line is changed - the order remains blocked.<br />
However, if anything on the sales order header or if header or footer text is entered - the order comes off block status. This occurs whilst in the sales order. <br />
Has anyone seen this before? I'm not sure if there is a process error, standard Baan issue or if one of the customizations that we have made in the past to the sales order header has caused this problem. Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
This does not occur for any item that is not direct delivery.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

This doesnt sound to be a process issue and if it is, then thats a serious flaw. What service pack are you on currently?<br />

But it does appear to me to be a customization that must have caused this. If it was a process setup issue - the order would never go on hold in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Standard Baan will block the order every time a record is saved either in header or lines- this includes adding or removing or updating text notes. In my setup we have customized so that if an order is not blocked and if Baan blocks it and there is no change in the &quot;Order Amount&quot; system will unblock it. Also I note that your blocking step is &quot;Print P/L&quot; , so how is that going to work for a direct delivery sales order. In my set up we block at Order Ack. And we don't allow the PO sent to supplier if the sales order is blocked. <br />

I guess its best you use either DBSLOG or TT_SQL_TRACE command to see whats really happening behind the scene which causes the current problem. In the long run, its better to have a test company(a replica of your live company with preferably a different customized vrc package) to test certain scenarios without affecting your live data. <br />
