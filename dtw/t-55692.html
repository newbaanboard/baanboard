       I am currentlly working on Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
       I want to create the Inventory Transfer order using session (tdilc1120m000).<br />
<br />
       For some condition the question is been asked &quot;Location contains blocked goods. Continue?&quot;.<br />
<br />
       I tried to look in the Program script for session (tdilc1122s000). There I found the message is been poped when the field &quot;Inventory on hold&quot; (tdilc101.stkb) value is non zero.<br />
<br />
      I tried to block the Location, but while creating transfer order it does not allow me to enter that location as &quot;to location&quot;.<br />
<br />
      Then I tried to block the lot but again while creating the transfer order it does not allow me to enter that lot.<br />
<br />
     Is there any way where without blocking the Lot, Location we can can have some quantity at a loction blocked??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
As per my understanding, you want to do Inventory Transfer from a location controlled W/H.<br />
<br />
The message you are getting is a warning message that in location from/to some of the inventory is on block status.<br />
<br />
check the data in table tdilc101 &amp; tdinv001, there must be some data mismatch in these tables.</div></div><hr />

            I think I have confused you.<br />
<br />
            Actually I want to create the condition where the mentioned question is been asked. It is not necessary that the warehouse must be location controlled or the item must be location controlled.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

You can use Item Signal for this requirement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand from above , that you need to put some custom messages based on Inventory &amp; item in session tdilc1120m000.<br />
<br />
Suggestion :   write a cust session - AFS and insert condional messages as per your requirement.<br />

<br />
           My problem is not that the question is been popped up.<br />
<br />
           My problem is that I am unable to get the condition where this question will get popped.<br />
<br />
           We have the customization where if there are any questions then they are written in a file.<br />
<br />
           I have to test it. So I have to create the record so that the question is been asked, so that the customized code will write it in the file and I can check it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
