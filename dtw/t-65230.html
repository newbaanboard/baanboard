<br />
When you create a transfer order, you get 2 planned transactions in Planned Inventory Transactions for the item. Now, if you have confirmed the shipment, you will have a pending receipt transaction to be done against that shipment. <br />
<br />
In your case, the item has been transferred to Warehouse B from A. So, the inventory has already been reduced in Warehouse A but has not been increased yet in Warehouse B.<br />
<br />
At this point, the inventory is awaiting for the receipts to be made. If you receive the material, inventory of Warehouse B will increase and if you reject it during inspection, an Adjustment order will remove the stock from Warehouse B. But, it wont affect the inventory in Warehouse A.<br />
<br />
Now, you have two ways to send it back to the Warehouse A.<br />
<br />
1. Create a receipt against the Shipment, reject it, and use another adjustment order to adjust the stock in Warehouse A.<br />
2. Create a receipt against the Shipment. This will complete the Transfer Order. Now, create another Transfer Order to send the material back.<br />
<br />
It depends on the way you want to handle it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*CASE 2 Suppose B is bond warehouse in this case warehouse reverse transfer order not possible for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">30th December 2013, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">*Case1 Suppose if i receive the shipment in the warehouse B with 0 quantity. then what will be the status of the inventory shipped from warehouse A<br />
<br />
In this case, the Inbound line will remain active as the receipt has not yet been made. If the shipment is already confirmed, the Inventory in Warehouse A is already reduced. And, Warehouse B is waiting for the receipt to be done.<br />
*<br />
*CASE 2 Suppose B is bond warehouse in this case warehouse reverse transfer order not possible for us.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure about this scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">3rd January 2014, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not necessary to reject during inspection. A zero quantity receipt is possible. The inbound line is finalized when the &quot;Final Receipt&quot; flag is selected.<br />
<br />
Note that depending on the &quot;Warehouse Order Type&quot; (whinh0610m000) settings, a backorder line can be generated to ship the not received quantity. This backorder should be deleted.<br />
<br />
Correcting the stock in the supplying warehouse can be done in e.g the following two ways:<br />
1) If you did not receive the goods in warehouse B you have to create an &quot;Adjustment Order&quot; (whinh5120m100).<br />
<br />
2) If you did register a receipt and you did not reject the goods, you create a new transfer order. You can easily generate a return order. Use the specific option &quot;Create Return Order&quot; in the &quot;Warehouse Order&quot; (whinh2100m100) session. A new order set is created for the same order number.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. Thanks for the correction. So, just the adjustment order will do the job.</div></div><hr />
