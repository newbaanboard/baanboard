<br />
There is one replenishment order in the system, for line no 20 order qty is 5, delivered qty is 4. Deliveries &amp; backorders confirmed for this line.<br />

When I try to generate outbound advice, it says no data within selection. However I can maintainoutbound data for this line.<br />
<br />

Perhaps there is an incorrect warehouse or date being entered / defaulted. This is not perhaps as obvious when you are generating as it is when you are maintaining.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">6th January 2003, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">is the order a ship complete order ?? (The Ship Complete field is set to Yes on form 2 of the Maintain Sales Orders (tdsls4101m000) session<br />
<br />
Is the order or customer blocked ??<br />
<br />
as prev noted make sure the dates on the dates on the Generate session are correct.<br />
<br />
If you are still stuck use the tracing option :<br />
-- -set TT_SQL_TRACE=0240  -logfile log.txt -keeplog tdilc4201m000 (Client sql statements)<br />
<br />
This will give you the sql query if you do not have the source code to reference.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">24th January 2003, 06:10</div></div><div class="posttext">With help from BaaN local support I am able to solev this problem. The detailed procedure for this is.<br />
<br />
1. Make a replenishment order with order qty 100. Say order no 100022-position no. 10.<br />
<br />
2. Generate / Maintain outbound data for partial qty say 30 &amp; release the advice.<br />
<br />
3. Now confirm replenishment order deliveries through session tdrpl0114m000 with the session showing <br />
Planned quantity	-	100<br />
Delivered qty 	-	30<br />
Backorder qty	-	70<br />
<br />
Confirm deliveries by making field confirmed YES.<br />
<br />
4. Confirm back order by session tdrpl0120m000. It shows order qty 100, backorder qty 70. When field confirmed changed to YES, a new record is created in table tdrpl100. For order no 100022 position 10 with sequence del. 2.<br />
<br />
5. Now again open session tdrpl0114m000 (confirm rpl order deliveries) &amp; when we tab through this session, system by default picks up the value 70 in field backorder. If we save the record, It saves the record in the system as backorder qty 70.<br />
<br />
6. Now at this moment record in table rpl100 del.2 are as  - order qty 70, delivered qty 0, backorder qty 70.<br />
<br />
7. For this record system doesnt generate any outbound advice.<br />
<br />
8. To rectify this we have to again open up the session tdrpl0114m000, make backorder qty as 0 &amp; save the record.</div></div><hr />
