<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bernard</div><div class="date">27th March 2003, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">We use internal EDI on a BaanIVc3 installation. 850.1 to be precise. PO (company 1 )--&gt; to trigger a SO (in company 2) We now want to be able to specify the warehouse to which the PO/SO should be posted. We find that 850.1 format does not have warehouse. What can we do. <br />
<br />
This becomes very important as we now want to move to external EDI and like to specify the warehouse in the generated message.<br />
<br />
Any help / advice will be greatly aapreciated</div></div><hr />

Baan by default assumes the warehouse that is in the item file. The only way you have to turnaround this problem is to develop a new format for the edi message that allows for a warehouse field.<br />

I agree with you and figured this out. What I'm asking is 'how' to do this. I need the instructions to carry out the changes ( new message ) and try.<br />
<br />
BTW - the warehouse is picked from the defaults of the user carrying out the EDI session. We already verified this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askajale</div><div class="date">28th March 2003, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I can think of  - This customization can be achieved by 2 ways.<br />
<br />
Method-1<br />
-----------<br />
1. Change the conversion setup for IN / OUT message for the Line segement. Add the field of warehouse.<br />
2. The OUT message DLL (Standard) may not require modification as the warehouse field must be already selected using select tdpur041.*<br />
3. The IN message DLL nned to modify to read the field from in file and validate (you can think of introducing Code Conversion for Warehouse code) and convert (if required)<br />
<br />
Method-2 (only if you have limited number of warehouses)<br />
------------<br />
1. Copy the EDI message with different names.<br />
2. Add the Qualifier in Line segement and attach different  evaluation expressions to each message for different warehouse codes.<br />

<br />
Leave the EDI the way it is and create a new session to modify your SO with what ever rules you want.  Have this session change the planned inventory movements as well and you should be good to go.<br />

we wrote a custom session to do this, it updates the sales order warehouse field to be equal a warehouse field in the customer table (that we added).<br />
<br />
Getting the code to work properly was a bit of a struggle.  You need to update / check,<br />
- items by warehouse<br />
- planned inventory movements<br />
- sales order tables<br />
<br />
as well, things like phantoms, cost items, application locks, exceptions where the order should not be updated, need to be handled correctly.<br />
<br />
As well we built error checking / exceptions reports that sit behind the update session.<br />
<br />
A relatively tough personalization, but we use it on hundreds of lines a day.</div></div><hr />
