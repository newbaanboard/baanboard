No the item code length keeps varying. Anyway I have done it by editing the report script. Item codes without the colour code was determined by sorting and then 1st position of the similar items was stored in an array. Using this array at the detail layout the other lines were suppressed and the qty and amount was stored in my variables for same items and these variables were printed in the report session.</div></div><hr />
