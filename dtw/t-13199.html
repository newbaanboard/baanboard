<br />
Example - today I entere a sales order, and tomorrow the customer goes on credit hold. Is there any way at this point to block this demand from MRP? As far as I can tell, MRP will still see this as planned demand, which means I end up building the inventory, even though the customer is on hold. <br />
<br />
I do not want to build product until the customer is off credit hold</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">7th October 2003, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used Baan Quotations for exactly this reason.<br />
<br />
You enter the quote (looks just like a sales order).<br />
By setting a success percentage on the quote, you can determine if MPS / MRP will see this demand.  So, you can run MPS/MRP with a minumum success percentage of 99 % and only see 'sure bets' and then run it with a success percentage of 1 % to see everything.<br />
<br />
Once the credit hold issue is resolved, then you can process the quote into an order.<br />
<br />
The problem with this approach is that it does require some hand-holding / manual intervention to watch the credit of the customer, and then process the quote into an order.<br />
<br />
An uglier work around involves changing the warehouse on the sales order to be a 'non-nettable' warehouse, and then once the credit issue has been resolved, change it back to a nettable warehouse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This original question is 5 years old. So I ask it again. I require a way to exclude all sales orders of certain block codes from MRP. <br />
<br />
We use ATP, hence changing the warehouse is not a good option.<br />
Moving the delivery date far into the future requires to much manual intervention. The Quote module in Baan 5 is also not ideal. <br />
<br />
Our sales people want to get the sales order into the system but Customer Service do not want it taken into the planning until it is reviewed by them selves.<br />
<br />
What I have done is made all sales inexperienced operators so the order goes on hold, that customer service can then release after review. But how to exclude these from the planning?<br />
<br />
The same rule would apply for orders that are entered via EDI; these should also be excluded from the planning until they are reviewed.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any bright ideas.<br />
In the meanwhile we are misusing the project code field but this requires quite a bit of manual intervention.<br />

So, one can write a batch program that will be running before MRP and change the warehosue in the tdinv150 for blocked order and then after MRP is finished change it back to orginal warehouse in tdinv150. Thats quite simple solution.<br />
