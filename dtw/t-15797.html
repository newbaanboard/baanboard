<br />
Does anyone have experience on MAUC reporting?<br />
What I intend to have is a Crystal Report that provides me with the most recent value of MAUC for each item.<br />
<br />
So far I could get data from whinr112 &amp; 113 [Baan V], but still am not able to filter the values to get the latest cost (MAUC) per item. Therefore my report currently needs too much number crunching in Excel... :( <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
The latest (= actual) MAUC is found in whwmd215 + whwmd216<br />
The historical MAUC is found in whinr112 + whinr113<br />

First of all thank you for the answer! The report works perfectly with the tables you mentioned (actually used table 217 instead of 216).<br />
<br />
Let me ask one question however:<br />
The MAUC values I get with whwmd215&amp;217 are slightly different from the MAUC I see in session whina1512m000 (inbound transactions to warehouse)...<br />
<br />
I can see that in the whwmd215&amp;217 the latest date is different to the date of whina1512m000, this because the former corresponds to a delivery to one of our clients. <br />
The rationale could be that delivered items incur in further costs (e.g. in the warehouse) and therefore the MAUC is higher than the one of the reception; but I believe that for the moment we only have inbound/reception costs in Baan (e.g. purchase price and transport) and therefore both values should not differ despite the difference in dates...<br />
<br />
Am not sure I have been clear enough -hopefully yes :) <br />
Any input?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, you are right: whwmd217.<br />
<br />
If I understand you correctly: the date in whwmd215 has no relationship with the date in whinr112/113.<br />
The date in whwmd215 (whwmd215.ltdt) is the date on which the last inventory transaction was registered. So, it can be a date when the last issue was done.<br />
<br />
The transaction date in whinr112/113 is the date on which the receipt was registered. <br />
<br />
As MAUC is only calculated on receipt, the MAUC value in whwmd215/217 should be the same as the last one in whinr112/113. Note that in whinr, the MAUC price is stored (so per inventory unit), whereas in whwmd, the MAUC amount is stored (overall for all units). <br />
The MAUC in whwmd215/217 can be more accurate as it is not rounded.<br />
<br />
whwmd217.mauc/whwmd215.stoc = whinr113.mauc</div></div><hr />

<br />
the possibility of calculating MAUC per company (or grouping for multiple warehouses) is present in SSA ERP LN - FP2.</div></div><hr />
