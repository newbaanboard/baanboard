<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">30th September 2004, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
Is there a parameter to block the inbound during a cyclic count?<br />
I'm using Baan IV c2.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gardsted</div><div class="date">4th October 2004, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">One solution would be to block all but 1 user in $BSE/lib/informix/inf_users or similar depenending on the database You are using.<br />
<br />
Make a backup file ' inf_users_all' and delete all lines but the one for the counting user in the original file.<br />
<br />
When You are done counting, copy the backup file 'inf_users_all' back on top of 'inf_users'<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">knfarm</div><div class="date">5th October 2004, 13:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow... Your method is not only block for inbound for cycle count but will block everyone from accessing system axcept the users on inf file. How about finance users still need to use finance module key-in some journal entry or transaction???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">knfarm</div><div class="date">5th October 2004, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">if you have location implemented, you can try to set &quot;No&quot; for inbound or &quot;Yes&quot; to Block inbound at Maintain Location. Hopefully this method can help you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could use field &quot;Block Locations for Cycle Counting Orders&quot; (tdilc000. take), but in this case wou will also block outbound movements.<br />
<br />
When you set the &quot;Block Locations for Cycle Counting Orders&quot; (tdilc000. take) to &quot;Yes&quot; in &quot;ILC Parameters&quot;, Inventory for which cycle counting orders are present must be blocked. To prevent mistakes, it is advised to block the inventory between the time that you create cycle counting orders and the time that you process your counting results.<br />
<br />
This parameter determines whether or not stockpoints must be blocked for transactions that modify the inventory on the stockpoint during cycle counting. Advices are not blocked, but actualization of the advices are. Blocking only occurs when both tdilc000. take and tdilc101. take are yes.<br />
<br />
Where this parameter is used: When ILC is implemented (otherwise the parameter is Block During Warehouse Cycle Counting) this parameter is used in combination with Cycle Counting Order Generated to determine the blocking status after session &quot;Generate Cycle Counting Orders (tdilc5210m000)&quot; is run.<br />
<br />

I have set the parameter tdilc000.take for block outbound movements. The problem that I have is when the user do an inbound pocedure.<br />
<br />
That´s why I´m asking if there are another parameter to block these movements also.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could block locations by transaction in session &quot;(Un)Block Locations by Transaction&quot; (tdilc0111m000).<br />
<br />

Hi, is tdilc0110m000 (Maintain Location), but u need to do 1 by 1. U can try to use (Un)block Range of Location at tdilc0220m000 to BLOCK all location, u can use back same session to unblock location.</div></div><hr />

Hi, session tdilc0220m000 will be more useful if you have many warehouses and locations. :cool:</div></div><hr />
