<br />
How can we use Baan Exchange Scheme to populate sale order data from a text file, which has several columns that data is not used for upload? <br />
<br />
Is it possible to use Exchange Scheme to read and populate only the required columns from a text file? How? Additional Script required? <br />
<br />
Please advise. I'm really appreciate all answers. <br />
<br />
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you~</div></div><hr />

in session tuxch0103m000 Maintain ASCII File Formats, by default the format created is Identical to the table; however you can change the start position of the fields like:<br />

10    cuno          Customer Code                       Alphanumeric                     1           6<br />

I don't think that loading sales order (header/Details/text) using exchange will be your best bet. However is doable.</div></div><hr />

Thank you!!! :D <br />

I know that loading sales order usin Exchange is not the best way;however, I have no choice and it's not my choice.  <br />
<br />
The file contain multiple lines for a sales oders, will that be a problem? <br />
<br />
By specifying the starting position, can the file contain &quot;,&quot; as a separator? Also, some column is blank, &quot; &quot;. How do count the start position when it's blank? Start from the first code? Total 3? <br />
<br />
Please advise...Thank you!!! :)</div></div><hr />

Since you have no choice, I will suggest that you parce your files first and try to create the files from there.<br />
I mean the ASCII exchange file to populate sales order header and sales order lines.<br />
Normally files will be fix lenght, therefore you can still use the starting position and end position of the field, the character fields should be alligned according with the domain of the field that you are populating.<br />
You can create manualy a sales order and sales order lines, then use exchange and export the values so you will see which fileds you will require to populate from your import.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
