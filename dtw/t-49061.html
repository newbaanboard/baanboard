<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">8th March 2008, 08:48</div></div><div class="posttext">To my knowledge there is no such standard report, in Baan4, that shows the stock info per Supplier . You can find out how much was purchased from that supplier, but there is no way of tagging your available stock to a supplier...Thats the blunt reply to your question. <br />
<br />
Now can it be done? Yes ofcourse you can... Below is one of the straight forward way of doing (i.e without customizing forms and reports)<br />
Lot Control.<br />
As part of the Lot Id structure, you can include the Supplier Code and everytime an item is recorded against that particular Lot No, you would be able to tell how much stock you have pertaining to that Supplier..<br />
Thats the rosy part. The not-so-rosy part is the overheads of implementing the Lot Control and the daggers that can come flying in your direction from irate DEOs (read Data Entry Operators) or users..<br />
<br />
I dont think the effort would be worth what you seek..<br />

If on the other hand you have just a handfull of suppliers then you could play with your warehouses and locations but otherwise i dont see any other straight forward method than what i described.. <br />

It would be interesting to hear about other standard methods if at all there is any ... <br />

<br />
Thanky you for reply - I know that there is no direct relation between current stock and supplier, but what about back-tracking stock to its original purchase order via transactions?<br />
<br />
Otherwise, as you said, implementing lot control just for this purpose is out of the question.</div></div><hr />

  One of the reason for implementing Lot Control is to track a particular Lot to a supplier/order. Having Lot Control can easily get you the details on which stock is pertaining to which order of which supplier as a Lot Controlled Item will have the identity of the Lot in each transaction its a part of... <br />

I am not sure of any other available standard methods to achieve the same...<br />
