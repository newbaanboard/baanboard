<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">21st December 2005, 05:55</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I can recall, in BaanIV, by default, over-delivery of sales order is permitted. In BaanERP initially no over-delivery of sales order is allowed. However, Baan later provided enhancement to enable controllable over-delivery of sales order (through over-delivery &quot;tolerance&quot; parameter)<br />
I haven't touched BaanIV for ages now. And we are still studying the use of the over-delivery enhancement in BaanERP<br />

The situation I recall was with ILC activated: when changing the outbound manually, over delivery on sls is possible.<br />
<br />
Obviously whithin Purchase it works different: only when there's more then 1 open (backorder qty or initially ordered), receiving ore then one is possible.<br />
<br />
(gotta go to the X-mas diner now :D )</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if you ar using ILC and use maintain outbound data session, it is possible to issue more quantity than the ordered quantity.<br />
<br />
In order to prevent this, first try to be on-line<br />
secondly use generate outbound instead of maintain outbound may be as a order step or<br />
still if u insist, change parameter in ILC - confirm SLS/RPL data as yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanDeveloper</div><div class="date">28th February 2006, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience with Baan IV c2 &amp; c4 was this is possible. In fact, it was absolutely necessary for the steel pipe and tube business because if a customer orders 200 meters of pipe then a quantity of +/- 10% is delivered. This is normal industry practice because pipe is manufactured in random lengths meaning one piece of pipe could be 7 meters long and another piece of pipe could be 6 meters long. So when the pipe is gathered together to satisfy an order the collective measurement of all the pieces of pipe allocated to satisfy an order for 200 meters could permissibly reach a total of 220 meters. 220 meters would be the quantity shipped and invoiced. Like I said - this was normal industry practice and quite common.</div></div><hr />
