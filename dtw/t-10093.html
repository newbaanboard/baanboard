<br />
I have to recreate Sales order in BaanIV from Sales order in BaanV. (yes BaanV to BaanIV).<br />
<br />
Iam writing a spec for this.Would request experienced people to suggest a good method.<br />
<br />
Internal EDI is also considered.<br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone has any specs like this please post it here.I appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">21st May 2003, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you please outline the process if we have to use internal EDI.<br />
<br />
whether the sales order in BaanV has to be a purchase order for BaanIV.<br />
<br />
Iam trying to get it into BaanIV without all the purchase order etc from BaanV.<br />
<br />
Please clarify<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Normally Internal EDI is used with the same instance of Baan. As you are talking about Baan V and Baan IV, it can not be same instance and moreover the tools version is different. Still we can make it work like Internal EDI, but I think External EDI (with some shell scripts) should work.<br />
<br />
You need to raise the PO in Baan V and then take it IN in Baan IV as SO.<br />
<br />
The other option could be Create ASCII files from Baan V and may be develope function server DLL or use EDI dll (for 850 IN message) to generate SO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanprog</div><div class="date">21st May 2003, 14:43</div></div><div class="posttext">can you please elaborate on the second option<br />
<br />
&quot;The other option could be Create ASCII files from Baan V and may be develope function server DLL or use EDI dll (for 850 IN message) to generate SO.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tell me , whether the ascii file created should be according 850 IN format.<br />
<br />
Whether we can then use EDI in BaanIV and make it read this file and create a sales order.By using conversion setups etc.<br />
<br />
please give me as much info  as you can.I will appreciate that.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">22nd May 2003, 02:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The format of the EDI file generated in BaaNV should be as per the 850S(IN) conversion setup in BaaNIV. If not you need to change any one of the 850 conversion setups to meet this requirement.<br />
<br />
If the above requirement meets, then you can definately able to load sales orders in BaaN IV using EDI. The person doing this should have knowledge to tweak the 850 EDI conversion setups<br />
and the knowledge of EDI process.<br />
<br />
The other option is as Avinash told, using function generator to load sales orders. Here I think you need not worry about the file structure except for input fields as defined in the function generator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askajale</div><div class="date">25th May 2003, 08:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I think EDI might become slight complicated as Baan V Logistics module is completely revamped compared to Baan IV and then mapping the conversion setup fields with Baan IV Sales order generation dll (EDI) might be complicated.<br />
<br />
So I feel Function Server DLL could be the better option.<br />
