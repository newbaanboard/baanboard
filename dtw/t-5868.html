I'm using Baan IV c2.<br />
<br />
In Maintain Tax Codes By Country, in Form 1 , we have 'Sales Tax Account' field and in Form 2, 'Sales Ledger Account' field.<br />
<br />
1) What is the function of this two fields?<br />
<br />
2) If I create a PO, with tax, is it ok to leave these two fields empty?<br />
<br />
3) And , I never maintain 'Maintain Single Tax Rates'. Can I print DO which includes the tax without maintaining this?<br />
<br />
My problem is, when I print a PO, the report doesn't include the tax. We are running two different companies: 668 and 888. I copied everything from company 668 to company 888. But, in Maintain Tax Codes By Country,  (company 888), I leave the above two fields empty and I never maintain the  'maintain single tax rates'.<br />
In company 668, the tax is displayed when I print DO but not in 888.<br />
<br />
And I don't know where the problem is. Please advise me.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />
Best Regards,<br />
