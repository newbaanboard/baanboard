<br />
On our test company, we have a problem with reprinting packing slips.<br />
<br />
Generating a new packing slip is not a problem, but as I am customising a packing slip, I want to be able to test my changes without having to generate a new one.<br />
<br />
The packing slips are avaiable and the same situations do not cause a problem in our live company, but when I try to reprint a slip in test company, I get the &quot;no data wiithin selection&quot; error.<br />
<br />
I have heard that this is a setting problem...  Can anyone elaborate and/or provide a solution?<br />
<br />
Cheers:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
In session Maintain Order Steps (tcmcs0139m000), find the record for Print Packing Slips (tdsls4403m000). At the bottom of the form you will see the re-execute sequence. Simply add the numbers of the order steps that come after Print Packing Slip for the order type that you are using and it will allow you to re-print the packing slip when the order is at any of these steps.<br />

<br />
thank you for responding.<br />
<br />
I have found the session to maintain order steps, and can see the re-execute sequence.<br />
<br />
You'll have to forgive, me I am quite new to BaaN...<br />
<br />
I am not sure what you mean by entering the numbers following the packing slip, could you please elaborate?<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dmcgrath</div><div class="date">26th November 2001, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">The numbers (order steps) can be found in Maintain Order Types (tcmcs0142m000). You will need to find the record that corresponds to the order type that you are using, it will then show all the order steps that form the procedure for that specific order type. <br />
<br />
E.g. We have an order type SC7<br />
<br />
The order steps that form the procedure for this order type are:-<br />
<br />
1. 2 Print Picking lists<br />
2. 3 Maintain Deliveries<br />
3. 4 Print Packing Slips<br />
4. 6 Print Sales Invoices<br />
5. 7 Process Delivered Sales Orders<br />
<br />
Therefore in Maintain Order Steps for Print Packing Slips we would add (step) 6 and 7 to the re-execute list to allow us to reprint the Packing Slips when the order is at these order steps in the procedure.<br />
