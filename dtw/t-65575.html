<br />
Am working on Baan IV from 1 month. I need some help from you people regarding the functional flow. The scenario is as follows:<br />
<br />
I have raised a purchase order along with inspection as 'Yes'.<br />
The PO print has been taken.<br />
Maintain receipts activity is done.<br />
The inspection activity is also performed.<br />
<br />
But in the session tdilc1515m000 session. The inventory is in inspection location and also in the blocked inventory field. As the inspection activity is completed, it should be unblocked. But it is not in my case. Is there any other activty that is to be done against this. Please suggest.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Girish</div></div><hr />
