<br />
I want to transfer item from Warehouse to warehouse through a Sales order. All warehouses belongs to us. i need Bill of Lading. The invoice amount will be 0 since its internal transfer. The item cost should move from one warehouse to next.<br />
<br />
Obviously we cant use Inventory Transfer session because we need Bill of Lading. Location control is not implemented.<br />
<br />
Is there a way I can accomplish this?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />

<br />
If only you were in B5, you'd be able to do warehouse transfer and get bill of lading<br />
<br />
That said, using combination of SO and PO with zero price in B4 would work. The sales result and purchase result should cancel out in Baan Finance anyway.<br />

That would allow you to get a bill of lading with out resorting to 0$ orders which could cause you other problems espcecially if you are using average purchase price to calculate your std costs.</div></div><hr />
