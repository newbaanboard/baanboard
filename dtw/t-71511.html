Where do we define Storage Units for an Item.<br />
Inventory units are different from Storage units.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdittmar</div><div class="date">30th November 2018, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Convert Use For Storage (tcmcs1202m000)<br />
<br />
Use this session to convert units from use in storage allowed to use in storage not allowed or vice versa.<br />
<br />
Allowing or not allowing use for storage for units is initially specified in the Units by Unit Set (tcmcs0112m000) session. In the current session, you can change the initial setting.<br />
<br />
This session launches a process that converts the item quantities expressed the in storage unit to the inventory unit. Consequently, all quantities are expressed in the inventory unit, thus avoiding rounding differences between inventory and storage units when the inventory is reduced or increased.<br />
<br />
If this session is started from the Units by Unit Set (tcmcs0112m000) session:<br />
<br />
    The unit and unit set selected in the Units by Unit Set (tcmcs0112m000) session is displayed in the fields of the Selection Range group box.<br />
    The Convert Use For Storage To field is unavailable and displays the conversion option allowed. (If the Storage field is set to No for the selected unit in the Units by Unit Set (tcmcs0112m000) session, the Convert Use For Storage To field in the current session displays the Yes option and vice versa).<br />
<br />
Convert from allowed in storage to not allowed in storage<br />
<br />
If you convert units from use in storage allowed to not allowed, quantities expressed in these units are converted from the storage unit to the inventory unit in:<br />
<br />
    The Item - Inventory Structure (whinr1550m000) session<br />
    Handling units with status In Stock in the Inventory Overview (whinr2510m000) and Handling Units (whwmd5130m000) sessions.<br />
    Open outbound process data, including handling units.<br />
    Not yet processed adjustment order and cycle count order lines.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
<br />
Converting a unit from allowed in storage to not allowed in storage does not affect the inbound process. In the inbound process, you can still receive items in these units after the conversion. In inventory, cycle counting, adjustment, and outbound processes, only units allowed in storage and the inventory unit can be used.<br />
<br />
The following units are an exception to this rule, these units can be used in all Warehousing processes regardless of the allow-for-storage setting:<br />
<br />
    Units defined as inventory units<br />
    Units defined for a packaging level for a fixed package definition in the Package Definition Levels (whwmd4520m000) session.<br />
<br />
Convert from not allowed in storage to allowed in storage<br />
<br />
If you convert units from use in storage not allowed to allowed, quantities expressed in these units in inbound process data are converted to the inventory unit.<br />
How to convert the use-in-storage setting for units<br />
<br />
    Use the fields in the Selection Range group box to specify the unit sets to which the unit to be converted belongs.<br />
    In the Unit field, specify the unit that must be converted.<br />
<br />
    In the Convert Use For Storage To field, select:<br />
        Yes to allow use for storage.<br />
        No to block use for storage.<br />
<br />
    Click Continue.<br />
<br />
    A status dialog box displays the progress of the process.<br />
    When the conversion is completed, a dialog box is displayed. Click OK in the dialog box.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
<br />
    If the unit selected in the Unit field is not present in the unit sets of the selected unit set range, the Continue option is unavailable.<br />
<br />
    The Convert Use For Storage To field displays the conversion option allowed for the selected unit:<br />
        If the unit setting Storage = No applies to all of the unit sets within the selected unit set range, the Convert Use For Storage To field in the current session displays the Yes option, and vice versa.<br />
        If both the Storage = No and Storage = Yes settings are present in the unit set range, you can select either Convert Use For Storage To option.<br />
<br />
