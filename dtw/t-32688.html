<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharmaz</div><div class="date">14th March 2007, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using ERP LN. Does anybody has idea to make requisition flow authorization/approval before it reaches to purchase? I mean to authorize different level of users for approving the requisition. In the current scenario, user can generate the requisition and it comes to purchase. Now the purchase has to scrutinize either to purchase or not. If some process of approving the requisition on the basis of the total amount of requisition is there, then it will be approved by the said authority and sebsequently purchase can procee the requisition.<br />
Any help or more to describe the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skennedy</div><div class="date">15th March 2007, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We have developed a software layer that catches Baan / LN report output and based on data contained within, routes each through it's own approval or revision workflow. User's just print requisitions to a designated print device, which turns it into a requisition &quot;intelligent form&quot;. The software then routes it internally via email to as many approval levels as needed, based on rules defined by you such as dollar amt, department, requestor etc...  <br />
<br />
Long story short, each approving authority sees it as a PDF onscreen with &quot;Approve&quot; and &quot;Revise&quot; buttons. Clicking on &quot;approve&quot; adds their signature, time &amp; date etc... and sends it back into the system until it reaches to top level. After the top level, the approved requisition  can simply be sent to purchasing or optionally, the process of converting it to a PO can be automated. <br />

<br />
We have implemented a requisition approval process in B50b.<br />
The requester can only create a PRQ, print and submit it to the next approver department, which is his own department.  The user's policies are set with DEM and tools, to make sure that he or she cannot approve a PRQ.<br />
The department manager then approves or rejects it.  If the total amount is higher than a certain value, the manager has to approve and submit the PRQ to the financial manager for final approval.  At the end, the requester can convert the PRQ into a purchase order and send this to the supplier.  The only thing is that you need to count on the approvers to make sure that they do not finaly approve a total amount that exceeds their tolerance. <br />
For this, we have defined every department as a purchase office in the departments session.  Via the employees session, the employees are linked to their department.  Then, we entered the departments in the approve list session and also the financial manager as individual approver type.<br />
This works fine.</div></div><hr />
