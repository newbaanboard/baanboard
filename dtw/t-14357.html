For that I opted the table tdinv700. But there are some problems. Pls. provide me the tips so that I can customise the stock ledger.<br />
<br />
1. In case of Pruchase Receipt It carries only Order no./Postion, where as I need Receipt no. for the particular transaction. It is also possible that We might have made many receipts against same P.O.<br />
<br />
2. IN case of Purchase Receipts it makes three or four enteries in the tdinv700 table for the to be inspected PO items.How to pick the right one.<br />
<br />
3. If inspection flag in the PO has been set to 'NO' in that case Only single transaction will be created in the tdinv700.<br />
<br />
Is there any other table I can use to prepare the same like 'tdilc301'</div></div><hr />
