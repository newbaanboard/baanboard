IÂ´m looking for any solution solving folowing situation:<br />
For Production order is as a material used serialized item (lets say speedmeter PN001 to produce display board). <br />
The display board is sent to warehouse and PO1 is closed.<br />
Then PO2 for another (higher) BOM level is created and the display board is used as a component (for examle to build an airframe).<br />
But during testing functions of the airframe the speedmeter PN001 is found defective and must be changed.<br />
How can we send the defective speedmeter PN001 back to warehouse and get new one for PO2?<br />
Note:<br />
We do not fill As-build components in Manufacturing.<br />
Thanks for help</div></div><hr />
