when i try to look at the script....i couldn't understand....the script is too complicated for a beginner like me....<br />
<br />
so can anyone tell me what is the thing that i must check first before running generate outbond advice so it can tun successfully....<br />
<br />
Thanks before...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">2nd January 2008, 07:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally, you just have to make sure the stock is available in the warehouse mentioned in the PBOM. Additionaly the status of the Production order should be Released, Active or Completed in order to do any issues (or receipts for that matter). <br />
<br />
Do you have Lot Control Implemented?<br />
<br />

P.S: Happy New Year to all of you out there!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">2nd January 2008, 13:52</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the answer sukesh...<br />
<br />
i'm not implementing lot control but i implemented location control....so issue for production order must be run from generate outbound advice...<br />
<br />
how can i make sure that the stock is available???? is it only from inventory on hand? how about inventory on order or allocated? and if inventory on hand &lt; allocated at the location(not from item master data...because the quantity is different), can i still generate outbound?<br />
<br />
but still....thanks for your answer sukesh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">2nd January 2008, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">When it comes to the formula to base your checks on, it becomes a bit tricky. I hope others could contribute to this as well...but in my opinion if you were to do only material issues using Generate Outbound session then, its only necessary that the collective allocated figures from production orders remain smaller than the On hand figure of the item in the particular Location (needs to be tested for many locations in one warehouse for an item). The allocated figure is also picked up from  other places such as a sales order as and when the item is mentioned as a Line Item in that order. Therefore the collective allocated figures of all production orders (that are not free or planned or in close stage) should be enough to give you an idea as to what your on hand figure should be before you do a Generate Outbound...<br />
<br />
Again, its my opinion and i hope someone else could second this or give a better suggestion..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">3rd January 2008, 02:19</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm....so basically i need to check if inventory on hand on item's location is bigger than allocated...and also check from planned inventory transaction for further detail about allocated inventory for that item....ok...i'll do this step before generating outbound advice.<br />
<br />
btw...according my senior....the allocated inventory in location is generated outbound advice that havent released yet...is it right? if that so...if there is x allocated quantity when there is no generated outbound advice that havent released yet then i just have to zero-ing the allocated inventory so i can generate outbound advice with no shortage.<br />
pls give me your opinion<br />
<br />
Thanks sukesh75</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your senior could be right on that matter. But then why is there a need to wait to Release once a Generate Outbound Advice is done? The Release session always follows the Generate session in our case. Is there any compelling reason at your end to keep the Outbound from being Released after a Generate Outbound?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">3rd January 2008, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">well...basically to recheck quantity by maintain outbound data so there's no over outbound quantity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">3rd January 2008, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that makes it a bit tricky now, doesnt it?<br />
It means you would have to somehow keep the quantities already booked for releasing from the allocated stock against a item/Location or else (better) complete the checking of Outbound Data (for over outbound quantity) prior to the next Generate Outbound Advice so that the slate is clean...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">7th January 2008, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">yes....every generated outbound advice must be checked....<br />
<br />
Thanks for your opinion sukesh75</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">28th January 2008, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">We need to be clear in the use of the word allocated - the allocated total that you see in inventory is increased each time an order with demand for an item is created.  This is a soft allocation, used mainly for inclusion in requirements planning.<br />
<br />
If you have orders that have a hard allocation step in their order procedure, then that step when executed will reserve stock against that order if it is present and not yet hard allocated.<br />
<br />
When you run Generate Outbound, the system looks at all of the demands, prioritises them and checks against free (not hard allocated) stock.  Each order in turn has stock effectively hard allocated to it until all orders are satisfied or all stock is committed to orders.<br />
<br />
If you are getting outbound shortages when you think there is plenty of stock, then the most likely answer is the one Sukesh suggested early in the thread.  Generate Outbound is trying to allocate to Production Orders from the warehouse quoted in the PBOM while the stock is actually recorded in a different warehouse.<br />
<br />
If that isn't the case, you could check the Outbound Advice to see what orders the stock is being outbounded to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">27th March 2008, 06:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I cannot outbound for production order(shortage problem) 24 pcs, even though there's 29 quantity in inventory, 0 quantity in allocated on the item's location, here's the detail:<br />
<br />
session : Display Inventories by Item/Lot/Warehouse/Location<br />
item code : 23B6016230<br />
warehouse : 010<br />
location: AOS1001<br />
inventory: 29<br />

Inventory: 29<br />
Blocked: 5<br />
On Order: 46<br />

i want to outbound 24 pcs, still get shortage on the result, the allocated quantity on item and warehouse is soft allocation used mainly for inclusion in requirements planning, isn't it right? so why there is shortages?<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me an advice? What should i do to solved this problem?</div></div><hr />

    The item in question, does it have a different inventory and storage unit? <br />

Also, if the inventory is blocked for cycle count or any other reason?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">31st March 2008, 04:38</div></div><div class="posttext">i think there's some mistake in blocked qty in display item and warehouse, because on the location there's no blocked qty for cycle counting or for inspection. and i also had check ilc table tdilc101(inventory data by location and lot) and 401(outbound data), is there any other ilc table that i have to check?<br />
<br />
i had check the script, and the formula to determine the shortage is tdilc101.stks - tdilc101.stkb - tdilc101.stka which is 29 - 0 - 0. Is there any other formula?</div></div><hr />

<br />
by making a new location in the same warehouse and transfer the inventory from old to new location and doing outbound in the new location.<br />
<br />
strange isn't it......<br />
Thanks for all your support guys....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Umesh Mittal</div><div class="date">11th April 2008, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Pl. check the warehouse carefully...<br />
<br />
(1) what is the warehouse of item  (Check in item master data)<br />
(2) Check the inventory of item lying in which warehouse ?<br />
(3) check the warehouse in session &quot;enter material issue for production order&quot;<br />
<br />
AND check allicated inventory<br />
<br />
I am sure that you will found discrepency.... &amp; Please let me know for the same<br />

<br />
As you have mention that allocated qty shown as zero and total inventory is 29 with 5 no blocked first of all approve the 5 number invnentory which is block or check the reason of blocking whether lot is blocked for another reason if so open the lot and then try to outbound.<br />

<br />
the new location that i had created is in the same warehouse with existing location, warehouse in item data, location by item, and enter material issue for production order, so i think the warehouse is not the problem. Also the blocked quantities is already approved.<br />
<br />
i cannot tell about discrepancy, because the item is already release outbound at the new location. but i will follow your suggestion if i encounter the same problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping me.</div></div><hr />
