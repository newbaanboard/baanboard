<br />
<br />
Please help me. <br />
We intend to unshare Sales tables like tdsls040, tdsls041, tdsls045, tdsls050, tdsls051. I know tables like Order types, First Free numbers should also be unshared. <br />
<br />
Are there other tables that need to be unshared aside from the mentioned above?<br />
<br />
thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">11th January 2005, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done this before for a customer who was splitting up companies. I used exchange to move the records from the shared company to the new company and to delete the records from the shared company.  I would run Count Number of Records by table ttaad4222m000 for the shared company and this may highlight additional tables.  Others to consider are sales contracts, sales quotes, EDI sales tables. Also tdsls042, 043, 044, 047, 049, 053.  If you are running location control then the outbound records.  Also tdinv150.  If you have projects there are sales orders connected to projects so these tables must be reviewed.   You might want to run a where used on the order number to check for additional tables.  Obviously if they are not shared there is no problem but check carefully for all shared tables.  Hope this makes sense.  Let me know if I can be of more help.</div></div><hr />
