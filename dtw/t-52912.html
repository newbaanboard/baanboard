<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">3rd July 2008, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been running ERP LN in production for a little over a year without using warehouse location control but due to company reorganization and a major warehouse expansion we now need to turn on location control for one of our warehouses. <br />
<br />
We have been talking to Infor Support and they tell us that to do this the Economic Stock in the warehouse must be Zero, meaning no Inventory, no open Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Warehouse Orders or SFC Production Orders.  We understand that we can’t have any inventory, open receipts or hard allocations but don’t see how we can remove all the  open Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Warehouse Orders or SFC Production Orders.<br />
<br />
If anyone has actually gone back and turned on location control in ERP LN after they were live, we would appreciate any information on how this was accomplished.  What procedural steps did you actually do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">7th July 2008, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the option would be to:<br />
1. Create a new warehouse with location control turned on<br />
2. Transfer the on-hand inventory from old warehouse to new<br />
3. Short close all partial received/delivered orders<br />
4. Create new orders for the partially closed orders<br />
5. Change the warehouse from all the open orders to new warehouse<br />
