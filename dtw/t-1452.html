<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mitch Nelson</div><div class="date">20th March 2002, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on IVC4, but we've imposed numerous customizations on our system.<br />
<br />
We want to automate our credit card authorization procedure so as to avoid shipping a Sales Order for which a credit card has been denied.  As a distributor, we must also accommodate many change-orders and back-orders, so we don't want to bill the credit card as soon as we take the order.<br />
<br />
Of course, there are other factors to consider. But, to avoid a long, complicated e-mail, I'd prefer to simply ask whether anyone has successfully implemented an automated credit card authorization process.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

I have seen a POS system call oricash in which you can use credit cards (fully integrated to baan) and I know that in e-sales you can use credit cards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">21st March 2002, 07:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Typically the credit card gets billed when the goods are shipped and not when the order has been taken. This is an important timing difference.<br />
It would be best if the authorization number of the credit card transaction is linked to the sales order line directly.<br />
<br />
I know that RedKlay has build a solution called WiseB2B that has has credit card functionality already build in there. This is more of a websolution that brings your sales order entry process in BAAN IV on the web by applying the data dictionary of tdsls tables.<br />
<br />
Currently I am looking for a credit card solution for BAAN IV Service.<br />
