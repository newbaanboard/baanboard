We have got an unclear situation with the Delivery Date calculation. <br />
While calculating the Delivery Date using DDQ the system does not take into consideration the whole routing. Accoring to all operations defined in the routing the time required for production should be about 30 days but the system calculates the earliest Delivery Date just one day later, what in fact includes the only one operation which is scheduled in Block Scheduling.<br />
Why it does not take the whole routing into consideration 9in terms fo time)?<br />
The block size is 1 day (24h).<br />
<br />
The program script responsible for this is tdmdm12230. Unfortunately do not have access to this...<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
