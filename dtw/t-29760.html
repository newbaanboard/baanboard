The stock disappears from inventory but you can still see it on the Inventory valuation by using the check boxes &quot;include inventory in transit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Derrick that we do not have anything standard in LN.<br />
<br />
We managed this by customizing a report taking selection as Order type of Transfer manual and those lines shipped from outbound and not yet received in Inbound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">h_baan_ln6</div><div class="date">13th January 2007, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">As suggested by Derrick, ensure inbound activities are not automatic.<br />
<br />
As soon as outbound is done of Transfer Order(manual) inventory will ship from Source Warehouse and would Appeare in Destination Warehouse as On Order and In process inventory (Check whinp tables).<br />
<br />
On making receipt.. this will come as On hand Inventory in Destination W/H. A customized repor can be developed on this basis.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your inputs, i was wondering if there is any standard session to achive the functionality,<br />
Customisation is the last and only option to achive any kind of functionality.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for your feedback;<br />
