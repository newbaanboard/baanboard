Does whinh310/whinh312 (Receipt header/lines) inserts record in tdpur406 (actual receipts) in LN somewhere ? I am looking for that component or it does not do that actually. Infor says standard DLL does that. Is it true ?</div></div><hr />

@Bhushan - I think those dlls dont tell about how whinh310/312 tables insert tdpur406 (actual receipts). We did where used but nothing found yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the call to insert a record in tdpur406 is actually started in whinh312 DAL. This DAL does not of course write directlty to tdpur406. This would be against all the programming rules. It calls instead the function whintdlltdpur.update.receipts() which in turn calls ist opposite function in tdintdlltdpur which call other DLLs. The actual writing of tdpur406 is done by tdpur.dll4112.insert.or.update.actual.receipt().</div></div><hr />
