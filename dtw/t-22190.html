<br />
I am facing a situation where I have to change the lot # for a spesific item to another lot #.<br />
Lets say I have item A, Lot 123, Qty 100.<br />
I want to change this into:<br />
item A, Lot 123, Qty 70<br />
item A, Lot 456, Qty 30<br />
<br />
Anyone knows how to do this? I tried item transfer but didn't work. Thanks<br />
<br />

Ie How did this originate ? From production or purchasing ? Or were the figures entered as adjustments?<br />
<br />
The Inventory Transfer is the transaction can be used to move from one lot number to another. However, you also want to change the quantity. I think you will have to use Inventory Adjustment for this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am afraid we'll have to avoid adjustment for a moment. It has a risk of entering wrong reason code and might end up in the wrong GL account.<br />
<br />
The origin is from production and the status is closed already. Guess you can't reverse that one right.<br />
<br />
Any other idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

U can change lot number by using Production Issue/Production Receipt.<br />
<br />
As in ur case:<br />
&quot;Lets say u have item A, Lot 123, Qty 100.<br />
I want to change this into:<br />
item A, Lot 123, Qty 70<br />
item A, Lot 456, Qty 30 &quot;<br />
  Perform Production Issue of &quot;item A, Lot 123, Qty 30&quot; and again take the Prodution Receipt to &quot;item A, Lot 456, Qty 30&quot;.<br />
<br />
this will work fine in ur case.<br />
<br />
Thanx <br />
Sanjay</div></div><hr />

<br />
With this kinds of error, nothing is truly easy. Any method you use, including production issue-receipt combo (either through Warehousing or Production module), will always result in imbalance in Finance module if your inventory valuation method for the goods in question isn't Fixed Transfer Price. But I guess the Finance guys have to live with that. All the company can do is minimise such errors in the future so that such imbalance will be immaterial in Finance<br />
