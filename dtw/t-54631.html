<br />
We having an issue about decimal point in our invoice.  We have created 6 decimal point for our sales order line but when we print the acknowledgement the system round up the pricing to 4 decimal point.  <br />
<br />
Same thing goes to our invoicing, the system printout the invoice with 4 decimal point although we set the decimal point for invoicing 6 as per sales order price.<br />
<br />
That's is the caused why we having an issues with the decimal point in invoicing.<br />
<br />
We really need the system to print out with 6 decimal point for us to match back with th supplier contract.<br />
<br />
Please advise how for us to overcome the issues.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Did you change only the form field display format or did you update the domain behind that field and the display format on the acknowledgement/invoice reports along with that?<br />

Check the &quot;domains&quot; of both the price &amp; amount and see if both are set to display &amp; accept 6 decimals. Then you may want to check your reports for the usage of any variables (to hold price &amp; amount) in the script of the report and what datatype or how many decimals are used for those variables. I would also check the display formats on both the forms and reports for the price and amount field..<br />
