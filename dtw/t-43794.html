<br />
One of our plants wants to create a cycle counting order for 2 of the 3 warehouses they have ...  <br />
<br />
When they run the session, it does generate counts, but only for the warehouse they didn't want ...<br />
<br />
I there anything special I should be checking on these 2 warehouses that won't create cycle counting orders for ? Perhaps a setting or the way they were set up ?<br />
<br />
This is a fairly new company so it is possible that there may be set up issues or something incorrect.<br />
<br />
It seems odd that running the session wide open will not grab all the warehouses we have in that company...  There is inventory in all of these warehouses.<br />
<br />
Any direction would be appreciated, thanks !<br />

We do all the time and has not faced any issues. There is no set up. All yo</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our other companies capture warehouses fine, so we're thinking there is something different about these warehouses but we're not sure what yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">2nd November 2007, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll list the 3 warehouses ( incl the one that did work )<br />
<br />
Warehouse 300 ( Did not work )<br />
Normal Type, <br />
Nettable = Yes, <br />
Locations = Yes, <br />
multi item locations = Yes <br />
Multi Lot by item locations = yes<br />
<br />
Warehouse 310 ( Did not Work )<br />
Normal Type, <br />
Nettable = no, <br />
Locations = no, <br />
multi item locations = no <br />
Multi Lot by item locations = no<br />
<br />
<br />
Warehouse 410 ( DID Work )<br />
Normal Type, <br />
Nettable = Yes, <br />
Locations = no, <br />
multi item locations = no <br />
Multi Lot by item locations = no<br />
<br />
Not even much of a pattern to correlate the 2 that didn't work with the one that did  :( ...</div></div><hr />
