<br />
i am facing a problem in issuance of a item. I have a item A and have its almost 16kg inventory in warehouse RMA. But when i am issuing this material to production thru session tdilc1120m00 (Enter inventory transaction) using Production Issue then in after selecting the lots to be issued in subsession tdilc1121s000. It is generating message &quot;-ve Inventory not allowed&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have checked the ilc &amp; inv tables for inventory and found no problem with them. then i also checked the Warehose parameter and found no problem in that.<br />
<br />
Can somebody help me where can be the problem and how to rectify it.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
Maybe the lot you want to issue is already allocated for something else. Maybe you should run tdilc0252m000 / tdilc0250m000on forehand to be sure all allocations are correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible that outbounds data has been generated but not released for some of the quantity. If so your production issue+ the outbound quantity is likely to result into negative inventory</div></div><hr />
