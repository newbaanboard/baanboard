<br />
BaaN Vc<br />
----------<br />
<br />
When I enter a Sales order for a customer with country say. eg: Germany, and in the SO Lines I insert 2 lines, I am getting two different country codes in the Form 'Invoicing' of the SO Lines, field tdsls401.ccty for each line. Because of this when I invoice, 2 different invoices are being created for the same Sales Order.<br />
<br />
I have checked the Business partner and the items used as well and everything seems ok. Could there be some Finance implication because of which it could be changing?<br />
<br />
Thanks a heap in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have checked the BP and tax codes by country. Everything is correct but still the problem persists.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You suggest that you check the field Tccom112.cinm that biller is in the role of partner and after check its configuration in the session tcmcs0555m000 Methods of invoicing, here you form if wish one or two invoices for the orders of sale for different concepts (For deliveris, for SO, for codes of Tax)</div></div><hr />

If there was no matching entry in the tax codes by country table, it used another country where that tax code was valid.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is the same as your problem, but its worth a check.<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />
