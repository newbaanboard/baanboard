<br />
There is an item with latest purchase price as 22049.9287. However latest purchase price transaction is as <br />
<br />
qty ordered/received  = 7.5K (1K = 1000)<br />
<br />
Rate in purchase order = 282.48 EURO (1 EURO = 42.6 rup as in purchase order header)<br />
<br />
Is this a bug in BIVc4. <br />
<br />
Is there is any table in finance where it stores all the rates &amp; with purchase quantities.</div></div><hr />
