We might have 25 pieces of item AB1234 on hand and one would be no different than the other.<br />
<br />
Now we are moving towards serial numbers, where each of the 25 pieces AB1234 would have its own unique serial number.<br />
<br />
How do most companies using Baan keep track of which serial number was sold or issued to which customers?<br />
<br />
Lot control?<br />

Currently on Baan 4C4 with Location Control.<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
For one of our divisions we use Lot Control  to record the serial number of every product produced and sold (make to order environment.) <br />
<br />
When each item (spool of wire/rod each with slightly different weight) is produced a unique serial number is generated and a lot is created for this item/serial no.<br />
<br />
When each item is sold specific lots  are selected in the outbound procedure and shipped.   This all works fine and gives us an impecable lot history. <br />
