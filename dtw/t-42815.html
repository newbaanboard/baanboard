If i am understanding correctly , then your question is regarding the difference between normal &amp; cost order type. In normal order  you can select any type of item i.e purchase , manufactured  cost etc. But  if you take order type cost, at the time of entering purchase order lines system will show u only items of type cost or service. Otherwise the  purchase order activities are same for normal &amp; cost order type.<br />
Taking the cost order type is just  for the identification purpose of the keyuser.<br />
<br />
I think i am able to answer your query.<br />

<br />
You have a option to choose wether you want to release it to warehouse or not and hence fastening and giving flexiblity in the process. This option is avialable in item purchase data.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BhushanPatil</div><div class="date">18th October 2007, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noted following things in LN6.1 FP2,<br />
1) There is no Cost type Order, but you start with Normal Purchase Order Type only.<br />
Here you have to choose any item you have to order. You cam choose Cost Type of Items, or Service type of item or Purchased or Manufactured type of items.<br />
2) The Normal Purchase Order has step Release To Warehousing.<br />
3) If in this Purchase Order, you choose Cost Type or Service Type of Item, and Approve it, then the system eliminates the step Release To Warehousing. While processing this order the order is not released in the warehousing.<br />
4) The Service or Cost type of Items are not inventorised, and hence there is no need of it treating in the Warehousing module.<br />
5) The Receipt is maintained in the Purchase Receipt only. And transaction is completed.<br />
