<br />
we would like to use a pro forma invoice before we want to deliver our goods. <br />
<br />
I inserted a new order type (pro forma invoice parameter set to &quot;yes&quot;) with the following order procedure:<br />
-print order acknowledgement (tdsls4401m000)<br />
-print pro forma invoices (tdsls4435m000)<br />
-link advance receipts to pro forma invoices (tfcmg6200m000)<br />
-maintain deliveries (tdsls4120m000)<br />
-print sales invoices (tdsls4404m000)<br />
-process delivered sales orders (tdsls4223m000)<br />
<br />
In our test company, I inserted a new order. After that I printed the order acknowlegdement. This was all going well. At this stage I thought it would be easy to print the pro forma invoice. But this doesnt seem to work. The following message appears &quot;no information within selection&quot;. <br />
What am I doing wrong?</div></div><hr />

You have to call session Maintain Advance Payment Schedules from Sales Order Header zoom sessions. Then you will be able to print proforma invoice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">User33</div><div class="date">16th October 2013, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We can print proforma invoice, but now we have an additional problem:<br />
We run: <br />
- tfcmg6110s000 Maintain Advance Payment Schedules and we could print proforma invoice (Field Advance Invoice is set to 0)<br />
- tdsls4435m000 Print proforma Invoices, set Final proforma Invoices to Yes<br />
<br />
It worked.<br />
<br />
- tfgld1101m000 Maintain transactions + tfcmg2100s010 and entered payment<br />
When we click &quot;Maintain&quot; we got tfcmg2105s000 Assign Unallocated/Advance Receipt to Invoices and the screen was empty.<br />
- finalized Batch with tfgld1110m000<br />
 <br />
- tfcmg6200m000 Link Advance receipts to Proforma invoice<br />
Field Advance Invoice  Number is set to 0, but other fields showed that payment is linked<br />
- after printing tdsls4404m000 Print Sales Invoices, balance is the value of the invoice, and system does not recognise that the invoice was already payes.<br />
<br />
(there is no entry in tfcmg602)<br />
<br />
Do we miss something, or do we do something wrong?<br />
<br />
Thank you for help.<br />
<br />
Best regards!</div></div><hr />
