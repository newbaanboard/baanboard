Question:-<br />
<br />
If I have already a number series with 2 digit first free numbers, what is the implication of changing this to 1 digit numbers in the Maintain First Free number?<br />
<br />
Has anyone made a similar change before? Appreciate if u can share this. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you mean you want to change first free number from 2 digits to 1 digit (like you said in your question) or you want to change the length of series from 2 digits to 1 digit?<br />
<br />
DON'T go ahead changing the first free number from 2 digits to 1 digits like you say in your question (say, your first free number now is 88 and you want to change it to 1), because you can end up with 2 orders having exactly the same order number.<br />
But if you want to change the length of series from 2 digits to 1 digits (ie usually you have 110001,120001, 210001, but now you want to have 100001,200001,300001) then go ahead, no problem it's just the numbering style.<br />
