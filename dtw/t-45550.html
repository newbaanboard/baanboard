<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">max_turrell</div><div class="date">6th December 2007, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully there is a wonderfully simple solution to this one:<br />
<br />
We have implemented Lot Control for our finished goods. Each pack produced receives a unique Lot Code for traceability purposes. When we ship these goods, each pack is given a unique sequence/line in Outbound Advice and the subsequent Shipment. This is not a problem.<br />
<br />
The problem lies in what happens to the Sales Order Line once the related Shipment Line has been confirmed. As part of the confirmation process, a new Sequence Line is created in Sales Order Lines (tdsls401) for each Pack/Lot shipped. This I could understand if the newly created SO Line specified the individual Lot that it was related to - but it does not - instead it specifies a Lot Selection of 'Any'.<br />
<br />
This causes us to have a lot more (no pun intended) data on the system in the guise of the additional SO Lines and also it has a negative impact of our sales reporting abilities. We now have 5 page reports where there used to be 1 and we can no longer simply identify where an additional delivery has taken place or how many. Before we introduced Lots, a simple deduction was that 1 seqn = 1 delivery.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to consolidate the shipped lot qtys against their original order line/seqn?<br />
<br />
Please help....</div></div><hr />

Atleast in Baan IV it behaved differently and I don't see any reason why lot number should equal the delivery sequence. Are you by any chance confirming every lot and then creating back orders etc... (i mean is there a customizatiom done and that may be affecting now?) Are you using barcoding or DDC?<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">max_turrell</div><div class="date">10th December 2007, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply. We are using bar-coding via API's connected to std Baan.<br />
<br />
The only pre-barcoding change we made was to allow overshipping without actually overpicking i.e pick 10 and ship 20. This in itself should not cause this kind of behaviour.<br />
<br />
The confirmation is performed at a global/header level. Albeit the process would still have to confirm each line individually.<br />
<br />
We dont typically have back orders any more as we only confirm what we pick/advise. The picking is based on what packs the operator has physically scanned - so the subsequent Shipment Line should always be accurate as to the qty going out of the door.<br />
<br />
Hope this clears some things up.<br />

Thanks,<br />

Can you test this through normal Baan session? I think in your bar-coding API, you may be confirming after every serial number. So checking standard Baan functionality would be helpful.<br />
