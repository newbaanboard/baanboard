<br />
I have processed a shipment notice in EDI. The values will come in table tdpur400. Only<br />
what can i do with this table?, nothing else will be updated etc. Normally we must process <br />
the shipment notice from tdpur4120m000 if we don't use EDI. Could somebody tell me what to do <br />
with the table tdpur400? I'm using BaaN IV c4.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
never work with that, but it seems that Session tdpur4580m000 &quot;Display Interim Table Dispatch Advice&quot; is not only displaying the data but also processing it in some way.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can check this.<br />

But still i can't process the data. I could see them in the session you give, but could nothing do with it...<br />
<br />
Any idea is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
found out how it works!<br />
<br />
From Session tdpur4120m000 &quot;Maintain Receipts&quot; on field Packing Slip you can zoom to Session tdpur4580s000 &quot;Display Interim Table Dispatch Advice&quot;. In that Session you have the option &quot;[Y] = Transfer Dispatch Advice&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope it`s works for you also!<br />

<br />
yes that's exactly what is happening. We are using this procedure. A disptch note is written into table tdpur400. When maintaining the receipt you can select various dispatch note from the td pur400 table to maintain the receipt a bit faster and easier.<br />
<br />
If you have further questions please post them here.<br />

I'm setting up EDI in Baan IVc4 and have figured out how to transfer dispatch advice. My problem though is that when I create the ASN / Shipping Notice (this is a multicompany setup), I get a seperate packing slip for each line shipped. So in order to use the dispatch advice, I'd need to create a seperate receipt for each PO line. This takes more time than doing a manual receipt.<br />
 <br />
Is there anyway to combine the lines for a single PO onto one packing slip to simplify this process?<br />
 <br />

In the EDI input data, is there a different Packing Slip number for each PO line ? In that case you will have one record per Packing Slip in tdpur4580m000 yes. Perhaps you could run a perl script to amend the EDI input file first before you load it into the EDI module.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">11th July 2007, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer robertvg: yes they are getting different packing slips when I run &quot;Print Packing Slips&quot; in the sales company. <br />
 <br />
Oddly if I create a sales order manually for the same customer and parts, all the lines get the same packing slip number. If I create the sales order through EDI (from an 850 from the purchasing company), I get different packing slip numbers for each line.<br />
 <br />
I haven't had much of a chance to investigate this much further yet. I think there are some fields in the sales order lines (delivery address??) that can trigger different packing slip numbers, so perhaps there is something in the EDI conversion setup for the 850 that I can change to fix this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I do not have much experience with the outgoing DESADV message (Packing Slip), but I know from the outgoing INVOICE that also each order delivered will be get a new invoicenumber. I think this is due to the EDIFACT message format. Even tried to work around this once by making changes in the message setup, but our customers would get problems processing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way: I'm also implementing the incoming Packing Slip message at the moment and I have a different issue: the tdpur400 table contains 3 quantity fields: ordered qty, packing slip qty, and backorder qty. We actually receive only the value of Packing Slip qty.<br />
Suppose I ordered 1500 pcs, but the Packing Slip qty is 20 in the EDI data is 20 pcs. Now when I use this data in tdpur4120m000 (Maintain Receipts) I would expect Maintain Receipts automatically to receive 20 pcs. Instead it just shows the original ordered 1500 pcs as 'To Be Delivered'.<br />
Where did my 20 pcs. go ?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Maybe you have thought of this, but I found there were a couple of ways to enter the packing slip in Maintain Receipts. One worked the way you described. The other worked the way you would expect.<br />
 <br />
If you just type the packing slip number in Maintain Receipts, you see the original order quantity.<br />
 <br />
If you zoom on the packing slip field and choose the packing slip from the list of dispatch advice notes, the packing slip quantity shows what was on the EDI message.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I figured out that it is the delivery address. The incoming 850 (purchase order) is creating a specific delivery address on each sales order line, which then triggers a seperate packing slip.<br />
 <br />
I found that if I deleted the contents of the flat file that holds the addresses (850.7), the sales order was created without specific addresses and I got one packing slip for all lines. <br />
 <br />
So how would I go about making sure the specific addresses are not generated?<br />
 <br />
In our case I am trying to set up mulitsite or intercompany EDI. We will be using external EDI, but we are starting with intercompany. I know I could probably create a seperate version of the 850 message for multisite, but I'd like to keep the setup as simple as possible. I am hoping we can create some customer-specific conversion setup that will fix this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 18:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure about the X12 formats (we use EDIFACT) but in my standard outgoing DESADV/ORDERS conversion setup the address that is send in the message is either the delivery address, or if that is not available then the customer address, or the line-specific address. You will see references to all three addresses in the conversion setup - tccom013 - tccom010 - or tdsls042<br />
Which address is send is controlled by the Evaluation Expressions SCD, SDD and SSD.<br />
You could copy the conversion setup to an extra one, amend the conversion setup (delete some lines or use different evaluation expressions) and then for those customers use that new conversion setup.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your help. That works.<br />
 <br />
For the record, here is what I did:<br />
I copied the existing 850 conversion setup to a new one (850.M)<br />
Since for our intercompany I don't want to bother with delivery addresses at all, I just deleted all the records for level 7 (which 850 is the specific delivery address level of the 850.)<br />
I then attached this to the relation.<br />
 <br />
I only needed to do this for the outgoing 850.  Level 7 is optional, so the incoming process skips over it if it is blank.</div></div><hr />
