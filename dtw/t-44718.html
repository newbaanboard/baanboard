<br />
In this case, if only once you wanted to copy the master from one company to another company in that case you can take the sequential dump of the master table from source company thru session ttaad4226m000 and import the same thru session ttaad4227m000 into the destination company.<br />
<br />
In case if you required to share the table between two companies in that case you have to follow the following steps:<br />
<br />
CASE 1:     If no data present in the table which needs to be shared.<br />
<br />
   1. Go to the session ttaad4120m000 insert the record like company, table and physical company details.<br />
   2. Save the record.<br />
   3. Run CRDD<br />
<br />
CASE 2:    If transaction is available in other company. In this case first you have to verify that there should not be any duplicate records in both the company. If duplicate record is there in that case both the record should have same parameteres (All the fields and its values should be same). After verification you can follow the following steps:<br />
<br />
   1.   Take sequencial dump of table thru session ttaad4226m000 from child company.<br />
   2.   Import dump thru session ttaad4227m000.<br />
   3.   Go to the session ttaad4120m000 and insert the record like company, table and physical company details.<br />
   4. Save the record.<br />
   5. Run CRDD<br />
<br />
this way data will be merged to master company and table of master company will be shared between the company.<br />
<br />
Hope this will solve your problem.<br />

Hmmm...just for my understanding...when did you make new logistic company? is there any transactions happened in new company or its new one? <br />
<br />
Would you like to use previous items in the new company or you want to make it sharing?<br />
<br />

If it is just copying data from one company to another try this.<br />
<br />
Create sequrntial dump for table in the source company. Then create table from sequrntial dump in target company.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DineshSharma</div><div class="date">21st November 2007, 08:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, Ajay,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response. But, we are presently running FOUR PLANTS. Every plants have own data, which was not share with each other.<br />
<br />
Now we like to copy data from company 540 to 541. How it is possible that only these two companies are share the master data.<br />
<br />
we are taking sequential DUMP from Session ttaad4226m000 from company 540, but the dump files names are ****0540.s. There are 260 files create from this sequential Dump. <br />
<br />
When we import these files in co. 541 through session ttaad4227m000, no data was upload in to the new company.<br />
<br />
First of all how we change the Dump files ****0540.s to ****0541.s, because change one by one is a long process.<br />
<br />
Where, we are wrong for importing that data in the new company. <br />
<br />
For your information we are also enter the financial data like Bills in this company from manual process.<br />
<br />
Please suggest what to be done for importing data in the best manner.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Yes, we make many transaction relating to the finance or gld module like manual Bills entered in this company<br />
<br />
Now, we want to copy of master data of the existing Company like 540 to new company eg 541.<br />
<br />
I also take the sequential dump from session ttaad4226m000 but not import this data in the new company.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that sharing of only two companies tables, because we are running four companies except the new one.<br />
<br />
Please suggest how we import this data.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can export 540 item master and import it in 541 company in append mode very well.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind, only importing tiitm001 might not enough because its reference tables like item group/selection code also needs to be import or relevant data should be there in 541 company, otherwise it will be mess.<br />
<br />
You can use ttaad4227m000 session to import the data.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

<br />
When you take a sequential dump baan will create a ASCII file with ppmmmnnn.comp.s.<br />
<br />
If you are going to import the data to different company you should not rename the original file but while importing thru session ttaad4227n000 you can select import to different company and give the company number where you wanted to import the data.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to import only one table then you can give only table number or you can keep only selected tables in the folder.<br />
<br />
Hope this is clear. Please update with the status.<br />

Not understood, you already copied or you want to copy.<br />
<br />
If it is already copied, Do you have any specific criteria to delete all those records? If yes, then you can use ttaad4100 and in Application menu there are all the table level functionalities like export/import and remove rows etc.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
I don't have idea regarding your master data. But in Baan if child data is available in the master you are not allowed to delete the same. At the same time if you delete it thru standard baan session in that case it will check for the referential integrity and this deletion will take time.<br />
<br />
What I can suggest here, before import you can open the sequential dump file (Before this please make a copy of dump file) delete unnecessary transaction using notepad. Here, you must delete only data part and save the same and try to import. In this case it will not take much time.<br />
<br />

I mean to say that the Item master copied from co. 540 to 541. The Data is copied and I want to delete the non-useable data from 541. We are not update the localisation data for items.<br />
<br />
Because, the item master have many those items which are not in use. we want that the item master contain only those items which are used in this company (541).<br />
<br />
Please suggest how it is possible to delte those items from item master which are not using in that plant.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

we wants that these fields are shows zero quantity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dinesh,<br />
You can write an update program for the tables tiitm001, tdinv001, tdilc101, and the ltc table if you are using lots.<br />
You can chose the right fields to update and then run the update program. This should resolve your issue.<br />
<br />

Dear Dinesh,<br />
<br />
As Mr. ajay suggested first identify all the tables linked to item master, and start deleting the unwanted records according to a specific criteria that you have for the lowest level table first &amp; then for the next parent tables using ttaad4100. And finaly the item table.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help u out.<br />
