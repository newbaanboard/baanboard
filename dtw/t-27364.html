<br />
I'm facing very interesting problem related to Sales Return Order.<br />
Problem is <br />
User has maintained a Return Sales Order with the quantity &quot;-1&quot;, after this Order acknowlegement then maintain outbound data.<br />
In the maintain outbound data as the user said she entered &quot;1&quot; instead of putting &quot;-1&quot;( which is not possible in the case of return sales order) by mistake.<br />
I tried to simulate the similar steps at my end but system is not allowing me to enter a positive quantity.<br />
<br />
Is it a BAAN BUG or some other problem...that user has maintained the positive quantity...<br />
Thanks in advance...........</div></div><hr />

Sorry to correct you, but in case of a return sales order the &quot;delivery&quot; takes place by Outbound with negative quantities.<br />
<br />
To come back to the problem:<br />
I know it's possible to outbound more then ordered in case of &quot;normal&quot; sales orders when outbound is created manually. Perhaps Baan forgot to surpress this option in case of a return order?</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
i've no access to my system yet. But as i remember, there is an option (warehouse parameter ?) &gt;&gt; allow negative quantity ? &lt;&lt;.<br />
If this is set to NO, the effect described will appear.<br />
<br />

Negative quantities are impossible when ILC = active (sounds fair: how to have neg.qty's on location level?:confused: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">11th July 2006, 18:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found that the simplest method for sales return orders with ILC is to make the return order type a collect order as well as a return order.<br />
<br />
Then, when you book the order, the maintain outbound line will pop-up immediately the order line is saved.  If you book the stock into the default receipt location for the warehouse, you can then move it wherever you want after that.</div></div><hr />
