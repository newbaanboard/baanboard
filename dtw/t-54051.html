<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aysinerten</div><div class="date">20th October 2008, 09:15</div></div><div class="posttext">We want to change our PUR parameter in order to have the possibility to choose PO Number instead of Supplier Number during the &quot;Maintain Receipt&quot; process.<br />
<br />
We tried this in our test system before informing the enduser but unfortunately not succeeded.<br />
<br />
The problem is, we can not register different PO lines to different packing slip numbers.<br />
I think it is obvious why we need this.<br />
<br />
Attached you will find an example showing the problem.<br />
<br />
It is a little urgent, because the enduser needs to have a solution for this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have any suggestion to solve the situation...</div></div><hr />

    You forgot to attach the example. <br />
Anyways, could you tell us what you have defined in Form2 of Maintain Purchase Order Parameters {tdpur4100m000} for the field &quot;Maintain Receipts by Receipt/Order Number&quot;? If you want to maintain the receipts based on the order number then this field should have Order Number selected. <br />

<br />
An example file is now attached. We are working with the option &quot;Supplier&quot; so far. But now we want to make receipt for a particular Po line.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">20th October 2008, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">With ref to your example: <br />
Two ways to fix that problem.<br />
1) Go to that particular receipt number (283717) and create back orders for all those lines (that's to be received with a new receipt number), thus eliminating their link with that receipt number. <br />
Or <br />
2) Go to the particular receipt number delete those lines (that's to be received with a new receipt number) from that receipt number.<br />
<br />
Both of the above could have been done at the time you received the position no. 6.<br />
<br />
I am not sure of any parameter setting to block all the lines from being associated to the same receipt number at the time of receiving one of the lines. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aysinerten</div><div class="date">20th October 2008, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the answer.<br />
<br />
For both solutions the enduser will have extra work to do. Aim was to make his/her life easier. So, it seems that changing the parameter will not help us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">24th October 2008, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We did a little modification to it where system deletes the receipt lines (for position that is not received) when user exits from the session or try to enter a new receipt. This is a small customization.<br />

We may try to make a similar customization, if we would decide to change the standard vrc at that session.</div></div><hr />
