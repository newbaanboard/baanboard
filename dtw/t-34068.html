Both PO Line and Receipts entry are recorded in table tdpur051-PO Line History. How can we determine which one is realted to tdpur041 and which one is related to tdpur045? <br />
I think Record Type=1 in tdpur051 is related to tdpur041 and Record Type=3 in tdpur051 related to tdpur045. But when I checked some return order record in tdpur051, there are no entry having Record Type=3. So how can we extract Recipts entry from tdpur051?</div></div><hr />

it is not exactly , the Type=1 in tdpur051 are the created lines of PO, the Type=2 cancelled and the Type=3 the invoiced ones. The relation with tdpur041 and tdpur045 is not direct, both tables give data tdpur051. In order to know the receptions you have in tdpur045, verifying the dates of reception.</div></div><hr />

  I see that you are still in the recovering stages. Even if you were successfull at isolating Receipts Entry and Order Line entry, there would be some important information missing... for e.g: Receipt Number. i dont think that gets stored in 51 Table..sorry to be the spoil sport...<br />
<br />
By the way, were you successfull at recovering the tdpur46 table?<br />
<br />

Hi Sukesh,<br />
You are right. Receipt Number is not stored anywhere. Packing Slip No, Receipt Dt are stored in tfacp200. Since I am specially looking for return order,<br />
receipt number = purchase order<br />
packing slip=Empty<br />
tdpur045.date=tdinv700.trdt<br />
<br />
For tdpur046:<br />
We are assuming that for every receipts have only one invoices since it belongs to return order.<br />
 So we assign  <br />
tdpur046.qana = tdpur045.iqan<br />
tdpur046.amtc = tdpur045.iamt<br />
tdpur046.amtb = tdpur045.iamt<br />
 <br />
On the basis of this we are searching record in tfacp200 by matching supplier and order. If no record found then searching record in tfacp200 by matching supplier and amount. If unique matching record found in tfacp200 we assign it to specific fields of tdpur046 otherwise make it empty.<br />
<br />
What do u think abt this logic?</div></div><hr />
