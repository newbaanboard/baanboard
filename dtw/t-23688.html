<br />
Hope someone can assist me. Its been decided all raw.mat purchases only are to go thru QC department. Other purchases(i.e:stationery,furnitures etc..) would bypass and go to warehouse for receiving(i.e: use receipt module)<br />
<br />
We need this job scope maintained for Purch.Dept(i.e: Creation of PO, Printing and Acceptance. Afterwhich , its QC 's turn.<br />
<br />
Currently QC only uses Baan for formula management. How do i best assisgn them the role of receiving the correct items - matching them with correct PO's?<br />
<br />
What is the best way to link Purchasing -&gt; QC -&gt; Warehouse.<br />
<br />
Pls advice<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />
Yours in service<br />

<br />
there is two ways to deal with your problem: One is to use the Quality Management System in Baan and set up order specific inspections. This would allow the QC to enter measurements and / or qualtitative inspection results, block and release incoming materials and do some more QC stuff. It requires quite a bit of set up and overlaps with a specialized QC system. <br />
<br />
The second approach is much easier. Set the 'inspection' flag in Maintain Suppliers form 4 to yes and set the the items to be inspected to 'inspection' = yes (form 3 in Maintain Item Data). Only the combination of both flags set to yes will then force the purchase order position to go through QC. Hence, you can control that stationary does not need to go through QC.<br />

maintain approval (incl. return notes in case of rejections) need to be in</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you veru much for the assistance. I would prefer to take the second approach.<br />
<br />
Could you acknowledge if this is the correct steps:<br />
a) Print Purchase Order          (done by Purc.Dept)<br />
b) Print Goods Receive Notes  ( done by Purc.Dept)<br />
c) Maintain approval              (done by QC )<br />
d) Maintain Receipts              (done by warehouse )<br />
e) Print Purch.Invoices           (done by finance )<br />
f)  Process Delivered Purchase  (done by finance/IT)<br />
<br />
I notice c)  and  d)   have receipt numbers assisgned. Are they the same?<br />
Any changes need to be done on this?<br />
<br />
If we start this beginning of next month, would it effect the previous PO's?<br />
<br />
Pls advice<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />
Yours in service<br />

You do the Maintain Approval using the receipt number from Maintain Receipts.  Maintain Receipts puts the goods in the inspection location in the warehouse where they were received if you are running location control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">15th April 2005, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Usually&quot; (but what is normal) the goods receipt notes are printed at Incoming Goods to have an information doc for QC.<br />
<br />
Further on, when you change an excisting order type, all non-closed orders with the same order type will be updated with the new steps (therefore changes take pretty long, tdpur045 needs to be updated for all present orders)</div></div><hr />
