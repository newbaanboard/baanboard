The reson being we have the situation as follows:<br />
<br />
We create  sales orders for a job(rebuild or repair), also a service order is created and tied to this sales order with the reference field in the service order, after closing the service order I need to receive the item in the sales order back in to the inventory and the finished goods account should be hit with the total cost of the service order. I am bothered about the integration part right now, need to receive the item in the invetory.<br />
<br />
is there a standard baan function like tcmcsdll0100 that i can use?<br />
we are on Baan IVc2.<br />
Thanks<br />
Sant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use stpapi programming to simulate sessions you wish to chain together.  There are many links to the manual on this board - search for stpapi.  Slight learning curve to understand what they are doing, but perfect for this type of action.</div></div><hr />

That is to receive broken item on SO then repair it using is service and then ship it back to customer using SO again? What happens to Invetory valuation of your company? Or do you receive and ship the SO at zero price?<br />
