<br />
Dear All,:) <br />
<br />
Hope someone could help me on this matter.<br />
<br />
As of now, our Baan Sales Order Number for Credit Note is 990450. <br />
We still have abt 9549 to 999999 may be for another 6 months.We might <br />
need to start from 900001 again. <br />
<br />
According to Baan Support ,  we should do &quot;Archieve<br />
and Delete&quot; all orders related to this series first then reset the &quot;First Free number&quot;<br />
<br />
Question is:<br />
<br />
a)where do we access the session for &quot;Archive and Delete&quot; ?<br />
b)is the any setup to be done prior to this procedure?<br />
c)we already have a archive company -&gt;771 , have done transfer of most of the master files into 771 in year 2004<br />
<br />
how will our future reports be shown? will those old details having the previous<br />
credit numbers still be shown?<br />
<br />
Pls kindly advice<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />
Yours in service<br />

  Before you go ahead with Archiving, just consider installing a patch that increases the number of digits from 6 to 8(E.g: 100000 to 10000000). Its there for production order and i dont see why it wont be possible for sales order series as both the data types are the same. If you check some of the threads of November in Manufacturing, you could get information about this patch. <br />
If going ahead with archiving and you have a reporting tool outside baan, you would have to make certain modifications in the report to include data from this archive company. As for Baan default reports, i am not sure whether there is a provision to include data from an archived company as i have not yet done archiving..<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...<br />

  I am not sure why you are still running on SP6 as there are has been a lot of changes brought forth with the applications of these later service packs apart from bug fixes. <br />
With your existing setup, i am not really sure whether you would have a successfull archiving done. The whole archiving process might have been updated in any of these later service packs..<br />
<br />
So i suggest you start looking into this matter..<br />
