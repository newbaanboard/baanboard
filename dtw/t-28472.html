<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rka_72</div><div class="date">20th October 2006, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
There is a PO for which an item is received (receipt confirmed) after that an the inbound advice was generated.<br />
The next step was to generate the storage list (whinh3415m000) and once done that the next step was to confirm the storage list for put away through the session whinh2515m100 (Storage list).<br />
While trying to put away qty in this storage list, following error is reported: -<br />
(Putting away this would take the item from RECEIVING LOCATION to the INSPECTION LOCATION as QMS is also implemented.)<br />
<br />
******Inventory allocated (Inv unit) can not be greater than the Inv on hand (Inv unit).******<br />
<br />
When I checked the inventory of the item in the particular warehouse at the REC location(whinr1542m000), it shows the inventory qty blocked, on hand. There is nothing in allocated inv or inv on order.<br />
<br />
Also, there is no inspection order as of now, lot is not blocked, location is not blocked and item is also not blocked. There is no cycle counting order also which might have blocked the inventory.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me find out and crack the problem?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
rka</div></div><hr />

Then only your inventory can be put away into your warehouse.<br />
