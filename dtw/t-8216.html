<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChrisV</div><div class="date">23rd December 2002, 23:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here's the scenario.  We have an in-house web order entry system we're using for internal sales reps.  Our Baan admin customized a couple sessions for writing the sales order data into the correct Baan tables, as well as generating the outbound advice.  We are, however, encountering a few problems with that system.  <br />
<br />
A suggested solution was brought up to use the existing EDI functionality of Baan for use with this web order entry system.  (fyi, I am not the Baan admin, I work the EDI side of things).  I think this could work, however, our current 850 conversion setup is working just fine, and I have no desire to make modifications to it that would result in having to tweak the translation mappings in our EDI system. <br />
<br />
My question is, how difficult/what steps are involved in creating a custom 850 sub-type...say an 850W conversion setup in Baan that would allow for importing data specific to the web-entry system (pricebooks, delivery codes, order type, series, etc)?  Can I just create a new inbound messge, or copy the existing 850 with a new name and make modifications to it?  Or would I have to create the new message and build the conversion setup from scratch?<br />
<br />
Thanks...<br />

<br />
You can copy the 850 message to a new EDI message and alter the conversion setup to reflect the fields you want to read into BAAN. This is pretty straightforward.<br />
<br />
However, you will also need to create a DLL to utilize this new conversion setup - this is how BAAN reads information from the ASCII file into the BAAN DB.<br />
<br />
You would be best to base the new DLL on the current standard 850 (in) DLL - tdslsdll4280.<br />
