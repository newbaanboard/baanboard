<br />
I am using Baan IVC. An interesting problem occured the other day.<br />
A range of sales orders were selected to print the sales invoice. One of the invoice got printed 2 times with the same packing slip and order no. On verifying the tdsls045 and 051 table there was only one invoice no. updated against the sales order. One of the invoice no. was skipped. But physically 2 invoices were printed. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to resolve this ? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
