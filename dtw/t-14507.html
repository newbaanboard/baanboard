<br />
I have a requirement to have a system checking for credit limit at the time the goods is delivered. So that, when the credit limit is exceeded the shipment cannot be delivered.<br />
<br />
In standard baan application, credit limit is checked when we create a sales order and it will block the sales order if the credit limit exceed.<br />
<br />
Do you have any solution of my problems<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />
Harley</div></div><hr />

<br />
To block orders if customers exceed the credit limits go to Sls parameters and set the &quot;block if customer exceeds credit limit&quot; option (form 2 - i think), to YES, as well also ensure that you do not have any customers with a credit limit of 0,. as this = unlimited credit limit in Baan.  <br />
<br />
For ongoing reporting, you can also run a report &quot; Print Credit Comparison&quot; in AR / Open Entries / Reports.  This sesssion shows you all the customers open balances, Invoiced Amount, and amounts exceeding credit limits.  <br />
<br />
Another good feature for collections is Reminder Diary.<br />
<br />
Best wishes</div></div><hr />

<br />
On form 2 of maintain Sales Order Types you can specify the step at which a sales order should be blocked. Thus even though the sales order says 'blocked' when entering the sales order, you can execute sales order steps upto the step specified in form 2. Since you want to block it at mainatain deliveries status, Baan will aloow you to execute Print Sales Orders and Print Picking list steps Therefater maiantain deliveries can be done only after sales orders is unblocked<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you require any further details</div></div><hr />
