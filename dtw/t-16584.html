<br />
Firstly, you must perform gap analysis whether the lot control functionality available in BaanIV fulfills your company's need or otherwise. After getting the goods properly labelled ready for lot control, and getting the company ready for lot control (these are all the hardest part), then all you have to do in BaanIV is run tdltc0130m000, Convert non-lot item to lot item <br />

Is there a way to change this field without removing all stock and allocations?<br />
<br />
It could be that my version of the session has been customized, does the standard version change this field?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know, Outboundprio can be set indepedend of lot-controlled yes/no. The only difference is, that tracing can be executed more detailled, because also on date-level AND Lot-level.<br />
<br />
Good luck  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">1st September 2005, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a session n Baan IVb4 to modify the outbound priority of an item / group of items. You can find this under<br />
Location control --&gt; Inventory Locations --&gt; Miscellaneous --&gt; Maintain outbound system by item.<br />
<br />
Standard Baan allows us to change the location system by item just as it allows changing from lot to non-lot and vice-versa.</div></div><hr />
