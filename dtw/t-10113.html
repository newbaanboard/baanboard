<br />
We had an offsite warehouse which we dont want to use anymore. all the inventory is removed and locations blocked. <br />
but since Baan does not allow us to block receipt locations, there is always a possibility of users accidently using these warehouse. <br />
<br />
Also  there are quite a few rpl orders open which we will not deliver. deleting the warehouses is not an option because we need the history. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions how to tackle this ?<br />
( we tried training the users but still they keep sending inventory to that warehouse)</div></div><hr />
