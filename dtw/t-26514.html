<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">2nd March 2006, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Below you find 5 situations and their solutions in SSA ERP LN.<br />
<br />
1. Order amount is correct and invoice amount is also correct.<br />
Invoice can be entered in session &#8220;Purchase Invoices (tfgld1110s000)&#8221; via session Transactions (tfgld1101m000)&#8221;. Invoice can be related to the order and matched, approved and paid without price differences.<br />
<br />
2. Order amount is not correct but invoice amount is correct.<br />
3 ways to solve this.<br />
<br />
a. Before receipt the purchase order line can be changed and after that situation 1 shows up.<br />
<br />
b. After receipt and before matching the invoice, the order line can be changed in session &#8220;Change Price and Discounts after Receipt (tdpur4122m000)&#8221;. A price difference is booked in the integration transactions and the order amount in ACP is adjusted. During matching the invoice, no price difference exists anymore and the invoice can be approved and paid.<br />
<br />
c. As alternative to b. the user can also solve the problem within the match process. In session Match Purchase Order / Receipt Lines mark the order line. Via specific menu go to session Match Invoice to Order Line / Receipt, change the amount to be matched and create a price difference in this way. The invoice can be approved and the price difference is booked in the integration transactions and the invoice can be paid.<br />
<br />
3. Order amount is correct but invoice amount is not correct.<br />
The supplier made an error but you as user did determine the right order amount. You ask the supplier to sent a credit invoice.<br />
<br />
a. Wait for the credit invoice. When the credit invoice arrives, link the credit invoice to the invoice. In this way the invoice amount of the invoice is changed to the correct amount and situation 1 shows up. <br />
<br />
Note that the credit invoice amount is reset to 0 after linking to the invoice. Invoice and credit invoice can be approved separately. <br />
<br />
b. For some reason (f.e. payment is required) you cannot wait for the credit invoice. Match the invoice to the order line. Create a price difference via specific menu option Match Invoice to Order Line / Receipt. Approve the invoice and payment can start.<br />
<br />
When the credit invoice arrives enter the credit invoice and go to session &#8220;Match Purchase Order Lines / Receipts (tfacp2541m000) or (tfacp2544m000)&#8221;. Because the order line is already completely matched to the original invoice, the order line will not be shown. Via the specific menu show the completely matched order lines. Via specific menu option Match Invoice to Order Line / Receipt a quantity of 0 and a negative amount must be filled. The credit invoice can be approved and after that the credit invoice can be linked to the original invoice.<br />
<br />
Note that the original invoice can also be unapproved and unmatched. After that the credit invoice can be linked and situation 3a can be followed.<br />
<br />
4. Order amount is not correct and invoice amount is also not correct.<br />
Use a combination of the solutions described in situation 2 and 3 to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
5. Order line already processed<br />
Original invoice is matched and approved. Price difference is created. The purchase order line is processed. After that a credit invoice is received.<br />
<br />
In this situation the credit invoice of the supplier cannot be related anymore to the original purchase order. The corrections amount cannot be booked to the inventory and average purchase price. The amount of the credit invoice must be booked as costs. If this situation occurs frequently it is advised to be more careful in running session &#8220;Process Purchase Orders (tdpur4223m000)&#8221;.</div></div><hr />
