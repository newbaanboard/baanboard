<br />
we want to add additional order costs for certain salesorders. The additional costs should be based on the total net order amount (in our case: 0,15% of the net order amount).<br />
What we did is: create a cost item, maintain a cost set, assign the item to the cost set (upper limit 999999,0000 lower limit 0,0000). Afterwards the cost set is assigned to a certain sales price list. The cost item is added to the sales price list (Maintain Prices by Pricelist and Item; Parameter Grade by Amount). The discount is set to -0,15%.<br />
Despite our efforts the additional costs are never added to any salesorder. WhatÂ’s going wrong? Bug or feature? Note: we are running on BaanIVc4 SP 8<br />

<br />
without having a Baan system right now accessible - I think there is a paramter (Salses order parameters) indicating if these additional costs have to be added - did you set this correctly?<br />
<br />

<br />
I suppose the parameters are set correctly. The funny thing is: when the sales price in the item data (of the certain cost item) is &gt; Zero the additional costs are added to the sales order. But the amount is equal to the sales price in the item data. That's not the way it should work. We would like to have an additional (negative) discount to the order.<br />

<br />
Some months ago we also had a problem with cost items. We found out that Baan has changed the functionality without documenting this (also internally it is not documented).<br />
<br />
Please check session tdsls4128m000 'Maintain Items by Cost Set'. <br />
If the Units for prices and Limits are the same dry to change one of them. If they are the same no cost item will be added to the sales order.</div></div><hr />
