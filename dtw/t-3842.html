<br />
Because weve used so many of the available 99.999 order numbers in Inventory Transactions, and havent started archiving yet, we are looking for an alternative method to move these items.<br />
<br />
Anybody got a proposal? Were on BaaN 4c4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">16th May 2002, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I see you have to move a lot of items.<br />
<br />
Why not Replenishment orders? It is a lot of work but... Are you looking for a non standard BaaN session? In this case I cannot suggest you anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">16th May 2002, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">you can re-set the first free number back to 1, and continue with the inverntory transfers - because the date along with the order number makes the record unique.  So you can have order number 100 but with differentt dates to make the records unique.</div></div><hr />

Another opportunity maybe cycle counting orders. When we migrated from our old ERP-System to Baan we used cycle counting orders to initialize the inventory for all our items. The data (itemcode and inventory) where imported via Exchange into table tdinv120.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dmcgrath</div><div class="date">16th May 2002, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Using Replenishment Orders you'd need to set up a Direct Inventory Transfer order type - this acts much like a normal inventory transfer. The added bonus is that you can perform multiple transfers for each Replenishment Order.</div></div><hr />

If you do I know someone who wrote an inventory initialization routine that worked with the cycle counting orders.  This would allow the user input the inventory and location and the system would update it as new.  Let me know if you would like more information.</div></div><hr />
