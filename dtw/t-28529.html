For which date you are performing the inventory valuation. In case you are calculating for the date previous to the date of first SCP calculation,, it is going to show error.<br />

<br />
Can you please check in ticpr200 &amp; tiitm001.<br />
I am unable to understand how data from ticpr300 had been deleted. <br />
<br />
If the same is the case you have to take help of GTM log to find out who had deleted and then insert record manually.<br />

Create a test company and restore the table from the dumps and create the entries in the live company which are missing in ticpr300. Check out who all are having access to sessions like ticpr2260m000, tdinv7210m000, tdinv7250m000,  tdinv7260m000 and tdilc3211m000(if ILC is implemented). Take these off from user menus so that you wont face any more missing data problems...<br />

It is advisable that u check the GTM Logs to trace and if no data is found there then insert the records manually.</div></div><hr />

for 2 years and there was no change in cost price in the past 2 years or you didn't calculate the cost price for the past 2 years for an item. Now when you calculate CPR and the calculated price is different from the previous one, system will update the cost price as well as delete the old cost price since it has crossed 2 years. What you are left with is only the latest <br />
cost price. <br />
<br />
You can also look at the old sales orders/purchase orders(tdsls041/tdpur041) to get the std. cost price at that time of purchase/sales for inserting them into ticpr300.<br />
