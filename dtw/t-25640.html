<br />
we entered a purchase order with order type &quot;return&quot; for a lot controlled item.<br />
When doing the negative receipt in tdilc4113s000 we get the message &quot;Available Inventory = 0 pcs&quot; although enough inventory is available.<br />
<br />
For normal items the process is working fine.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what could be the problem? A parameter setting?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
We are on BaanIV, Service Pack 18<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
In BaaN 5c you must allocate it like an sales order! Do not know if 4c is same<br />
Hope helps Jero</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanguyz</div><div class="date">24th November 2005, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Please read the below details for your solution:<br />
<br />
Purchase Retrun Order Made for Item X with -1.00 qty from warehouse WRH which has location REC (receipt location) and INSP (inspection location)<br />
<br />
so to have the purchase order fully processed you need to have the inventory in receipt location i.e. here REC<br />
<br />
In warehouse it may be showing that the inventory is 100 but if the inventory in location REC is 0.00 then no receipts would be possible for Purchase Return.<br />
<br />
Firstly transfer the inventory to REC and then start processing.<br />
<br />
Hope this resolves your problem.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
BG</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your replies.<br />
<br />
We already tried to transfer the inventory to receipt location but we get the same error message.<br />
<br />
In the meanwhile we entered a sales order like Jero suggested. It solved our problem for this time but normally this is not the way we want to proceed.<br />
<br />
Is it in general not possible to return lot controlled items?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayant Keskar</div><div class="date">1st December 2005, 09:49</div></div><div class="posttext">In a location controlled warehouse it is necessary that for purchase return inventory should be available at the receipt location. If you are getting the message the inventory is not vaialble even at the time of inventory transfer it means that you have already consumed the inventory of that lot. In this case the only solution is to adjust the inventory from an existing lot and transferring it to the lot which you wish to return</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mjones</div><div class="date">9th December 2005, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Another problem could be, that is if the lot controlled part &quot;is&quot; in inventory, you have a hard allocation against it.  This could be Outbound advice or Inbound advice.</div></div><hr />
