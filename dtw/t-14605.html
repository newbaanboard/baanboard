             qty    amnt    qty     amnt      qty     amnt  qty     amnt<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Item A   100   1000     30     300        50      500    80      800 <br />
<br />
From which tables I can get those information in order to create that report?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harley</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I agree with you, in that table contains all transactions.<br />
<br />
But how to get the information of the beginning stock &amp; the value?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We have to report opening and closing stock and detailed transaction per item for every month to customs because of bonded warehouses. The report is roughly based on tdilc301. The only way we could realize this without drastic performance loss was to save the closing stock at the end of every month in an extra table, otherwise you have to go through all transactions since the start of your system when you print the report.<br />
<br />
Another possible way to do it would be to define the item as dimension in Finance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">27th February 2004, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">With respect B40c4 , one can also use tdltc102 if he/she requires lot level information or even tdinv700 if one requires information at the warehouse level only besides tdilc301. <br />
<br />
We also have done this using tdilc301. Robert is right in saying that if you do not have periodic balances stored in a table , this report can be very slow for backdated reports . The older the from date ,the slower the report.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harley</div><div class="date">1st March 2004, 04:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately I am not in Baan IV, so I don't have table tdilc301. What is the information contained in that table?<br />
<br />
At this point, I can produce the report by using table whinr110 but all of information is in qty. In that table there is whinr110.stoc (qty after transaction), so from this information the opening stock in qty I can get easily.<br />
<br />
Now, I am trying to combine this table with whinr112, whinr113 to get the value, so far I can get the value of in and out transaction. But to get the opening value, it's quite difficult.<br />
<br />
For Hitesh and Robert,<br />
<br />
I am just thinking with you way by creating an extra table, how do you export the closing stock? do you create a new session to run this procedure?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">1st March 2004, 07:48</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan IV  tdinv700 has the stock after transaction (tdinv700.stoc) . This one can use if one is to get the inventory report at the warehouse level only. <br />
<br />
We need the report at the warehouse/location level . And tdilc301 is a table same as tdinv700 at the warehouse /location level (one level deeper) .  However it does not have a field like tdinv700.stoc ie stock after inventory transaction. Further there were lots of bugs earlier in Baan standard in updating tdinv700.stoc which according to me should have been corrected by now. <br />
<br />
So the our report mechanism works like this . It gets the current closing balance from tdilc101 . And then it calculates the opening balance as on 'from date' in the report . Normally this report is run at the day end to verify the stock of precious items. So no performance issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have indeed an extra session that fills the custom table with closing stock qty/values. The report has to be run every month not to long after end of that month. It takes the closing stock of previous month from the extra table, adds all transactions of the reporting month (tdilc301 = inventory transactions (history) by lot/location) to calculate closing balance for the reporting month and writes those values to the extra table.<br />
