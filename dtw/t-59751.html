<br />
- Create an Adjustment Order<br />
- Add Adjustment Order Lines<br />
- If the item is serialized you will be prompted for a serial number<br />
- Process the Adjustment Order<br />
<br />
If you have thousands of balances to load and you have an excel or text file with the initial balances, you could:<br />
<br />
- Manually add an Adjustment Order<br />
- Use Exchange to populate the following tables:<br />
    - Adjustment Order Lines (whinh521)<br />
    - Adjustment Order Lines Lots and Serials (whinh526)<br />
- Then manually process the Adjustment Order<br />
<br />
If you decide to use Exchange, attached are the entity relationships that you would need to consider.<br />
