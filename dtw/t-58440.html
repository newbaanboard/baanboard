<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">preethi</div><div class="date">18th May 2010, 05:29</div></div><div class="posttext">1. after &quot; Maintain receipts&quot; is done for the items received, the warehouse defined in &quot; Maintain standard items&quot; will be updated for inventory<br />
<br />
Ex: wrh defined in Maitain Standard items&quot; is WRH aganist item xxxx. Once &quot; Maintain receipts&quot; is done for 'xxxx' the inventory aganist the item in warehouse WRH will be updated..<br />
<br />
3. Without  running the session &quot;maitain receipts&quot; can i do Inventory transfer using &quot; Inventory transaction&quot; session ( inventory is 0).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">18th May 2010, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Yes, after maintain receipt is done, it should update the inventory in destination warehouse (not item master warehouse).<br />
3. Replenishment order can be configured in numerous way.If you want short process then maintain deliveries and process delievred rpl orders are the only two steps. In this process one cannot use transit warehouse. One can always usr &quot;Inventory transfer using the inventory transaction session. The inventory (free inv) in source warehouse needs to be more than zero. If the inventory in source warehouse is zero then one cannot do transfer.<br />
<br />
What is the reasoning behind to transfer when invenotry is zero?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

i still hav some doubt..if the inventory is transfered to other warehouses(other than transit), is it possible to use the replenishment orders..<br />
<br />
wat abt the Inventory transfer in customized items case (can i use the sessions in tdilc)</div></div><hr />

The replensihment order purpose is to transfer the inventory between warehouses. The use of transit warehouse is optional. And transit warehouse is used only for storing inventory in transit. <br />
<br />
You can also use the tdilc session. Both will do teh transfer, but the process and purpose is different. The replenishment order is more like a order flow, where once an order is genrated it can be picked, packing slip can be printed and then invenotry can be received at other warehouse. While the tdilc session is to do q quick transfer, there is no documents and paper flow in this.<br />
