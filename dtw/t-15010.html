This is how you do it:<br />
<br />
Cross Docking<br />
<br />
1)	Base Data Set up<br />
a)	Make sure that the sales order type that you are going to use has the allow purchase orders box ticked. This is on the second tab.<br />
b)	Make sure that against the item, both the sales and purchase data have the default warehouse set to a location controlled warehouse.<br />
c)	Make sure that the items purchased data specifies the buy from business partner.<br />
d)	Make sure there is no stock against your item (so that it will ask when entering the sales order where the stock is coming from).<br />
<br />
2)	The back-to-back process<br />
a)	Use the sales order type referred to in 1a above.<br />
b)	When entering the sales order line, select the generate purchase advice option from the menu that pops-up.<br />
c)	Confirm and transfer the purchase advice which will result in a real purchase order. These options can be found under Warehousing / Inventory Analysis / Order Advice<br />
d)	Release the SALES order to warehousing.<br />
e)	Release the PURCHASE order to warehousing<br />
f)	In warehousing / inbound / receipting, receive in the purchase order<br />
g)	Generate the inbound advice and complete any other steps required to put away the stock. Notice, instead of going into the bulk / pick locations the stock has gone into the staging location.<br />
h)	Go into warehousing / outbound / shipments and notice that a shipment for the sales order has been created without the need for generate outbound, release outbound etc.<br />
i)	Confirming the shipment results in the stock being issued from the staging location.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />
