<br />
I am working in a company using baan. <br />
<br />
The issue that I face is when i want to see what dispatches are made to the customer each day. <br />
<br />
e.g. order # SKU  OrderedQty PendingQty<br />
       111      xx      1000          1000<br />
<br />
If this order is delivered in 2 dispatches on different days, I am told that this data is not available in baan. <br />
<br />
So as a result, the order will be represented as only 1 line in the system with the pending quantity as 0. Plus the data on when each dispatch was made is also not available. <br />
<br />
We are using business objects to extract this data from baan and i am told that the data is not available in baan therefore i cant see in business objects. <br />
<br />
I just want to know the following:<br />
1. If this is true or not. How are order dispatches normally mapped in baan. I think this is a fairly standard requirement and would be the same for all companies. <br />
2. Is this mistake because of baan or because of the company having customized the software in an incorrect way. <br />
3. Can the functionality that I have asked for be added and how. What might be the implications of this change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan keeps the record for each delivery in the table tdsls045. If there is a partial delivery of a sales order it keeps the record for each individual lines in the sales deliveries table with delivered quantity &amp; dates.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,</div></div><hr />
