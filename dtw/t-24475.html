Is there somebody in the Baanworld who's working with SSCC / UCC.EAN 128 Labels (http://www.ean-int.org/) ? We have strong demands from large US retailers and are looking for a solution to provide the required data out of the Baan system. We do not run ILC or PCF, just standard items. Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

Are you refferring to Standard Shipping container label. We do generate the label from our shipping system, which is integrated to Baan. I am not sure what kind of shipping system you have. Othewrise you will need to do some system modification and run it through some barcode generated system.<br />

Yes, I think there are several descriptions (SSCC, UCC128 ..) meaning the same thing.<br />
I am not sure what kind of shipping system you have<br />
None. That's the point :) . I'm looking for a solution (report or session) which generates the required data from the standard Baan tables. This labels seem to be pretty common in the US and I'm wondering why there is no standard solution in a highly recommended ERP software. A small add-on would be applicable also.<br />
After years of consolidating scattered software systems into an integrative, company wide solution called &quot;Baan&quot;  ;) we are not in favor of turning this efforts up side down.<br />

You may have to generate that label yourself. It is not difficult to generate the label. All the data is in the system. Since, I don't know your process I cannot comment on it. At our place we assigned SSCC label for every carton that is shipped from our warehouse. We also capture the content of every carton. If your requirement is similar then, you must be aware Baan doesn't capture this kind of information in system. It will need to customize or you can intergrate with packing and shipping system. In our case SSCC label is generated out of packing system and then that information is later on uploaded in Baan for visiblity to customer service as well as our B2B site. If you want to discuss it further you can email me at apatil@bogen.com<br />
