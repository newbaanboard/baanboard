<br />
May I ask your help with endorsing below Enhancement request for Sales Order Delete/Cancel ? <br />
<br />
e would like to delete/cancel sales order automatically if it has not shipped or doing any process on them for a month for example.<br />
<br />
We have opened Incident related with that( 15256914 ).<br />
<br />
The Infor have offered Delete Sales Orders (tdsls4224m000) session. But we want to delete unprocessed sales orders. I mean not used or does not have any outbound warehouse process.We can use &quot;Delete Canceled Lines&quot; and &quot;Delete Orders without Lines&quot; options in the but if sales order have &quot;Free&quot;,&quot;Approved&quot;,&quot;In Process&quot;, &quot;Modified&quot; status, the session will not delete the orders. Even if they has not been processed in any way.<br />
<br />
In this session the options related the status ( &quot;Free&quot;,&quot;Approved&quot;,&quot;In Process&quot;, &quot;Modified&quot;) can be added. Then the session will be more suitable and usable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please check out the details of the enhancement request and endorse it if you also find it useful.<br />
