We have four Plants. FY yr 2005-06, we used the invoice series for plant 1,2,3,4 is 10,20,30,40 respectively. In the Current Year our series is 20, 40, 50, 75 for plants 1,2,3,&amp; 4 respectively.<br />
<br />
Now, our problem is when we received payment from our customer in the txt file. When we upload this file in our baan system, the system is ignor the matched invoices from last years and balance is processed.<br />
<br />
How we take the exect steps for this problem, so we upload the all payments.<br />
<br />
Please suggest asap. Thanks in advance.<br />

I think the better way was to get the year, plant from the invoice number, since I don't know how ur program is written, can't comment. <br />
