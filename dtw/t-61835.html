I just have a general question relating to inventory reporting. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if an Excess and Obsolete Inventory report or something similar exists in LN FP7? <br />
<br />
We had to build one in Baan IV, but Iw as trying to avoid doing that in LN.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />

But for excess inventoy there is no LN report as the definition is always diffferent by company. So you need to create one ...</div></div><hr />

Could you inform the transaction code for obsolete items? I know there is this report in Baan, however, I did not use Baan since 2001 and don't remember... <br />
<br />
Please , help me!</div></div><hr />

This is not quite correct; the slow moving report is based on a turnover rate rather than an absolute age.  The parameters set up determine for turnover rate bands how much of the existing stock value should be considered slow moving.</div></div><hr />
