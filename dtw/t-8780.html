<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">savitr</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">i want to add additional cost automatically to PO<br />
i defined a cost set next i attached a supplier with the cost set and then cost item with cost set(Price unit?)<br />
when i transfer the order through MRP this items gets attached at the last line no in PO but the ordered QTY and price remains zero the amount appears that i defined in supplier by item Price File.<br />
I want it to calculate based on the qty/amount transferred from MRP which is different based on requirement generated by MRP.<br />
I want it to be proportionate to amount/qty.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

Thanks for the reply<br />
when the &quot;unit for prices&quot; is purchase unit in the session &quot;Maintain item by cost set&quot; and supplier prices by item is maintained for the cost item item. the line which comes in the purchase order thru MRP transfer is the amount that i maintained in the above session. I want to add cost proportionate to the qty which is being transferred thru MRP not fixed additional cost.<br />
The case is i want the other charges which is freight cost and is based on some percentage of the basic price to be added autmatically thru MRP transfer. I donot like this additional cost to be included in Basic Price<br />

Good luck anyway!<br />
