<br />
When you duplicate a sales order line which has BOM components it takes the component list from the List Item. <br />
In other words if you change some of the components in the BOM of first order line and duplicate it, the system wonâ€™t copy the modified BOM, instead it takes the original BOM from list components.<br />
<br />
Is there a particular logic behind this? I think the correct functionality should copy the modified components. <br />
<br />
Appreciate your expert thoughts on this. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rohan Kumar</div><div class="date">8th October 2012, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">When we copy a sales order with modified BOM components, the new sales order takes the components from the list item only and this is standard functionality. With the copy template it can be determined which sales order (line) fields are defaulted again and which are taken from the original order. However for dependent fields, like the BOM, this is not possible. After the line is copied, the BOM is defaulted again from the list item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rohan Kumar</div><div class="date">8th October 2012, 22:31</div></div><div class="posttext">To circumvent this problem, you can use the following workaround :<br />
<br />
Suppose we have an item say ITEM_LIST1 and a standard BOM is defined for this item.<br />
<br />
In the BOM suppose we have four component items say COMP-1,COMP-2,COMP-3 &amp; COMP-4.<br />
<br />
Suppose to certain number of Customers (SOLD-TO BP) we send only 3 components, Ex : COMP-1,COMP-2,COMP-4.<br />
<br />
The COMP-3 is not delivered to this SOLD-TO BP group, which we manage by deleting the component items (COMP-3 in this case) in the sales order.<br />
<br />
In such scenario we can define new item-codes and their BOM as mentioned below:<br />
<br />
<br />
(ITEM CODE)      (SOLD-TO BP GROUP)          BOM (COMPONENT ITEMS)<br />
=========       ================          ========================<br />
<br />
ITEM_LIST1       (GROUP-A)                              (COMP-1,COMP-2,COMP-3,COMP-4)<br />
<br />
ITEM_LIST2       (GROUP-B)                              (COMP-1,COMP-2,COMP-4)<br />
<br />
ITEM_LIST3       (GROUP-C)                              (COMP-1,COMP-2,COMP-3)<br />
<br />
Though we will have to define few extra items &amp; their BOM in this case but doing this setup is just one-time activity. Users have the benefit that they don't need to modify the BOM components in the sales order line once they select the correct list item.</div></div><hr />
