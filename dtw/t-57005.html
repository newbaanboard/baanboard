We are currently implementing ERP LN6.1 FP5. <br />
<br />
We have a warehouse that is of the type &quot;Consigment (owned)&quot;. <br />
I know that using sales orders with an order type having the flag &quot;Consigment replenishment&quot; set are used to create warehouse orders of the origin sales and type transfer to issue material to the consigment warehouse. <br />
I also know that sales orders are with an order type having the flag &quot;Consigment invoicing&quot; set are used to book off used inventory in the consigment warehouse.<br />
<br />
But the question is if there is any way to get proposals to actually replenish this consigment warehouse. I tried to set reorder points and safety stocks in the consigment warehouse. But no SIC, TPOP..or whatever run is generating propositions. Also EP is doing nothing.<br />
<br />
Anyone an idea to get the replenishment propositions.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
