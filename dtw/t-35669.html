<br />
we have to count our inventory that is in Recieving and Inspection locations. BaaN does not generate cycle counting orders for materials in these locations.<br />
<br />
If I change the REC/Insp location in the warehouse table for any other location that doesn't have inventory or dummy location... this will generate cycle counting orders for those items in REC and Insp... The thing is that I do not know if this can cause any problem on a later stage of after finishing the counting. These will be done over a weekend no production transactions or anyother type.<br />
<br />
Obviously we will put back to &quot;REC&quot; and &quot;Insp&quot; locations in the warehouse table once the counting is finished.<br />
<br />
Any ideas, inputs?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
