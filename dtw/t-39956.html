<br />
1 : process 6 - Error : Read row error 506 on tcmcs098141  (error 506) (tcmcsdll0011.table.booster() in object otcmcsdll0011)<br />
2 : process 6 - Fatal error : Error 506 (Table does not exist) on select<br />
<br />
Other previous orders are displayed fine.<br />
We did a SP and Porting Set upgrade last week, I don't really know if the problem is related. <br />
Please advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">1st August 2007, 10:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure if this would help you, but its a harmless try. Could you run Re-organize tables {ttaad4225m000} for tables tdpur40 to tdpur45 and see if it resolves this problem? It looks like something is amiss in that order you searched for. Re-organizing it should solve it, under normal circumstances. tdpur45 alone would have been enough but it would be best to include all the three tables(tdpur40, tdpur41 &amp; tdpur45) while re-organizing purchase order tables...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mvanta</div><div class="date">1st August 2007, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">We did the upgrade with SSA but as you notice in the message in says &quot;error 506 on tcmcs098141&quot;.  Company 141 was not used anymore and they adviced us to deleted.  You think that re-organizing will solve the problem?Or is something bigger?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">1st August 2007, 11:30</div></div><div class="posttext">So 141 is not your live company? <br />
Is your co setup as single finance single logistic?<br />
Are you using table boosters since its pointing to the table in the error message..<br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mvanta</div><div class="date">1st August 2007, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to let you know we manage to find a solution.  we are using a multicompany environment and company 141 ws not used any more, so as SSA suggested, we deleted tables and logical as well.<br />
<br />
We noticed from the SQL that tables tcmcs065 and tcmcs003 are used.  By checking we realised that departments and warehouses of deleted company were assigned to that company(141) so we changed that using ttaad4100 to an existing company. I think in tdpur4500m000 the next documents to be displayed were those of company 141 and that concluded in the error.<br />
<br />
Now it works fine. Hope it is fine as well.<br />
Thank you from your help!!</div></div><hr />
