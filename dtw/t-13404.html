<br />
We are planning to run the print invoicing and other sessions related to it in JOBS.So this the problem which we are going to face :-<br />
<br />
=&gt; I have a SO which a normal item and a cost item say Freight.<br />
=&gt; The status of cost item becomes release to invoicing.<br />
=&gt; the status of the other item is still release to WH.<br />
<br />
So if my job runs open for the all SO's for &quot;Release to Invoicing&quot; it will pick the Cost item for this SO and invoice it. Which is what I do not want !!!!<br />
<br />
Has any one faced this similiar problem????<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help in Advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can specify in the salesdata of the item that you want the costitem to go via warehousing. See, item sales data, tab 1 release to warehousing field!<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">14th November 2003, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Onyour issue with Release to Invoicing - we have the same issue. We have some charge lines that we use a quantity, and some that we don't. WHat we did is to create a custom script that will go in and basically 'deliver' the cost item, once it sees a shipment for the sales order. Also, we developed a custom Release to invoicing session to check that ALL lines on the order were ready to be released, as the customer wants one invoice per order. If there are any lines not ready to be released, or if one of the charge lines with quantity were not yet delivered, it will not release the order and will send back an error report.<br />
Also, could you add your freight without quantities and just use an amount?</div></div><hr />
