<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">14th March 2002, 13:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have any documentation or hints on how to setup/use the Intra EU Transactions area of Baan IVc4?<br />
<br />
I have looked on support.baan.com and I have found a very simple solution that shows the setup of parameters and what else must be set up.  <br />
<br />
However because of this solution, I have a lot more questions (ie:  how do these additional sets really work?,  The Item code for customized Items in the parameters...does this code print out for all I/E customized items then?, etc).  <br />
<br />
So if anyone has any documentation or hints that they want to share, it would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">14th March 2002, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I recall that code is used as the item code put into the Intrastat tables, if there is NO &quot;derived from&quot; standard item given in the customized item. So, if the customized item is derived from a standard item, Baan will use the code of that particular item, and not the parameter value.<br />
<br />
When using Baan Intrastat, keep in mind that the country of origin may be given in the item code only. So if you source the same item from multiple suppliers from different countries, the Baan Intrastat will pretty soon come to it's limits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweber</div><div class="date">18th March 2002, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help (the tip about the country of origin especially).<br />
<br />
I checked with our Intrastat person (who is doing all the imports manually right now) and she told me that for intrastat, we must state the following:<br />
<br />
Amount (from the std cost, I see)<br />
Amount on the Invoice (from AP, I guess)<br />
<br />
I was successful on testing the import (Purchase/rec), but I can't seem to pick up the AP transaction.   I linked it to the PO, finalized it, posted integrations but got nothing when I processed EU transactions.  Did I miss a setup peice?<br />
<br />
Also, does anyone have any idea on how to catch transportation costs?</div></div><hr />
