<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">22nd September 2009, 14:29</div></div><div class="posttext">We are implementing some new processes and we'd like EDI to accept 850 incoming messages from our satellite plant and automatically assign it to a particular warehouse based on customer code.<br />
<br />
Example, if CUNO = 1234  then cwar = 101 ...  etc etc ....<br />
<br />
So whatever order lines come across EDI we would like to take those and assign to a particular warehouse depending on cusotmer.<br />
<br />
We have about 6 of these case type statements that we'd like to program in.<br />
<br />
is this possible in EDI? I am not sure where to look for programming these exceptions.  Should I look into the evaluation expressions or perhaps at the actual conversion setups ?<br />
<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />

<br />
if I remember correctly our old EDI set-up it is not possible in the standard IVc4 to process warehouses when receiving EDI sales orders. The standard functionality is that the warehouse related to an item is taken from the item data. <br />
<br />
In this case the only possibility to do a small customisation of the program for incoming messages tdslsdll4280 &quot;Receive sales orders&quot;, but to do this you need the source code.<br />

We don't have source code, but we have Qkey. What we do in our case, is we let Baan translate whatever they way it does. Once the lines are added, we call our code and then modify lines as per pur requirement. We have done several modifications to EDI e.g. like calcualting planned receipt date basd on the freight carrier service chosen, adding logic for not to charge customer for freight based on order quantity, blocking an EDI line if the order quantity is not in multiple of X and so on.<br />
