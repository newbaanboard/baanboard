<br />
We have created new purchase order and insert one item line for that purchase order.  And the transaction has been approved and Purchase Order has been printed.  Suddenly we found that something wrong with the order line and try to remove the order line.  But the system does not allow us to do so.<br />
<br />
I'm really thankful if someone can guide me how for me to remove the order line.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Could you provide the screen shot of which message/error you are getting on deleting the po line?</div></div><hr />

  Am not sure if this would work in Ln, but (instead of removing) why don't you try receiving 0 and changing the back order to 0 as well? In Baan4 it effectively closes that particular line item from receiving any further. <br />

Probably system wont allow you to delete the PO line now, if no receipts made till now the best thing to do is cancel the line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to my understanding of the problem , Receipt has been made , so you need to first unlink the receipt line , <br />
<br />
Once receipt line has been unlinked purchase order line automatically enable , Now you have option to modify the line or delete the line .<br />
<br />
Hope this will Help.<br />
