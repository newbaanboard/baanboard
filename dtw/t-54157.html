<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jksandy</div><div class="date">30th October 2008, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">We use Cognos and Baan. We have the out of the box solution from Infor for the enterprise analytics. one of them is purchase activity which pulls data from the purchase history table. Cognos pulls the last record from the history table. I was checking some of hte purchase orders and found that price is 0 for some of the records when the price on the order is something else. I tried to track and see what is going on. Then I found that PDPO is making the price 0 on the history table for some reason. We dont have the source code and do not know why it is doing so. Anyone has an idea about this? Any kind of information would be very very helpful. Thanks in advance.<br />
