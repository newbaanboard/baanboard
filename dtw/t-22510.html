<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthil</div><div class="date">2nd December 2004, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">In DRP, we defined some installation materials to get transferred from one warehouse to non nettable warehouse.<br />
<br />
Let Say ITEM1 - current inventory = 500 nos<br />
parameters are as follows :<br />
<br />
Safety stock - 3000 nos with seasonal pattern .. 1 to 6 months as 1 and 7 to 12 months - 0.25  (i.e safety stock from 7th month to 12 month is 750 nos)<br />
<br />
Maximum inventory - 6000 nos<br />
<br />
Ordering Method - Lot for Lot.<br />
Order qty multiples of 100 nos<br />
<br />
There is some open sales orders from January '04.. (say 100 nos... with dely date 31/01/04) to till date, total qty comes to 300 nos. <br />
<br />
By generating DRP for above scenario at current date, the system generates order for 2600 in the month January 01 <br />
<br />
Actually at current date - safety stock is 750 nos.. and my net requirement is 300 nos (including january schedule) and current inventory is 500 nos. so my requirement should be 600 nos where as we are getting multiple planned orders for 2600, 600....<br />
<br />
Could anyone suggest idea to solve the issues.</div></div><hr />

If in 5 - presuming you have set your seasonal safety stock pattern in the Item Data by Warehouse session (whwmd2510m000), could it be something as simple as having the Use Item Parameters box checked?  That box has to be cleared before the system will apply the settings from this session for Expected Annual Issue, Max Inventory, Seasonal Pattern for Safety Stock...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maintain item by warehouse (tdinv0101m000) is available and use item parameter field was already set to &quot;NO&quot;.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
