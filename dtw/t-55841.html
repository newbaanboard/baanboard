<br />
Please advice me. <br />
Even if it is not possible pls let me know that whether it is possible or not.<br />

<br />
one possible solution could be to use tcobd0501m000 &quot;Alternative Items&quot;.<br />
<br />
You could define an &quot;Introduction Date&quot; of the Alternative Item in the future. The Alternative Item should be an item that is blocked for everything via a signal code. <br />

<br />
Look, There is no any direct method through which we can handlle your problem. But If their is such kind of requirement , In that case we have to manage it by two ways!<br />
<br />
1) Block your Inventory From Stock point When you want to stop your transaction. And also the same time you need to put item Blocking signal into the item.<br />
<br />
If your requirement no mainatin the expiry date manually then <br />
2)Create one customixation in which AFS pick the Last transaction date and on the basis of date, Your AFS will do the above activity Automatically.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope It will help you out from your problem.</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much for your replies. but the problem is my requirement is like this. i have items which have expiry dates. so i need to enter these expiry dates to the system and there should be a way to identify expired items later. i just thought to do it through giving a shelf life to the item and but i confused how i maintain this expiry date because there may be several expiry dates for the same item. <br />
Please advice me regarding this.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
San</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was considered the Self life, But self life is used when you want to expire particular receipt/LOT , your requirement is not mapped with self life. <br />
<br />
<br />
you are basicallly focused on expiry of Item not stock(LOT). So you need to follow my give solution in my previous post.<br />
<br />
You need to customize one session in which you maintain the expiry dates of the item , and through AFS you need to block the item for further use , As given in previous post</div></div><hr />
