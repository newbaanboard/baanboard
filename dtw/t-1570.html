<br />
We have successfully created a number of PO's in the purchasing company and, via EDI, have created the corresponding SO's in the supplying company. <br />
<br />
We have created the final PO with 500 lines but when we run the Direct Network Communication session to transfer the data to the Supplying company the session just hangs. If I look at the trace files I can see that a file has been created and that my 500 lines are recorded but that's about it. If I check on out going Generated messages there is no information.<br />
<br />
There can't be a problem with the EDI set-up due to the fact that it has been working previously and nothing has been changed.<br />
<br />
What else should I look at?:confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

If the field &quot;Generate outgoing messages before connection' of the  Maintain Networks is set to yes, then the file command.fil is gets created in the command directory. The Direct Network Communication gets hanged till you delete this file. This may be one of the reason..<br />
<br />
Have you tried the session Generate EDI messages for Generating PO's?</div></div><hr />
