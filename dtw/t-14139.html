<br />
I am working as a Crystal Report Developer and I have least knowledge in Sales Order/Warehousing modules. I am currently doing a report on Print package slips. <br />
<br />
In case of Parent-Child (List) Item, I need to calculate the number of children present for the parent ..<br />
<br />
code is as follows:<br />
<br />
|Calculation of count of each child item for a parent <br />
|Ex (2)chI1 + (3)chI2 = (1)PI    and now the count would be *2** |for chI1 and **3** for chI2<br />
	select	whinh217.qana<br />
	from	whinh217<br />
	where	whinh217._index1 =  {:whinh431.worg,:whinh431.worn,:whinh431.wpon,:whinh431.wseq,:whinh431.boml}<br />
	as set with 1 rows<br />
	selectdo<br />
	selectempty<br />
		whinh217.qana = 0<br />
	endselect					    <br />
<br />
|calculation of no. of child items for a parent item (how many child items form a parent)<br />
|Ex. (2)chI1 + (3)chI2 = (1)PI    and no. of child item is ***2***<br />
	select	count(*) :no.of.child<br />
	from	tdsls403<br />
	where	tdsls403._index1 = {:whinh431.worn,:whinh431.wpon,:whinh431.wseq}<br />
	selectdo<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
In one of my cases, for a delivery note (shipment), whinh431.wseq is 1 and both the queries fails as tables tdsls403(Sales Bill Of Materials) and whinh217 do not have matching record for sequence number '1'.  I found that all the records in both the tables are with the sequence number 0.<br />
<br />
So Instead of using whinh431.wseq in my where statement, Can I modify my query as :<br />
<br />
where whinh217._index1 =  {:whinh431.worg,:whinh431.worn,:whinh431.wpon,0,:whinh431.boml}<br />
and<br />
where tdsls403._index1 = {:whinh431.worn,:whinh431.wpon,0}<br />
<br />
Also Can you explain when and how whinh431.wseq(Warehouse Order Seq. no.) and whinh431.rseq(Sales Seq.no.) are updated and when to use what?<br />
<br />
Please help me at the earliest.<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />

<br />
I can't answer all, but I can sympathize, I ran into the same sequence number problems reading from warehousing back to sales.  <br />
<br />
I found that the shipping constraint (tdsls400.scon) affects the warehousing sequences - does your problem order have a different shipping constraint than the others?  For example, I think for ship complete it will not create sequences, because there will only be 1 shipment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the information.<br />
But In my order, Shipping Constraint is None (1).</div></div><hr />
