<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">When you are in the sales order line, enter the line item and then click Special or Application (whichever you have) and you will see Maintain Production Order as an option in the zoom menu.  Click this enter the series number and Baan will bring in the item number and the quantity into a production order.  Of course there is no actual link here with the sales order so I suggest adding SFC text.  This should do the trick.  If you don't see the session Maintain Production Order then your zoom menu may have been changed.  Just add it back in.</div></div><hr />

We did a customization to handle this as we wanted this to be a automatic process. We do generate a Production order from sales order for certain items and the generation is based on expected inventory in warehouse. The menu option in the Sale Order line is good, but leaves a lot on user. Also on of the limitation of Baan production order is that all the components required for prodcution order will be drwan from Production BOM warehouse, while this was a limitation to us. We wanted the components to be drwan from the warehouse where sales order would be shipped. Our system does following:<br />
1. Create a prodcution order from sales order based on item and expected inventory<br />
2. Link production order to sales Order<br />
3. Send email to Operations that a production order is created.<br />
