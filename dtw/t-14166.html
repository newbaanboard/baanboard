<br />
Appreciate your input for this problem.<br />
<br />
I have an item with order system = Manual (Order policy = Anonymous and Odrer Method = Lot-for-Lot) . <br />
<br />
Why BaaN still generate Planned INV orders for this item when the on-hand stock fall below the re-order point after the session Generate Planned INV order is ran ?</div></div><hr />

We're on 4c4, Oracle, Unix as well. I set up a couple of items just as you posted and I could not replicate your problem. BaaN would not generate an SIC order for manual order system item. any possibility the order was a firm planned SIC order generated for the item before it was changed to manual?<br />

<br />
The item I was mentioning is newly created. So, your feedback does not valid in my case.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what BaaN will consider when generating SIC order. I attached the screens shot showing the ITM data for this item.</div></div><hr />

I think I have the answer. In the session tdinv3201m000 Generate Planned INV Orders (this is the SIC planning engine) BaaN allows you to generate planned orders for items with an order method of Manual. Check the drop down in the field titled Order System and you will see the possibilities are SIC, MPS, MRP, FAS and MANUAL. I ran my item this morning and selected Manual and sure enough BaaN generated a planned purchase order. I actually think it's neat to have this flexibility. Currently on our Manual items we make out purchase reqs. I'll be telling our planning group about this today. It's going to save time in our ordering process.<br />
Hope this is your answer,<br />
