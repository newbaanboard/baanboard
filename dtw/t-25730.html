<br />
Please help me out with the following issue:<br />
In a BaanIVc4 environment I have to set up internal EDI between 2 sites of the same company. The challenge is, to receive PO's in ASCII-files which have to create SLS-orders in the selling comp. of type Direct Delivery. Can I add a fixed value in the ASCII-file which sets the tdsls041.drct-flag to &quot;Yes&quot; when the field is part of the Conversion Setups? (I saw a thread a while ago which says this Direct Del's with EDI should be impossible........ :( <br />
<br />
Thnx in advance<br />
Erik</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe, the Order type should be of direct delivery type while loading the PO in selling company. Yoy have to link the order type to the internal EDI relation in the EDI setup of the selling company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem however is, that you can't set the &quot;Direct Flag&quot; to Yes in the ordertype when the Orderkind is &quot;Sales&quot;. This works only for Purchase.......<br />
So I'm afraid questions remains unanswered.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">16th December 2005, 18:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you misunderstand the Direct Delivery functionality.<br />
There is no Sales ordertype of type 'Direct Delivery'. Rather you set the 'direct delivery' flag in a sales order line to yes, and you then use a session tdsls4240m000 (Generate Planned Purchase Orders for a Sales Order) to generate a Purchase Order (of type 'Direct Delivery') which then gets the delivery address of your customer as the PO's delivery place (instead of your own address as the delivery address). So you are asking your supplier to ship directly to your customer. Because the goods will then never enter your warehouse the Direct Delivery PO procedure skips some steps like maintain inbound - maintain receipts etc. Note: if you use lot valuation I think it is not possible to use Direct Delivery (as you will need a lot price but since the goods never come in you warehouse you will not have lots).<br />

<br />
The point is was trying to make is that the Direct Delivery procedure is from Sales Order to Purchase Order. Not from Purchase order to Sales order.<br />
If it is for specific partnumbers maybe you could lower the field tiitm001.ddfq:<br />
<br />
&quot;The order quantity that is critical to direct delivery from the supplier<br />

Looking for info on Direct Deliveries and this thread seems to be the best so far.  However I have a simple question.  Where is the field for &quot;Direct Delivery&quot; at the Sales Order level?</div></div><hr />

You set the 'direct delivery' flag in a sales order line to yes.... where is the direct delivery flag on Sales Order lines you speakth of?  Form 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
HHHmmmm.<br />
<br />
This maybe more difficult than I thought then. We don't use EDI with the supplier.<br />
<br />
We currently hold stock of part A.  Our supplier can also ship part A directly to the supplier.  It basically depends on the customer location.  I.e. if our customer orders part A is in the USA our supplier ships directly.  If the customer orders part A is anywhere else in the world we ship from our stock.  Setting the direct delivery to Zero at the item master level will always want to ship directly.<br />
<br />
Ok even so if all shipments to our customers are shipped by our supplier directly to the customer (which would be ideal) are there order steps that need to be set up?<br />
<br />
Entered Order where direct delivery for item A = Zero.<br />
Order status of Sales Order is at &quot;Awaiting Direct Delivery&quot;.<br />
Now what?  Our supplier has shipped to the customer.  How does the order status change from Awaiting?<br />
<br />
Maybe a need to pay a BaaN consultant... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">29th March 2006, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Well here is this way I would design my solution comsidering your scenario- Direct Delivery and shipping from your warehouse. I was not aware that you can do both way. <br />
All these will be system step (Automated process):<br />
1. Bring the EDI order as normal Order i.e. without Direct delivery flag.<br />
2. Based on shipping location of order make the direct delvery flag to Yes.<br />
3. I will directly create record in planned inv purchase order then.<br />
4. Tranfer INV order to Purchasing using standard Baan session.This will be called in the custom script.<br />
5. Email purchasing group to make them aware that there is a PO sitting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Upon SHipment. Again this can be manual or automate process<br />
In Manual process one will receive the PO and that Baan will automatically Invoice<br />
<br />
In Automated proess:<br />
I would request supplier to send me the PO number Item Quantity shipped, tracking information, freight charge in electronic format- Flat file etc.<br />
Receive the PO and add trtacking information to sales order, so that freight can be billed to customer.<br />
<br />
We are doing part of this in our process- Esp the receipt part. <br />
We have a web form where supplier will enter the shipment details - Tracking weight, and also the carton content. We also ask them to enter their Invoice information. Upon enetring this info, system automaticaly process the Purchase Order and as well as proces the SUpplier Invoice through our automatic PO matching process. This has become virtually paperless process and no ine in Purchasing and Accounting has to do any transactions.<br />

2. Based on shipping location of order make the direct delvery flag to Yes.<br />
<br />
I still cannot find a direct delivery yes/no flag that everyone keeps referring to.  Maybe it was removed by previous BaaN programmers during customization?  I wish I could find such a flag...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">29th March 2006, 21:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
You can look into table- tdsls041. It is called tdsls041.drct. If your form is modifed then it is possible it is not present on the form. But you can test it. Make the direct delivey quantity to zero in item master. Then try entering the sales order for item. Also you can set the Distibution parameter- Generate Planned INV order to Automatc and Generate Purchase Order to Automaic or Interactove to test it out. Hopefully the code is not modified in your system. <br />
<br />
Just to add to your question, Baan EDI doesn't generate ASN for direct delivery, which you may have to generate for such orders. ASN are generated on &quot;Print Packing Slip&quot; stage and Direct Delivery orders by passes that step. ANyway Baan ASN are not that helpful. In my scenario I have created my own 856 (ASN) transaction with lot of information, and I do generate ASN for direct delivery orders also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">30th March 2006, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: the flag is to be found om form 1 in sales order line, right side, 3rd field from above. if not, I guess indeed your forms are customized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason Patte</div><div class="date">6th April 2006, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys, in fact the field was &quot;disabled&quot; on the form.  Does anyone have any basic instructions on the direct delivery functionality in BaaN?  Even now when I enter an order that I want to test the direct delivery &quot;special&quot; procedure I can't change the direct delivery field from No to Yes.  Do I need to create specific order types to allow direct delivery, direct delivery won't allow Yes because of item type?  I know we could use this but I have no clue and there seems to be little to nothing anywhere about how this direct delivery works... :sadface:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">9th March 2009, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">On my system, it is field tdsls041.drct.<br />
It is on form 1 of Maintain SO Lines (tdsls4102s000) just underneath Back Order quantity.</div></div><hr />
