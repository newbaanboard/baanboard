<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Eden</div><div class="date">27th November 2003, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">We are considering a change to our current structure and I wasn't sure of the response to a question that was posed to me.<br />
<br />
If we have a multi / multi environment how / where / when does the PRP get run. <br />
<br />
We will be loading the sales orders into a master company and then (hopefully) move these out to the various logistical companies. I'm thinking that the upper level (saleable) items will have a warehouse code attached which will send the line to the correct logistical company and then we would run PRP in that company.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on this scenario.</div></div><hr />
