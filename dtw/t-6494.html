<br />
I am using BaanIVc4 with is4.   Today for the first time we had a situation to cancel the Excise invoice (57F4).<br />
The Excise invoice is generated for one subcontrator, but after processing we found that the subcontractor is not interested to take this job. So I am trying to cancel the excise invoice through session (tdind0233m00 - Cancel Excise Invoice). <br />
Can anyone tell me, what are other implications that will happen if I run this session for a particular invoice.<br />
Does all the records/transactions related to this invoice will be deleted.<br />
<br />
If any one has a detailed document &amp; flow chart on the india localization part &amp; particular detailed notes on the subcontratoring funda., please send it to the below mail id..,<br />
<br />
thanx &amp; rgds.,<br />
