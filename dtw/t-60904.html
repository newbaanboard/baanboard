Inventory transaction gets updated through cycle counting on the &quot;counting date&quot; defined in the order. So you can give back date,but the order date must also be back dated.<br />

<br />
is it possible with out back dating the server????? though you back date the order date and run cycle counting transaction will be recorded on the date which you run the cycle counting. any way i am running a trail check by back dating the server date. <br />
<br />
Thanks and with best regards,<br />

<br />
you could try some tweaking using GTM ,although it is not recommended<br />
<br />
Note :   try it in test server first.<br />
