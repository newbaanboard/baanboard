We used to set this field to &quot;Issue main Item&quot; again because we want to deliver the assembled part, rather than its components.<br />
I am pretty sure that until last year (before we moved from SP14 to SP19) the phantoms were NOT replaced by their components when generating the project structure with session tipcs2240 if you had the field tdsls041.isss set to &quot;Issue Main Item&quot;.<br />
Today phantoms are always replaced by their components at generate project structure, regardless of the field tdsls041.isss.  BaaN claims this is standard functionality, but I am not convinced.  Can anybody confirm that we haven't been dreaming?</div></div><hr />

I know that what you believe is correct when project is not in use. I don't know what happens when project is involved, though<br />

   Cant confirm if it was allowed prior to SP15 or above as we only started using it(phantoms) post SP16 or 17. If my understanding of a phantom item is correct then, it is like a placeholder which disappears or gives way to the manufactured or purchased item in its bom while delivering sales orders, generating production orders or projects.<br />
<br />
But do tell me if you want to deliver the main item than the components, then why use phantom? <br />

P.S: Quoting from Baan help &quot;A Phantom is an item that appears in the product structure, but which is not seen as a separate manufactured item for production.The item will be included in the product structure, but will not be stocked in a warehouse&quot;.</div></div><hr />

We are a machine building company.  The items we are talking about here are sub-assemblies.  These sub-assemblies have been entered as phantoms in the stucture of a complete machine because we want to collect the material on a higher level (we don't cut a PO on the level of these sub-assemblies when building a complete machine)<br />
But if we sell such a sub-assembly as a spare part, we want it on a sales order and create a production order to build it.</div></div><hr />

  You are talking about two different scenarios where in one scenario you sell a machine and in the other you sell a spare part. The way i look at it, you shouldnt treat both in the same manner. When selling a machine, the delivery and invoicing would be based on the machine(i presume?) and so there is no need to have a PO cut out for the subassemblies. Having the sub assemblies as phantoms in this scenario helps the cause. However when selling a spare part, i guess you should include a valid item(manufactured item; Not phantom) which, has the same structure(BOM) as the phantom sub assembly of the main machine. This way you could raise a production order for it. <br />
<br />
Let me know if this is a feasible option..<br />
