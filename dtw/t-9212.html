I've try it and the system says that the location is not permited.<br />
<br />
The only way to do it is leaving the system make the advise, (whinh4201m000)<br />
<br />
In our company we have to select the lot manually, so we don't want to use this automatic process.<br />
<br />
The version is BaaN Vb.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

I am sorry I have not access to Baan Vb, but I think it should be possible to do this also on your version of Baan. <br />
Did you check if there is any solution on Baan support?<br />

I was trying it again, and at the end I realised that the system was asking for the staged location, field to fill in the second form....<br />
<br />
It's easier than I thought!<br />
Ciao, regards, adeu.</div></div><hr />
