<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">17th February 2003, 00:33</div></div><div class="posttext">How do others handle customers in a multicompany environment?  Currently we share it to our group company.  However, soon we will be implementing several new distributions companies.  We have a need for separate salesrep and pricelist information in these different companies.<br />
<br />
I want everything to flow through standard Baan, without a lot of customization - Does anyone have any advice?<br />
<br />
We're on IVc4.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">18th February 2003, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">As our products and costs are very similar throughout our companies we have shared the customer table (amongst many) and just use a structure to identify which belongs to which (e.g. UK0000 belongs to UK finance company, BE9999 belongs to Belgian finance company).<br />
For sales reps. you could do similar - you have 6 characters so <br />
D12345 could be for Distribution company, M12345 could be for manufacturing etc.).<br />
<br />
We use table data authorizations ttaad4134m000 to prevent users entering data for customers that don't belong to them.<br />
<br />
Sales price lists are 3 characters long so depending on how many you have you could do the same with those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">18th February 2003, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't you then have issues with customers and statements and such, or do you link the multiple customers together with parents?<br />
<br />
We don't want to have to set up separate customers for each company.  We did this with suppliers, using numbers to differentiate, and ended up with a reporting mess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">18th February 2003, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">We tend to have each of our financial companies responsible for a country so normally only one Baan fin. co supplies to that customer. If we supply to ABC Company Ltd in UK and also supply to ABC Company NV in Belgium they would be 2 separate customers on our system( they may be billed in 2 different currencies as well).  We don't currently link them using parents etc. but we may do in future for analysis purposes but sometimes working out relationships is a little difficult!<br />
<br />
As the customers are independent themselves it doesn't bother them either.<br />
<br />
We have statements set up in each finance company so they can be different.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
