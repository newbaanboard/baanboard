<br />
probably I can help you, but I need some details of your current setup like:<br />
<br />
1) salesodertype<br />
2) order procedure (transportation) details <br />
3) route plans<br />
<br />
Screenshot's would be very helpful. Setting up the link between TD and TR is a tricky thing, but not impossible :) .<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />
Martin</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can post page 2 of the SLS Ordertype as well please. Are your sure that authorizations for the TR-orderprocedure are set properly (orderprocedure by login code)?<br />
<br />
What I found very surprising is, that you copy the salesorder AFTER the step Maintain Deliveries. I'm not sure if this is a problem in Baan.. Have you ever tried to change the sequence?<br />
<br />

<br />
As soon as you asked to post  2nd form I have checked my 2nd form ( Maintain order type ) where 2 field 1) Order Procedure 2) Series was empty.<br />
After enter this value when I run transport order generated successfully. Thanks once again for your help.  My email address is nitaichandradas@gmail.com.  Pl. reply with ur email address so that in future we can contact.<br />
<br />
