Purchase Currency is US Dollars but the Home Currency is Canadian Dollars. <br />
<br />
Some details <br />
&quot;Maintain Financial Integration Parameters&quot;<br />

<br />
 <br />
Home currency for the company is CAD (Canadian Dollars) and the effective currency rate for USD is 1.269<br />
<br />
If I see &quot;Print Integration transactions&quot;( tfgld4410m000) after completing &quot;Maintain Receipts&quot;, I can see the bellow<br />
entries.<br />
<br />
Transaction Origin :Purchase<br />
Financial Transaction : Receipt<br />

<br />
Transaction Origin :Purchase<br />
Financial Transaction Result<br />
Amount in CAD  : 382.89 D<br />
Amount in CAD  : 382.89 C<br />
<br />
What I expected was a Purchase Receipt for 1729.171 (1362.63 * 1.269). Can somebody explain me why there is a Purchase result for 382.89?<br />
<br />
I can see that the difference between Purchase Receipt and Result gives the actual value 1729.18.<br />
<br />
I am not very familiar with BaaN Functional side as I normally work with BaaN Tools. Is this how BaaN is supposed to work?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JosephA</div><div class="date">22nd March 2004, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick reply. But would you mind explaining me how BaaN calculated the value as 2112.07 CAD when the standard price is 8.4569 USD, the received quantity is 550 and the purchase price is 2.4775. The effective currency rate for USD is 1.269.<br />
<br />
Is there anything else I am missing while doing the calculation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">22nd March 2004, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">The integration postings show std cost of $3.8401 CAD as of transaction date of receipt. ($2112.07 CAD / 550 units).<br />
<br />
Where are you obtaining a standard cost of $8.4569? Is that displayed on Item Master? As of today?<br />
<br />
Run &quot;Display Standard Cost Price by Item&quot; (ticpr3501m000) to check the std cost price that was in effect on the date that the goods were received. (Note that std cost will be recorded and expressed in home currency.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JosephA</div><div class="date">23rd March 2004, 02:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much Scott.<br />
        I was assuming that standard cost price will also be in USD. In item master, it is 8.4569. The inventory unit is kg, but the purchasing unit is pound(lb) and there is a conversion factor from kg to lb of 0.4536. So 8.4569*0.4536/1.269 = 3.022 which exactly matches with what you have calculated.<br />
      Now due to the difference between the standard price and the purchase price, a purchase reult is created. In our situation, I think that the variation is due to the fact that the inventory unit and the purchasing unit are different. Does ths mean that we should use inventory unit same as purchasing unit? Or is there any way to use different units, but to get rid of the purchase result? Is there any other financial implication that I should be aware of about the purchase variance genreated in a situation like this?<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AWondergem</div><div class="date">23rd March 2004, 09:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Using a purchase unit different from inventory unit does not necessarily create a purchase result. <br />
<br />
As long as the purchase price, converted to inventory unit and home currency, is the same as the standard cost price (in inventory unit and home currency) at the time the receipt is posted is the same, there won't be  a purchase result posting (or, at worst, a couple of cents in rounding differences).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moshe Almog</div><div class="date">24th March 2004, 08:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
The purchase receipt integration transaction is in standard price terms, which is 2112.07 CAD.<br />
<br />
When there is a difference between standard price and actual purchase price, and this is the situation here, the system creates a purchase result transaction for the difference.<br />
<br />
In your case, standard price in lb is about 3.84 CAD, purchase price is about 2.4775 * 1.269 = 3.1439 CAD per lb.<br />
The difference mult 550 gives you the 382.89 CAD that you get.<br />
<br />

<br />
I have a similar situation fopr different finance-companies (SLMF). In the main company I have no problem, and no 'result' transactions, yet since starting using one of the cost-items used in the main company, also in a finance-company, we receive 'result'-records...</div></div><hr />
