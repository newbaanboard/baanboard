<br />
I have just created one new company and setup all parameters and all master data including business partner and item master data.<br />
<br />
Then I would like to entry the beginning stock for all items. I have used session generate cycle count orders (whinh5200m000) for many times. But every time I run this session with all selection, I always get &quot;no data within selection&quot; eventhough I have checked &quot;force cycle count&quot; field.<br />
<br />
For your information, attached is the parameters I have set.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to generate cycle count orders for new item created?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Harley</div></div><hr />

<br />
The input for cycle counting orders is table whinr140 otherwise whinh540 ( conditional)<br />
<br />
Since in the new company there would be no records in either tables, the cycle counting orders are not generated. <br />
<br />
For you a better and a simpler way would be to create records manually in the session whinh5540m000 and checkmark force cycle count. <br />
<br />
Now try generating the cycle counting orders from session whinh5200m000 ( force cycle count again)  Since there are no records in whinr140 , relevant records from whinh540 will be picked up.</div></div><hr />

We faced the same problem with one of our previous installation before. Turned out that the &quot;Force Cycle Count on New Stock Point&quot; and &quot;Force Cycle Count on Inventory Zero&quot; has to be set to &quot;Yes&quot; from day one. That way, BaanERP will remember to include practically everything if want to do a &quot;forced&quot; cycle counting (by settting &quot;Force Cycle Count&quot; when generating cycle counting orders).<br />
<br />
A little note: If you don't do it on day one, then, on &quot;forced&quot; cycle counting, BaanERP will only remember to include the new items created after moment you set the parameter so<br />
<br />
By the way, even after setting those parameters so from day one, I personally prefer porting the initial inventory data from Excel to BaanERP using BaanERP Exchange. It's faster than using cycle counting order procedure<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
For Flip_J,<br />
      I already have the Item data by warehouse.<br />
<br />
For Ramakrish,<br />
      I couldn't find table tdinv120.<br />
<br />
For baan5guy,<br />
      It works with your way, but I have to create manually for all items.<br />
<br />
For Paul P,<br />
     Yes, I didn't check &quot;Force Cycle Count on New Stock Point&quot; and &quot;Force Cycle Count on Inventory Zero&quot; at the beginning. I only check &quot;Force Cycle Count on New Stock Point&quot; just before I want to generate cycle counting orders.<br />
<br />
After I read your advice, I changed my setting to &quot;Yes&quot; and created some more items then generate cycle count orders. Unfortunately I still get the same message &quot;no data within selection&quot; eventhough I have set the parameters to &quot;Yes&quot; before the items created.<br />
<br />
I also curious to know how to upload the initial inventory data using baan exchange? What kind of data of initial inventory can be uploaded using exchange? FYI, I'm familiar with Baan Exchange. <br />
<br />
Please your advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

<br />
Hey, seems like you've got the Exchange bite too :)<br />
<br />
What I normally do to port initial inventory to BaanERP (at the last stage of implementation) is to create one cycle counting order per warehouse, port the data to Cycle Counting / Adjustment Order Lines table, and then process the orders. Please remember to use the correct order number when porting. Since you said you're familiar with Exchange, I'm sure it'd be a piece of cake for you :)<br />

Yes, I know how to do it.  :) <br />

Thanks a lot<br />
