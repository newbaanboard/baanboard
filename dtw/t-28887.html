<br />
we are using baan IV in5. I have created some data for executing sub contract orders, this is my client requirement.<br />
<br />
Items                                          BOM<br />
<br />
Item  A -- Purchased,                    ----<br />
Item  B -- Manufacturing                0.33 Item A<br />
Item  c -- Manufacturing                0.33 Item A<br />
Item  d -- Manufacturing                0.34 Item A<br />
Item  SA - Subcontracting Item.<br />
<br />
I defined Supplier, task and workcenter for subcontracting,created 3 Production orders and released, created purchase orders for the above three orders ( 100001   -  P.No 1,2,3). I have generated 3 Delivery challans for the 3 production orders and maintained material for issue and to be recieved for subcontractor. <br />
                    when I run process Excise Invoice-Purchase (tdind0305m000),<br />
I am able to run for the any one of the delivery challan but the status of all purchase order lines is changing to next step i.e. Maintain Reciepts. After generating reciept, when i go to recieve the subcontracting material i am eble to enter the reciept and material for the first delivery challan only. And the status of line 1 in purchase order is changing to next status and can run upto 'deleting line'. But the other 2 line status is not changing. <br />
          <br />
                 any help is appreciated.This is an urgent requirement of the client. Thanks in Advance.<br />
