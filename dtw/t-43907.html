This is also one of the causes if the date range doesnot match with that of the order for which u are generating the inbound advice.<br />

<br />
sometimes the users press unintentionally a button twice thus the second time this message appears. If you want to check if an inbound advice exists please use &quot;Print Inbout Advice&quot; because in the maintain session the run number is the first selection criteria and it could be that another person has already created the inbound advice. I rather think that there was no inbound advice created and that you should follow the already given hints but you never know.<br />
