       We have one customer with different shipment location and warehouse. Now Can we create sales order header on of his Head office address(Both sold to and ship to address of HO of customer).<br />
And sales order line with different shipment address of it.<br />
But invoice need to get generated on sales order header address, That is HO address?<br />
