<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">11th July 2002, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">When using session &quot;Print Packing Slip&quot; (whinh4475m000) in BaanERP, it will print all shipment lines. As these shipment lines are created per stock point: the packing slip can show multiple lines per (sales) order line. If the picked inventory has two inventory dates, two shipment lines will be created. Both lines are printed on the packing slip. <br />
<br />
When the shipment lines are aggregated into one line on the report, this can save paper. Besides the packing slip will be more easy to read.<br />
Does anyone know what the advantages are of the current way Baan is working: not aggregating the shipment lines?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antoon</div><div class="date">12th July 2002, 09:36</div></div><div class="posttext">You will probalbly have used the paramaeter setting FIFO for stock movements. Baan will then advice to transfer oldest stock first. This is another parameter than the parameter for stock valuation which can also be FIFO.<br />
So if you want old stock transferred first this will make that happen. The big disadvantage is that you will get more lines per sales order, actually a line per stock date.</div></div><hr />
