<br />
I am facing a problem with EDI (Baan 5.0c). I am now testing internal EDI between two Baan companies. In purchase company I got regular EDI message for purchase order (850 Out). When I try to import this message to sales company as sales order (850 In), I get &quot;Business partner XXX NOT FOUND&quot;. <br />
<br />
I am sharing Business partner table between two companies and in I have XXX business partner. <br />
<br />
In manual, it says that I need to map the business partner between companies, but it doesn't say how to do that thing.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me what should I do?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
G.</div></div><hr />

You first need to populate ALL the business partner buy from and sell to roles in both companies.  Then on the business partner header under the multi-site you will be able to check multi-site and put in the affiliated business partner number.  Once this is done in both companies, you will need to make sure that your network and EDI messages by business partner and business partner by EDI network are set up.  You should then be able to send and receive 850s</div></div><hr />
