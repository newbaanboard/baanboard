<br />
I am creating data in a new company in Baan Vc and would like to have the following scenario<br />
<br />
In the warehouse I have a  lot item having lots with inventory but different lot price.Now in the new company on ERP I would like to introduce the above lots at different lot prices. <br />
<br />
When I do the cycle counting, the lot price for the lot is taken as the standard cost price. so all the lots have the same lot price.  <br />
<br />
One method I could think of was to purchase these lots from a dummy Business Partner...but the AP transacations would be difficult to explain to the auditors later :( <br />
<br />
Any suggestions ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps you can change the prices after receipts? The lotprice is based on the latest purchase price, so therefor the lotprices automaticly change if you run session tdpur4122m000.<br />
Hope this is of some help to you.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
