We find base of the problem, that only 26-03-08 data not posted in the sales register. but 27 mar-08 to till date data posted in the sales register.<br />

We lodge a case in INFOR, Mr. Rakesh Jaggi said that the object failed for this session and give us a dump for oind211. we put this in our BaaN Server and there again no results.<br />
<br />
Another point is that if object failed, in that situation it  not worked at any date and not in any Company.<br />
<br />
This session is smoothely working in other date like current date and in ALL OTHER COMPANIES CORRECTELY EXCEPT THE DATE OF 26-03-2008 IN CO. 540.<br />
<br />
We have four logistics company like 510, 520, 530 &amp; 540. This also work in 540 in all dates except 26-03-08.<br />
<br />
The 26th March data was not posted into the sales register. While all other companies data was posted into the sales register for the above said dates.<br />
