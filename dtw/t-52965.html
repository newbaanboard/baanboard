I was hoping that I could get some feedback from anyone that is currently using the Commissions Module in Baan IV.  We are on Baan IVc4 but I can't imagine there being to much difference between the versions.  Things I would be interested in knowing would be -<br />
<br />
1.  How difficult is it to setup?  How long did it take you to implement the module?<br />
2.  What types of rules are you using to calculate commissions?  Is there much flexibility in the module?<br />
3.  Have you encountered any problems with using the functionality?<br />
<br />
Your feedback is greatly appreciated.<br />
