<br />
I want to use a common business partner for creation of my sales quotations like &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;.  B'coz, i can't create BP code every time i get an enquiry from different clients (We are creating 100 quotations/day). If the quotation is accepted by the client, then i'll create new business partner &amp; i would like to convert the respective quotation to the new BP code.<br />
<br />
Is there any standard solution / Workaround for this ??<br />
<br />
Another query is...I want to create quotation with plain text. Of course we can create quotation with text but when i enter result of quotation, system should give a message that &quot;Quotation cannot be confirmed. Reason:Item not defined as sales Item&quot;. But i am not getting this message.<br />
<br />
If i manually insert the item code,  i am loosing all master data like order quantity, price, discounts etc..<br />
<br />
Please help...Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I know it's a pain not to be able to change the Sold-to BP on a Sales Quotation or Sales Order.<br />
<br />
One workaround for this is to:<br />
<br />
- Duplicate the original Sales Quotation<br />
- Assign the correct Sold-to BP to the new Sales Quotation<br />
- Delete or cancel the original Sales Quotation<br />
<br />
This would work as long as your customer does not care about the different Quotation number.</div></div><hr />
