<br />
We are using ERP LN 6.1 FP3<br />
<br />
We have one manufactured item which has only two components. Manufacturing team has decided to &quot;purchase&quot; this item directly for some time. So we raised a purchase order and received goods. After completing the receipt weve found that the system has  updated the inventory of two components, not the main item. How can this happen? Then we have changed the item type in Item Master to Purchased and raised a new PO. But still same thing happens when receiving.<br />
<br />
Please advise how to change this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

This field indicates whether a complete item or its components are received.<br />
When receiving components, not necessarily the first level bill of material (BOM) components are received. SSA ERP executes a top-down scan of the BOM until it finds a non-phantom component. If the BOM consists of only phantom items, the lowest level BOM components are posted.</div></div><hr />
