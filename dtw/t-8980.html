<br />
We would like to purchace an item that consists of a BOM of 5 items.<br />
When we maintain receipts we would like the system to show the receipts of these 5 items and not of the one main item.<br />
<br />
I thouhgt maybe a phantom could be the solution but it does not work as I hoped.<br />
Does anyone have a solution?</div></div><hr />

when I maintain the receipts I see the main item in session tdpur 4120m000 and no item in tdilc4113s000 just **********.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">21st February 2003, 12:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Alternatively you could copy the BOM into the PO via the special menu. Lines will then display the BOM lines though.<br />
In Baan 5 you could use Kits.</div></div><hr />

In this subsession there shall be 5 lines for 5 different items defined under the BOM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gary P</div><div class="date">17th March 2003, 23:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Flip's two answers are both correct but perhaps not quite clear. The following applies to 4b2.<br />
If you wish to order the assembly but receive the piece parts the assembly part number has to be identified in the item master as a phantom. As Flip stated you then enter the assembly part number on the PO line and select &quot;Post To Components&quot;. At receipt the components should appear for receipt.<br />
If you wish to place the components for an assembly on your PO but do not wish to have the assembly part number appear on the PO,  select &quot;Copy BOM Line&quot; from the PO line zoom. In this case there is no need to use the &quot;Post to Component&quot; option. Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NicoleR</div><div class="date">22nd April 2004, 04:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the reverse problem. I want to receive the main item (assembly) but have the components on the purchase order. I copied the main item's bill of material to the purchase order. The main item is manufactured, phantom = no. On each order line for each of the components I set it to post to main item (defaults but I double checked.) All components print on purchase order and GRN. However, when I maintain receipts it shows all the components and not the main item! I want to receive the main item - not the components. Any suggestions?<br />
Using BaanIVc4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I can't really imagine why you'd want to do that. But anyhow, the &quot;Post to Main Item&quot; is there to make sure the items directly mentioned in the PO are the only ones received, not their child items in BOM (i.e. the item Paul Baan put in PO, but not its 5 child items). So it's not actually there for you so that you can mention the child items in PO and receive the parent item in warehouse. Probably they should change the term so that it wouldn't confuse users like you :)<br />

Paul is correct. I'm also not sure what you're trying to do. If you're trying to do some sort of consignment (sending piece parts out and receiving the assembly in) here's what we occasionally do. Lets say you have a manufactured item &quot;A&quot; which consists of piece parts &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; with 1 each used to make &quot;A&quot;. Here's how we set the PO lines up. Enter assembly &quot;A&quot; on line 1 for quantity of 1. Use the drop down function &quot;Copy BOM to Order.&quot; In the selection box enter main item &quot;A&quot; and ordered quantity of -1. The result will be a purchase order with +1 of &quot;A&quot; on line 1 and -1 each of items &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; on subsequent lines. At receipt &quot;A&quot; will come into inventory and &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; will be decremented from inventory. <br />
Now, some things to be aware of. From a PPV perspective the variance should be your labor content of &quot;A&quot;. <br />
From a cycle count perspective, you may have problems depending on the cycle time from your vendor. If it's long you may want to consider receiving &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; when they are sent to the vendor. You could also consider setting up an external warehouse for the vendor if there's a lot of this activity. We've done both.<br />
If you don't put the BOM on the PO as a negative you'll obviously receive both the assembly and it's parts back into inventory and your piece part balances will be all screwed up.<br />
As said earlier, I'm not sure if this is even what you're trying to do, but I hope it helps. You can also email me if you have any other questions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NicoleR</div><div class="date">22nd April 2004, 18:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the input. Essentially I am trying to purchase an assembly from a supplier. Instead of sending out a print out of the BOM to the supplier to indicate the latest build structure - I was wondering if I could incorporate that into the purchase order. I do not want to receive the components at all - only provide the supplier with the latest BOM. But that does not seem possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what we are looking for. Receive A into inventory, reduce B from inventory based apon receipt. <br />
Question, are the items in the BOM positve or negative quantities?<br />
When trying to create the receipt, it will not allow me to enter a negative value.<br />
How can this work for &quot;supply chain process&quot;? The purchase order is created apon receipt.</div></div><hr />
