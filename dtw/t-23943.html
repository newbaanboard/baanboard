<br />
I have created one product.For that product, in Item master, the valuation method i have selected is &quot;Lot Price&quot;. And Lot Control set to &quot;by lot&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now when i am creating a lot for that product, still i am not allowed ti add/modify the price for that lot.<br />
<br />
I have checked all the distribution parameters but all seem to be fine..<br />
<br />
Any advice/suggestion how can i get the lot price..<br />
<br />
Its very imp as our Business Decisions are dependent and affected.<br />
<br />

The price is written to the lot when you receive the purchase order through maintain receipts (tdilc4113s000).<br />
