<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">30th May 2002, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been asked the following question by our Purchasing Manager. Does anybody have the same issues?<br />
<br />
&quot;At present we can not clearly define which PO has been raised to meet certain sales order requirements.  <br />
Question?<br />
Is there a way of linking purchase orders and sales orders so that when a purchase order's delivery date has been entered into Baan, the respective associated sales order requirement (if applicable) is scheduled in line with that PO.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
Scenario<br />
PO 123456 receives a Confirmed Dl.Dt (or Changed Dl.Dt) of 01/06/02.<br />
Result needed is:<br />
The associated sales order ABCDEF, Sched. Ship Date field is automatically populated with the date 01/06/02.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Any advice you can give will be appreciated.<br />
<br />

It is also possible to use the session generate planned purchase orders for sales orders to generate a purchase order of the whole sales order. Then confirm and transfer the planned inv purchase order. In the maintain purchase order line session on one of the forms you should then see the associated sales order and line.</div></div><hr />

Are you trying to update sales order delivery based on an expected delivery of a purchased item?  Are you looking to have the change automated within Baan?  Is there a one to one relationship between the sales order line and the purchase order line?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">31st May 2002, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your replies. Our response is as follows:-<br />
<br />
&quot;Vav - Yes, we would like to update sales order delivery based on an expected delivery of a purchased item.  With reference to Darren's suggestion - we already use generate planned purchase orders in emergency scenarios.  Unfortunately it would not be effective to do this every time we raise a standard sales order -  i.e. our preference is to mix sales order requirements and replenishment (safety stock) requirements through the planning engines (MRP and SIC) so that cost effective replenishment quantities are suggested.  The situation at present is that there is no automated system process where purchase order schedules are automatically recognised and updated to their respective sales order  planned delivery date fields (where applicable). &quot;<br />

<br />
As I understand you would like to use the MRP and SIC planning methods in Baan to optimise your inventory and to secure the SO. I could suggest several things which will let you be more flexible. Of course, it will be up to you to decide how applicable they can be in your case, so far as I am not familiar with it in detail.<br />
1. Since your PO are linked so tightly to SO why don't you use the PCS module? Then everything will be project oriented.<br />
2. How applicable it is in your case to use the MRP sales forecast (or even MPS)? Can you receive from your customers any sales shedule, which could be rough and made on a monthly or weekly basis but will provide you with an idea what are going to be your requirements to your suppliers, especially for items with long lead time periods or in cases when large amounts are ordered. <br />
3. Also you could use all the available order parameters like time fence planning, higher re-order points, safety time cushions and so on to make your deliveries less &quot;painfull&quot; and unpredictable.<br />
4. Even DRP is a solution depending on the case.<br />
<br />
All these are just ideas but you may find something usefull for your case.<br />
<br />
