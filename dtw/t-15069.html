<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">19th April 2004, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
A user was testing in test company on blocking negative stock for an item that does allow negative stock in live company. By mistake she blocked negative stock in live company. <br />
<br />
As a result for an order-line there was a partial delivery of amount 3 instead of 13. So, there are 10 allocated in whwmd215. The invoice was on the full 13 and the full 13 were indeed delivered. Meanwhile the order has been processed, and removed to history.<br />
<br />
Now I have a stock difference of 10, AND I have an allocated stock for this item-warehouse of 10.<br />
<br />
What is the best way to correct this? All I want is the stock to be correct, and the stock-information to be as correct as possible. If I just make a correction order, I think the allocated stock for 10 pieces will stay present, no?<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
<br />

You can run this session without  checking the &quot;update&quot; check box for verification. This should remove the allocated Quantity of 10 pcs as the order was already delivered.<br />
<br />
Second step in this is as you mentioned, you  need to to adjustment for 10 quantity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you happen to know what exactly the Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions session (whinp1200m000) does except for correcting the allocated stocks of delivered orders?<br />
<br />
When I run the sesion in test mode, it does a couple of more corrections for this item on different warehouses. I receive two reports; one per item, in which it seems to correct the 10 allocated receipts, and one per warehouse, which doesn't at all mention the relevant warehouse, only a different warehouse with a different correction.<br />
<br />
I don't really want to spend too much time and effort in correcting this, yet I do want everything to be correct at the end. <br />
<br />
Can you please advice and explain?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

Can I also do that as a first step (so that I can allow the user to proceed with correcting the stocks and remove the allocated receipt issue later)? Or will that disable proper functionality of whinp1200m000?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There can be cases like :<br />
<br />
1. A production order is closed , But still you find entry in whinp100. In such case it deletes that record.<br />
2. A purchase order is already received..But still Present in whinp100...It deletes that  record...  Some times,these kind of cases happens in Baan :-)<br />
<br />
I have been using this session for the past few years at different clinet sites...There is no problem with this session..It never does anything wrong..<br />
<br />
As per your second Questions...You can do any step first...You don't need to follow the Order..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ran the session already, but it didn't remove the stock allocation record. Probably there has been a manipulation by the user regarding this order. <br />
<br />
Never mind; it is not important enough to invest a lot of time/efforts on.<br />
