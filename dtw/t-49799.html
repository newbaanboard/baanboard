<br />
I have a question regarding warehouse information from Sales Contract.<br />
<br />
We are using sales contract (and sales contract delivery schedule) as a demand input to MRP.<br />
<br />
In the session &quot;Display Planned Inventory Transactions by Item&quot; it shows Wrh code as &quot;SH1&quot; with order type &quot;Sales Contract&quot; linked. However, we did not put in item master the default warehouse code for this item &quot;SH1&quot;, instead we put &quot;FTZ&quot;. We cheked the inventory storage, it was actually stored in warehouse &quot;FTZ&quot;, not &quot;SH1&quot;. We then checked the customer setting in common data, it seems no warehouse setting linked to the customer. Also in the maintain session of sales contract, we can not find the warehouse field that can be entered.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know where does Sales Contract draw Warehosue information? What can we do to let it show correct wrh code?<br />
<br />
Thanks and appreciate any replies.</div></div><hr />

The warehouse is not available as an input field in the contract lines but it IS stored in the table tdsls301. When determining the warehouse, first the user defaults are looked for (see tdsls4123m000) and in case none is defined there then the warehouse is taken from the item master (tiitm0101m000).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
