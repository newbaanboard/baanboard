<br />
We have created 1 generic code for our consumable item category maintenance engineering. That code is cost items and we have set the default unit for purchasing qty and pricing as pcs.  <br />
<br />
But we have issues with the code when we created purchase order for that code with units of measure is units or other than pcs.<br />
<br />
Please advise us how we can choose others uom rather than default unit for pricing and ordered qty while preparing the Purchase Order.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as i know if the item type was a cost item, you don't have to maintain the conversion unit coz the unit's still changeable. i'm doing fine in my company and nothing going wrong if i have to change it into different unit price.<br />
