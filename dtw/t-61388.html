<br />
First question, is there a way to automatically commingle all items from that business partner onto one Purchase Order without running the &quot;Commingle Purchase Orders&quot; session. There is a &quot;Combine Transfer Orders&quot; box in the TPOP session but it's not working for Purchase Orders.<br />
<br />
Second question: How do you get the Purchase Order that is created to pull the supply time in Item Purchase?  Currently it is defaulting to the Purchase Order Date and is populating that into the &quot;Planned Receipt Date&quot; on the PO line.<br />
<br />
Third question: What is the formula for the quantity generated? If you put in Items Ordering you get a differerent quantity that when you put in Warehouse Item.</div></div><hr />
