Consignment (not owned) Warehouse feature is not available in BaaN IVc4. What could be the best and practical workaround to map this process in IVc4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">19th January 2010, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We had used this in past by mapping the inventory and other transaction to different GL account.<br />
<br />
So, say if a purchase order is received in thewarehouse, instead of hitting AP, it would hit same account- DR, CR to same account, so financial result is zero,Now when the inventory is used up either by production or thru a sales process, then we would map the transaction accordingly. Consigment is purely a financial set up, so there is a work around in the system to handle it. Also, you may have to exclude this warehouse from inventroy valauton reports.<br />
