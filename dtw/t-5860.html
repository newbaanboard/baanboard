<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">17th July 2002, 17:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been asked by a colleague in purchasing how the Baan credit process works as we're having trouble finding functionality within Baan that meets our Credit process. I have included his comments below and would welcome any advise that anybody may be able to give.<br />
<br />
&quot;The problem is as follows:-<br />
<br />
1) We do not have the ability to raise credit applications through Baan by using either the original sales Order (with minus quantity) or by creating a new (credit) sales Order.  The additional information that would need to be collected on the sales order application is as follows:<br />
<br />
Our original invoice reference<br />
Our sales order reference<br />
Customer PO reference<br />
Reason for credit request (default text)<br />
Corrective action required (default text)<br />
<br />
2)  We do not currently use a Baan approval process which interacts with its users (e.g. - notification messages, prompts etc..) If we were able to raise a credit application in Baan this in turn needs to be authorised. Does Baan have a mechanism for doing this?<br />
<br />
If the above is not clear in anyway please let me know and I will ask for clarification<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">19th July 2002, 09:56</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding is that the following information is not available on the order header and this is needed.<br />
<br />
Our original invoice reference<br />
Our sales order reference (This would be available if the original order was used)<br />
Customer PO reference<br />
Reason for credit request<br />
Corrective action required<br />
<br />
Also there's the question about getting the credit authorised and having an approval process behind this.<br />
<br />
It may be an idea it I get my colleague to subscribe to bb.com as he's best positioned to answer these questions direct.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">19th July 2002, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds like you are on Baan 4. Fields that could be used are Ref A, Ref B and Cust PO Number. In 5 you have extra fields. Cust Order Number, Orig. Doc Type (Can select Order,Shipment or Invoice), Orig doc number and Return Reason.<br />
Another option is to create a standard text template that could be filled in by the person entering the order. The template could be called return info and filled in to save the info needed.<br />
<br />
Approval could probably be handled by using workflow as the std. software does no allowe for approval allthough in 5 you could create a manual activity (Could be called Approval) that needs to be released and added to the order type. Give access to specific people to the session to release the manual step.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pschwind</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I agree with Flip_J that workflow is a perfect solution to solve such a situation. It is built to control sequences of activities and their routing through the organisation - i.e. get the right work to the right person. <br />
<br />
With Baan IV (c4) there is an integration to COSA Workflow. This product has been integrated into Baan in 1999 by a joint development team of Baan Company and LEY, the company which has produced COSA Workflow - see also the threads in the DEM&amp;Workflow forum for more details (search for COSA).<br />
<br />
For additional information concerning myself and my company's ability to assist you in the areas of workflow implementations (business added values, optimal process modelling, business process optimization with COSA), please contact me at ps@schwindling.biz or visit our websites at http://www.schwindling.biz and http://www.cbs-network.com<br />
