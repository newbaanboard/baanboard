I have a problem here at my customers side with the so called &quot;reverse charge&quot; handling. This is how the zero VAT of deliveries of services between EU-countries is handled from January 2002 on.<br />
<br />
Now the finance people of my customer insist that for mixed orders (goods and services) there have to be two different invoices for formal reasons. Each invoice has to be tagged with a specific text (&quot;Reverse charge&quot; for services, &quot;Tax free delivery&quot; for the goods). <br />
<br />
Now my question is: Is that formalism (two invoices for one order) really requested or is my customer just overdoing here? And if not, has anyone else already had that problem and how was it handled? The only way I can think of is splitting the order into two or modifing the &quot;print invoices&quot; script.  Any better idea?<br />
