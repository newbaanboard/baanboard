<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ale_baan</div><div class="date">29th July 2004, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
am setting up the locations of our warehouse. We can assume as a first step that 1 location corresponds to 1 pallet and that in some cases will be fixed to just 1 code (yet, some locations will remain &quot;flexible&quot; to accept different items).<br />
<br />
Here's the situation:<br />
- I have set conversion factors from piece to box to pallet<br />
- such conversions are based on units; for example 1 pallet contains 36 boxes which contain 10 pieces, thus 1 pallet = 360 pieces<br />
- on what concerns measures (cm) I have set them for the boxes and the pallets, not for the items since they have 'particular' shapes<br />
- we receive the products from our suppliers in boxes; however we purchase by piece!<br />
- I want to establish a finite capacity to each location and to do it based on measures (cm)<br />
- I saw it is possible to establish also a max capacity by units (i.e. qty of pieces) but I want to avoid doing this since we have many many references and because, as said before, some locations will be share by different items<br />
- using max. capacity based on units Baan assigns a certain qty to the location and then suggests the use of another one (since the original is full). and this is ok<br />
- but, using max. capacity based on measures (cm) Baan exceeds the pallet measures accepting an infinite number of pieces!...<br />
<br />
I believe this is because there are no measures set for the piece itself (remember we purchase per piece), but because of the already mentioned 'particular shapes' issue it is not possible to establish measures at piece level, only at box level...<br />
<br />
If this is the case it would be necessary to make Baan convert 'upwards' from qty. to dimension. This means storing pieces (units) but till the maximum capacity in cm. is reached -which can only be assesed through the conversion to box and/or pallet<br />
<br />
well, this turned out to be a bit long  :rolleyes: I hope it is clear enough<br />
Any help?<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />
