<br />
any ideas how to solve the following problem concerning direct deliveries:<br />
<br />
Depending on the way of direct delivery (free on board, delivery ex quay ...) we have different price lists for the same supplier. When generating the the PUR-order, the pricelist is taken from the suppliers master data. No manual interaction is possible. Once the PUR-order is generated, no other pricelist can be assigned. Is there a way to deal with such a requirement?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

You will not be able to make any changes once you have received items against po, howwever, at initial point, changes are possible.  <br />
<br />
Check it out, have supplier linked to price list 1, create a new po, go to the price list field, should be able to change it.<br />

That's how it works in my system... :( Do you have a different behaviour?<br />
The problem is that when a PO is generated from a Salesorder the PO-lines are automatically inserted (and linked to the Salesorder). <br />

We do direct delivery sales orders and we are able to modify the PO price line. The only difference between our set up and what you have posted is that we do not associate a price list with the vendor (field is blank). We can then modify the PO price on the line (you will get a warning that Sales Lines are Present, just click OK). We have our system set this way because we don't use vendor price lists. Therefore I'm not sure how this set up would affect your ability to actually select a price list in the PO header (or even if you wish to).<br />

 We use direct delivery sales orders and we are able to modify the PO price line. We do not attach a price list with the vendor though. After direct delivery purchase order got created, we will go to the purchase order lines and modify the price as per the requirment. Price correction is allowed until the PO has been processed after the receipt.<br />
<br />
Check it out fisrt without linking the vendor with the price list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your help.<br />
Changing the price on orderline level has actually been our last option to solve the problem. It work's of course, but is a nasty job in case of hundrets of orderlines. We also thought of a global order discount which mathematically leads to the same result as a different price list. <br />
<br />

Else also use PRice list / PRice Group as yet another option, rather than individually indicating each option for discounts<br />
