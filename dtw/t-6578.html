<br />
We are working with BaaN 5.0c and having a problem regarding subcontracting operations linked to phantom item.<br />
<br />
When the production order is created the operations linked to the phantom item are included in the production planning.<br />
<br />
The problem is that when generating the purchase order, the quantity is set to the main item and not for the operated (phantom) item!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
This means that it is impossible to have the purchase price correct and makes it very dificult for the warehouse guys to receive the inventory (especially when it comes to parcial receipts).<br />
<br />
His this a real problem or it's just me imagining things???</div></div><hr />

That sounds like it blows away a suggestion I made for using phantoms. You may want to follow the other thread (see http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?threadid=6427)<br />
<br />
It deals with a different situation on IVc but involves a similar requirement: how to subcontract for quantities other than the main item of the SFC order.<br />

ps: This thread would get better attention if posted under Manufacturing &amp; Supply Chain. Maybe Pat will move it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanana</div><div class="date">6th September 2002, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">We faced the same problem but I don't think it's related to the phantom functionality.<br />
<br />
In our situation the main item quantity does need to be sent to the subcontractor, it's just the timing of it that is a broblem. There can be several deliveries for the same operation.<br />
So no problem with the purchase order and receipts because  we open the order on the main item qty and receive partially each time.<br />
We did need to customize our packig slip that goes to the subcontractor to include a partial qty. (We use a ps instead of the standard subcontracting note).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Baanana that the problem is probably not be related to phantoms per se. <br />
<br />
In the thread I mentioned previously, Sturla pointed out that it is possible to link items in the BOM to specific operations. Logically, that is the way to force an operation to relate to a qty other than the main item/order qty. And it should apply to all items, including phantoms. But I suspect that unless you issue the phantom instead of its components, the subcontract operation may still be planned for the SFC main item qty.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I havent tested this and SFC is not my major. (Indeed, I may know just enough SFC to be dangerous. But then, thats what I tell my logistics colleagues in crime about their grasp of Finance!)<br />

<br />
Was having the same problem with Antonio. I know I read about this thread in the past, so even when I couldn't find the solution on Baan Support, I kept on looking there with different search keyword until I found it. It's 159638, solved around about the time Antonio talked about this case. Thanks to you, Antonio.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />
