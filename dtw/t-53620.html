The result is that currently we have to do the donkey work of taking the entries from baan and from the other company's software and then compare them manually. <br />
<br />
Is there a more elegant/humane/intelligent way of doing this ? <br />
<br />
I mean can we automate this process somehow ? <br />
<br />
Or is there support in baan for this already e.g. cycle count etc.<br />
<br />
Ideally we would need to see the same transaction in baan and in the 3rd party's system and these transactions can be compared. However, there is no mapping of transactions as such e.g. we can automate the system to check transactions but there is no direct mapping for the dispatch data.</div></div><hr />

But if any discrepancies occur, you still not human to find out the reason.<br />
<br />
I think a better way, if possible, is to avoid the entries of transactions on the two system separately. I will suggest to import the inventory transactions from the external warehous system in Baan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can create a table in Baan to import the data from the warehouse system by scheduled job etc. and then run a report to get the desired output.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">12th September 2008, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">create a custom script to compare and report. baan do have a cycle count program where the data are held in a cycle count table. there you can analyze and make changes as necessary. in our case we have the data in excel and upload to the cycle count table. once you're satisfied with the number you can process the cycle count so the inventory goes into the Item data by Warehouse.</div></div><hr />
