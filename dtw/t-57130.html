I'm working for a company that lives by Baan. The fellow that was handling inventory consitantly had it jacked up and is no longer with the company. So now I have to do a cycle count on all of the raw inventory by the end of the day and no one knows how. <br />
<br />
Does someone have a link that they could post up that would walk me through the steps??? <br />

Please??? <br />
