<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sturla</div><div class="date">19th October 2001, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I work for a client that use one itemgroup for all their manufactured items. That makes a lot of things complicated in Baan IVc4, like selecting in reports, global update of sales prices and also a lot of other things.<br />
I have made a logical system system to split up the item group they have in several other item groups for manufactured items (from 1 to about 50 groups), and the change can be done in one or two hours.<br />
<br />
Does anyone of you see any negative consequenses in changing from one group to many? <br />
<br />
Thanks:confused:</div></div><hr />

Statistics will be less reliable<br />
Watch out for you (integration) mapping with finance</div></div><hr />

They don't use sales statistics!<br />
The procedure:<br />
<br />
1. Print all items where item group is going to be changed to Excel,<br />
2. We made a rule to uppdate all items with new item group in the spreadsheet,<br />
3. Maintain new Item groups in Baan, (manually)<br />
4 Maintain Item Default Data, (manually)<br />
5. Maintain Surcharges by Item Group, (manually)<br />
6. Modify the customization that links item groups to GL-accounts,<br />
7. Import new itemgroups from the spreadsheet to tiitm001.citg by using Baan Excange.<br />
<br />
Thats it.:D <br />
 We used approx. 6 hours to do the job and changed item group for 5900 items.<br />
