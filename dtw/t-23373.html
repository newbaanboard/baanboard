I have met a problem that the total inventory are not equal to on hand in all warehouses for some items, that means tiitm001.stoc is not equal to sum(tdinv001.stoc) by item, but sum(tdinv001.stoc) is equal to sum(tdilc101.stks) by item.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know what happen?<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For Bann IV try session tdinv0252m000 (correction session, not in browser yet)<br />
It will correct differences between ilc, inv and itm stoc.<br />
Not sure but there should be an equivalent session for BV<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be careful with tdinv0252m000. First of all this program assumes that the data in tdilc101 are correct and the data in tiitm001 wrong. Secondly, when executing the session no transactions are created in Finance (tfgld410).<br />
<br />
In my opinion (which is just one of probably many) it's best to sort out which data are correct. Do a physical count of the data that are present in your warehouse in order to decide which data are correct. If tiitm001 is correct, create a cycle counting order in order to correct tdinv001 and tdilc101 (so that you also create the financial transaction and Distribution and Finance are in sync) and after that change the figure you have in tiitm001 by table maintenance. If tdilc101 and tdinv001 are correct, change the figure in tiitm001 (no financial transaction is necessary).<br />
<br />
To answer your question how this situation could have arisen: impossible to say. Over the years bugs have appeared in Baan that result in a corrupt update of the respective tables and it depends on your software level whether these bugs still exist on your system. In order to find out, try to retrace via tdinv700 which transaction might be resonsible for the inconsistency. Next to that it could be due to a customisation you have that results in a wrong update of tables. It's guess work from where I'm standing.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
Run tdinv0250m000 (Rebuild Planned Inventory Transaction) and tdilc0250m000 (Rebuild Inventory Data) if ILC implemented.<br />
<br />
I think this will solve your problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankadam</div><div class="date">11th March 2005, 11:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Manoj, Kittyfeng,<br />
<br />
Tdinv0250m000 and tdilc0250m000 don't update the inventory on hand figures (in either tiitm001, tdinv001 or tdilc101) but only the allocated inventory, the inventory on hold and on order and the expected inventory after completely rebuilding the planned inventory transactions. In other words, it won't help.<br />
