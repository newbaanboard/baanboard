<br />
We are using Baan IV c2 with Oracle back-end.<br />
<br />
Due to some wrong update of ILC Parameters, table tdilc301 (Inventory Transactions by Location (History)) has stopped recording ILC Transactions History and this continued for a period of 1 month. <br />
<br />
We have identified the Parameter, corrected it and the system started re-recording of ILC Transactions History.<br />
<br />
Our problem is how to bring back the data lost so that table tdilc301 is in sync ? Can we populate this table tdilc301 from some other tables for the data lost ?<br />
<br />
Can someone throw light upon the tables involved ? <br />
<br />
Table tdinv700 can be taken as the starting point i.e. it should take all orders from this table for a particular time period, get Location and Lot data from some other tables and then,  use that data to create a record in table tdilc301.<br />
<br />
Please advise on those other tables involved.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
PS - Hello Moderator, please post this thread to some other suitable topic; if it's too techical.</div></div><hr />

We are having the same problem... when the initial inventory was entered to the system, no transactions were recordered in ilc301. Now we are trying to create some crystal report and we are not getting the right information.<br />
<br />
Have you find any solutions for re-creating transactions in ilc301?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

BaaN said there are no programs avbl to re-create records in tdilc301. Since this problem appears to be so common I hope BaaN would make some correction program for this. Also I am not sure whether we can track the actual lot and location data from tdinv700.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">7th March 2002, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Since tdilc301 is only appended to, it is possible to re-instate that data from tdinv700 by writing a new session. Difficult but possible. Only problem is if you have multiple locations, then you would need a 'compromise' decision as to which specific location  to 'move into' or 'move from' to serve as a default.  The other aspect is with Purchase or Manufacturing Receipts, where there are at least three records in ilc301 for each inv700 (Receipt into REC Location, Transfer FROM REC Location, Transfer into FINALLOCATION). If there is inspection required, it will have a different set of records. Each transaction type will have its own different way of logging into tdilc301, but most are one-to-one. The new session, if written, can become a good utility. (Using the Order Type and Order Number, one can refer back to the original Order information, if necessary).<br />
<br />
There will be many people to convince about the decisions made, especially Finance.</div></div><hr />
