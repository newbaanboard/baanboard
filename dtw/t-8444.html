<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">15th January 2003, 19:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently using internal EDI between our Baan companies. We are now looking to start using external EDI with a third party supplier.<br />
<br />
Could somebody give me a high level explanation as to how this set-up will probably work. I know we need some form of EDI translation software that sits between our Baan system and our suppliers systems but how does everything fit together?<br />
<br />
My understanding is that the EDI message will probably comply to the EDIFACT (being in Europe) standard and the process will work as follows:-<br />
<br />
1. The supplier's system will send their EDI message<br />
2. This message is received by our system and sent to the translation software.<br />
3. The EDI message is converted into a format recognised by Baan.<br />
4. Baan sessions will then read the message in and create the orders, acknowledgements etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Either correct or incorrect please add as much as you can to my understanding.<br />
<br />
Could somebody please recommend translations software systems.<br />
<br />
Are there any particular resources on the web that may be of use to me?<br />
<br />
I'll appreciate all the information you can give.<br />
<br />
many thanks<br />

Usually if you are the buyer and your third party is the seller then it starts with a purchase order on your side, this is send to the supplier, your order is processed at the supplier, it sends back an acknowledgement, which in turn is processed by your system.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to do direct ftp or email between the two of you, you will need a mailbox on a VAN network, such as IBM's<br />
<br />
1: your BaaN system generates a PO edi message<br />
2: translate/convert into EDIFACT or X.12 message format<br />
3: send to suppliers EDI mailbox<br />
4: supplier picks up message, and converts EDIFACt/X.12 message into format he can process<br />
<br />
5: when sales order is generated at your supplier, it can generate a acknowledgement, convert to EDIFACt/X.12 and send to your EDI mailbox<br />
<br />
6: you pick up the message<br />
7: translate EDIFACT/X.12 into your BaaN BEMIS format (which BaaN EDI module can process<br />
8: order acknowledgement data is processed into your purchase order (e.g. scheduled/changed delivery date)<br />
<br />
Suggestion: besides buying and implementing the transalation software yourself you can also outsource the translation to the third party that hosts your EDI mailbox, if you need a contact please send me an email.<br />
