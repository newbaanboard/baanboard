after a lot of R&amp;D i came to resolve the issue. There is link generating between the financial and logistical companies in session &quot;tcemm1170m000&quot;, from the fields Exchange Rate Types of Purchase and Sales (This should same in Finance and Logistic companies). <br />
Now i am able to create Departments / Warehouses in current logistic company linking to other Financial Company.<br />
