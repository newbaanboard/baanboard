<br />
The incidentals that I have in mind are costs that are not included in the purchase price of the supplier (overseas in this case). Items such as sea-freight and freight from wharf to repackager and then to our warehouse , re-packaging materials and external repackaging costs.<br />
<br />
We use standard &quot;td pur&quot; purchasing module and there doessn't seem to be facilities to collect these costs against the item / product.  An order needs to be raised aganist the supplier of each of the incidentals and the supplier of the basic product. <br />
<br />
Previous exposure to SSA's PRMS system (10 years ago) used very flexible purchase burden cost components to handle this sort of cost that is in addition to the price paid to the manufacturer of the basis product.<br />
<br />
(Till now the incidence of purchased product has been minimal for us -- we are a manufacturer and baan has handled this very well)  <br />
<br />
Look forward to learning from you<br />

<br />
There are few other threads discussing freight here in BaanBoard, but I'm sure you've read those. Unfortunately, the only suggestion I have been able to give to customers so far regarding this is to charge a standard freight cost to these items. Of course it's an ugly way of doing this, and probably Baan (or SSA now) should try to include this functionalities built in using better method instead. I'm curious to know how PRMS did it<br />

But I do remember that PRMS had the facility of having at least one Purchase Burden (overhead) that depended on other factors.<br />
<br />
The operation where I used this charged various overhead percentages to its &quot;branches&quot; for products that were purchased centrally. This additional cost was related to factors such as Item/Product group codes. <br />
<br />
I think PRMS was very flexible in regards these cost elements which were very much like baan's cost componnets.  For example I think it was possible to have numerous overhead components on manufactured items rather than the 2 that BaanIV has.<br />
<br />
Sorry my memory is not more lucid but it may be worthwhile checking with SSA to get a better idea.</div></div><hr />
