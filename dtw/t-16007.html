<br />
Imagine we have a purchase part that successfully seeks QC approval. QC will then maintain approval in BaaN.  Unfortunately, when come to production, the production people reject this part. Later, QC confirms that this part is not good to be used in production.<br />
<br />
As QC already maintain approval in BaaN,  how can we reverse this approval so that the part is return to supplier and later receive this part by warehouse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1) The defective purchase part is transferred using RPL from Production warehouse to rejection warehouse of the store.(assuming a part of it is not consumed in production)<br />
<br />
2) A manual PO with -ve qty. is made and the part is sent back to the supplier, thus the stock in warehouse gets corrected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the feedback. We also have this idea but we found the flow is too long. <br />
<br />
Does anyone did a customization to overcome this problem.</div></div><hr />
