Does anybody happen to know the difference between the first and second pass during purchase/sales order entry? Seems like what BaanERP means by second pass is not the editing of the header but an actual second pass during order creation. What is this second pass for? Thanks very much<br />

Thanks. Actually I missed your post from my list of New Posts. Must be the tricky counter mechanism.<br />
<br />
But Flip, there are 3 categories in Order Input Control regarding the header. They are first pass on header, second pass on header, and edit of header. What's the difference between the 3 then?<br />
<br />
I was asking this because I thought it might shed some light on how to set up the Order Input Control. My setting works fine for normal orders, but is having problem for cost or return orders. I set up the control to be exactly the same for all kind of orders and it seems to be having problem during the second pass. Sometimes, I have to go back to form 1 and tab all the way again at the header of a cost PO, before the order line session pops up.<br />
<br />
How to set it up correctly? I can't find anything on it in the B5c documentation CD. Does order input control work by the way?<br />
<br />
THanks very much<br />
