I'am writing my master thesis on advantages and disadvantages of a WMS. The company which I'am focusing on want to know all their possibilities. They are chosing between a stand-alone WMS or a expand their use of the ERP.<br />
<br />
They use Baan IVc today and would like to know what an implementation of Location Control and Lot Control has for an impact on their company. So I'am asking you experts for some help.<br />
<br />
Which preparations and changes do you need to do to implement these subsystem without to much difficulties?<br />
<br />
Second, what are the advantages and disadvantages once it's in use?<br />
Anything else one should think about?<br />
<br />
I would appreciate if you could be very clear and thourough because I have very limited experience of Baan.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

Implementing location or lot control is the need of process and not something one desires. As the name suggest location control system would help to have inventory designated by location and lot control gives tracking ability the usage in different transaction. I guess your question should be reframed- You need to ask if standard Baan location and Lot control will satisfy a requirement of business (specify the requirement) and then the board members can better answer it. In my experience Baan can handle a some complex way of managinng inventory in warehouse and ofcourse it is can be modified also to fullfill the deficiencies.<br />
