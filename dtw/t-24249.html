<br />
We're looking at having one company linked to another company so that a sales order in the second company is created when someone creates a purchase order in the first company.<br />
<br />
These companies are not part of the same group company.  In fact, there would have to be a currency conversion when the sales order is created.<br />
<br />
I assume that this will probably require EDI but we don't have this implemented right now.  Is there any other methods of achieving this?<br />
<br />
We're running Triton 3.1b.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice/help provided.</div></div><hr />
