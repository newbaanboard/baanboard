<br />
we are on B40 c4 / SP14<br />
<br />
when we use Inventory Adjustment / Inventory transfer using session &quot;tdilc1120m000&quot; the system determines the order number as 500001 always with 50 series.<br />
<br />
the series number &quot;50&quot; for W/H order, is it hard coded?????  <br />
OR can you pls tell me where this series number for warehouse order defined<br />
<br />
the problem is, it assigns for every transaction a new warehouse order number (no position or line seq number given, but a new warehouse order every time).  This way we can have a maximum of 100000 orders only. we are using it so freqent that we fear overflowing the order number soon.<br />
<br />
any ideas... pls<br />

1 purchase<br />
2 sales<br />
3 prod issue<br />
4 prod receipt<br />
5 stockcorrection<br />
6 transfer<br />
7 inventory<br />
<br />
If you are running out of free numbers, customization would be the solution.<br />

<br />
since we are going to use AFS for the inventory transfer,<br />
<br />
i think we will keep on backnumbering the first free number before we do the inventory transfer.  Even when I backnumber the first free number,  it is putting the old order number with a sequence number religiously<br />
<br />
BUT would it create any  duplicates entry in tdinv or in tf integration.<br />

<br />
                    Did you solve the order no. issue because I am faced with the same issue.  I ahve just restared theorder numbers since they were full. Did you have any issue in integrations?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried creating Inventory Transfer for many items under a single order by keeping on backnumbering the &quot;ffno&quot; in series no for Warehouse Order/60.<br />
<br />
I went to integration and posted all these transactions: They got posted nicely; no probs.<br />
<br />
Also I went one step further by going back to Inventory transfer for few more items under the same order number. Now when I checked the integration the order had those old lines as posted and the new lines as unposted. When I posted again these new lines too got posted nicely.<br />
<br />
So I dont see any problems in this logic. We use a single order number for any given date by keeping on backnumbering the &quot;ffno&quot;.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gary P</div><div class="date">31st March 2004, 21:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I echo the other replies. Since the key to the tables are actually warehouse order # and the date/time stamp we don't have any problems with accurate data, transactions and integrations. We probably now have better than 5,000 duplicate warehouse order numbers since we reset the first free number. <br />
<br />
I do have one suggestion. Please consider archiving your inventory transactions when you reset. We did not do this for many months and it caused user confusion (looking at 2 warehouse orders with the same number). At least the first use of the number will be in your archive company and the nost recent use will be live.</div></div><hr />
