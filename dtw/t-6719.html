<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 03:16</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the issues we have with the standard Baan shipping module is that we need to schedule trucks ahead of time. We are make to order, so a customer places an order, and typically about 1-2 days before the goods will go to stock, the shipping department calls in a truck.<br />
<br />
Lets say I have 5 lines on a sales order in Baan. When I release the outbound, and confirm the pick list, lets say Baan creates 5 different &quot;shipments.&quot; The problem is that in Baan50.b, in order to place multiple shipments onto a &quot;load,&quot; the goods have to be &quot;picked&quot; in Baan, and be on a &quot;shipment&quot;. But we want to compose the &quot;load&quot; 2 days before the goods even come to stock, so there is no way in the system to compose a &quot;load,&quot; since we have not confirmed the pick list yet, and they are not on a &quot;shipment&quot;<br />
<br />
Any ideas????</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately you would need a workaround for Baan 5.0<br />
a. Received items in advance to create the load. Correct later if variance.<br />
b. Customise a report. Could use shortage report of outbound as the items are not there yet. Change the layout etc.</div></div><hr />
