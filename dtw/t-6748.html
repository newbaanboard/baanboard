<br />
Depending of what you want the solution is slighty different. Except for automotive EDI, there are not special prerrequisites. Tell me what you want and I can help you.<br />

<br />
The baan EDI module can generate and read ASCII files with a flexible format. When you use Baan EDI to exchange documents, these ASCII files are transalted or reformatted, using standard EDI mesage formats, such as ANSI XI2, UN/EDIFACT etc by a 3rd party transalator, to provide a format supported by your trading relation. The data  files are typically transferred between external trading partners over commerial  or non commercial networks. <br />
<br />
3rd party transalations and communications software handles the transalation of the ASCII files that are created are received by Baan EDI. This 3rd party software may additionally provide encryption for transferring data over unsecured networks. Baan EDI software does not provide this translation and communicaiton functionality. This enviornment is treated as an external EDI <br />
<br />
The trasfer of internal EDI messages is similar to external EDI situation except for the transalation and communciation requirements. Internal EDI is also referred to as  multicompay or multisite. In multysite EDI implemenations the ASCII files are usually trsansfrrerred over an internal company network ( LAN or WAN) which means that encryption is not required. Also because all companies or sites in the multisites structure use the  same format for the ASCII files, transalation to a differenct external EDi Standard generally is not required.  <br />

trust this is enought for the moment to digest and trust i was able to provide you with some insight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tomparek has explained it very well... first you have to think (or ask) in which &quot;language&quot; or standarized format (if any) you want or need to communicate with those companies. Once you have that solved, you can think about the way to implement EDI. If you have any more questions just let it know.<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you soon...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also why don't you check with the Baan Shanghai office or call the Baan support in PRC. There are some good documents on EDI and I know a few consultants who can assist you with a training.<br />
Also Baan Support may have some good documents.  <br />
<br />
 cheers<br />
