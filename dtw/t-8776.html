<br />
while its possible to issue sales order back-dated,<br />
apparently its impossible to insert warehouse traffic with the past date?<br />
<br />
state gives us default grace period of 4 months to set our records but we have no means unless we figure this one out!</div></div><hr />

thankyou</div></div><hr />

&quot;set up account by reason code&quot; <br />
<br />
you read that  together &amp; created confusion<br />
<br />
what i can say  is he means for each adjustment u can set reason code in feild provided in session tdilc1120m000<br />
<br />
he just mean you can have record for audit that why you did such inventory adjutment &amp; you can use it as supporting document <br />
it doesn't have any relation to finance account<br />
<br />
<br />
Financial entries are seprete from this for inventory adjustment</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use Adjustment Reason Code by itself to analyze the adjustments. You will have to write a special report to do so as standard Baan does not provide a report by Adjustment Reason Code.<br />
<br />
You also can assign to an Adjustment Reason Code a specific ledger account. That account overrides the normal integration mappings.<br />
