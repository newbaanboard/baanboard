I am not able to calculate delivery date on sales order tdsls4101m000 on basis of route( defined in session &quot;Maintain routes tcmcs0104m000&quot;)<br />
<br />
parameter &quot;Determine route with transportation in session tccom0000m000&quot; is set to Yes<br />
<br />
<br />
as the feild (tdsls040.ddat) help says if parameter determine route with transportation is Yes then delivery date can be calculated on basis of routes.<br />
Otherwise delivery date can be calclulated on basis of receipt date<br />
<br />
<br />
Kindly revert back ASAP<br />

<br />
until you will be able to calculate delivery dates according to route plans you have to adjust parameters and settings in Transportation very carefully.<br />
A brief overwiev of what has to be done:<br />
<br />
- Maintain Standard Route and link Standard Route to Route <br />
- Maintain Date and Times by Standard Route<br />
- Maintain Order Procedures (TR)<br />
- Maintain Route Plans<br />
- Maintain Route Plan Lines and link Standard Route to Plan Lines<br />
- Maintain Order Types (SLS/PUR) and link Oder Procedure (TR) to Order Type (form 2)<br />
<br />
Done. :) <br />
<br />
I skipped some smaller settings within Transportation which you will easily detect when stepping through the procedure above. In case of any problems don't hesitate to come back to me for further questions. Good luck!<br />

martin<br />
<br />
i just wanna clarify<br />
are you talking about linking of route plan with standard route <br />
<br />
or <br />
&quot;Routes defined in session &quot;Maintain routes tcmcs0104m000&quot;)<br />
<br />
 to standard route  route plan<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm talking about both...<br />
Setting up Routes in tcmcs... is not enough in order to calculate delivery dates in sales orders. To make things working you have to set up the whole integration between Transportation and Distribution. In our company the calculation runs fine with the settings I mentioned in my previous post. Maybe you have to make some modifications depending on your needs, but basically this is the way to proceed.<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
when entering a salesoder in our system I get the following message after leaving the field Route Plan 'Planned Delivery may be dd-mm-yy' and the Reciept Date (next field) is calculated automatically (next available date from today in the calendar of the standard route). The Delivery Date has to calculated by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;[D].<br />
This does not work the other way round (entering the delivery- and calculating reciept-date) although the option is displayed in the status bar :confused: <br />
Bug or feature?<br />

<br />
Thats fine friend. i tried my best to calculate receipt date but it's working in same fashion as you said.<br />
<br />
well i wanna know do you agree that receipt date calculation should be done on logic i given.<br />
<br />
<br />
as if you consider my example at your end  you are giving receipt date 7 days  after delivery whereas actualy its 2.31 days<br />
<br />
asking you for solid second opinion on logic of my requirement.<br />
<br />

<br />
it took me several attempts but it's working fine now. Try the following:<br />
1) enter a salesorder including route plan<br />
2) enter a reciept date greater than the delivery date you have in mind - actually it does not matter which reciept date you enter, it's only to avoid the error message 'Reciept date cannot be before delivery date'<br />
3) enter the delivery date which fits to start of the standard route<br />
4) go back to the field reciept date and... the system calculates it automatically according to the lead time in the route plan :D <br />
<br />
Tricky indeed (Baan logic :rolleyes: ) and I'm not sure whether it's applicable for your users - but it works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sammeer</div><div class="date">4th April 2003, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">HI MARTIN<br />
<br />
IT STILL CALCULATING 15/04/03 INSTEAD OF 11/04/03 ON RECEIPT DATE FEILD.<br />
<br />
i try to explain again:<br />
<br />
standard route( to which route is linked) defined staring 01/04/03 with exceution frequency of 7 days it means 08/04/03..... 15/04/03....... 22/04/03.... 29/04/03....&amp; so on<br />
<br />
Now on my route plan( here standard rote is linked) lead time is 55.55 hrs means 2.31 days so if i book order today on 04/04/03 system calculates delivery date 08/04/03 the nearest one according to standard route.<br />
now as you said i go back to receipt date feild the system calculates receipt date as 15/04/03 instead of 11/04/03 as per my lead time in route plan.<br />
<br />
well i too agree here it seem some baan Logic<br />
  but  we have to try:rolleyes: <br />
<br />

strange, really strange...<br />
Let's have one more try: did you check the adress calendar for the End Adress in the route plan? Maybe you've defined some closure days? <br />
When I look at the data you get, it seems that the systems does not take the lead time into consideration but takes the frequence of the standard route (08/04/03 and 15/04/03 are a difference of 7 days). Just an idea...<br />
I have to admit that setting up a proper configuration is really hard work and took us also several weeks in the end.<br />
<br />
Don't give up ;) <br />
