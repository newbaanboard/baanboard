<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">14th April 2009, 11:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I was task to develop this report based on the following user's requirements:<br />
<br />
1) Aging by Warehouse/item.<br />
2) Aging is calculated from the date the inventory is received into warehouse from vendor (purchase receipt).<br />
3) If an item is transferred from warehouse A to warehouse B, then the aging for this item in warehouse B should be calculated from the date when the inventory is received warehouse A from vendor.<br />
4) Items are not lot control.<br />
5) User should be able to print the report based on a passed date.<br />
6) User has sevaral warehouses of which the inventory can be transferred within this warehouses.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me if I have the enough information to build this report. If yes, can I know the tables.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For preparing Inventory Aging Report, your Inventory Outbound method must be FIFO or LIFO in order to track the inventory date.<br />
<br />
I have prepared a SRS, may be this can help you, just go through it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">15th April 2009, 07:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Nishant,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
If an item is transferred from one warehouse to another (Point 3 in my first post), how can you find the GRN date in the original warehouse ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nishant</div><div class="date">15th April 2009, 08:31</div></div><div class="posttext">HI Teddy,<br />
<br />
There is not impact of Transfer Date or GRN Date on Inventory Date, your Inventory Date will remain same till it is out from your system &amp; the Inventory Date will be generated when you recieve the Inventory in ur system for the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">15th April 2009, 12:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi nishant,<br />
<br />
Remember that our inventories are not on lot controlled. So, the inventory date is not available in table whinr140.<br />
<br />
Please correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajeev Kumar</div><div class="date">15th April 2009, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Teddy,<br />
<br />
If your Inventory is LIFO/FIFO controled then definetly whir140 is updated with inverory transaction date.. <br />
<br />
Well if you are not finding date in whinr140 , it means your inventory is location controled .<br />
<br />
Now come on the solution part. <br />
Take the selection of Item, Warehouse , And transaction date from table whina112.<br />
If whina112.qstk&lt;&gt;whina.qskt then use the whina.qskt= In hand Inventory.<br />
Now store the whina112.koor,whina112.orno, whina112.pono, whina112.srnb, whina112.itid.<br />
<br />
Now the basis of  whina112.itid open the table whina124. Find the whina124.tror <br />
 if the whina124.tror=’64’( Warehouse receipt) . then open the table whina114 on the basis of  whina112.koor,whina112.orno, whina112.pono, whina112.srnb and find the whina114.trtd( The GRN date)<br />
else<br />
In Case of whina124.tror = ‘1’(purchase order)/production receipt then whinh124.trtd is actual receipt date.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help in your scenario.<br />
<br />
If any further query please mail me @ rajiv.bobby@gmail.com</div></div><hr />

<br />
As i hav already mentioned in my first post, you need to have FIFO OR LIFO outbound method to calculate the correct age of stock lying in your W/H.<br />
<br />
If you calculate the Age on the basis of Inventory Transaction date, you can't get the correct age, as Inventory Transaction date will update for each nd every transaction (in warehour transfer also which u hav mentioned in ur query) &amp;  you can never track your inventory without a unique ID.<br />
<br />
As per me you hav to use LIFO/FIFO outbound method to track your inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajeev Kumar</div><div class="date">16th April 2009, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I am agree with you !! if we use FIFO/LIFO then we can get correct agging according to your given SRS, But if  the Inventory is  not LIFO/FIFO controled. In that case,  we can also get the agging through mentioned procedure in my previous post.<br />
In my post i am also consedering, Whether the transaction is purchase/Production/warehouse transfer, If it is warehouse transfer, then system go back and capture the actual Transaction date when GRN was made.<br />
<br />
It might be a lengthy logic .. but according to my observation , i will work accordingly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">20th April 2009, 10:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Rajeev, nishant,<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the suggestion. <br />
<br />
Our inventory is not FIFO/LIFO. So, have to consider Rajeev's suggestion. <br />
<br />
Once again, many thanks for the great help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashok_elgi</div><div class="date">25th September 2013, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">hi,<br />
I tried with almost the same logic, Iam in ERP LN FP7 and my outbound is by location.<br />
and it is not by LIFO/FIFO.<br />
I ve found the list of GRNS made which is ending up in whina112.qstk by going inside a loop between 112 and 114 tables, but how do i match the resultant whina112.qstk in the list of GRNs which is obtained from query.<br />
My to be consumed qty (whina112.qskt) is after many transfers between 2 warehouses.</div></div><hr />
