When we run MRP it considers all the inventory in the nettable warehouses. So warehouse A might have the inventory but warehouse B will require it.  but MRP will just consider it as A+B. <br />
<br />
Now how to find out that users need to make transfers from warehouse A to B? is there is automatic procedure to do it? if not please suggest some practical way out...<br />

<br />
we faced a very similar problem years ago. We were told that the DRP-module (part of Tranportation) is responsible for that. The DRP-run generates planned RPL-orders which can be confirmed and tranferred (similar to MRP-orders).<br />
We took a short glance on it and decided to create the RPL-orders manually. Mostly because Transportation is not the best supported module in Baan IV (we know what we talking about because we're using Transportation for other purposes :) ) and a manual workaround is acceptable for us.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
Yes, DRP order setup would be painful here. so manual rpl orders is the only good way out. <br />
<br />
But which report do you get the users so that they know a manual rpl order needs to be created?<br />
<br />
will we need to customize the reports? if yes from which tables do you suggest. ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">17th June 2003, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, a customized report (or session) is very useful. We created a report called 'Planned Inventory Transactions by Warehouse and Item' which reads table tdinv150 - a piece of cake for your programmers :) . Even the required key in tdinv150 is already present. I don't know why this kind of session/report does not exist in standard Baan, our users love it.<br />

Best regards,<br />
