<br />
I am trying to link request-for-quotations to a Purchase Order &quot;PO&quot;. This means, setup up a request to an existent supplier, input his/her answer and, thereafter, convert such RFQ to an actual PO.<br />
<br />
The problem I face is that when pressing the button &quot;Copy&quot; I get the &quot;not data within selection&quot; message. I believe am following Baan V instructions properly though...<br />
did anyone face this before?? ..what can be missing?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

<br />
1. I suppose you did fill in the ranges correctly in session tdpur1202m000.<br />
2. The rfq line should be set to &quot;Convert to Order&quot; in session tdpur1805m000.<br />
3. expiry date on the rfq line should not be filled or should be in the future.<br />
<br />
Succes,<br />

<br />
I can see that session tdpur1805m000 (your second point)  has no data -is empty.<br />
..but let me say that am noy comparing RFQs for different suppliers but, instead, just trying to convert to PO directly an RFQ returned from one supplier.<br />
<br />
Am not sure if in this case as well the aforesaid tdpur1805m000 has to be filled in. because in such case could be the cause of the &quot;no data&quot; message I receive.<br />
your opinion?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

After that a record will be shown in tdpur1805m000 and you will be able to convert it to a purchase order.<br />

<br />
I think the error I was making was not to start from the Compare Quotations, as you suggested. From specific (in tdpur1110m000), and going to &quot;Totals per Supplier&quot;, am able to activate the column &quot;Copy RFQ Line&quot; and therafter generate the Purchase Order.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />
