<br />
Does anybody know, from which module, process, source .... or whatever, in standard BaanERP 5.0c,  tcibd001.csig (signalcode) is written? We supposed, that one out of our inventory sessions (which are heavily customized) do the job. But at the moment I find neither in the sources, nor by trying the inventory sessions anything what helps me further.<br />
So I hope, that if someone can tell me how the standard is, that I find something in our custs.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<br />
thank you for the anwer. But I need to know how signalcodes comes into tcibd001.csig? What sessions update that field?<br />

tcibd0501m000/tcibd0101m000 this are the sessions which finally maintain table tcibd001. But I don't ask for manually maintaining tcibd001.csig. I'm looking for processes which are doing that.<br />
Let's try to tell my problem that way: In our company a rumor is saying, that tcibd001.csig is updated somehow from inventory. If an item is untouched in warehouse for a long time the signalcode for this item will be automatically updated in a certain way. So far the rumor. <br />
<br />
My problems:<br />
- At the moment nobody seems to able to simulate such a behavior<br />
- If this rumor is true, then nobody nows if it is standard or a customization<br />
- I personally try to find something in the sources, but until now, without success :-( <br />
<br />
So I would be happy if somebody can definitely say: In Baan standard tcibd001.csig is not updated by any process. or which procces does this job.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

Hello Richard,<br />
<br />
in B IV and LN standard the item signal tiitm001.csig / tcibd001.csig has to be maintained in item master.<br />
<br />
With a customisation the described behavior maybe appear.<br />
<br />
Check where the domain is used with session ttadv4410m000, maybe this will give you a hint.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sure that will be the same BaanERP 5. That explains why I'm not able to find such an assignment in the sources.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Check where the domain is used with session ttadv4410m000, maybe this will give you a hint.<br />
Regards<br />
I personally perfer the &quot;grep&quot; command.<br />
<br />
So I think I can make the conclusion that there is no programmatically assignment to tcibd001.csig.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
