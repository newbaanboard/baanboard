<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gary P</div><div class="date">18th July 2003, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">We're testing the forecast functionality. What we'd like to do is forecast by warehouse. We have three spares warehouses with very different usage profiles. Ideally we'll be able to set parts up In Items By Warehouse tdinv0101 with a forecast method (right now we're testing Moving Average) and then run session tdinv4230 Calculate Forecast. In tdinv4230 we select a specific warehouse when calculating the forecast. We expected to ONLY get the forecast for the selected warehouse, but the forecast is calculated based on the shipments and issues from ALL warehouses. Does anyone have any insight? Are we doing something wrong? Have we missed a switch , a field, a set up option or something? We've checked all the parameters, the item master, items by warehouse, forecast method etc.<br />
<br />
And, since I'm posting. We haven't gotten this far yet but can I assume that the resulting forecast can be dumped systemically into MPS/MRP?<br />
<br />
Thanks in adavance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">19th July 2003, 03:47</div></div><div class="posttext">(1) The inventory parameter &quot;Item Issue History by Warehouse has to be set to YES for the calculations to happen by warehouse. Note the input form filters which warehouse and othe ranges. <br />
 <br />
(2) Yes, it is possible to transfer forecast to MPS -  Our planning people do this  but I am not sure (it is Saturday morning here at the moment) which session is used for this. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
