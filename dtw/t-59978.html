The item is purchased.  We are using MRP to order the item.  Here is an example of our problem.<br />
<br />
I receive an order on Jan 10 for item ABC with a due date of April 1.  We have an overnight job that runs MRP and confirms and transfers planned orders.  I now have a purchase order with an April 1 due date.<br />
<br />
I receive an order on Jan 15 for item ABC with a due date of March 1.  MRP/Confirm and Transfer runs overnight.  Now the system inserts a new purchase order with a due date of April 1 and recommends moving the previous order in.  <br />
<br />
Is there anyway to just insert a new purchase order with a due date of March1?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">9th February 2011, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">The reasoning behind the rescdeule message is that. it is eaier to reschdule an open order vs creating a new order. Hence. system behaves like this. This is how traditional MRP works.<br />

However, on this one instance, we would like to lock the due date.  Just thought that there might be a way to do this in Baan.</div></div><hr />
