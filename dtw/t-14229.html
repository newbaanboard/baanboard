<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faditimo</div><div class="date">18th January 2004, 11:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We are having problems using when purchasing kit items. <br />
Firstly, I cannot include lot controlled items as part of a kit. This is because the kit itself is not lot controlled and BaaN does not allow me to create a lot controlled kit item (which makes sense since kits are not physically stored as items). So how can I include lot controlled items in kits?<br />
Secondly, how can I force kits which are purchased using normal Purchase Orders to be inspected upon receipt in warehouse. I can specify that the kit is to be approved (item master-purchase insert and BP ship from insert), but when I create the purchase order, the approval check-box is dimmed and cannot be checked. So how can the kit (or its components) be inspected upon receipt in warehouse.<br />
Thank you for your help</div></div><hr />

<br />
to answer the second part of your question, the way to ensure inspections for purchased items, kitted or not is to set the supplier also to inspected, as well as the parts,  also you have an option on the PO for inspection as well.<br />
<br />
Best regards</div></div><hr />

I've tried check the inspection checkbox for both the kit item and the B.P. but when i create the purchase order line for the kit item, the inspection checkbox is unchecked and dimmed and so I can't force inspection this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried it some years ago and discovered the same problem. For this problem we registered a call at Baan-support.<br />
<br />
the answer was negative.</div></div><hr />
