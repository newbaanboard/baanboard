<br />
        The scenario is my company will be buying bags from another company instead of manufacturing them and then we will contract another company to fill these bags, the only thing my company is going to do is to arrange the shipping only from one point to another for the customer. On the above scenario, my company will arrange all this, the buying, the selling, and the shipping. The invoicing is interesting, since its will be a global business, which ever branch of our company the sale is made in will invoice the customer. Now my question is how best to handle this particular scenario? Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - Buy the bags from your supplier.  <br />
2 - Sell them to the sub-contractor [at 0?]  (***OR on Sales Consign. Replenish in order to monitor stock levels of empty bags at their site).<br />
3 - (*** Process Sales Consign. Invoice of consumed bags at sub-contractor)<br />
4 - Ensure that &quot;Direct Delivery From&quot; item parameter is set to 1 for the filled bag item<br />
5 - Ensure the sub-contractor is the default supplier for the filled bag item, in item master and item supplier data<br />
6 - (I assume you will keep no inventory on hand)  Now sell your filled bag item to your end customer.  Because of the direct delivery setting, Baan will auto generate a purchase order to your sub-contractor, instructing him to directly deliver the filled bags to you customer.  Baan also links the so to the po<br />
7 - On second thought, if you wish you have visibility of filled bags, you may need to receive the goods into your system first (before shipping to the customer)<br />

I Hope this helps you as a guidline.<br />
