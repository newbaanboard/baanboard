<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onnoboer</div><div class="date">26th October 2006, 10:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm investigating the CMS module. The main problem is that I cannot post the commission costs as project-related costs, in case WIP. The field 'cprj' (project) is not filled in the integration tables tfgld410 and tfgld418. The reason for that is solution 154289. The argument 'project' is removed as argument to the dll that creates the integration transaction.<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
- are there someone using this module in relation to pcs / project?<br />
- is there a way to post the commission costs as WIP?<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">onnoboer</div><div class="date">26th October 2006, 11:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Maintaining the General Project Costs is no option because the integration transactions for Commission are automatically created. The mapping scheme in tdcms2101m000 doesn't allow ledger accounts with a PCS integration indicator. When we watn tho use the Maintain General Project Cost session we have to do it manually. <br />
<br />
Surcharges by projects is also not an option because we have a lot of sales agents having different percentages per agent / salesagent-team.</div></div><hr />
