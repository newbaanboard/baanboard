Kindly please help me, i have deleted an unused sales order but i still want to use that deleted sales order number thus the sales order number could be in the right order, but somehow i can't use the number i have deleted it again...What should i do to manually change the sales order number ? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I guess you wont be having backup's. Anyway, if you just want to create this Sales Order number again, first make sure none of the dependents tables have the same order number. Now, if Baan 4 has first free numbers concept, you can change it and make it similar to the one you deleted. Now, if you create a new SO, you will get the lost number. Now, change the first free number back to the original.<br />
<br />
Please note, do it in single user mode else it will cause problems if some other user creates SO before or after you.<br />
<br />
I would not suggest you to do this unless it is very important. Try it in a test environment first!</div></div><hr />
