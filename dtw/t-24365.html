It seems that we don't have this functionality.<br />
Is it limited to a certain version or Baan 5 only?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">23rd June 2005, 02:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We are interested in this also. The module is available for BaanIVc but not in the standard version. I think it is SCH extension. <br />
<br />
Baan Australia repeatedly denied that module was available for BaanIVc and when we gave them a reference to their support web site where the module was mentioned, Baan then effectively said it is not available to us. IE: they will not sell it to us (SSA haven't been able to polish the sales-manners of the people in this outpost yet). <br />
<br />
Instead they are proposing a stand-alone web interface e-procurement package, but have been slow to come back with any functional or pricing  details.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to learn what the BaanIV requisition module does in detail and what additional sessions and tables are involved.   <br />

The answer I have been receiving so far from our local support (Israel) is that the module is not supprted in our current version (C2) and that it is supported in newer versions of Baan IV.<br />
They are checking and I'm waiting for their formal answer.<br />
I'll update the forum with their reply.<br />

It allows you users to place electronic requisitions without item no, supplier and prices. These can be added later on by the purchasing department. An approval matrix can be set up and the requisition can then be converted into a PO. It is not a fancy tool but for companies with paper requisitions it is a step forward.</div></div><hr />
