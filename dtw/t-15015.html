<br />
completely process the current order ?<br />
<br />
how do I determine what this means ?<br />
why would I not answer Yes to the question ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">13th April 2004, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">This happens in Maintain Deliveries when a user selects &quot;Global&quot; on an order marked as &quot;ship complete&quot; whose current delivery line has not had its Maintain Deliveries step completed.<br />
<br />
If you say yes, it does some checks to make sure it can deliver all of the remaining lines at the same time.  If so, it performs the delivery and/or confirmation of the delivery.<br />
<br />
I suppose the question is there as a check in case someone forgot the order was ship complete.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
