On 5.0.c the commingle functionality does not exist and would also not fix this. Commingle can only combine PO's from the same supplier. <br />
<br />
Hi Mujtahid,<br />
In case both items (=RFQ lines) have a quote from both suppliers then both lines should be splitted. In case line 10 has a quote from both suppliers and line 20 only from 1 supplier then only line 10 should be splitted at moment of creating PO's.<br />
