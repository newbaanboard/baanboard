<br />
Version LN 6.1<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
I have made a Sales order type with Kind of Order as Return rejects. I have ensured that the 'Customer Approval' is checked in the 'Implemented Software components'.<br />
<br />
However when I make a sales order to take back the goods rejected by Customer and try to link this order type, the system does not show this order as well as accept it.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me with this please? Am I missing out something conceptually or in Baan?<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Roughly spoken the procedure is as following:<br />
- the original sales order should have an order step 'customer approval'.<br />
- enter sales order and deliver the goods.<br />
- after that customer approval (in tdsls4106m100) can be done.<br />
- reject some goods.<br />
- and automatically a sales return order will be generated.<br />
So, no manual creating of a sales return order as the original posting implies.<br />
For more information you can read the SSA Web Help.<br />
