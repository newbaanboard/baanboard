<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">13th March 2002, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We are in the process of transferring some stock between companies in Baan. To save on a huge amount of manual entry we have done the following:-<br />
<br />
1. In the buying company we have created an Exchange scheme that uploads into the Planned INV PO table (tdinv310)<br />
2. Planned INV PO's are then confirmed and converted to PO's<br />
3. The PO's are then EDI'd to the selling company which subsequently creates the SO's.<br />
4. Each SO line created selects the default warehouse from the Item Master. We want to change this warehouse code (tdsls041.cwar) If we attempt to do this via the Oracle level we will break referential integrity in tdinv001, plus other areas I suspect.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know of any other way that we can change cwar without going through each SO line by line?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">13th March 2002, 21:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a similar problem, and we wrote a baan script that goes through the sales order lines, and does the following :<br />
<br />
- changes warehouse in sales tables<br />
tdsls041 - sales order lines<br />
tdsls045 - sales order deliveries<br />
tdsls051 - sales order line history<br />
<br />
- changes inventory records<br />
tdinv001 - allocations<br />
tdinv150 - planned inventory movements<br />
<br />
We have been using this functionality for about two years, and all most all of our sales order lines are updated this way.<br />
<br />
Be careful of:<br />
- Cost Items (don't have warehouse)<br />
- Direct Deliveries<br />
- Phantoms (Issue Comp.)<br />
<br />
as well, be sure to write application lock checking routines into your code.  (an order gets half updated or two people update at once).<br />
