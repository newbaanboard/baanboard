<br />
Didn't get your question. Which version? On LN, only tdpur4101m000 exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">9th October 2013, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on Baan IVc4.  I created a new company and when I am in  Maintain Purchase orders(tdpur4101m000) and click Lines it opens Maintain Purchase Order Lines(Wholesale)(tdpur4105s000)  in our everyday company it opens Maintain Purchase Order Lines(tdpur4102s000).  I just wondered what the trigger was that made one session come up as opposed to the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th October 2013, 00:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I think from digging around it is in one of the parameter tables. Check tisfc0000m000 between the two companies.  Then Compare your tipcs000 table between the two companies. I think if tipgc000.ipcs is yes then tdpur4102s000 is used.<br />
<br />
I would say you need to compare all parameter tables between the two systems.  I am not sure what all plays with what.</div></div><hr />
