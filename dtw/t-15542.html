<br />
I'm not sure if it's standard in Baan V, ut has anyone ever tried to do the following in BIVc4:<br />
<br />
For A-suppliers, the company I work for, uses a fixed delivery day in the week for all their PO's, in order to execute workload planning at Goods Receipt. But PO's delivery days are generated random by MRP/SIC (or KanBan tools). Does anyone know a way to consolidate these orderlines after or during creation to the agreed delivery date, e.g. by creating a customized field in the Suppliers table tccom020 as standard within the Sales environment?  :confused: <br />
<br />
Hopefully someone can help.<br />
