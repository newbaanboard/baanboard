Baan 5c.<br />
Some of our clients have special requests for their order preparation (for example to use a particular package or to include a catalogue in the box).<br />
<br />
So, such request is inserted as a sales-order-header-text and automatically printed, to the warehouse operator, as a note on the picking list. Then he/she can prepare the box accordingly. And this is ok.<br />
The point is that in many occasions the request is repeatedly added to orders, i.e. the client asks always for the same particulars. So we'd like to include such request as Business-Partner-Text and not as Sales-Order-Text, since the latter is lost after the delivery of the specific order.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to link the Bus Partner Text with the Picking List?? this will help the person that inserts the orders on the system, who will no longer need to repeatedly type the same note.<br />
Assistance is welcome! thank you<br />
<br />
  Ale</div></div><hr />

If required (i.e. if records not yet fetched/available) you can select the required text field in the report script.</div></div><hr />

thanks for your reply!<br />
<br />
could you kindly tell me what kind of level of knowledge is needed for making the change you propose.... the point is that am a &quot;User&quot; of Baan and probably may still not be able to do such modification.<br />
<br />
your comments are welcome,</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need a programmer who knows how to customize reports. Normaly consultance are able to do so. Also the baan system administrator with a customization education should be able to do the modifications.<br />
