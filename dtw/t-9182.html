While calcuating Standard Cost price thru Item Zoom Menu it is shoiwing message 'Economic Stock already Present for Item' <br />
This is ok but when I run this thru session 'ticpr2210m000'  calculation are not done and cost is not updated. It only displays no data found to print report.  <br />
<br />
This is only for few items, I had checked the items for which calculation done vs calculation not done, there is no difference.<br />

Note that in order for economic stock to be present (i.e., to have been entered), there must already have been a cost price calculation (recorded in ticpr200) and an update of standard cost (recorded in ticpr300 and in Item Master). <br />
<br />
2) This is ok but when I run this thru session 'ticpr2210m000' calculation are not done and cost is not updated. It only displays no data found to print report.<br />
As Paul suggested, be sure that you enter Update Cost Prices=Yes in ticpr2210m000.<br />
Note, however, that if the calculated cost price is the same (amounts and cost price components) as the current standard cost, standard cost will not be updated. (No change = No update). And since Cost Prices table (ticpr200) does not record the calculation date, if there was no change, you can't tell that it really was recalculated.<br />
<br />
Check the Cost Price by Item, compare to the Standard Cost by Item. If they are the same and you want to confirm that a calculation is in fact being done (but just not updating standard cost because there is no change), copy your standard Cost Price Calculation Code (say 001) to another another code (say 901) and calculate cost price of the item using the new code. Then compare the results under 001 and 901. They should be the same.<br />
