One of our prospects asked us to simulate a scenario which he often comes across during purchase of items from abroad. He requires that the items have several added costs such as freight, duty,  inspection costs, etc. The problem is that these costs are often not known beforehand and thus item surcharges will not work since the surcharge amount or percentage must be fixed. I have also thought of adding cost items to the purchase order but the problem is that he wants these additional item costs to be distributed over the purchased items and thus be accounted for in the purchased items inventory valuation. To my knowledge, cost items only affect finance and not warehouses (even if they did affect warehouses, they cannot be distributed over the valuation of other items just because they exist in the same purchase order). Is there another way other than item surcharges to add these additional costs and distribute them so that items issued from the warehouse will account for these costs. Finally our client requires that each of these extra costs be allocated a different currency exchange rate. I know that it is possible to manually enter an exchange rate in the financial transactions, but during purchase, Baan picks up the latest exchange rate defined in the system (which is logical) and does not allow manual definition of exchange rates of these additional costs since they are allocated at the exact same time (time of receipt in warehouse).<br />

Sorry for forcing you to read all of that, but I really need the help.<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Indeed there are at least 2 ways to book inbound freight cost:<br />
 Include it in the value of incoming inventory. This is what your prospect is asking for. And about the only way to handle it this way is to come up with standard freight in cost and allocate it into the inventory as goods are received. As actual inbound freight costs are paid, the difference between actual and standard inbound freight costs can be calculated as the difference between the debit and credit sides of Inbound Freight Costs account in FOh. This difference can then be allocated to COGS as one of FOh variances. Please ask your finance consultant to decipher what I just wrote if finance is not your field of expertise<br />
 Book it separately as one of the Factory Overhead (FOh) costs. This can be achieved by using Additional Order Costs, making separate cost PO, or even direct journal entry. Here, the actual inbound freight costs are simply booked as FOh, not allocating them to inventory. These costs can then be allocated to COGS as FOh variance too<br />
Now, probably you couldn't really see anything I wrote that would fit your prospect requirements exactly. But maybe you can show them how BaanERP handles inbound freight costs and ask them to choose one method<br />
