<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">23rd October 2002, 23:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on Baan 5b. We have 2 plants, one on the west coast US and one on the east coast. We manufacture product A at both plants, and product B only at the west coast plant. It is cheaper for us to produce product A at the east coast plant. <br />
<br />
Lets say we have a customer that places a sales order with us, which is a full truck load, half with product A, and half with product B. This customer is equally distant from each of our plants.<br />
<br />
Product B can only be made at our west coast plant, and product A can be made at either plant. My problem is trying to determine which plant will build item AÂ….<br />
<br />
If I build product A at the east coast plant our manufacturing cost is cheaper, but I will incur LTL freight costs because I will be not be shipping a full truck load - actually I will be shipping 2 LTL trucks to the same customer - one from plant 1 for item A and one from plant 2 for item B.<br />
<br />
If I ship it from the west coast plant I can combine the products to fill one truck so my freight will be less, but I am incurring more costs to build it.<br />
<br />
Im trying to figure out if there are any type of systems out there which can look at this information and help us determine on an order by order basis which product to build in each plant, based on manufacturing and freight costs.<br />
<br />
Any ideas??</div></div><hr />
