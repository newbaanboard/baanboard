<br />
We have a business requirement relating to location control. There is a Raw material warehouse (RMS) where raw materials are received and issued for production. In some cases we have &quot;ONE ITEM CODE&quot; and received from 3 different suppliers. We would like to keep this item stock in 3 different locations and issue only from these respective locations. How can this be controlled in the system? The correct raw material is decided base of the finished product code. <br />
<br />
The problem that we face is that the raw material code is the same. The same raw material code is given in the system since these are alternative items and alternate items are not considered for MPS/MRP run which is used in the organisation for planning purposes. Hence different item codes cannot be defined.<br />
<br />
Please let me know how this scenario can be mapped and controlled in the system.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.....</div></div><hr />

Once you receive it the system will put the inventory into the fixed locations defined in locations by item. Once the item is received then you can write a program to transfer the item based on the supplier to the  respective locations. This can be controlled by adding a new order type for the purchase order and link it to the supplier master. Make the custom program as an order step and link it in the order type after the maintain receit order step.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using one item code for 3 raw materials does get around the fact that BaanERP doesn't automatically suggest alternative material when the main material runs out. But this can create problems in other parts; for one thing, the 3 raw materials will have just one average cost, which can be a problem if their cost difference is material<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pergerp</div><div class="date">30th August 2004, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">As I read manufactured item code determines which supplier lot (location) should be used during manufacturing.<br />
<br />
To control issue, consider creating more WIP warehouses, by suppliers:<br />
 in this case, same raw material (different supplier) can be issued from different WIP WH-s, determined by the manufactured item.<br />
(You can determine the appropriate WIP warehouse with the Bill of Materials or routings/workcenters).<br />
<br />
&quot;Purchase side&quot;: you receive raw materials to fix receiption location. If you use Lot Control then you can develope a program to transfer materials to their final WH location: supplier code attached to lot number so you can move items by lots (=&gt;suppliers) to different locations. I think you should extend RPL module... you can replenish WIPs with same way, with this extended RPL functionality.</div></div><hr />
