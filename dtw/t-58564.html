<br />
we are using ERPLn (FP2) with india localization phase III. In our purchase order parameters, Automatically confirm back-orders is set to Yes.<br />
<br />
Now when any w/h receipt (final receipt set to Yes) is made against purchase order, system generates back-order line. But to again process w/h receipt against this back-ordered line, purchase people are required to do release to w/h step.<br />
<br />
Is there any way once a back-order line is generated it is automatically released to warehousing ?<br />
<br />
please guide.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

You can set the activity ‘‘automatic’’ of ‘release to warehousing’ in purchase order type, if it have no other impact in your existing business cycle.</div></div><hr />
