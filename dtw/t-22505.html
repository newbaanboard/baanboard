<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">2nd December 2004, 01:06</div></div><div class="posttext">We are implementing Commissions/Rebates in our organization and the way rebate works in our setup is that we pay rebate to our customers (basically the distributors) based on who we are shipping the order to. So it means that though we are always paying rebate to our customers/distributors, our ship to could be different and hence the percentage of rebate could be different. <br />
<br />
We thought of setting it up in Baan by defining multiple relations for each customer for rebate purposes. Each Relation will represent a possible 'Ship To', for which we are supposed to pay rebate to our distributor/customer. That way we will be able to define different rebate agreements based on Customer/Relation combination. When we will create a sales order, we will link relevant relation to order line and hence the rebate calculation will be based on the agreement that was defined earlier for that customer and relation.<br />
<br />
Only problem is that Baan does not allow creating multiple relations for a customer and therefore we cannot define multiple rebate agreements. We are now thinking of customizing the Relations session (tdcms0110m000) so that we can define multiple relations for a given customer. I quickly ran a test by entering multiple relations for a customer on GTM level, than linking it with a sales order line, and calculating the rebate and it seems to work fine.<br />
<br />
Does any body know what is the logic behind not letting multiple relations defined for a particular customer? Do you think something will not work if we customize the session logic to allow us to enter multiple relations? Any other things that I should keep in mind or should be aware of? <br />
<br />
Any suggestion or help will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
