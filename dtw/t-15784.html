<br />
We have implemeted QMS module for Purhcase receipts. So when goods arrive they go to inspect location. Inspection orders are opened and sample test details entered and the Inspection orders come to the status &quot;Processed&quot;. After this the &quot;Maintain Approval&quot; is done which automatically changes the Inspection order status to &quot;Closed&quot; in the QMS module (this is in table tcqms120). <br />
<br />
In some cases we find that &quot;Maintain Approval&quot; step is completed and the Inspection order still has the status &quot;Processed&quot; and it is not changed to &quot;Closed&quot;. In such cases the session &quot;Check and closed standard inspection (tcqms1205m00)&quot; also cannot be used to close the Inspection orders. Hence we have many such cases and all these Inspection orders cannot be &quot;Closed&quot; and taken to history and adding to confusion.<br />
<br />
Is there a solution to this problem? Is there something wrong in the procedure done in the system to have such records. Please let us know!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

even i faced this problem sometimes, the order status remains in processed status, although data is approved. So in this case i used to check the GTM, in tdpur045 table and usually what happens is maintain approval session is not executed n is still in the yes state. so u can execute that step through GTM and ur order will be closed.<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards</div></div><hr />
