Baan Support inform me that there is currently no utlity in Baan V to do this job. Has anyone attempted it through other means?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francoisp</div><div class="date">30th January 2002, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the solution is:<br />
1- make sure there is no on hand inventory in the warehouse by creating adjustment orders to zero out your stock<br />
2- select the &quot;location&quot; checkbox in the &quot;warehouses&quot; session<br />
3- make sure you have locations set up for the parts (or at least one bulk location + receiving + inspection + staging)<br />
4- enter adjustment orders reversal entries (the system should prompt you for each part's location)<br />
<br />
You may want to create a script to do (1) and (4) if you have lots of parts in that warehouse.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
<br />
PS: give a call if you need help with the script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nick Bailey</div><div class="date">30th January 2002, 23:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your response. I had already concidered your solution. Although a slighly different approach by transfering stock to an empty warehouse. However I came unstuck with inventory commitments.<br />
 <br />
I think I need to cancel all outstanding orders as well, As these orders will not be looking for a stock location.<br />
<br />
I was hopeing for a solution that just went through the relevent tables and put all stock in one location and then turned the locations on for the warehouse. My guess is it can be done but I need to determine which tables are involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francoisp</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 04:23</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right in saying that any released but unconfirmed outbound advices (and/or picking lists) or any un-approved inbound advices (and/or storage lists) would need to be taken care of (removed or completly processed) before attempting to adjust or move the inventory.<br />
<br />
However, going to the tables in my view is too risky and yet has the same pre-requisite as explained above.  I do not think you would save time this way. I know a company that attempted a similar &quot;correction&quot; and they're still struggling with the after-effect (they spent over $50,000 to almost fix the problem).<br />
<br />
I suggest to play it safe.<br />
<br />
The problem with using transfer orders is that, unless you have just a few items, a script will be needed and will have to update at least 4 tables (orders, order lines and history) and it's trickier. Using an adjustment order is fairly simple and requires to populate only 2 tables.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

You have hit on the crux of the problem. Baan so far have failed to write such a utility for BaanERP. Possibly due to the incresed complexity in these area compared to Baan IVc<br />

This outbound priority is defined in session whwmd4100s000 (Item Warehousing Data) and you have the following options there:<br />

- LIFO (Last In First Out)<br />

<br />
Indeed whwmd3203m000 has nothing to do with changing warehouse types. But because jroberts mentioned two sessions which did not exist on B50b, I wanted to indicated that (although too bad) 'only' one is missing.<br />
<br />
For changing warehouse types Edwin is right.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenix</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 09:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, <br />
<br />
I have done the migration for the intial stock value several times now by using exchange. <br />
<br />
I have done it in 3 steps: <br />
<br />
1. create the locations with the baan standard session for a   <br />
    new warehouse using ILC<br />
2. import the relation item &lt;-&gt; location <br />
3. export the available stock per item<br />
4. import the cycle counting orders and follow the normal <br />
    procedure for cycle counting in Baan in the old warehouse<br />
    and set all values to zero<br />
3. import the cycle counting orders and follow the normal <br />
    procedure for cycle counting in Baan for the new warehouse<br />
    with the available stock from the old warehouse<br />
(Attention: If you have to import more than 999 records you <br />
have to splitt your import file. It is not possible to have more <br />
than 999 records per cycle counting order!) <br />
<br />
If you need more information I can prepare some screen shots <br />
from the import schemes. <br />
<br />

Ralf</div></div><hr />
