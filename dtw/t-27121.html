while implementing this, will the lot code be printed in the packing slip as well as edi message of ASN in standard baan.<br />
<br />

<br />
getting lot-id's in an ASN can be done with standard Baan, this means you don't have to change the software just add the required fields to your EDI-mapping will do the job.</div></div><hr />
