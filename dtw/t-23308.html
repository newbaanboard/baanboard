<br />
We have picked and released from warehouse an order line for a smaller quantity than the one requested from our client. i.e. sales order line 1.500 pieces, picked in warehouse 1.400 pieces.<br />
<br />
After releasing the 1.400 pieces we could not Confirm the shipment line whinh4531m000 (to thereafter print the load documentation). Baan allowed such confirmation only after picking the remaining 100 pieces to reach the 1.500 buyed from our client.<br />
<br />
This was quite unusual since many times we deliver partial orders. It is to note that in the sales order lines no shipping restrictions had been set (it was a normal sales order).<br />
<br />
Could you kindly provide me some hint on what could have happened in this particular case? ...why only admitted a full line delivery?<br />
Thanks in advance!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
At order header level also shipping constraints can be set.<br />
What is the value of that field?<br />
And what is the message you get when you try to confirm the shipment?</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the prompt answer!<br />
<br />
1.  also at order header level there are no shipping constraints (i.e. &quot;none&quot;). So both header and order line have no constraints<br />
<br />
2.  unfortunately I did not keep a copy of the message (something I usually do)... but was something like &quot;can not confirm order line&quot; without further specification. This appeared in a small window<br />
<br />
other ideas?<br />
thanks again..</div></div><hr />

 Check the first free numbers related to the shipments. If for some reason, some shipment transaction got stuck up in between(not comitted) then the  first free number will get stuck up. If this is the case, you can try incrementing the next free number by a few numbers and try to ship again. Let me know if this works.</div></div><hr />
