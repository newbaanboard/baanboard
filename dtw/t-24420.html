<br />
Can anyone tell me the use of session Cycle counting Data (whinh5540m000) in Baan V, as per the baan help  , all the records which meet the criteria defined in Inventory handling parameter - &gt; Cycle counting form (like interval as per A,B,C classification) are available in this session.<br />
<br />
At our end the interval for A class is 12 weeks , for B class is 16 weeks and for C class it is 20 weeks , even then some items which were cycle counted on 07/06/05 are appearing in Cycle counting data , why it is so  ??<br />
<br />
In short Cycle counting data gives us the details of all the records for which  cycle counting orders are going to be generated next time ?? or it would have all the records (for all stock points and items) ??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />

Generate cycle count session will refer to this last count date to decide if stock point is due for counting<br />
