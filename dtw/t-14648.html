The purchasing company generates a sales order in the other company.<br />
The order has an specific address code. Despite this code is included in the message in and out, the saling company creates the sales order, includig as a ship to address, the ship to business partner address.<br />
<br />
I think that could be solved with EDI expresions, but I don't know how.<br />
<br />
Does someone know how to do it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
