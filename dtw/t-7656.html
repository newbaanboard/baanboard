What is the standard way to get rid of these records?<br />
<br />
Version B40c4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess 1) archive all referenced records (purchase/sales orders+receipts and purchase/sales invoices), and then 2) hit the 'delete' key for every supplier/customer.<br />
<br />
I can tell you my experiences in a few weeks time...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">This would be the procedure, but if you have a lot of them...<br />
<br />
And what about suppliers linked to items via the Item Master (tiitm001)? Even when they are linked as alternative suppliers for items, you will not be able to delete them... There are more places like this: you will have to delete all references manually...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 10:47</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to delete a whole range of suppliers there is no other way then to create your owns session for this. A suggestion to BaaN for some new standard sessions (delete suppliers and delete customers ?)<br />
<br />
As for the supplier field in tiitm001: if this would be the main reason why the suppliers can not be deleted: you could copy the table defintion to your own VRC and change the 'Delete Mode' of the tiitm001.suno field from 'Lookup (Restricted)' to 'Nullifies', these fields should be made empty then when you delete the parent record.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 11:24</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, sure. And if it is a one-time operation, and you have no developers data, you even can modify the RDD file, reconfigure and do the same....<br />
<br />
Our customer is not willing to do it in this way ;-)<br />
<br />
The main problem is that all suppliers and customers (even blocked, inactive etc) are shown in the zoom sessions. The defect would more likely be: add an option in all these kind of zoom sessions to allow for a choice what type of customers / suppliers may be selected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 11:34</div></div><div class="posttext">In my company we insert an asterisk (*) as the first character of the Search Key of old/obsolote customers/suppliers. That way, when you zoom to the display suppliers list, ordered by Search Key at least they are all grouped at the start or end.<br />
Add some customization to tccom2510s000/tccom1510s000 to filter these out ?<br />

I think you can try to use AFS for writing your own utility for deleting clients.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Our solution was to use a field in the supplier or customer to mark the customer as out of use (you could use the supplier or customer status, but we wanted to keep that for finance).<br />
<br />
Then using the chosen field (we chose area) set the field permissions to &quot;not authorised&quot; for the nama, namb, namc, namd, name, pstc, etc sections of the supplier or customer records if the area field is set to the &quot;archived&quot; value. Use session &quot;Maintain Table Field Data Authorisations&quot; (ttaad4135m000).<br />
<br />
This solves the problem with data integrity, and makes it very visible for people to see customers/suppliers that are available.<br />
<br />
You will need a standard program after October 2002 (ttstpstandard) for this because it did not work initially for zoom sessions, for which I submitted as case to BGS.  After installing solution 10923 we had no problems.<br />
<br />
Hope this is helpful<br />

How exactly did you do it? What permissions did you set? Based on the contents of a specific field?</div></div><hr />

we are facing this problem, we have about 600 customers that we would like to delete.  They have no transactions against them.  We are going to write custom code to go through all the supporting tables that we are using including,<br />
- EDI relations<br />
- alternative item code systems<br />
- pricing<br />
- addresses<br />
<br />
and delete the entries from the supporting tables, and then delete them from the customer master.  It is going to be a pile of work, but it is the only way we can think of.<br />

we had a similar problem with Items.<br />
3 items were entered into the item master incorrectly, so it was decided to remove the items through informix on the same day.<br />
we ended up getting a whole range of problems, affecting our normal operation. In the end, we had to reinsert the items.<br />
In this case the items had never been used, so there should have been no references to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
We do the same with our customers and items. (use table data authorisations, put an X in the tccom010.osno field and only allow users to view the customer when the osno field is not X).<br />
For items, we don't allow users to see items with signal codes greater than 900.</div></div><hr />
