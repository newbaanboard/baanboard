I'm using ERP LN FP3 and implemented EU sales listing.<br />
I found 2 issues which seems that not correct:<br />
<br />
1. In order to transfer open invoice data to the sales listing I have to follow up this steps in this order (no other):<br />
- open Invoice to BP open Entries tfacr2520m000 select invoice, start Sales Listing Data tfacr1113s000 and run Save .<br />
- finalize batch . After this step the invoice appear in Sales Listing<br />
If I finalize batch first and after that open tfacr2520m000 and start Sales Lising Data the invoice won't appear in Sales Listing. I think it's not OK<br />
<br />
2. If we have many EU sales invoices, to have it in Sales listing we have to select each invoice in tfacr2520m000 and then start tfacr1113s000 which can be run invoice by invoice. A lot of work and time !<br />
<br />
Any suggestion will be helpful<br />

<br />
the ESL functionality works this way and I guess that most invoices are normaly generated via SLI and not through manual input. Through SLI everything is stored automatically - which is the bulk of it.<br />
