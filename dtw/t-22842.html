<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">12th January 2005, 21:32</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, I'm running IVc4 Nas0<br />
<br />
I have an issue that prompted me to look into the Baan Sales Statistics session.  We started making a product for one of our Customers.  In the past, they would send me there Forecast via EDI 830 transactions and everything was fine.  That changed however.  They now want only to send me the orders they have from there customers.  They will provide me with there planned sales for this year and they want me to plan for that.  An agreement has been reached requiring them to take all product that is produced via there forecast.<br />
<br />
I found that if I manually key in the forecast via Maintain Sales Budgets (tdsst0150m000), I could then import the Budget to MPS via session Copy Sales Budgets for Demand Forecast (timps3280m000).  I havent discovered yet if MPS will add all actual customer orders to the forecast in creating Planned Orders or only add where the Actual Customer Orders exceed the forecast.  For example if I have item AB1234 and a forecast of 100 for March 2005 and I have actual orders for 120 units during March 2005, will MPS create planned orders for 100 or 120 or 220  I hope its 120.  Ill do some testing to find out.<br />
<br />
In either case, Im confused by the session Maintain Sales Budgets.  I have only added Budgets for about 60 Items so far but Im having an issue.  If I want to look up the forecast for a specific Item, I cant.  If I use the binoculars, I can only select the Sort, Statistical Year, or the Year Part.  I do not see any way to ask for the specific items record.  I cant even use the Query Tool because Baan compresses all the fields displayed into a single Column thats 104 characters wide.  The Query Tool adds description to what I can get via the Binoculars but nothing else.  I dont know if Description is the 104-character field or if its something else.<br />
<br />
Even the Query Tool is different because I tried to use Contains to get a part number hoping that the description field is the compressed 104 Char field that contains all the fields.  But contains is not there?<br />
<br />
I have never seen a Baan Session where if I have 600 Items, I need to look one at a time until I find the item Im looking for.<br />
<br />
I have very limited previous history on the parts in question so the historical data I have in Baan is not of much use.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?<br />

Now for the Sales Stats Question:<br />
You can create a Display Code in Maintain Sales Stats Display Codes.  In the mode field use Figures.  You can then go into Display Sales Stats (Graphical) and you can use the find &lt;ctrl&gt; F to find the item number.  Another option is to create Sales Stats Layout Codes and the Print Sales Statistics.  In this session you can specify a single item or a range or all.  You will get totals by item here.  Hope this make sense.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply.  I'm glad the 120 is what I'll get.<br />
<br />
Regarding the display codes, I thought that there use was to format report on the Budget.  What I'm running into is if I need to edit my Budget for a specific Item, I have to run the session to maintain the budget and then find the item I need to edit the Forecast for.  How do I find the item that I want to edit?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">12th January 2005, 22:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I misunderstood.  You are right there is no nice way to find an item.  by the way the description in the query is the description of the sort code not of the item or any other field.  I suggest that you create an exchange scheme and do the forecast in excel and then import the budgets.  The Baan table is tdsst050.  You can change your excel sheet as often as you like and then reimport.  Hope this is a workable answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll start working on that.  In the meantime, I can't help needing to log a case with Support asking them why I can't lookup a specific Item in the sales budget when It allows me to create a sales budget for a specific Item.<br />
<br />
I was beging to thing the session was simply a leftover from Baan IA0.5<br />
