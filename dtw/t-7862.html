<br />
Unfortunately you're right. With ILC, at minimum every warehouse should have 3 locations, ie one each for receiving, inspection, and storage. It all changes in B5 where location control is a warehouse to warehouse kind of setting<br />

This does not mean that you are forced to create locations in the warehouses. You can have warehouses without any locations if location control is switched on.<br />
In a warehouse that does not have locations in this setup you will have to deliver via outbound data but don't need to inbound data becaues you do not have locations.<br />
Warehouses with locations you will have to deliver via outbound data and store via inbound data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Within Location control you have 4 different situations in the scripts:<br />
<br />
1) Warehouses With Locations<br />
2) Warehouses Without Locations<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
3) Items that need zooming to ILC (date / lot / storage unit / loca filled)<br />
4) Items that do not need extra information registered (no lot item, no storage date, storage unit equals stock unit, warehouse without location).<br />
<br />
When you use items that are cat 4 and warehouses that are cat 2 then you can mainly use the inv sessions to do your thing.<br />
<br />
(From the functional point of view, you can make a matrix: 1 and 2 on top, 3 and 4 on the left. In the matrix the result of al sessions used must be comparable.)</div></div><hr />

It was quite some time ago that I played around with B4c4. There's always a message saying &quot;ILC implemented. Pls use tdilc....&quot; or something like that. So I assumed that if ILC is on you'll just have to stick to all ILC rules. Pls disregard my comment above then :p<br />
