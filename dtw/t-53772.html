Unfortunately we have lost some purchase orders. They were deleted in a Baan legal way using Process delivered Purchase Orders.<br />
<br />
In order to reconstruct some customer specific reports based on purchase orders we look into tdinv700.<br />
<br />
Here we see a lot of unexpected negative receipts.<br />
<br />
When we expect to see receipt of +10 items, we may see +10, - 10 and then +10 again. Three transactions within the same minute. We are not aware of a user making unexpected use of Maintain receipts session.<br />
<br />
When we add it all together the number is OK. But to make a new report to an enduser with three lines we have a problem.<br />
<br />
Do you know why we see these unexpected negative receipts?<br />
Is there a way to sort this out to make a user friendly report? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Strange that you get more than one entry per receipt!!<br />
Are all the three entries of Purchase Receipt-Purchase Order combination? The date and time and the username are all the same as well? Are there any projects connected to this Purchase Order?<br />

<br />
I had faced these type of senario .<br />
<br />
my analysis : at the time MRN - the user accepts full Item in (by using special) . then he saves the MRN and then edits the line and makes receipt as zero or less than PO qty (where not received).<br />
<br />
Hence the different lines of +ve and -ve qty in tdinv700.<br />
<br />

If you see almost same time (jsut one secapart) then the PO was received one day and approved the other day. You may see the time as 11:59:59. If the qty net out to be same, then it is due to inspection approval. If this reporting is a problem, then create a table where you can update the net qty and that may resolve ur reporting issue.<br />
