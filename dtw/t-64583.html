Does Baan allow blocking of Sales orde manually.<br />
For e.g if i just have to block an order from the sales order header does it allow? I tried to block order on header. The order blocking screen comes up with blank values. i have created an order type with block step as tssls4100s00<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

I am not sure about Baan 4, but in LN it works. You need to add the activity tdsls4100s000 at Block As of Activity field. The screen will pop up if you block it. Now, you will need to put a reason of blocking and thats it.<br />
<br />
Check if you have all solutions installed.</div></div><hr />

A screen does pop up but its blank and does not allow me to enter anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I checked it at my end. You can add any activity as blocking step. You can block before the activity is executed. Like, I have kept tdsls4246m000 as blocking activity and I can still block the orders manually. The difference is that, the system will pop up a message that the activity is not yet carried out.<br />
<br />
Check if you have maintained proper change reasons in Hold Reasons(tdsls0190m000). You can try creating a new reason e.g. General type and then try. Also, check if User Profile is defined for your username. That won't affect but you never know. You can check KB 1059434 for more info. I am not a functional person, so you can wait for a functional person to provide some help.</div></div><hr />
