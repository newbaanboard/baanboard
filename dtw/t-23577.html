<br />
I am in a brazilian B4_c3 customer in which this Case were opened: during Faturamento process, people want to issue materials from stock (mcsdll0100) at NF printing moment, not the normal way during Maintain Delivery.<br />
What problems could happen on doing that? Why Localization is designed this way?<br />

Tks,<br />
