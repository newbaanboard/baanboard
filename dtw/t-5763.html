	I am having problems with a lot.<br />
	It shows a quantity of 48 in tdltc001 and<br />

<br />
                See the attached pics.<br />

      I have attached the output of tdltc1520m000 for your<br />
      ref. I have highlighted the lot in question.<br />
<br />
Hi Riaz,<br />
     The units are all the same - &quot;each&quot;es.<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is your Software Version / patch level? Because we have seen something like doubling lot quantities in the past. It may be a new error or still the old one...<br />
<br />
Did you check the support site on this issue?<br />
<br />
What is the history of this lot in tdilc301?<br />
Was the lot sold before? (was it a previous received lot).<br />
<br />
Was there an inspection? Were there rejections on that receipt?<br />
<br />
Were there any inventory corrections with tdilc1120m000?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isimeon</div><div class="date">11th July 2002, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">OmeLuuk is right.<br />
<br />
There are several patches for inventory adjustment - session tdilc1121s000 - Maintain Stock Transactions by Lot and Location.<br />
<br />
E.g.<br />
With BAAN IVc3 SP3 when you make inventory adjustment and quantity is positive, the lot size is changed. If quantity is negative, the lot size is not changed.<br />
<br />
With BAAN IVc4 SP8 the lot size is changed if quantity is positive and lot size is zero.</div></div><hr />
