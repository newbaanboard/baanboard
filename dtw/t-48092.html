We measure vs. our commitment date and our customer's requested date.<br />
<br />
Is there a way in ERP LN 6.1 to keep an accurate shipping schedule (ie delivery date is the day we are actually shipping out the door) and maintain static &quot;promise&quot; and &quot;request&quot; dates?<br />
<br />
Our old ERP had three date fields, &quot;request&quot;, &quot;promise&quot;, and &quot;required&quot;, where the required date is the day the product needs to ship in order to meet the promise/request date, or the revised day the order is scheduled to ship (if late).</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have to add an additional field to the sales order and sales order line and define<br />
<br />
planned delivery date = required<br />
planned receipt date = promised<br />
new field = requested<br />
<br />
&quot;required&quot; should be calculated automatically upon promised. If freight management is not used, it could make sense to add an additional field &quot;transport time in working days&quot; to the ship-to role of the business partner and to calculate it.<br />
<br />
For reporting you have to compare the following values<br />
if promised &lt;= requested --&gt; available<br />
if deliverd &lt;= required --&gt; reliable<br />
<br />
For reliability it makes sense not to differ only between in-time and too late or just to calculate the avarage of too-late days but to create classes<br />
<br />
broken promise days = delivered - required<br />
<br />
BP &lt;= 0 --&gt; Class 0 (reliable)<br />
BP = 1, 2 --&gt; Class 1<br />
BP = 3-5 --&gt; Class 2<br />
BP = 6-9 --&gt; Class 3<br />
.... or however<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
