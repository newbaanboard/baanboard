<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gatesplayback</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 12:26</div></div><div class="posttext">i am having this problem in generation of location cycle counting order. It only generate a handfull of items. to elaborate it further, for example there are 30 items in my whse each having two to three inventory dates. i am expecting aroung 90 records to be generated by the system but upon finishing the generation it only generated 5 items with one inventory date each. and the very strage thing is this only happens in one warehouse in the production warehouse the generation has no problem.<br />
<br />
based on my understanding the cycle count will look up in item by whse and it will generate all items for a particular whse.<br />
<br />
i have already check the item data, the item by whse and the other stuffs. <br />
<br />
please enlighten me on this..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gatesplayback</div><div class="date">4th April 2008, 03:25</div></div><div class="posttext">i think what causes this was an accidental or intentional generation and processing of location cycle count was performed last 04/01. i wasnt quite familiar with location control tables i ove looked the table tdilc101 at this table i saw the field Last Counting Date and items that didn't appear in the cycle count have an entry of 04/01. <br />
<br />
thanks anyway.<br />
<br />
is there a way for me to see who performed the processing of the cycle count?</div></div><hr />
