<br />
The warehouse transfer b/w the location are only possible for the locations of type &quot;BULK&quot;. Item lying in Receipt Location means it is still not the part of the Inventory &amp; yet to received (on-order) for that you have to take it in Bulk Location by Inbound Order.</div></div><hr />
