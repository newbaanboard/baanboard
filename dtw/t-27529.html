For BaanERP or Baan 5:<br />
<br />
As long as the receipts (whinh3520m000) is not confirmed,  the receipt line can be deleted/unlinked by Specific&gt;Deselect Order Line.<br />
But what if the Receipts (whinh3520m000) is confirmed, is there any solution to delete/unlink the receipt order line?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

You can change the receipt quantity zero. But it is not possible to do this in certain circumstances, for example, if the receipt had already been matched/approved in finance, or another receipt has been made and confirmed for the same order line(I am not sure about this). If you use inspection procedure and completed approval, it is not possible too.<br />
