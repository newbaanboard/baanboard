Our client is having problems with tab sequence of PO lines session. It is because if the user does not specifically click and change the warehouse field in the session, and makes receipts and inbounds etc without noticing the warehouse, the whole entry becomes wrong.<br />
Did any one circumvent this problem? and How?<br />
BaaN claims that this problem has been solved in SP15.<br />
We are on SP9 and before I try and upgrade to SP15, I request the users on SP15 to try this out for me. Does the tab sequence come to warehouse field also in your sessions?<br />
<br />

<br />
We are on BaanIV C4 and SP11, We have the same issue, but we do not face any problem because the default warehouse is set in item master data is the correct warehouse where the receipts are always made in our case. It saves time and prevents mistake of wrong warehouse selection. So here it is important to set the correct warehouse in default warehouse in item data.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I know that the default w/h comes from item master. And it is mandatory to feed a warehouse in the item master.<br />
But what if an item can be purchased into any one of the hundred warehouses. The default would be only one w/h. If the PO has to be made into any of the other 99 warehouses, then user will have to remember to specifically click the w/h field and change the field.<br />
<br />
Is there any simpler solution for this?<br />
Any of the SP15 installation user can comment on this?<br />
<br />

<br />
You can leave WH in Item Purchase Data empty.<br />
Then, you link WH with the purchase office. Of course, if you have more than one PO. If not you can link WH with Purchase order type.<br />
<br />
If WH is not defined in Item Purchase data then the WH is automaticly taken from the purchase order header.</div></div><hr />

the session in general shows to different behaviours. During the initial entry the field warehouse is skipped. This has been standard functionality since ancient times. On changing the orderline, every field can be accessed by pressing tab, also the warehouse. We didn't noticed any changes from SP9 to SP15 in the tab sequence.<br />
What should be changed according to the Baan statement?<br />
<br />
Anyway, the tab seq. can be modified with a small customization..<br />

I think users should notice this before going ahead. <br />
<br />
As others said , changing tab sequence is just a minor customization.</div></div><hr />
