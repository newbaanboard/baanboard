<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">My advise would be to contact BAAN Support before installing and running this session.<br />
Many dependent solutions have to be installed first and it is best to run the session in a non-update mode first to see what the implications are.<br />
I would be very carefully running this session. Especially in case you are using b50_b.<br />
<br />
I was working at a b50_b customer a few years ago and we had to install about 200 separate solutions before we could run whcor0200m000.<br />
We were dealing with a lot of corrupted inventory. Also we struggled with our inventory value in Warehousing being out of sync with the inventory value in Finance.<br />
These should be the same under normal conditions.<br />
