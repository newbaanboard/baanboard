<br />
I Would like to know how to correct Wrong Quantity in Warehouse Receipt ?<br />
because when i try to using Correct Receipt Lines (whinh3121s000) the quantity field are block and can't be changed  and there's no movement both for issue and receipt for the item itself after being receipt.<br />
<br />
thank u.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is inspection carried out on the warehouse receipt ? if yes, that might be the reason.<br />

<br />
Make a note of the following points when it comes to Correcting the Receipt <br />
<br />
1. Receipt Correction is not allowed if order is not originated by Purchase (or) Pur Module doesn't allow the correction<br />
2. If the PO Line is being used in ACP Module (tdpur401.stsd = Approved), then you can't change the Receipt<br />
<br />
LN uses the following DLL to check if the Correction can be made to the particular receipt line (or) not.<br />
<br />
whinh.dll0312.receipt.correction.allowed<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you find the issue. Feel free to reach me out if you still have any issues/queries.</div></div><hr />
