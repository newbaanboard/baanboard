Problem: <br />
We're having an issue with items with an SIC system setting.  At times we have a re-occurring system request to order an item that has already been placed on order.  If you look at the data we have a demand order (sales order requirement) and a offsetting supply order (purchase order for a requirement), but we are still being asked to order more by Baan.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
We think that it has something to do with the &quot;time phased order point&quot; setting, but we are not sure.<br />
<br />
Can someone explain what the &quot;time phased order point parameter&quot; does?  And, could it create this problem?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Matt</div></div><hr />
