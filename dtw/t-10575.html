Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">1st July 2003, 09:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan is great, but it cannot trigger a cost price update by itself. Best table to check is ticpr300 for your item, assuming projects is not used. Find the item in question and check the last date that the price was rolled up and updated. By the way ticpr300 is a good table to audit along with a few others...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swatcat</div><div class="date">1st July 2003, 09:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply.I checked in ticpr300 .On a certain date the cost price had been triggered and calculated wrongly.The previous calculation (date which i saw in the above mentioned table ) is correct. What data should i check which could have resulted in this wrong calculation.The purchase price in item data is correct.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">1st July 2003, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a difficult question: the reason being that baan does not store old value/new value except in ticpr300. I assume the item is of type 'purchased' then the factors used in determining the cost price are:<br />
<br />
Check the live cost price calculation code purchase price priority:<br />
Si = simulated purchase price<br />
Cp = current purchase price (from item master form 3)<br />
Ap = average purchase price (ditto)<br />
Lp = latest purchase price (ditto)<br />
<br />
Ap/Lp are determined when matching invoices to orders.<br />
<br />
Anyway one of the above is used based on your priority... then added to that you may have surcharges based on item group or simply by item.<br />
<br />
Please note that it is incredibly difficult to determine what numbers were used in determining the cost price after the update has completed - you have to choices: what we have done is create a report that prints all of these factors before an update of the cost price is done -&gt; anyone not doing this on our system will be shot.<br />
The other choice is to audit all the tables that are possibly used in determining the cost price. (very data intensive)<br />
<br />
If you'd like a copy of the report let me know...<br />
<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan will not trigger a cost price updation automatically.In the integration trnx you can find out the user who updated the cost .<br />
<br />
As to how cost has been calculated will depend upon the priorities as explained by Rupert. It would also depend upon the setting in the PO parameters- Current inventory or cumulative purchases, when did you last run the session tdpur4225m000- Equate balance of purchases with inventory and whether purchase invoices have been matched and approved in finance. So it would be very difficult to say how the cost was calculated at a particular point in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swatcat</div><div class="date">1st July 2003, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply.I have checked the purchase integration transactions and the purchase invoices.The price what is paid to the supplier against the quantity is correct.<br />
regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayant Keskar</div><div class="date">1st July 2003, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
I am sorry I was not clear in my reply about integrations. You can find out which users has updated the cost price by looking at the 'Warehouse Order Revaluation ' <br />
<br />
As regards how the cost was calculated, it would be difficult to know at this point in time. What do your fields 'Average Pur Price' and Latest Pur Price show in the item master</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">1st July 2003, 16:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Jayant, unfortunately the warehouse order revaluation will only be triggered if there is indeed inventory recorded in the system. I am not sure if swatcat is looking for someone to blame or an answer as to how the price was determined??<br />
<br />
I wonder if this will ever be resolved, as we do not have ready access to all the information required?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Rupert</div></div><hr />

But i am interested in knowing how the price was determined??<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BBailey</div><div class="date">2nd July 2003, 22:21</div></div><div class="posttext">there is no &quot;one right answer&quot; as to how cost price is calculated.  It depends on the particular configuration. Start with your cost price calculation code priority, find the purchase price that applies, add any surcharges (by item or item grp), and if purchased in foreign currency, convert to home currency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swatcat</div><div class="date">5th July 2003, 07:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply.In the cost price calculation code priority ap is no 1. which already has changed in the item data ..and i am wondering why? when all the purchase invoices/receipts are at correct price.Then no 2 is Lp which is also correct for that item.<br />
As you have mentioned about currency the item is purchased in home currency.Surcharges i will have to check if any.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">5th July 2003, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Average purchase price and latest purchase price are updated in invoice approval (tfacp1140s000)  and change price / discount after delivery( tdpur4122m000) . <br />
<br />
So if the average price is changed through this session and cost price is recalculated for the item , then cost price changes and warehouse/revaluations will be generated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swatcat</div><div class="date">14th July 2003, 07:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey! Thanks to all of you for your help.The matter has been resolved.The cost price calc script which was written in-house had a bug.</div></div><hr />
