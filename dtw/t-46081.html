<br />
Could someone tell me the procedures involved for year end closing. I have listed a few, have i missed out on something important. I am aware on the finance front, need help on logistic &amp; manufacturing front. Here are the few which comes accross my mind right away. <br />
<br />
- All open purchase orders having delivery date before the year closing date needs to be <br />
<br />
processed. The same check needs to be done for Sales Order <br />
- Validate for any partial processing in &quot;Planned inventory TYransaction&quot; tdinv1550m000 &amp; <br />
<br />
tdinv1551m000, ensure same is processed so as to reflect in History. <br />
- Any warehouse transfer or replenishment orders needs to re-looked, before carrying forward <br />
<br />
the actual inventory. <br />
- Validate WIP inventory against finished goods. <br />
- Special mention to inventory. We need to carry bare minimum inventory cost. <br />
Anything else that i missed out ? <br />
Regards, <br />
Neetal</div></div><hr />
