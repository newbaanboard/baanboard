This is in Infor ERP LN FP7,  Session “Serialized Items” ( tscfg2100m000 ) in tab “Configuration control” where the <br />
Location Type is showing “In Transit”,<br />
<br />
Want to know the probable reasons for the appearance of this indication. <br />
And if needs to be changed, please guide as to how it can be done.</div></div><hr />

No one replied on this. But by now I have got explanation on this after simulations.<br />
<br />
During Depot Repair, in Maintenance Sales Order, the Item code is used for carrying out the Depot Repair for the Serialized Item recd from Customer at our warehouse. The Serial number is attached to the item in Warehouse receipt for the Maintenance Sales Order, and at that instant the Location Type becomes &quot;Warehouse&quot; for the Serialized Itemcode in tscfg2100m000. When the maintenance is over and the Item is once again billed and dispatched back to the customer, the Item is out of our warehouse, and hence the Location Type becomes &quot;In Transit&quot;. This is standard proccess seen in ERP LN FP7.</div></div><hr />
