<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danny Leolux</div><div class="date">7th September 2005, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">When we close a route (trtop4292m000) in Transportation, with visits linked that represent salesorders that do not have the orderstatus &quot;close routes&quot; yet, the route is closed anyway. Later when the salesorders do have the status &quot;close route&quot; we have a problem. Because the route is already closed and cannot be closed again (?) and therefor the status of the sales order is blocked.<br />
<br />
How do we avoid/solve this problem ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
