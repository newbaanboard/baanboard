<br />
I'm trying to figure out how the purchase order delivery date is being calculated in case item-supplier info is entered for the relevant BP/item [tdipu0510m000].<br />
<br />
I have set up one BP in the test company (we do not yet work with item-supplier info), and I set the delivery time to 30 days. When I create an order for this BP/item today, and in the order line on the third tab I click to calculate the planned delivery date, I get a date which is around *3 of the amount of days set in the item supplier info. I have played around with it, and saw that there is no constant factor, but it seems all the time around factor 3.<br />
<br />
Anyone shed some light please?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!<br />

<br />
The calculation of the deliverydate depends on the definition of your calender, which could be linked to your adres of the delivery adress. If for instands you have defined availability types for the kalenderlines, than this definition will be taken into account when calculating the delivery date. Perhaps you should take a look at your calender definition. Try linking a calender with 7 days availability from 0:00 till 23:59.<br />
<br />
Hope this will be of some help for you..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">9th March 2004, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I've meanwhile found the cause of this issue:<br />
<br />
In Baan 5.0 the calculation of delivery date based on supplier-item info is apparently very primitive. In our calendar the days are defined as working days from 08:00 to 16:30, i.e. 8.5 hours per day. When setting a delivery date of 10 days, Baan will calculate 10 * 24 hours, with a base of 8.5 per day, thus resulting in 28.235 (working-) days!!<br />
<br />
I find this very incorrect, because it is not relevant for me to know how long the working day at my company is when calculating the delivery date of my supplier...!! I logged a case at Baan Support, and the response was just that this is the functionality at Baan5.0, and that in Baan 5.2 (reger) it has been improved...<br />
<br />
I was waiting for a suggestion from Support to upgrade to 5.2 but lucky enough that didn't come this time.... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should be able to get it work by defining availability types with times not available for days 24 hours available..... so 24 hours available, exept between fi 1700  and 830. This way you have defined standard working days.</div></div><hr />
