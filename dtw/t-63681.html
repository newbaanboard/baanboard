<br />
After so many years on INV we are exploring an opportunity to activate the ILC and migrate to it (maybe LOT also). Has anyone migrated and can give me some pros and cons or maybe some documentation to read?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">5th February 2013, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Cons: <br />
More process steps (Inbound, Outbound)<br />
You have to book every move of the material, also within the same warehouse<br />
New functionality (training, menues, customizing)<br />
<br />
Pros: <br />
clear location of material (e.g. for large warehouses)<br />
easy to find<br />
easy for counting<br />
<br />
<br />
The programm for transferring INV to ILC (books all material to the entry location (specified in ilc setup per warehouse) has a bug ... you should customize the sorting of the material (standard and pcs). otherwise it is not clear if the programm is stille running or finished.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've downloaded the ILC module manual form Infor but there is just sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">6th February 2013, 05:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think there exists a migration steps as you are looking for. To convert INV o ILC one has to generate the location system. Please note that ILC can be implemneted even if warehouse is not location controlled. After generating location control in company one has to make warehouse also location control if required. The invenotry shall be present in tdilc101 table also after comverting company into location control. These are standard sessions. The real challenge will happen in sales module. Normally, the Generate O/B step is part of sales order procedure, so you may have to include this step in alll open orders as well in order type. If you need any more help you can email at avpatil@hotmail.com</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the approximate timeline to migrate from INV to ILC?<br />
1-2 month preparations and then switch over-night?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">22nd February 2013, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">1-2 month is more than enough. Most of the process are system generated. In Sales order you may have to write program to add new steps. I think if one really know what to do one week is more than enough.</div></div><hr />

This is mainly used to train the users how to deal with it. Good preparation makes the success.<br />
<br />
Here are the main steps:<br />
1. Training all the users;<br />
2. Update all users' menu and permissions;<br />
3. Switch the system with session tdilc0230m000;<br />
4. Change location system for warehouses with session tdilc0231m000;<br />
5. Generate locations for each warehouse;<br />
6. Cycle Counting to move the stock to new locations;<br />
7. Update other settings if applicable such as order types, reports, etc.</div></div><hr />
