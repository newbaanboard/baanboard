<br />
We receive the order of quantity 1000 mtr from customer. For this we make sale contract of quantity 1000 mtr. Then we prepare sale order against sale contract. but sometime we are not getting quantity as in sale contract form our department so then we make sale order of quantity 950 mtr. And balance 50 mtr is in sale contract. <br />
I want to remove this balance 50 mtr quantity from sale contract because its showing in pending sales contract and our auditor asking the question for this quantity. <br />
<br />
What I will have to do for this. Can any one help me out?   <br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

Anyway if it is a problem then you can de-activate the contract, change the qty to the exact called qty and then activate it again.</div></div><hr />
