<br />
Is it possible to include into the purchased item cost price several other costs like transportation, services,etc. ? These costs are comming from different invoices in random time periods so they are not linked to the moment of delivery of goods or to the moment of the invoice receiving of those goods we buy.<br />

Thank You,</div></div><hr />

There is no other way to add to Purchase Price Cost after receipt.</div></div><hr />

I think that there isn't an easy way to include these serveral purchase cost to item cost price.<br />
We have BaanIV c4 and we had to create some fields in tdpur041 and a maintenance for them. When we receive a purchase invoice related to purchase transportation, custom, etc. we allocate the amount in the purchase orders.</div></div><hr />
