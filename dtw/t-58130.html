So the question is how you where able to create the 'old' order type.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan.kmurali</div><div class="date">29th March 2010, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Bernd. Actually when i run the dealer Invoice session the sales invoice no is created, so print sales invoice step is not necessary which staus is &quot;NO&quot;.<br />
<br />
please tell me can i change the staus as &quot;YES&quot; through GTM or Update session.<br />
<br />
Thanks|Murali</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">29th March 2010, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Murali, are you running standard BaanIVc4? This because you are mentioning dealer invoice. <br />
Many sessions can be run even when they are not in the procedure. The order steps are used the other way around, to check that certain steps are not forgotten.<br />
<br />
Of course you can try to modify tcmcs042 via GTM but I think you will run into troubles for open orders using this Order Type.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks|Murali.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">31st March 2010, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if there will be any trouble. Open orders are created against the old version of the order type. At moment you change the order type I don't know whether you will be able to go through the procedure correctly for those open orders. <br />
So it will be on your own risk.<br />
