<br />
I am running on BaaN V b, would like to take records which are pending for PDPO<br />
<br />
for this i went into tdpur401 table and checked for field tdpur401.acti = &quot;tdpur4223m000&quot; , but it's not giving me the correct records, what should be the criteria for selection of records which r pending for PDPO.<br />
<br />
Is my logic wrong ?<br />
<br />
<br />
I belive the same logic will also apply to PDSO.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

Same should apply to tdpur045 . Also checl tdpur4533m000 for order status if possible. <br />
<br />
Is table tdpur401 localized one . No idea abt it .</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are referring to BaanIV. Table tdpur401 is the purchase order line table in BaanERP.<br />

Did you try to run the session with the option 'Print Errors' selected? Normally records that are not processed should be printed on the error report. Verify if the 'Process Up to' date is not in the past for your orders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note that the procedure mask is not finished. If the last position of tdpur401.pmsk is 'e', it means that tdpur4223m000 is already executed. You cannot process the order line anymore. You only can delete it.</div></div><hr />
