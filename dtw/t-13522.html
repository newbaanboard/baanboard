I are setting up some international companies and will be setting up our inventory valuation as a weighted average for European reporting requirements.  <br />
the issue is with the use of these two setup issues concurrently - will purchases into the customer owned warehouse (inbound material not owned) will affect the weighted avearage calculation?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance on any imput on the inventory valuation question and who may be using (and their experience with) weighted average inventory valuation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I understand you correctly you are using the Consignment functionality (customer owned warehouse) in b50_c Warehousing as part of your RMA process.<br />
As far as I know purchasing goods for a consignment warehouse (not owned) will have no impact in your inventory valuation.<br />
Are you using MAUC as your Inventory Valuation Method? I am not familiar with weighted average inventory valuation<br />
<br />
I know that in b50_b there were major bugs with MAUC (Moving Average Unit Costs) but they have been resolved in b50_c.<br />
I also know one b50_c customer in Europe that uses MAUC and they have no problems at all with their inventory valuation and cost prices. They have been &quot;Live&quot; with b50_c for more than one year now.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps for you.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

many thanks for the reply, <br />
We are using MAUC for weighted average invnetory valuation and hopefully we will not run into the bugs that are in the earlier version of BaanV. <br />
We are not using consignment warehouses, but using a 100% write off warehouse. <br />
We can push the consignment process and see what costs kick off when the item is pushed out from the warehouse. <br />
Many thanks<br />
