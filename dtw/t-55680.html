<br />
one specific situation. Customer order is 1 Item (collection item) S1 with Price PS1. This Item S1 consists for example of:<br />
5x Item A1 with Price P1<br />
5x Item A2 with Price P2<br />
6x Item A3 with Price P3<br />
<br />
This all items should be in stock reserviert, but the customer will not see this particular items on Invoice. Invoice should be only the collection item S1 with Price PS1.<br />
Attention - there is no Manufacturing Modul used, i.e. no BOM, and no automotive.<br />
Is any solution for this situation? In BaaN IV.    <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

This is how sales kits are handled in BOM. When a SO is created it would be for S1 and then system will expolde the BOM and would affect the inventory of component. If you don't want to enter BOM. then there is no other way of affecting the inventory. And by just implementing BOM, doesn't mean one needs to use all thefunction in mfg. Even if you enter a sales line text, it won't serve any purpose, as the real issue would be adjsut the inventory. The other solution would be to customize it. Basically all one needs to do is create record in table tdsls047 and update the planned transaction and flag the sales order for kit. This would be small customization (to avoid usin bOM).<br />
