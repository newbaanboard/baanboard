<br />
How do we account for it in the system.?  we are on Baan 5c. <br />
<br />
One way is that we manually change the inventory date to match the expiry date. (Using shelf life is not an option because that creates expiry date from date of receipt in warehouse which is not practical)<br />
<br />
For eg. <br />
We purchase item A in Jan which has manuf date Nov 2002 and exp Nov 2003<br />
<br />
The next receipt may be of a different manuf / exp date. <br />
<br />
Please suggest a way out!<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

It only defaults to the data you set up but you can overide it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 13:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I gather there is no way out. <br />
<br />
Because Inventory date = receipt date + shelf life <br />
<br />
and we are anyway changing the inventory date at the time of receipt.  <br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Yip. Inventory date is the expiry date</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">believe that if you make the item Lot Controlled (Lot for Lot) your problems are solved.  each receipt is a new lot number and that specific lot then has an expiry date.  next receipt is a new lot.<br />
<br />
but - be careful using lot controlled because you then have to specify from which lot you are issuing to work orders, etc.</div></div><hr />
