<br />
Purchase people can raise a purchase order for an item with any rate negotiated with vendor.<br />
<br />
Is there is any functionality by which we can restrict rate in purchase order to be compared with any rate entered as master (Standard cost, rate in item file,price lists etc)<br />
<br />
At present what we are able to get is only a report only for actual rates in purchase orders with any rates.<br />
<br />
This is required by top management to put control on purchase rates in purchase orders.<br />

I'm not functional - hopefully someone there can answer for you.<br />
<br />
If you develop at all, you can add validations to sessions fairly easily using the 'rush' procedure developed on these boards.   <br />
<br />
Click here to visit the rush posting (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=559)<br />
<br />
You don't need source code to do so, but will need to be able to install and work with the development tool.<br />
<br />
There are also enhanced supported ($$) versions of similar tools available from both RMCis (my company) and Fullscope.<br />
 <br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

   Set Table Data authorisations for tdpur041 as read only<br />
   For a user <br />
   all companies (or specific company)<br />
   Table Authorisation : D/I/M/R<br />
                                is   Read<br />
   <br />
   if plev not equal to Supl.item (end of Exp)<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
   Again for the same user, specific company or all companies<br />
   table Authorsiation D/I/M/R<br />
                               is D/I/M/R<br />
   if plev equal to Supl.Item <br />
<br />
<br />
   You can introduce PO Series if you desire in the expression.<br />
<br />
   This will ensure prices are entered <br />
   in the session tdpur0101m000 for Supplier. item <br />
   for the given PO series if specified.<br />
<br />
   DRAWBACK:<br />
   You may have a number of <br />
   tdpur040-Headers having no tdpur041-details.<br />
    <br />
