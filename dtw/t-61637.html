We have an urgent requirement to include some fields from a customize table to generate 810Out File. The index of that table is Shipment No. (shpm). We do not have the source code for the dll. How to do that using Assignment Expression<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
to my knowledge not possible without customizing the corresponding dll.<br />
Whenever we had to add table fields from non standard tables to a EDI conversion set-up the linked dll must be changed.<br />
<br />

We have several fields in Baan IVc4 NAS0 sales tables that we added to take information back out in our EDI messages.  Baan didn't have the required (automotive) fields needed in their standard code.<br />
<br />
If the table you have customized is already used in the EDI conversion set-up going &quot;out&quot; then you should be able to add the new fields to the conversion set-up and it will put that information out of Baan as well.  <br />
<br />
We pretty much have an interal rule for EDI, if you add a field for outgoing messages it will most likely take it out.  It's the incoming data you need to have the DLL modified or come up with a work around to pull the data and update the applicable fields with customizations.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...</div></div><hr />
