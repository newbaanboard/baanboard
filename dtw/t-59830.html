<br />
I have a problem with inbound ASN over EDI. I'm using BEMIS for EDI and made all setup with documents at edi.baan.com. I have implemented EDI for purchase schedules without any problem and now I want to setup inbound ASN. <br />
<br />
I imported defults.edi file and made necessary setup. But when BAAN process an inbound ASN, some fields like creation date &amp; time (tdpsc040.crdt &amp; tdpsc040.crti), gross weight (tdpsc040.grwt) fields are recorded as null even if they're in the file. <br />
<br />
I made some changes in standart mapping and included crdt and crti fields and set msg processing type &quot;interactive&quot;. After I run &quot;Direct Network Communication&quot; , I see correct values at session tcedi7151s000 but when I run &quot;Process Saved Messages to be received (tcedi7252m000)&quot; again these fields are recorded as null. <br />
<br />
When I enter a manual entry to &quot;Maintain ASN header - EDI (tdpsc0140m000)&quot;, there is no problem. Is there something I'm missing here? Any comment and help would be useful.<br />
<br />
Thanks already.</div></div><hr />
