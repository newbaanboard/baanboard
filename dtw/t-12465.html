Some of you seemed to think Baan should push it more, but I'm concerned about the lack of user support provided.  What have some of you done in the past for documentation?  Does anyone have a proven implementation schedule, training material, etc. that they might be willing to share?  I've spoken with Baan, but what they shared with me was very basic, not helpful, and all they could find!  Any info anyone has would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
guess you contacted your local Baan support in the US  :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
After working almost six years with Baan and Baan Transportation we found that the best guys, consulting and support, are located in the headquarter in the Netherlands. If you got serious problems perhaps you can contact them directly or with the help of your local Baan office?<br />
<br />
Transportation is worth this effort - never stop exploring.<br />
