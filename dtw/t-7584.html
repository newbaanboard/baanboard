In B4c4 turning of location &amp; lot control would cause it to consider stock of an item in a particular WH as one big chunk. This makes the inventory handling somewhat simpler. However, in B5, not using either location or lot control wouldn't prevent it from time stamping every batch of inventory. This effectively enforce lot control without lot code. You'd have to specify how much inventory should be issued from which inventory date? If you don't use lot control and label the goods, how would you be able to distinguish stock from certain dates physically in WH anyway?<br />
<br />
Does any of you know of  a way around this so that we can have simpler inventory handling in B5c with location &amp; lot control disabled? The only way on my mind now is to always receive goods into the same inventory date. But even that is hard because B5c doesn't provide zoom to list of used inventory date when recording receipt.<br />

FIFO and LIFO needs the stamp and the defaul is FIFO.</div></div><hr />
