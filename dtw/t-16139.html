<br />
Is it possible to have different cost per unit of any given item stored in different geographical locations. How this can be acheived in BaaN. Say for example, if an item is stored in a warehouse inside a free zone, the cost of the item is different as soon as it moves to a warehouse outside free zone because of customs duty etc. <br />
<br />
Please explain,<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">30th July 2004, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">If the implementation is multi-logistics-[single-multi] finance , it can be done in Baan IV . However item master can not be shared in this case . I think ur implementation is different one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
We have been considering single finance/multi logistic structure. What are the apparent disadvantages of this structure? We have operations scattered in different geographical locations, does it necessitate single fin/multi logistic structure? <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">31st July 2004, 09:16</div></div><div class="posttext">There can be many considertions. Try to tell u as many as i can recollect.<br />
<br />
1. Package combinations have to be same for all such companies. So separate<br />
 business logic for different logistic companies may require extensive <br />
detailed designs<br />
2.If the logistics companies deal in same set of items (ie same LOB) , the item master<br />
, BOM / routing etc have to be maitained in all companies separately or <br />
separate program  / exchange schemes have to be written to keep these masters in sync.<br />
3.All companies in the group must have the same home country / home currency. This may not<br />
be the case in ur case.<br />
4.All financial companies must have the same period definition in finance.<br />
5.All companies must have the same master data for suppliers,customers,<br />
 and tables (stored centrally and applying to all companies within the<br />
 group). This may not be the reality if each logistics company has its<br />
 own set of supplier/customers.<br />
<br />
So Baan IV multi-company structure can be useful for multi-location within the country <br />
having same legal entity.<br />
<br />
U can try the MCR version of Baan IV (if possible) with a leading currency as base currency<br />
if it's spread across multiple countries. And have consolidation through<br />
such base currency.</div></div><hr />
