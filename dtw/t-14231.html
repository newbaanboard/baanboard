<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gentercz</div><div class="date">19th January 2004, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
we set up an EDI scenario with one company making Purchase Orders. They get transferred with EDI to another company, becoming a Sales Order.<br />
For changes in PO's we use the change codes, so all changes are also visible in genrerated SO. This works.<br />
<br />
EDI messages are generated with &quot;Print PO&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now the problem: When we DELETE a PO or just a line, this PO can not be printed again, because it is deleted. <br />
So the &quot;delete-change message&quot; is not send via EDI.<br />
<br />
How can we send these Delete Messages with standard BaaN EDI ?<br />
<br />
Has anybody a solution for this ?!?<br />
<br />
Any help apreciated,<br />
Jochen</div></div><hr />

<br />
never worked with PO changes within EDI, but i have read in the Baan EDI User Guide (U7041C) that there is no way to directly transmit the chancellation  of a purchase oder line. To do this, you must change the order line quantity to zero and process the line as a change. <br />
<br />
For more information please read page 6-9 in the EDI User Guide<br />
&quot;Changing the purchase order (860/ORDCHG) IVb GLO and IVc only&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a little,<br />

<br />
this sounds like a bug (but i am sure baan calls it feature ...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Juergen is correct.  The procedure is to first set the quantity to zero and process the change. Once the EDI transaction has been generated you can then go back and delete the line.</div></div><hr />

In case of cancellations, it is very easy to handle this scenario and more over, the history for the lines  will be retained.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I agree with all .... the only way to post this PO cancellation is to make the Order line quantity &quot;zero&quot; for the line to be cancelled and then process the PO change... and then delete the PO.<br />
<br />
