(loca field)<br />
<br />
Normally we would use the tdilc1120m000 session to do this but it would be very time consuming to change the 1000's of records that we need to.<br />
<br />
I am looking at creating either a Baan Exchange scheme or back-end data load. <br />
<br />
Has anybody done what I need to do? If so how was it acheived?<br />
<br />
Are there any other tables to consider when importing the data?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I have done this quite a few times now using exchange. It is not as bad as it seems. Mail me at jan_park@bio-rad.com<br />
