<br />
We're using Baan 4C.<br />
<br />
Most of our items are set up with the following settings in the Item Master:<br />
Inspection=Yes<br />
Outbound Priority=By Location<br />
<br />
After the receipts are entered in session tdpur4120m000 Maintain Receipts, our users open session tdpur4121m000 Maintain Approvals.<br />
<br />
In the past, when clicking in the &quot;Approved&quot; quantity field, the user was taken to sub-session tdilc4123s000 Maintain Approvals.<br />
<br />
Now, however, when clicking in the Approved quantity field, the sub-session is not launched and all entry can happen at the main session level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone know, what parameter controls this feature? We'd like to be able to access the sub-session for each approval.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

<br />
When a lot item is used or when there is a difference between inventory unit and storage unit, the sub session is launched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chris Kiehl</div><div class="date">8th December 2005, 17:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I didn't give enough information...<br />
<br />
Our items are set up like so:<br />
<br />
Inspection=Yes<br />
Outbound Priority=By Location<br />
Lot Control=Not Applicable<br />
All Units of Measure=EA<br />
<br />
Is there anything else which causes the sub-session to be used?<br />
<br />
Last month it launched each time we used Maintain Approvals but this month it does not at all... the Main session is used. Obviously something has changed, but I don't know what.<br />
<br />
Thanks,   -Chris-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">11th August 2006, 12:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, guys,<br />
Anybody ever figure this one out? We have one item, ordered through 2 different POs with exact same settings. Funny thing is the approval can be recorded in main screen (tdpur4121m000) for one PO, but has to be recorded in different looking screen (tdilc4123s000) for the other one. The only difference we can find is that they are currently located in different inspection locations. But, the inspection locations have the exact same settings as well. The only difference between the inspection locations is that one is default inspection location and the other isn't. But we tried switching the default location and it has no effect.<br />
<br />
We don't have the tdpur4121 source code, so we can't really pin point what's causing this. Anybody can help? Thanks<br />
<br />
Rgds,<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chris Kiehl</div><div class="date">11th August 2006, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">The situation you are describing is also what was happening to us. We also had a second Inspection location. But the results were not consitent and could not be re-produced during testing.<br />
<br />
When I contacted Baan support on this issue they informed me that parameter &quot;Storage Unit Used for Inbound Advice&quot; in session tdilc0100m000 Maintain ILC Parameters controls whether sub-session tdilc4123s000 will launch from main-session tdpur4121m000 Maintain Approvals or not. <br />
<br />
Since we prefer the sub-session (it allows for partial approvals without rejecting right away) we went ahead and set this parameter to &quot;Yes&quot;.<br />
<br />
This caused the sub-session to always launch.<br />
<br />
But be aware, this parameter will causes sub-sessions to launch from other main sessions as well... such as:<br />
tisfc0202m000 Report Production Orders Complete<br />
tdpur4120m000 Maintain Receipts<br />
tdilc1120m000 Enter Inventory Transactions<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

I sort of found another pattern too. In here, storage unit is not used for inbound advice. But I found that tdilc4123s000 will launch during approval if we generated inbound advice for the receipt prior to approval.<br />

I found another pattern for this tdilc4123s000 too. Regardless of the value of the parameter Storage Unit Used for Inbound Advice, this screen will always come up if purchase unit or storage unit differs from inventory unit<br />

can u give me some more information on this regard. What is the item type for which u r getting this issue. r u changed the item type for the mentioned items, because recently i too get the same problem, i found that for subcontracting items/ or for those item types not related with location control, the session tdilc4123s000 is not activated. This may be one of the reason, if u found any other reason pl. let me know.<br />
Thank u<br />
 <br />
regards,<br />

Since changing our ILC parameters, we have been happy with the behavior of the system so I have not revisited.<br />
To answer your question, the items in question were always of Item Type 'Purchased'.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">27th March 2007, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Got another unexpected popping up of tdilc4123s000 from Maintain Approvals again today, thankfully just for one receipt number. Funnily, if we fill up everything on this tdilc4123s000, then return to the Maintain Approvals screen for the same receipt number, nothing pops up any longer. Really, really confusing<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">26th August 2008, 11:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Guys,<br />
I Had a little problem regarding of maintain approval.<br />
I'm using ILC Implemented. Usually when receiving item with inspection = yes and haven't approve yet. The item is in default inspection location with quantity blocked = quantity received. And if approval is made for those receipt, the received quantity moved from inspection to receipt quantity so that we can inbound it to real location.<br />
<br />
Lately, even after getting approval, the quantity is still in insepction location at blocked quantity. Is there any way to fix this? or is there any step that i missed? Please help, and thank you very much.</div></div><hr />
