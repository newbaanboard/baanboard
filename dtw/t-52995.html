<br />
We are facing the crucial problem today. When we confirm the warhouse receipt through session whinh3512m000, it shows an error message &quot;the cost of good sold can't be determined&quot;. This problem is comes in this item. Other items are not shows this type of message.<br />
<br />
We calculate the cost price for that item, but problem is still.<br />
<br />
Please advice how we remove this problem and what is the reason for this.<br />
<br />
Your early response will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DineshSharma</div><div class="date">14th July 2008, 07:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your quick response<br />
the answer for your queries:-- relating to item<br />
<br />
Item Typoe = Mfg<br />
warehouse = FG goods<br />
Valuation = FIFO<br />
cost price date= 12-07-08<br />
order date = 06-07-08<br />
<br />
this production order is partly received and balance qty is received on 12-07-08, but when we revceiving in the warehouse it shows error &quot;&quot;the cost of goods sold is not determined&quot;&quot;. We also check the parameters, but there will be no change.<br />
<br />

As you mentioned, the order was booked on 6th July and costing of that item was done on 12th July. So when you receive the material, it is trying to check costing / valuation of the item as on order date.<br />
Now solution is,<br />
1. Carry out back dated costing of that item (before 6th july) and receive the item or<br />
2. Cancel that order. Carry out costing as on today and received the material after doing costing.<br />
<br />
See which option suits you<br />
<br />
See Ace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DineshSharma</div><div class="date">17th July 2008, 07:54</div></div><div class="posttext">we change the costing date of that item, but we receive the same error message.<br />
<br />
I think it may be related to finance module, because the cost of goods sold is lie any sub module of finance.<br />
<br />
Am i right, pl advice. We can't cancel this Production Order.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
This due u'r order date is earlier than Cost price date. I have the same problem in the past and the problem is cost price calculation date.<br />
<br />
Calculate cost price (once again) backdate before the order date. (see the parameters of Cost Price re. backdate field).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DineshSharma</div><div class="date">6th November 2008, 06:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Please change the costing date &amp; time. u get the desired results. Because in LN Date as well as time is also considered.<br />

Deleting the open receipt which has the original date and starting the receipt over once the cost has been established usually solves the problem.<br />
