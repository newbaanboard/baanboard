There are some managerial steps you can implement to at least minimise it<br />
 First of all, how did the wrong amount came about to invoicing? I imagine if the sales person already keyed in the correct order price and warehousing person keyed in the correct qty being shipped, then the amount should be correct. You guys do print the packing slip you send to customers right from BaanERP and sign it before sending, right? Remember that, if there's a last minute price change even after packing slip is produced (but before invoice being issued) you guys can still change the price using Change Prices/Discounts after Delivery<br />
 It's a good idea to let Central Invoicing module handled by AR dept. That way, they can at least add another cross checking before any invoice is produced to make sure that qty, price, invoice date, and term of payments are all specified correctly. And, after the invoice is printed, have it signed by sales manager for final physical check of what's written on the invoice<br />
