<br />
we would like to use the field &quot;Safety Stock&quot; for our SIC planning.<br />
<br />
Who has got a detailed documentation how to use<br />
it and what different kind of options are possible.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your replies.<br />

<br />
thanks for this information.<br />
<br />
You can be sure that was my first thought, too<br />
but unfortunately there is nothing mentioned referring to the use of field &quot;Safety Stock&quot;<br />
in context with SIC.<br />
<br />
Hope that anybody else has got other idea.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
Is the text of the field-help not enough?<br />
Too it depends:<br />
what is the policy of the Logistic/financial manager.<br />

<br />
do you really like the BaaN field help?<br />
<br />
Of course, it is always the first library you<br />
are going to take a look, but...<br />
<br />
My supposition is that when the Safety Stock field is filled you should receive a message/warning when you key in a sales order or generate outbound data.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this is not the case and it seems<br />
that there is no parameter, etc.....<br />
<br />
But thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">7th November 2002, 08:37</div></div><div class="posttext">The safety stock is the stock that should never be touched. The reorder point (&quot;Meldebestand&quot;) is the stock level at which you will have to order. When you order at this point, the new delivery will appear exactly when your safety stock is reached (in case theres an &quot;optimal&quot; stable demand).<br />
So the safety stock is just used for calculating the reorder point, which is actually the stock level that SIC reacts on.<br />
<br />
Thomas, if you give me a short phone call, I will be glad to explain you the SIC principles (in german...). <br />
<br />

<br />
What's the &quot;K&quot; factor in the calculation of the safety stock?<br />
is the function of the safety stock only to calculate the reorder point?...or it has others functions...(alert level,...)?<br />
<br />
Now we work manually and the safety stock seems not to work? Is it for this reason explained above?<br />
And finally if we really want to get informations automatically, what's the procedure and is it possible on a few items only?<br />
<br />
thanks a lot<br />

<br />
Reorderpoint and safetystock don't have a relationship in regards to the reordering. reordering is done according to the planned delivery and the leadtime for ordering new stock (or manufacturing).  The moment in time where the stock is below the reorderpoint, new stock will be issued (incl. leadtime).<br />
In my opinion safety stock is used in MRP/DRP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giovanol</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for answer...<br />
<br />
Just another question...<br />
<br />
When I use the demand forecast, in the results it gives me the forecast error (absolute and real) and a demand forecast average?<br />
<br />
What does these fields mean and how are they calculated?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronny Terhaerdt</div><div class="date">27th November 2002, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
The way they are calculated is stated at the bottom of the report and in the different helpfiles.<br />
Good luck with decripting them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dansimmo</div><div class="date">3rd December 2002, 05:17</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of other points about safety stock<br />
<br />
You can set it by warehouse and there is a parameter by warehouse that decides wether to use the warehouse/item setting or the item master setting.<br />
<br />
There is also functionality to do &quot;time phased inventory check&quot; which gives a message from the sales order lines session</div></div><hr />
