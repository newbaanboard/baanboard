<br />
I have a problem and a possible solution that i would like some professionals to give their opinion about.<br />
<br />
We use Baan IVc. <br />
<br />
Today we have in Baan a main warehouse and a production warehouse. We are not ready to implement ILC. <br />
<br />
We have 3 different production lines+spare parts production and distribution. The production line shares the production warehouse and the spare parts are mainly connected to the main warehouse.<br />
<br />
The main problem with this configuration is that some items are used in more than one production line but has only one location in that warehouse. So some of the items have locations not shown in Baan, and therefore the inventory on hand in the production.<br />
<br />
The questions is therefore, are there any downsides with having different warehouse for different production lines?<br />
<br />
Are there any complications with having like 5-6 different warehouses or are there any better solutions??<br />
<br />
And also would I like to know how you handle your spare parts, due to their fast delivery timess and unknown usage??, are there in a separate warehouse, replenished by the main warehouse or??<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

Alternatively, you can use WIP warehouses- one for each production line.When the production order is released, the requirement will be transferref from main to WIP.Replenishment orders can be generated to do the inventory transfer. <br />
 I assume the spare parts are also the components of some finished product. You can stock the spare parts in finished warehouse. The only drawback is that say if you are short of spare parts for production run, MRP will not generate the planned production or purchase order as it will see the spare parts stock. You may want to consider to build some kind of safety stock. You can also make spare parts MPS and have the demand be projected-so spare part demand will be indepedent demand and requirement fromproduction order would be dependent demand. But this will make your MPS run longer, but this would be the good way to plan for spare parts.<br />
