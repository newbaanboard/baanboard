Which type of ware house, a location controlled or un location controlled  will have the benefit for the company.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nanuco</div><div class="date">30th June 2004, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Ther is no right or wrong. If your warehouses are location controlled you should use this possibility if they are not location controled then you shouldn´t use this possibility.<br />
<br />
The great diference is that the location controlled warehouse, besides controlling the location of the itens of course :), has one or two more sessions per entry because the material instead of going directly to the warehouse, the receipt puts in a docking bay from where it goes to the right location.<br />
<br />
hope i could help, any more questions i will try and look into it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nanuco</div><div class="date">30th June 2004, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">you can create zones and locations, then you can have locations per zones.You are not obliged to have zones but it will help if your warehouse is big.<br />
<br />
I don´t use the locations in my warehouse but from what i saw i think you need at least the receipt location. To advise you more, as you can imagine, i would need to understand how your warehousing process works.<br />
<br />
hope it helped,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">30th June 2004, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">To use Warehouse with Locations you must define a receiving location where purchase items are received and a stagging location for shipments going out.  These are the required Locations per warehouse.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
