When I try to do a stock transfer in the session tdilc1120m000, my system display a message: &quot;Wrong stock order&quot;. This is because I reached the maximum number for my series. But when I try to add another series in thes session tcmcs0147m000 Mantain first free numbers, it appears me another message: &quot;Series not used, is not allowed to add&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there another place for add another stock order serires? or this is a normal in Baan IV c2?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be aware of the fact that the series used for warehouse orders are hard coded and can't be changed. Series 6 is used for warehouse transfers. If you get to the end of the numbering you have to reset the first free number of series 6. This means that double order numbers can be created but that won't cause any problem since the first index of the table consists of more than just the order number, but it might cause some confusion. You could also opt for archiving the stock transactions first.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
