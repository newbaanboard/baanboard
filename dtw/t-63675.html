<br />
Outbound Method: FIFO<br />
<br />
Warehouse Receipt from Production by pallet - example 3 pallets (1 pallet=1000pcs, another 2 pallets=900pcs), one Lot# for one pallet.<br />
<br />
When shipment, system to allocate 2 pallets (total of 1900pcs), instead of 1 pallets &amp; 800pcs.<br />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it is possible. If the invenory unit or storage unit is pallet then it might do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TebbyTan</div><div class="date">11th February 2013, 15:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, if maintain palette size as the inventory unit, is possible, however cannot receive stock in different palatte size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">11th February 2013, 15:52</div></div><div class="posttext">You will need to create different standard pallet size like pallet 1- 1000 pcs pallet2 800pcs. When porduction order is received one can pick up different unit, I think that is how it may be configured. Alternatively one can make it lot controlled and make it lot by lot. SO when first production order is received create a lot of 1000 pcs and when next lot is receievd create a lot of 900 pcs.I think one will have to play with this scenario....<br />
