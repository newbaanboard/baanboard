<br />
When we receive a PO say for 1 qty. (order qty. also 1) in some cases instead of deleting that transaction from the planned inventory (tdinv150), BaaN is actually creating a negative transaction. In this case, once we receive this PO and look in the planned inventory transaction screen the same PO now will have 1 as the planned quantity. Even though we have source for maintain receipts wed not been unable to reproduce the problem. <br />
<br />
Just wanted to check and if anyone else experienced this problem and if there were any fixes for it.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">31st August 2005, 04:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this happens b'cos the table tdinv150 (planned inventoy transactions by item) does not get updated properly all the times. For example, in the present case, there should have been an entry of +1 in the table for the On order quantity. When the GRN is actually done, means that the material is received, then the on order quantity for that PO line has to be reduced by the receipt quantity which is -1. So thebalance becomes zero.<br />
<br />
But in some cases, the first entry of +1 for the on order quantity may not be there due to which the 2nd entry of -1 actually makes us believe that the inv balance is -1.<br />
<br />
To correct this, you must run the Inventory Error correction programs tdinv0250m000 and tdilc0250m000 and then check. You can read more on this session from the session help.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Or is the script customized perhaps?</div></div><hr />
