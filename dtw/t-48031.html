<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mattan</div><div class="date">12th February 2008, 04:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a requirement to set quantity allocation for multiple suppliers for each item so that MRP will planned the demand accordingly based on the input.  <br />
<br />
I was told that Purchase Schedules does that and therefore I have installed the SCH extension since I am on Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
I am struggling with Purchase Schedule since it's new to me and although I have finally managed to run MRP with the allocation correctly, it generated planned purchase schedules which I am not able to convert to a firmed Purchase Order.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate assistance on this following areas:<br />
1) Can Planned Purchase Schedules be converted/transferred to Purchase Order  rather than Purchase Schedules.<br />
2) Is there any alternative to my requirement than to use Purchase Schedules as I found that using Purchase Schedules requires more users work in maintaining Purchase Contracts etc which is not applicatable to us since the requirement is solely to allocate quantity.</div></div><hr />
