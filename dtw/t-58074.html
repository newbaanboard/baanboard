<br />
There is no such facility in Baan IV and audit for table tdinv700 and tdpur045 is not advisable.<br />
U can do it by the using Small customization because they is no recording for Cost item in transaction tables.<br />
<br />
To get the login details u have to check thinv700.</div></div><hr />
