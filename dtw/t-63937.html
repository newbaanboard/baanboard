<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">10th April 2013, 09:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Easiest way to do it :- Use this session tdpur4224m000<br />
<br />
<br />
ELSE (Not recommended)<br />
<br />
<br />
Through GTM , delete the cancelled line. <br />
<br />
Then delete it from the session tdpur4100m000.<br />
<br />
This happens when user cancels a Purchase Order line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">10th April 2013, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Also check if all the lines of that Purchase Order are cancelled.<br />
<br />
If not, manually delete the other lines and then run the session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GTM is not suggestable since histroy as already recorderd as line cancelled.<br />

Hi Anil,<br />
Both cancelled sales &amp; purchase order's can be deleted from sessions:-<br />
tdpur4224m000 &amp; tdsls4224m000, but only when all the lines of that order are cancelled.</div></div><hr />
