<br />
This is the situation...<br />
<br />
We use a cost item  to invoice all the services that our technician did. obviously with diferent cost.<br />
<br />
How can add cost to a sales order if we are using a cost item to invoice it??<br />
<br />

<br />
Question is not clear.<br />
<br />
If you use cost items for invoicing what other cost do you want to add?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">12th February 2004, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Provided you have not already generated the invoice, there is a session called 'Change Prices and Discounts after Mainain Deliveries'  (tdsls4122m000) that can be used to correct order line costs so your invoice is for the right value.<br />
<br />
If you are invoicing technician's service costs, have you thought about using Service and Maintenance where you can have estimated costs held against a service order that have to be actualised before an invoice is produced?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you using it??<br />
