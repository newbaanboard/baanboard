Since we are going to switch to Lot Control soon, will all the inventory on hand be assigned to one Lot, which is the best method in switching to Lot Control in regards to inventory on hand?<br />
<br />
1. Should we do cycle counting first?<br />
<br />
2. Or Just convert items to Lot items  and then do adjustment and move theinventory to the specific Lots.<br />

<br />
When you convert non lot items to lot controlled initially you  can assign the entire inventory on hand to one lot. If you want to assign it to more than one lot then after converting to one lot you can enter inventory adjustment and assign the inventory to multiple lots.<br />
<br />
Inventory in the item master is the total inventory of an item it may under multiple lots and lying in different warehouses.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps <br />

To get to actual numbers, we need to any way count, so why not cycle count ?<br />
A good process in my openion would be to do the following:<br />
1. Generate Cycle Counting orders for the warehouse we wish to move to a Lot Controled situation.<br />
2. Clear all the existing inventory<br />
3. In the mean while complete the count in the Warehouse<br />
4. Upload the new inventory numbers by warehouse/lot into Baan. Typically we have these new inv numbers in Excel sheets. Have a programmer write a program to upload all this data into an Inv Adjustment Order and upload them!! This saves a lot of time.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse, you would have to win the support of the Finance Controller first !!!<br />
<br />
This way you would have a clean inventory situation.</div></div><hr />
