<br />
I'm trying to setup Sales order blocking when a customer has exceeded there credit limit. If possible during sales order entry the order should be blocked from being approved to next stage.<br />
<br />
I've been reading the help pages, and there seems to be alots of things to change. This is what I've modified so far;<br />
<br />
- The business partner has a credit limit set<br />
- In Sales Order Parameters (tdsls0100s400) I have tick the box on &quot;block if credit limit is exceeded&quot;<br />
- I've modified the Credit rating (tcmcs0564m000) to &quot;check credit&quot; at the sales entry stage<br />
- In Sales order types (tdsls0594m000) I've check the box on &quot;credit check&quot;<br />
  In sales Order type-activities (tdsls0694m000) should &quot;Block As of Activity&quot; point to the sales order entry session??<br />
<br />
I was expecting that when entering a sales order line is would be blocked? But this is not the case!<br />
Where do you think I'm going wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance,<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />

2. Blocking step in order type must be 'releast to warehousing' session.<br />
3. Check you have attached a hold reason in the sales order parameter with a credit-check hold reason.<br />
4. I assume you have mentioned some number other than zero as credit limit. Zero means infinite credit.<br />

<br />
I change this part and it worked;<br />
<br />
 2. Blocking step in order type must be 'releast to warehousing' session<br />
<br />
I was expecting it stop users from entering orders, but I did notice, that when I enter in a line the status changes from &quot;free&quot; to &quot;blocked&quot; which is actually better because you can still capture the order.<br />
<br />
cheers<br />
