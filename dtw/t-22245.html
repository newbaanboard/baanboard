<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">3rd November 2004, 11:03</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want this on a item-by-item detail level: there is no table where snapshots of the inventory situation is stored, so a goods movement schedule on item level would need to take the current situation and then calculate backwards the situation at moment X using the historical inventory transactions from tdilc301. To slow and to intensive as you might guess. Alternatively, if you have developer possibilities in your system: create your own report that creates this snapshot every month. See this (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=14605&amp;highlight=inventory+report) thread for the same discussion<br />
If you need the goods movement schedule on a more general level: dump everything from tfgld410/417 into a datawarehouse and create an OLAP cube for this. (Total amounts debit/credit on your inventory ledger account by warehouse, by origin, by period etc.)<br />
