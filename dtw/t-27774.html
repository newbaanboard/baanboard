<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gigaman</div><div class="date">3rd August 2006, 06:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Our production procedure is,<br />
(1) Create production order<br />
(2) Move all raw materials from each raw material warehouse to WIP warehouse<br />
(3) Report production order complete and backflush all materials from WIP warehouse.<br />
We focus on the second step, and find we always need to add all raw materials into warehouse transfer order lines, which is a very very large workload. I remember in baan iv era, we can perform drp process and generate replenishment order containing all required materials demanding from production order. But I cannot find the same or similar method in SSA ERP LN system.<br />
Every baan experts, do you meet the same situation as mine? Could you share some experience to me? Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">7th August 2006, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">A possible solution may be to utilize the concept of Clusters in Enterprise Planning.  (There are also Clusters in Service in LN.)  Cluster functionality is available in Baan V and SSA ERP LN.<br />
<br />
Have you explored this option?  It might be overkill, and there might be a simplier way, but it would automatically create Warehouse Orders to fulfill the WIP Raw Materials demand from the supplying warehouses as a result of the demand created from the production order.<br />
<br />
Also, in SSA ERP LN, Assembly Line Planning and Control functionality exists.  This functionality addresses this issue as well but in a leaner way.</div></div><hr />
