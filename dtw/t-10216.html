<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sujoy.sen</div><div class="date">2nd June 2003, 19:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Outbound shipments from our Finished Goods Warehouse are only allowed out of one Location. For all other Locations in the Finished Goods Warehouse, the Outbound Transactions box is unchecked in whwmd3100s000. This works great for non-Consignment Sales Orders but for Consignment Sales Orders, the Outbound Transactions box does not appear to mean anything since it's seen as a Transfer to another Warehouse. We have to keep the Transhipment Transactions boxes enabled for all Locations to allow transfers within the Finished Goods Warehouse. Is there anyway in Baan to selectively block transactions from certain locations to other warehouses or at least to other consignment warehouses while allowing transactions within the warehouse?</div></div><hr />
