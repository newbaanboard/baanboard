<br />
For a large range of item I am facing this problem. When I try to do negative inventory adjustments, my planned qty (negative qty) becomes my remaining stock and the transaction fails with ' Negative inventory not allowed'<br />
<br />
Example: Warehouse MUT<br />
Item code :3805021IDP0<br />
Inventory on hand =1.9682<br />
Inventory on Order =0<br />
Allocated Inventory=0<br />
Hard Allocated Inventory=0<br />
<br />
I run tdilc1120m000 for item X with planned qty of ( -1.9443). When I try to enter deliveries tdilc1121s000, I see remaining qty becomes equal to (-1.9443). As a result the transaction fails with error above.<br />
<br />
There is not outbound for this item. I have also checked that there is not planned movement either. What causes this? I am experiencing this problem for a large number of items in this warehouse.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your advice.<br />
<br />

You already asked the similar one couple of days ago in the Negative inventory not allowed (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=16796) thread. And you didn't even courteously replied to solution suggestions offered by your fellow members there to let them know whether it has helped you or not. In the future, please use the same thread to follow up on the progress</div></div><hr />
