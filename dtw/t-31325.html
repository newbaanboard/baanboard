<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davismit</div><div class="date">14th February 2007, 13:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, We have a problem were when we run two direct network communication sessions at the same time for two different networks (as in setup in EDI) then we have problems with application locks.  The locks that are created are kind of generic to the DNC session so the second DNC running cant run.<br />
<br />
Any ideas.<br />
<br />
The first DNC is quite complexly related to other processes so it would be difficult to create a unix cript to control it.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to differentiate the two processes so they dont lock.  I have seen on her users running the DNC process so surely this must have happened before.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help<br />

<br />
the process (recieve // send data) is controlled by a semaphore (file).<br />
<br />
Every 5 seconds baan checks if the file exists. If not the appl_to data is read into baan.<br />
<br />
Maybe this makes problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davismit</div><div class="date">14th February 2007, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">and it looks fine when we have just one DNC running.  If we try to run two at the same time (each has a separate DNC network and directory structure) so I assume Baan could run both at the same time but it locks out.  If I run it manually I get the message (Some EDI sessions are still active, it is not possible to start up session exclusively).<br />
<br />
I was hoping that two DNC processes could run simultanuosly if they had different DNC networks in the session which had different directory structures.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could this be possible??<br />

<br />
reason could be the exclusiv application lock.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to register 2 different networks, with 2 different file structures but within one session dnc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davismit</div><div class="date">15th February 2007, 10:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, looks like application locks.  DNC can only run for one network.  Cant understand why Baan wouldnt allow multiple DNC runnig simultaeously if there looking at different networks and directory structures.<br />
<br />
Surely this is posible???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">11th March 2007, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The DNC session has to be customized not to create application lock. In this way multiple DNC sessions for different networks is possible at the same time.<br />
Many Baan clients has the requirement of running multiple networks at the same time and this is the solution I found for my client.</div></div><hr />
