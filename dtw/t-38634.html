Again, this is for particular item; suppliers cannot be deleted. Human errors may occur...<br />

I am not sure about BaaNIV. In LN 6.1 there is a field &quot;Buy-From BP&quot; in Item Purchase Data - tdipu0101m000. In this session you can define the buy-from bp and system treats this in the following way (as copied from help text)<br />
<br />
Hope this will be of some help. If not, keep trying for other ways....Cheers<br />
<br />
Buy-from BP buy-from business partner<br />
Default value<br />
If this field is filled, SSA ERP takes this field as the default value for retrieving a buy-from business partner when a purchase order is generated.<br />
<br />
The searching logic SSA ERP uses to retrieve a buy-from business partner is as follows:<br />
<br />
From the Buy-from BP field in the Item - Purchase (tdipu0101m000) session.<br />
From the Buy-from BP in the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session that is: <br />
Set to Single Source in the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session.<br />
Linked to an Item in the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session.<br />
From the Buy-from BP in the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session that is: <br />
Set to Preferred in the Preferred field of the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session.<br />
Linked to an Item in the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session.<br />
From the Buy-from BP in the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session that is: <br />
Set to Single Source in the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session.<br />
Linked to an Item Group in the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session.<br />
From the Buy-from BP in the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session that is: <br />
Set to Preferred in the Preferred field of the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session.<br />
Linked to an Item Group in the Item - Purchase Business Partner (tdipu0110m000) session.<br />
Note<br />
When a purchase order is generated by Enterprise Planning, this field is not used. As a result, Enterprise Planning starts with number two when searching for a buy-from business partner.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">6th July 2007, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">If blocking a supplier helps , that is there in Baan IV .<br />
<br />
Also  u can add a signal code to an item so that user gets a message to verify the supplier .</div></div><hr />

R U using Supply chain Module, if using u create a contract against required supplier with 100% share of business. This can control your reciepts. <br />
<br />
