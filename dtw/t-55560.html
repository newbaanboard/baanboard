<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lvergnano</div><div class="date">6th April 2009, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello gurus,<br />
I have a short question regarding PO approval.<br />
<br />
I really do not understand what is the meaning of (PO) approval: I see it is a step more, of course, but I do not understand why it is useful, especially if the user can approve the order himself. <br />
<br />
Did someone understand the approval meaning? It is possible, in the standard, to avoid the user to approve his own orders, for example so that they can be approved only from someone else?<br />
<br />
Moreover: if the approval is not useful, can be skipped without customizing?<br />
<br />
I realize that, if someone introduced it, there must be a reason of course, but I do not find it.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />
Luca</div></div><hr />

<br />
First thing is that you can restrict the user to approve a Purchase Order by DEM or User Authorization.<br />
<br />
Now Relivenace of Approval Rule is:<br />
<br />
Once a purchase order is technically complete, it must be approved or routed through an approval process. In the approval process, a set of rules is applied to the purchase order and it is determined if the order needs manual approval or if it is automatically approved. <br />
<br />
You can validate purchase orders against approval rules before their status becomes Approved. These rules enable you to define conditions based on which ERP LN can automatically approve purchase orders. The purchase orders that cannot be approved based on the approval rules, must be approved manually.<br />
There are lots of criteria sets, such as buy-from business partner, buyer, planner, effective date, expiry date, and amount, you can define the approval rule by combining any of these criteria sets.<br />
<br />
To use approval rules, take the following steps:<br />
<br />
 Define a number group for approval rules in the Number Group for Approval Rules field of the Purchase Order Parameters (tdpur0100m400) session.<br />
 Define the Basis for Approval Rule field as Acceptance or Exceptions in the Purchase Order Parameters (tdpur0100m400) session.<br />
 Define the approval rules in the Approval Rules (tdpur0191m000) session.<br />
 If you want to validate purchase orders against approval rules before their status can become Approved, select the Apply Approval Rules check box in the Approve Purchase Orders (tdpur4210m100) session.</div></div><hr />

thanks for your answer.<br />
<br />
But: How can I restrict the user to approve the purchase order? I mean, is the &quot;big green Tick&quot; restrictable? Because, looking at the code, it seems not, but I can also be wrong of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nishant</div><div class="date">7th April 2009, 12:17</div></div><div class="posttext">HI,<br />
<br />
Yes you can remove that Big Green Tick using DEM Edition 2.57</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">8th April 2009, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Furthermore the approval step is treated as the end of order entry. So at moment of approval the order procedure starts. If the first activity(s) is set to automatically it will be executed at moment of approval. Without an approval step it would not be possible to have automatically executed order activities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy_baijun</div><div class="date">11th April 2009, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding about this is :<br />
1)the first function: the end of PO creation. <br />
let us suppose someone is edit the PO, and after the PO edit finish, someone else should continue process. How dows the next person know the PO edit is completed or not. because there is not any flag to distinguish.  The buyer create the PO with 2POL(purhcase order line) and then he off work. In the evening, the next buyer want to release the PO, and in the next moring, the buyer found his order has been release, but, he want to add 10 POL in total. So, use the approve and add one more status to distiguish the PO.<br />
<br />
2)the second function is the trigger to start the PO activity which marked as automatic. if there is no the action, when the automatic PO activity start.<br />
<br />
3)simple approve function, you can set some approval rule to simple check the PO.  <br />
 (in my mind, I wish the function should be improve and can be set as more level approve, in our practise, the PO should be approval by more than one level. but now, it is can't be supported by the PO approval function itself.)</div></div><hr />

Hi, we managed to remove the approve tick on the purchase order but can't seem to figure out how to remove it from purchase order lines (tdpur4100m900).  Any idea?</div></div><hr />
