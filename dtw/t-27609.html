<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Ruppert</div><div class="date">25th July 2006, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the definition for Inventory Allocated and Inventory on Order should be given in a more global way because it depends on the level of the view on inventory.<br />
<br />
Inventory Allocated is the inventory which will go out but has not gone out yet<br />
Inventory on Order is the inventory which will come in but has not come in yet<br />
<br />
Session whwmd4100m000 &quot;Item Inventory&quot; shows the highest level by company <br />
Inventory Allocated = Sales Orders, Production Issues<br />
Inventory on Order = Purchase Orders, Production Orders<br />
<br />
Session whwmd2515m000 &quot;Warehouse - Item Inventory&quot; shows the warehouse level<br />
Inventory Allocated = Sales Orders, Production Issues, Transfer Order (outbound)<br />
Inventory on Order = Purchase Order, Production oders, Transfer Orders (inbound)<br />
<br />
Transfer Orders generate Inventory Allocated as well as Inventory on Order on warehouse level. Therefore the total sum of of the Inventory Allocated of all warehouses is only equal to the Inventory Allocated on company level in case there are no transfer orders. Same applies for the Inventory on Order.<br />
<br />
Session whwmd1540m000 &quot;Stock Point Inventory&quot; shows the lowest level by location.<br />
Inventory Allocated = Outbound Advice<br />
Inventory on Order = Inbound Advice<br />
Sales Order, Purchase Orders, Production Orders do not apply because the location has not been determined yet till inbound or outbound advices have been generated.<br />
<br />
Of course the the total sum of the Inventory on Hand on one level add up to the Inventory on Hand on another level.<br />
<br />
Yours<br />
