- Make non nettable.<br />
- Change Description and<br />
- Change the country to a dummy country (ZZZ) on the warehouse and do not setup any tax info for this. Should complain that no tax info was setup if you try and use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">One way I can think of is to have the parameter block warehouse for cycle count turned on and to do a cycle count on the warehouse (should zero all stock in the warehouse first). This only works if you have an entry for all your items in the tdinv001 table and if you have more than 999 items (and there are not many of us who don`t) then you would need to create multiple cycle counts as that is the limit for one cycle count order. not a pretty solution but should work. <br />
<br />
Might help to know the reason for wanting to blocking the warehouse.</div></div><hr />

for us there are two main reasons to block a warehouse:<br />
1) you are using a warehouse for a certain time - typically an offsite warehouse<br />
2) you are not able to change the warehouse type or whether it's nettable or not - the only thing you can do is to set up a new one (and try to block the old :) )<br />
