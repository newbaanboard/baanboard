stock, on order, allocated, blocked AND historic cummulative issue (tiitm001.uscu) are zero.<br />
<br />
Most of the time the last field is not zero.<br />
<br />
I don't know the proper way to get this field zero. I use ttaad4100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">7th March 2003, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello b.v.dj,<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for ur reply. But i already did it using ttaad4100 and could able to chnage the &quot;Inventory unit&quot; and then brought bcak the inventory with the adjusted quanttiy baced on new unit.<br />
<br />
BUT what will happen about all the quantities in the Inventory History transactions (purchase, sales, issues etc.). Specially Issues by period and Issues by Warehouse (tdinv750, 760, 700 tables etc.). Please let me know. Thanks.<br />

<br />
Changing inventory unit through GTM (even when you adjusted the stock to reflect the new unit) is most of the time not a good idea<br />
<br />
Well, once any inventory transaction has taken place for an item, BaanERP will fix the inventory unit. This is because in most records of the transaction that has taken place, BaanERP didn't really note down the unit involved. It assumes that the quantity refers to the inventory unit in item data.<br />
<br />
Probably an example would better convey the message. Say we have item A and we specify the inventory unit of it as kg. Say then that we also received 500kg of item A from purchase, used 200kg from it in production, and adjusted down 5kg from it because of bad quality. BaanERP will record it almost everywhere as 500 coming from purchase, 200 used in production, and 5 in adjustment, without recording that they happen in kg. And it does this kind of recording (i.e. without noting down the unit involved) not only in Distribution, but also in Manufacturing and, probably, Finance. Now if you change the inventory unit to tonne using GTM and even adjusted the last balance to terms of tonne, when you print the inventory transaction history, it will say that you receive 500 tonnes from purchase, used 200 tonnes for production, and adjusted down 5 tonnes. Not to mention the funny financial transaction that happened when you adjusted the inventory of the item to reflect tonne, i.e. the cost price used may not be accurate per tonne, depending on your cost price calculation code.<br />
<br />
Unless you're changing inventory unit to another equivalent unit, for example from pcs (pieces) to ea (each), then probably stay away from changing inventory unit through GTM. Block the old item code and create new item code with the desired inventory unit would be safer, I think<br />
