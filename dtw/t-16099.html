<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">23rd July 2004, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to add the item revision to the itemcode in an outgoing EDI message, so that the item will be written as 'item-rev' <br />
This can be done using an evaluation expression like<br />
tdpur041.item := strip(tdpur041.item) &amp; &quot;-&quot; &amp; strip(tdpur041.revi)<br />
The problem is that the domain of the field tdpur041.revi is right aligned, and although you can strip trailing spaces in evaluation expressions (using strip), there is no way to remove leading spaces (shiftl doesn't work).<br />
So with one order the output becomes 'item-  revA', with another order it becomes 'item-revisiB' and with a third it becomes 'item-    Rx'.<br />
Does anyone have a suggestion to remove leading spaces or to add revisions with variable length to the itemcode ?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
I'm receiving a value for tdpur040.ddat but it has to be 5 days earlier, so I tried to use<br />
tdpur040.ddat := tdpur040.ddat - 5<br />
as evaluation expression, but it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Any remarks?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">13th June 2005, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I have several evaluation expressions with assignments ( := ) that work, but have also discovered that the functionaliy is limited; it does not support the full command set you normally use in sql (e.g. strip works, but shiftl not).<br />
I'm not sure if modifying date fields is supported, I believe not, because I also had a situation like you where I wanted to add extra days to the request date, but we did not succeed, in the end we had to create some customization to do it.<br />

I'll have a look at a way to do it by customization.<br />

<br />
Putting the evaluation expression on the field tdpur040.ddat doesn't work.<br />
Putting it on the PREVIOUS field, it does the job.<br />
<br />
I looks strange to me and I hope this ain't a bug that will be fixed in the future.<br />
