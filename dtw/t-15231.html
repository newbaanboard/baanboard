<br />
We are currently using BaaN IVc3 with SCH extensions. We are also using a 3rd party &quot;Supply Chain Portal&quot; to connect with our suppliers. <br />
<br />
The 3rd party portal have the infrastructure to process ODETTE or EDIFACT based EDI messages. ( For PO, ASN, etc. ) <br />
<br />
Can we use BaaN to directly generate EDI files in ODETTE or EDIFACT format? Are there any users with this setup?<br />
<br />
Or can we only generate BEMIS based EDI files and need another 3rd party provider to set our EDI initiative up?<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm more familiar with EDIFACT format in Baan and have not used ODETTE at all. The EDIFACT format in Baan may differ from your other application format even if they claim to be both EDIFACT compliant.  In this case, we have done some translation between formats for at least one client.  You can do it on a PC or in Baan which depends on the skill level of your technical staff.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this means that BaaN IV can generate EDIFACT files directly? We can live with some small/minor modifications.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">27th May 2004, 10:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We have setup translations from EDIFACT to BEMIS for the DELFOR97A, DELJIT97A, DELFOR96A inbound EDIFACT messages. <br />
<br />
This was done using  a PC based package sold in the UK called XLATE which does the translation and interfaces into a EDI package called ODEX.<br />
<br />
We had the first two messages written for us during hands on training session and we did the last translation ourslelves. We hope to move this forwards ourselves by doing other translations and constructions.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">27th May 2004, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Baan does have a default conversion format for EDIFACT.<br />
You should be able to request for the &quot;defaults&quot; files from support. There is a session in BAAN EDI that will load these defaults.  There is also ANSI X12, XML and a few others but I have only used EDIFACT, XML, and ANSI X12 so far.<br />
The degree of change that you will be able to do without touching the message generation and interpretation programs does have a limit.  You may also find that Baan saved some positions by eliminating low use fields from the published EDIFACT standard.<br />
<br />
In cases where there are multiple partners and so many message mappings to manage, it may be better to use a PC based software like what Neal has mentioned. <br />
<br />
My last project is for SMS ordering interface into a TRITON3.1b system using EDI and X12. It was simple and worked well.<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />
