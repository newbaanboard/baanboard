<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">novasoft</div><div class="date">3rd December 2002, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Client is currently uses Lot Tracking for some products on Baan 5b. They are about to begin the process of upgrading to 5C, and may want to begin Lot Tracking all products. The caveat is that they do not want to change Item Codes. <br />
<br />
Would it be feasible to manipulate the data during migration  and keep the same item codes? And would this be easier than waiting until later? We believe that if they wait until after the upgrade they would have to create new items. We also that the best time to do this type of change is during the migration. Are we correct?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
