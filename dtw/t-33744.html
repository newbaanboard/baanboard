<br />
Doing a GTM to rectify mistakes is a risky thing and you could have avoided it by using the re-execute option in Maintain Order Steps {tcmcs0139m000} and rectified the received quantity. There are other ways too.. If this purchase order is invoiced and processed, then the value in the financial tables would be wrong. Supplier Balance would be wrong... not a pretty sight...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">5th April 2007, 08:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok now the picture is clear. Undo all the manual changes you did in the tables(that you mentioned in your post) and process this PO(with 10000kg). Create a Purchase Return of 9000kg and process that PO too. <br />
<br />
This is what you should have done. Since the status is Process Delivered Purchase Order, the re-execute becomes too late.. Therefore this is the best method to update all the tables automatically without doing any GTM..<br />
<br />
Any reservation in doing it this way?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DineshSharma</div><div class="date">5th April 2007, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">But all changes have been made. the problem is only, when we printing the GRN the delivered quantity shows 10000 kgs. While all related transactions give results 1000kg. We are already GTM in all related tables, perhapes we miss any single table which are related to the GRN printing session. Please help what to be done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">7th April 2007, 08:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I see that you havent done any modification on tdpur046 &amp; tdpur051..<br />
Apart from that, are you printing the Storage List or Goods Received Notes(Baan terminology is different from local use)?<br />
<br />
Do you use Location Control?<br />
