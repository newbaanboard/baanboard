Also during Inspection (Maintain Approval) session if you reject any qty that will be trated as back order.<br />
<br />
You can make it zero in BaaN session tdpur4130m000.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cvertz</div><div class="date">16th October 2001, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">My problem is, these back orders should still be open.  The purchase order status is Deleting Line but the qty is still on order in the inventory files.  Is there a way to change the status on purchasing without zeroing out the back order and putting another order in for those items we want?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a situation where there is a back order on a purchase order which I can see in the Maintain Backorders session.<br />
<br />
However, I do not see this backorder as a supply in the maintain planned inventory transactions by customized items ( This is a customized item) session.<br />
<br />
As a result, purchase orders are being generated when the demand could have been satisfied by the backorders.<br />
<br />
This is happening on all purchase orders of a few PCS projects.<br />
<br />
Does someone have a clue, when a purchase order back order quantity does not show up on the planned inventory transactions by customized items?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ajit.</div></div><hr />
