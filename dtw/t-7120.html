<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abuibra</div><div class="date">11th October 2002, 04:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I am was wondering weather in Baan IV C4, when the user receive a shipment of raw material in a Location and Lot Control environment, does BaaN assign a lot number with a unique receipt number. <br />
We are implementing bar coding and we were under the impression that we can receive one a large shipment of raw material and just assign one lot number and issue the material from this lot number to production by replenishing quantity needed.<br />
However, we were informed that it is not possible to assign one lot number to a huge shipment since for every pallet their has to be a unique lot number even though it is just for one single item. Furthermore, it will create a problem when we issue to production and will be a huge task when doing cycle counting. <br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on this because it is really a critical matter on our final decision.  :cool:</div></div><hr />

   On the technical side, there's no problem in receiving huge quantity as one lot. On technical side as well, there's no assignment of lot number to a specific receipt number, meaning different receipts can be made to the same lot number.<br />
<br />
   On the functional side, however, it may be not as wise because if your supplier send big shipment consisting of 2 or more lots (that is, in term of your supplier's lot number), then you won't be able to see in your Baan system which stock belongs to which supplier's lot.<br />

Are you assigning the lot number yourself or are you having Baan generate the number for you?  I have worked with people who have done it both ways.  The problem with having the same lot code with multiple dates comes into play when you need to issue material.  It gets very confusing.  I prefer to set systems up with more intelligent coding for the lot number.  If you are generating label information at the time of the receipt, you may also consider including information which will be useful when you move forward with outbounding.  This is of course assuming that you are using labels with bar code information on them.</div></div><hr />
