<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">telgar</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found a problem on my customers system where a user received in a line item and then turned around and received in a negative amount for the same line item.  The amounts were for 220 and -220, this has caused the system to put 220 of this item in backorder.  The supplier is complaining that they sent the items and I need to correct this bad entry.  What would be the proper procedure to correct this?  I am a Tools Admin, so this is new ground to me.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you provide a little more details? In which process did this actually happen? During maintain reciepts? Do you have any corrupt tables now? What about the status of the order line? <br />
<br />
There is a program to repair table tdinv150: tdinv0250m000, rebuild inventory transactions.<br />
<br />
