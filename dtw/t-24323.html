<br />
Hope you figure out something out of this problem.<br />
<br />
We have BaaN4 c4 on Windows NT. While creating a purchase contract last year we given the price for ITEM A as $4.5 with the expiry date of price as 25/01/05. The same price was reflected on Maintain Item data for this item. We again bought this item on 24/01/05 but the price this time was $2.8. This new price changed the Item data to the latest price i.e. $2.8  Now when we return the old item ($4.5 one) and generate a credit note for the same it is taking the price of $2.8 in place of $4.5, which is wrong.<br />
<br />
Pls advise of the possible solution. Thank you very much for the time spent reading on my query<br />
<br />
