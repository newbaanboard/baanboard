<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NicoleR</div><div class="date">11th February 2004, 04:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to set up the following commissions structure in Baan IVc:<br />
<br />
The same group of 3 people/employees can be paid 4 different commission %'s. This is independent of the customer or item/item group. It is decided per sales order.<br />
To further compound the problem - the same order can be shared between multiple groups of 3 people - the % will differ between groups.<br />
I cannot find a way where the same employee can have mulitiple %'s. <br />
Ideally I would like to group employees into teams (4 teams for each group thus representing the 4 different %'s) and then link each team to an agreement group (a total of 4 agreement groups) in order to define each %.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this 'odd' situation makes sense.<br />
Any thoughts?<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
did you check the relations, and rate matrix, as you would be able to share a commission within a specific group,<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
