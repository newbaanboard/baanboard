<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracked egg</div><div class="date">16th March 2004, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I am curious how others might now handle this:<br />
How to reprint pick lists after changes to the sales order?<br />
Specifically:  a customer changes the original order quantity but the pick list has been printed. How to let the Shipping/Mfg dept to know that they need to reprint the pick list.  Currently our sales dept is to notify the shipp/mfg dept but they often miss. I can't see any why other than a substantial mod involving generating an email when a change is made to the order/tdsls051. Does Standard Baan (IVc3) have any capability to do this?<br />
Thanx.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1- location-controlled / not location-controlled environment<br />
2- increase / decrease in sales order quantity<br />
3- partial pick / full pick<br />
<br />
As you mentionned, automatically sending an email when the sales order line quantity has changed (only if the pick list has been printed) could at least make the picker/shipper aware of that change.<br />
