Whenever we are creating new part along with Item Purchase data , it creates a record in tdipu001 (Item Purchase Data ) and tdipu010 ( Item Supplier information ), however when we update the lead time in tdipu001 ( Item Purchase data ), it does not update the lead time against the supplier in tdipu010 ( Item Supplier Information )<br />
<br />
Can you guys think of a business reason as to why it would behave this way. Just wanted to check with guys before i log a case with Infor as a bug.<br />

Then you may manually create more Item Supplier data based on number of suppliers for that item.<br />
When you change the Item Purchase Data of pre-existing item, the system would not know as which of the item supplier information should be changed among many item supplier data. Hence you have to make the change manually.<br />
If you have always one supplier for an item, then you can develop a small customization when you change the item purchase data.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the response.<br />

Well the default supplier is already specified on Item Purchase data so why would stand baan program have any difficulty updating Item supplier information based of that ? What you mentioned probably would be more valid if i don't have a default BP on Item purchase data.. isn't it ?</div></div><hr />
