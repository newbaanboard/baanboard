<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aneelsane</div><div class="date">19th April 2011, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We send out a lot of samples to potential customers at no charge to them. Right now we are doing this as a Sales Quote. The problem we're running into is that, the stock is never moved from Inventory, because e it is just a quote, and so our warehouses are showing stock that has been sent out to customers as a sample. We eventually get most samples back (some decide to pay and keep it), but there are a lot sent out, so this is becoming a problem.<br />
<br />
please help us  in how to handle this sample inventory and have a track of it</div></div><hr />

<br />
An MSO Line of type 'Part Loan' could be entered, issued from the warehouse and delivered to the customer. When the customer returns the part, it is received back into the warehouse and the MSO is closed.<br />
<br />
If the customer does not return the part, after a period of time he can be billed using the Maintenance Sales Order.<br />
<br />
Another way to do it might be to use Consignment Sales Orders.<br />
