<br />
	I have an EDI setup question that I hope someone can help with.  We are using EDI in Baan 5c.  A large retailer with many store locations has requested an Outgoing 856.  We create Outbound and ship to each store location on individual Sales Orders.  The store locations are set up as individual Business Partners with Sold-to and Ship-to rolls. All stores share the same parent Business Partner which has Invoice-to and Pay-by rolls.  Is there a way of setting up EDI so that we only have to set up the parent?  This would eliminate the creating and maintaining of hundreds of entries in EDI Messages Supported by Business Partner and EDI Business Partner EDI Data by Network.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.<br />

I guess this is better address in EDI translator. You can have only one Business relationship, but in EDI translator you can use say location code to identify the location and generate ISA accodingly. But somwe here you need to fo maintenace for ISA.<br />
