Offlate it is noticed the application lock on shipments in not cleared even after the shipment is confirmed. We have to manually go and clear the application locks.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if this will be a defect in BaaN or some issue in our system. Before I open a case with BaaN I wanted to check if anyone else has noticed similar issues.<br />
<br />
On BaaN Support site, i found similar issues for other sessions and BaaN fixed it with solutions.</div></div><hr />

Please contact Baan Support to get the necessary solution.<br />
<br />
PS: Make sure that solution for application lock is ported from B5.0c to B5.0b.</div></div><hr />
