<br />
short awnser: Not at all - no way in Baan IV standard.<br />
<br />
Long awnser: You cannot do direct delivery for customized items (and of yourse you have to customize each generic item before it can be sold or purchased). This is just a lack of functionality in Baan, there is no deeper reason behind it - I guess the implementation effort (for integrations and so on) was to high, so they did not implement it.<br />
<br />
Probably you can get around this by using ILC and/or additional development using the application function server: Use a particular warehouse for those items, and do an automatic delivery as soon as there is stock for these items on the warehouse. Probably use an AFS development instead of PRP for generating the purchase order with the correct delivery adress (of the sales order). Also, you will have to be careful with the intrastat reporting and so on. It largely depends on the actual situation. <br />
<br />
You can give me a call, if you want to discuss this issue in more detail. <br />
