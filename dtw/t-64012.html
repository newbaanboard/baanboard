<br />
 I am currently a Baan 5 user and am looking for possible means of allocating/reserving inventory for partial lots in a specific location. <br />
<br />
An example would be the following,<br />
1.	Location “A” has 100ea of item XXXXX, lot #00001. I would like to reserve 50ea of this item/lot in this location leaving the additional 50ea available for any consumption.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">15th May 2013, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">It should be possible to do this by creating an inventory commitment for the order you want to reserve the stock for.  You can only commit what is in stock at a point in time, but once committed any generate outbound run that does not include the order with the committment will ignore that portion of the stock and only allocate down to the committed level, then produce shortages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also there is an issue with the Inventory Commitments.<br />
<br />
Standard ERP LN restrict the user not to generate the outbound advice for an order if the inventory is committed to some other order. But if you try to create the advice (Manually create a record) it will just give you the warning message regarding the commitment but you can save the record &amp; release the advice.<br />
<br />
So, make a note of this if you gonna map with standard Inventory Commitment functionality.<br />
