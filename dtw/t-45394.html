<br />
In our system (ERP LN 6.1 FP3), We are using MAUC as the inventory valuation method. <br />
<br />
we are having difficulties in getting valuation reports (except for Peform Inventory valuation session). Could anyone please let me know a table field where the MAUC of an item is getting recorded? so that We can run external valuation reports using that.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

If u use MAUC by warehouse you have informations stored in whina113 by transaction receipt date and warehouse<br />
If u use MAUC by item and warehouse valuation group you have informations stored in whina137 by transaction recept date<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your information. Please let me know is there a way to check the MAUC of an particular item on line. I mean what is the MAUC at this time.<br />
<br />
In Baan IV we had this field tiitm001.avpr which we can check the Average Price of an item on line. Is there a same type of filed in LN 6.1 also?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

You have this information in:<br />
-Warehouse -item inventory(current view)-whwmd2515m000 by selecting a line and double click you start Warehouse-Item Inventory-whwmd2115s000 and on Dates/Prices tab you'll find MAUC (by warehouse) at this time<br />
-Inventory receipt transactions -whina1512m000<br />
-MAUC by item and warehouse valuation group - whina1534m000 MAUC by warehouse val.group at this moment.<br />
-MAUC transactions by item and warehouse valuation group - whina1536m000<br />
If you choose for an item, MAUC and Valuation by warehouse valuation group as inventory valuation, the system will calculate MAUC for group of warehouses and also, MAUC for every warehouse in that group. <br />
Hope it'll be useful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">7th December 2007, 00:30</div></div><div class="posttext">In BAAN IV c3 (A&amp;D) there is a session called &quot;Display Accountability Transactions (Part Cost History) [ticpr9551m00b]&quot; that shows the MAUC after each transaction. The information is stored in a table called ticpr951.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, you can locate a similar session/table in your version of BAAN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">6th August 2014, 22:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
my table ticpr951, some items(few) are off in the cummulative units vs on hand as result of ( I believe a bug or a transaction that did not go well). How can we align this table besides a GTM? we will perform a cycle counting for items to see what table is right before any change.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />
