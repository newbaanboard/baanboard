<br />
In Baan IVc4 I have a Manufactured item which is Phantom. In the BOM of this item there are 2 Purchased Items which have Inventory Valuation Method as 'Lot Price'.<br />
<br />
When I am trying to enter a Sales Order for the manufactured item, at the time of saving the Sales Order line, I get a message &quot;Component with Inventory Valuation method Lot Price not allowed&quot;. It does not save the line.<br />
<br />
Can anybody guide me what is the problem...or what changes I need to make in any parameter. Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">30th June 2009, 05:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have simulated this situation and it happens when the field &quot;Issue status&quot; in the form-2 of the Sales order line has the value &quot;Issue Components&quot;. <br />
<br />
As you know, for Manufactured items (incl Phantom items), it is possible to issue either the Main item or the components. The default is &quot;Issue Main item&quot; for Purchased items and &quot;Issue components&quot; for Phantom items.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is a bug or if there is a valid reason why a component with Inventory valuation as &quot;Lot Price&quot; cannot be used in the BOM when the the default of the sales order line is &quot;Issue components&quot;.<br />
<br />
But when i changed the value of the field to &quot;Issue Main Item&quot; the Sales order line got saved.<br />
<br />
So in your case what do you plan to issue ? I suggest you try to simulate the order cycle in your test company and check all the documents generated (like Packing slip, DO, Invoice, etc..) and only then change the field value.<br />
