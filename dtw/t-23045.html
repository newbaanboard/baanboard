<br />
What's the advantage of Business Partners over Supplier/Customers/Addresses.<br />
<br />
It's basically doing the same thing, right?<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Popeye!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan user</div><div class="date">2nd February 2005, 08:50</div></div><div class="posttext">A Business partnere can be a customer and supplier at the same time, and can play up to 8 roles You can fore example create a BP with only the ship to role, and link the invoice to role to another BP. Hence Baan V/LN will offer you more flexibility</div></div><hr />

   Thanks for the reply.<br />
   I understand that.<br />
   But I personally feel that the value add is little.<br />
   I could just have 2 codes - one supplier code and one customer code.<br />
<br />
   Because when I read any doc on features of Baan V/LN, it always talks <br />
   about BPs as a key feature.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
You can specify the business partner's financial data per department, for<br />
    example, if a logistic company has sites (enterprise units) in different<br />
    countries, that do business with the same business partner. In the<br />
    different countries you can then use a different default currency and<br />
    different invoicing methods for the business partner.<br />
<br />
    You can define financial business partner data per department for the<br />
    following business partner roles:<br />
    - Invoice-to<br />
    - Pay-by<br />
    - Invoice-from<br />
    - Pay-to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">3rd February 2005, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">It gets interesting as soon as some of your suppliers are also your customers (and vice versa). In Baan IV a lot of programming effort had to be done to consolidate open entry list for those customers/suppliers. Also, most of the functionality you need for customers you need also for suppliers, but there were different sessions, tables etc. I think this is one of the major reasons to merge it in Baan V.<br />
