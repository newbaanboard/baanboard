<br />
We created new finance company in Baan and there is one another company which is Finance &amp; Logistic.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Company 1 (Finance &amp; Logistic) Currency maintained Reference Currency SAR (Saudi Riyal)<br />
Local Currency SAR, Reporting Currency-1 EUR and Reporting Currency-2 USD. <br />
 <br />
Company 2 (Finance) Currency maintained Reference Currency SAR (Saudi Riyal)<br />
Local Currency KWD, Reporting Currency-1 SAR and Reporting Currency-2 USD.<br />
<br />
We setups all the warehouse, Enterprise Unit, Key Entities and also we maintained Entity-Entity Relationship.<br />
<br />
All the logical table is shared between both the companies.<br />
<br />
Currency rate is also defined with the combination (SAR to other currencies) because in both companies Reference Currency is in SAR (Saudi Riyal)<br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
<br />
When I am transferring the item from one warehouse (Riyadh) to another Warehouse (Kuwait), system is giving the error &quot;Currency rate not defined between KWD and home currencies for rate type in financial company 2‚Äù. <br />
<br />
Please advice me, where I am missing to setup any master data.<br />
<br />
Send me details in Toqueer@gmail.com<br />
<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
In both the company Referance currency is SAR but the location of the company is different, so we changed the Local currency as per the country.<br />
<br />

<br />
Check for the &quot;Central company to store Enterprise Modeler Data - tgbrg0100s000&quot;. It should show the company number for Company 1(Logistics and Finance) if that is the physical company for Company 2 in table sharing.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
