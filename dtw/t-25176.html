I have tried all combinations such as -3000 to +3000 in date field etc. This happens in issue against Production Order of only one manufactured item. The manufactured item (1000023) is also subcontacted. Moreover the problem occurs only in a combination of item (1000023) and subconractor/supplier (TY0022). Outbounding against Production order of the same item works fine when the Routing is inhouse or subcontracted to other suppliers. This has happened five times, I still do not think there is any link between the subcontactor and outbounding. <br />
<br />
Can anybody suggest something on why this happens<br />

I am using Baan 4c4 in5 with ILC Implemented</div></div><hr />
