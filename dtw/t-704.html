In my opinion, Baan does not handle kit items properly. We have been handling such situations by developing a new session 'Maintain Kit items' so that we can use the lot price against the main item as well as print the content of the kit wherever required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">8th January 2002, 10:47</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're using Baan IV c4 and you have used phantom items, you have probably reached the limit of the functionality.<br />
<br />
If you have not yet used phantom items, you could explore it.<br />
In Baan Vc, there are additional features to handle kitting more efficiently.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  In Baan IV the &quot;solution&quot; is to use phantoms (unless you want to use the configurator, which would be gross overkill for this problem).<br />
<br />
Have you had problems using phantoms for kits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been unable to use process end-items as kit components.  I'm still trying to find out if this should be possible based on the Baan IV c4 design.<br />
<br />
Other than it's not always an efficient business solution, I think it is a valid application solution used by other software as well.<br />
<br />
If you run into multiple level kits, it could really become a burden.<br />
Another example is if you have a returnable container that goes with the kit.  Just a few that I have encountered so far.</div></div><hr />
