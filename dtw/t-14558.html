<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smolawa</div><div class="date">23rd February 2004, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">We are a manufacturer using IVc4 with ILC and Lot Control.<br />
In Baan standard a lot information is sent to the warehouse by generating an outbound advice in tdilc401.<br />
We do not know the delivered lot at that time; this will be later picked by the warehouse and then sent by release outbound advice.<br />
Has someone a solution to create an outbound advice without lot information?<br />
There will be a problem with allocated inventory if other lots are released</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">23rd February 2004, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">The best way to solve your problem is to create an order type with the following steps:<br />
<br />
1.	Print Order Acknowledgement<br />
2.	Print Pick List<br />
3.	Generate Outbound<br />
4.	Maintain Deliveries<br />
5.	Print Packing Slip<br />
6.	Print Bill of Lading<br />
7.	Print Sales Invoice<br />
8.	Process Delivered Sales Orders<br />
<br />
<br />
You can now print a pick list for the warehouse personnel to use to pick and record serial numbers (Lots) but now you will need to do a Maintain Outbound (tdilc4101m000 &amp; tdilc4102s000) rather than Generate Outbound (tdilc4101m000) to tell Baan which serial numbers (Lots) were picked.  Depending on the number of items to be reported, you may want to try and find a way to automate this process either by creating an AFS session or some type of data collection process.</div></div><hr />
