<br />
based on the engineering complexity, the surcharge amount varies, and is assigned by the accounting group<br />
<br />
since a different group is creating the sales order, what is the easiest way to handle surcharges ? <br />
<br />
create a 'service' item for the surcharge and enter it as an order line item, that accounting can modify before closing the order ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">26th November 2003, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, depending on how you are defining the orders to which the engineering costs apply you may be able to use the additional order cost functionality.This would mean that the cost item is automatically applied to the sales order perhaps at a price of zero. Since additional order costs can be set to always appear on a particular order position is would then be possible for finance to have a report which prints out these positions depending on order status thereby ensuring that the correct value is assigned before invoicing.</div></div><hr />
