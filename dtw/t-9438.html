<br />
We seem to be having a problem where the Goods to be invoiced account has a balance remaining almost every month. :confused: <br />
<br />
Any idea why this is happening ? Is there anyway i can trace this balance in the system ?<br />
<br />
We are using BaaN IVc4. <br />
<br />
I would appreciate some advice on the above issue if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regds<br />

<br />
I'am assuming &quot;Goods Sold to be invoiced&quot;, please give your finance integration setup details, also are you getting a debit balance or a credit balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
integration setup would be something like ...<br />
<br />
tdinv8150m000 &quot;Maintain Inventory and WIP transaction accounts&quot;<br />
Sales - Issue Dr. Account will be your Goods to be invoiced ..<br />
<br />
Then in tdsls6102m000 &quot;Maintain Invoice details accounts&quot;<br />
All costs should be Credited to the same Goods to be invoiced account.<br />
<br />
Are you missing one of the costs here ??</div></div><hr />

If so you must be careful that the sales issue and sales invoice happen at the same STD cost if not =&gt; balance in goods to be invoiced.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">1st April 2003, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">assuming that you are talking about Sales transactions, you can run session tfacr1432m000 for your goods to be invoiced account and this should highlight the orders that have the problem.</div></div><hr />
