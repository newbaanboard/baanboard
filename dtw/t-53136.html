<br />
We wan't to use SIC planning for consumable goods. For these items we have a safety stock and maximum stock defined. Also we have a reorder point.<br />
<br />
This a test scenario:<br />
<br />
I have Item A with 153 items in stock.<br />
The Reorder point is 180.<br />
I use session tdinv3201m000 to generate purchase recommendations for this item and it correctly suggests 27. <br />
I confirm this recommendation and transfer this to a firm purchase order. <br />
I can also check in the system a planned inventory move of 27 (the PO move).<br />
<br />
I now rerun tdinv3201m000 and it suggests 27 items again. <br />
<br />
My question is: Should it ignore the inventory on order? If not what I'm doing wrong? :confused: Working like this we cannot implement this system as it would increase our current inventories. What we currently do is manually do a PO each time an item in the warehouse goes beyond the safety stock, of course we look at the on order qty before.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

Also, in the first case why you got 27. As 180 is re-order point and not the stock it needs to achieve. System will generatethe order either with MOQ or EOQ etc.May be you can explain what were other parameters.<br />

<br />
Please be informed ,System will keep track of the economic stock as per the formula given below.<br />
<br />
Economic Stock  =     Inventory on hand   +    Inventory on Order    -  Allocated Inventory<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
If the Inventory available is zero or the economic stock is below the re-order level then the purchase order will be generated equal to the quantity mentioned in the Maximum Order Qty field.<br />
<br />
I have had implemented SIC PO - in Baan IV c4.<br />
<br />
Note :<br />
Give the order method as &quot;Replenish to Max. Inv&quot;.<br />
<br />
if you want i can Mail the document that i have created for SIC Orders.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">29th July 2008, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Going through your attachment I see Re-order point to be 100 and not 180. In items by warehouse can you tell what is the value of  Use Item parameters?Also while generating order what value do you give to &quot;Order Advice by warehouse&quot;. You have similar set of parameter at item warehouse level. I am suspecting they differ from itme mastter<br />
<br />
It is still not clear why you got 27, as item master reorder point is 100. May be if you can answer above question it may become clear. <br />
<br />
You can choose any ordering methiod- Repl to Max, LFL, EQO etc, it all depeneds upon your need.<br />

<br />
The re-order point is set to 180. Not 100. I got 27 probably because the maximum stock allowed is 180. <br />
<br />
Sushil,<br />
<br />
I did some tests using you're explanation. If I lower the reorder point to 150 (below 153 physical stock) it will not generate more orders. If I lower the reorder point to 160 it will generate an order of 7 units even if the economic stock is at 180 (27 ordered and 153 in physical stock). So it seems to be using stock on hand and not economic stock. :cool:<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help</div></div><hr />

The purchase order is on 07/31, hence it is ignoring it. Try giving some time fence. I think that should resolve the issue.<br />

Thank you for your help. That made the trick. I didn't correctly grasp the use of &quot;time fence&quot; concept. It's now perfectly clear for me.<br />
<br />
Thank you once more,</div></div><hr />

<br />
In LN, the parameters for time fence have been brought to the Generate SIC session itself.<br />
<br />
Can someone give me a help document on how the time fence influences the SIC planning with examples?<br />
<br />
I am mainly confused about the delivery date. It does not seem to be calculating as per the LN help.<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
