<br />
I work with BaaN IV c4 and have a problem:<br />
I make purchase order. In lines, form 2, Inspection is checked YES. And then when i use session tdpur4120m000 (Maintain Receipts) the items are blocking in Inspection Location in Warehouse and i can not unblock them. But if i use tdpur4120m000 -&gt; Zoom -&gt; Fast Approval i have not problem like this. I will be very happy if someone may advise me how can i  resolve this problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">18th June 2004, 13:52</div></div><div class="posttext">When you mark the item for inspection it means that upon receipt the item must be inspected and approved before it can be put away in a stock location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Willy</div><div class="date">18th June 2004, 13:52</div></div><div class="posttext">there are 2 fields &quot;Inspection&quot; in the sessions &quot;Mantain item data&quot; (form 3) and Mantain Suppliers (form 4) to determine if the receptions of an item (or the receptions of a supplier) uses the inspection procedure. If those fields have value &quot;yes&quot; you've to execute &quot;Mantain Approvals&quot; (tdpur4121m000&quot;) to approve the receptions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amyumyun</div><div class="date">18th June 2004, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly! When i have Inspection i execute &quot;Maintain Approvals&quot;, but after this action items blocking in Inspection Location and I can not use them. They stay there and i can not &quot;move&quot; in warehouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">18th June 2004, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Maintain Approvals, Then generated inbound advice to move the item from the inspection location to a standard location.  All Item in an inspection location will be on hold until you move them.  If you have a return note you would need to print it.  After the Approval if you check Purchase Order Line Status should be ready to print purchase invoice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amyumyun</div><div class="date">21st June 2004, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much tomlbacon! IT IS WORK :) Shell i have a problem if this steps supplement to the PO procedure? Because now i can not see them like in Dislpay Purchase Order Status and i can not think of execute them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">21st June 2004, 21:53</div></div><div class="posttext">If you aren't sure what needs to be done on a Purchase or Sales order its recommended that you check the Status as it will always tell you what the next step should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amyumyun</div><div class="date">22nd June 2004, 09:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly :) But after Maintain Approvals by me follow Print Storage Lists and i don't see Generate Inboud Advice and Release Inbound Data. My question is: is there a problem if i add Generate Inboud Advice and Release Inbound Data like Purchase Order Procedure steps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uwe faerber</div><div class="date">22nd June 2004, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you will get problems if take the inbound sessions into the ordersteps of purchase prozedure or you have to customize it because these sessions are not standard steps in BAAN IVcx.<br />
<br />
In the purchase order type you should define<br />
...<br />
tdpur4120m000<br />
tdpur4420m000 (optional, also after the next step)<br />
tdpur4121m000<br />
tdpur4421m000 (optional, no must)<br />
tdpur4411m000 (optional, no must)<br />
...<br />
