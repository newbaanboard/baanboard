<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kssedhu</div><div class="date">30th September 2015, 08:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using Baan 5.0c.  We have a requirement to receive items from certain supplier into a separate receiving Location.  This can be achieved by defining the location in &quot;Dock Locations by Warehouse, Item and Business Partner&quot;.   However this setting is applicable only for the new orders that are released to warehouse after this setting is done.  How do I make this work for the existing Orders that have been released to warehouse already?  The Receiving Location in Inbound Order lines is not editable.  There is an option to change the Receiving location at the time of Receipts but changing for every receipt line is not a practicable solution.  <br />
Looking out for options to make the Dock Location setting work for the existing orders.</div></div><hr />

I don't have access to Baan 5c so I am not sure about work around. However, what I can suggest is get the open order details belongs to the Business partner and then  create a Exchange scheme to update the specific Inbound Order line's location. <br />
Here my assumption is , if the location in Inbound order line is modified it works.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your suggestion.  Modifying the Location in Inbound Order Line should work but I want to avoid database update.   I'll adopt this if I don't get any other way out.  Thanks again for your suggestion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">1st October 2015, 14:56</div></div><div class="posttext">how many existing receipts do you still need modified? i'm afraid that's your only option unless you want to do programming. baan has always worked based on when did you execute a certain task. in effect, new settings won't affect those that have passed a certain status.</div></div><hr />
