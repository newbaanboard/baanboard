1. How do we handle Cash Customers with Unique(special) prices in BaaN?<br />
<br />
2. How Can Baan can handle the following situations.<br />
<br />
Customer A buys product B ex factory and product C free into store (FIS).  The account information set up in Baan by Lesley currently only shows one option for terms.<br />
<br />
Customer D buys product B FIS and product C ex factory.  The item master only shows one option per bag for terms in Baan currently.<br />
<br />
This scenario has a customer buying on both ex factory and FIS terms.  Plus it has a bag being bought on both ex factory and FIS terms.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan has lots of options for system pricing: These include:<br />
Prices by Customer and Item, <br />
Discounts by Customer (and)  by Customers and Price Group,<br />
Prices by Price List and item, <br />
Discounts by Price List, (and)  by Price List and Price Group, <br />
Prices by Item. <br />
<br />
With these there is provision for Quantity Breaks and effectivity dates.  <br />
<br />
The is also a sales price in the item master. If none of these are suitable the price can be entered manually in the sales order. For you cash customers you could have a 'cash price lists' or enter price manually <br />
<br />
As to your requirement for FIS and ex factory. These are striclty Terms of Delivery which are defaulted from the Customer Master and apply to particular orders (an order can have only one terms of delivery.)  As to charging for freight on an ex factory order you would presumably enter a line on the order for the freight or the customer would make some other arrangement for freight (pick up etc).  <br />
<br />
You may be able to set up price lists for FIS and  ex factory situations.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
