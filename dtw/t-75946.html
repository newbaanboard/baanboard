<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nitin h</div><div class="date">31st August 2023, 08:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We have PO type where Maintain Approval is not defined as order step. We have an item for which Inspection is YES in the item master. Hence Inspection flag is YES in the PO lines table (tdpur041). Now release outbound is not happening and inventory is stuck in the inspection location. Message in the inbound advise step says ‘ location is a receipt location’<br />
<br />
Any idea?</div></div><hr />

I don't remember the exact process - or how we fixed those that went to the wrong location.</div></div><hr />

But one can add the step into PO lines through General Table maintenance and adjust the mask in tdpur045.</div></div><hr />
