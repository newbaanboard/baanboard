They want to change the sales invoice data. (BaaN IVc).<br />
<br />
I now that once listed, we can't do anything from distribution/sales module to change it.<br />
<br />
I wanted to know if someone has had the same problem as me. And what do you do?.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, we were asking the same kind of question as well. Since we can't find a way to do anything with the data once it's inside SLI, we ask the sales people to check for absolutely everything related to invoice before releasing the SO to invoicing. We were hoping for the same thing too, ie we can do something to the numbers after releasing to invoicing but before confirming the invoice data.<br />
