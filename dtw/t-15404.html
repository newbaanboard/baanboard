<br />
I would like to know what should be the correct way to request sample of the material for QC test. <br />
<br />
What we are doing now is to create Inventory Adjustment with specific reason code (so that it can charge to the correct ledger account) after the full quantity of the material has been passed.<br />
<br />
There are several problems we encountered with the current practice:<br />
<br />
- material could be issued in the system before the adjustment has been entered.<br />
<br />
- there is no urgency for the user to enter the adjustment since the sample already taken and sometime they even forgot to enter.<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
If the item and supplier is set for inspection, the PO line will also be set for inspection.  This will block the inventory in the application system from being issued before it is cleared by QC in the Approval session.<br />
There are integration entries to/from inspection coming from purchase receipts.<br />
Of course you have to match this with controls in the physical system.<br />
