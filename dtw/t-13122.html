In our shipment process we have necessity to transfer the stock demanded (from Sales Order) from the several locations in one escape location: <br />
<br />
We do not want to make of the session transfer (tdilc1120).<br />
<br />
In test company I have execute the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Insertion Order RPL (tdrpl0110)<br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
Order RPL n° 515<br />
<br />
From Warehouse: M1<br />
to Warehouse: M1<br />
Item code: 0054146<br />
from Location : LOC1<br />
To Location: LOC_EXIT<br />
Quantity : 100<br />
<br />
2. Generate Outbound Advise (tdilc4201)  for order RPL n° 515<br />
3. Release Outbound Advise (tdilc4202) for order RPL n° 515<br />
<br />
RESULT:<br />
<br />
Order RPL is closed regularly but the stock remains in location LOC1 !!<br />
<br />
Why? <br />
You know an alternative process?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you really want to transfer the Item from LOC1 to LOC_EXIT, you can transfer the material from one location to another location through RPL Order but provided that there is a Transit warehouse, In your case, you have to receive the material through Maintain RPL Receipts session,then you can track the material in LOC_EXIT.<br />
<br />
Pls check the Order Status in the system &amp; complete all the steps.<br />
<br />
Hope this will solve your problem.<br />
<br />

I have started the work again after a long time and I have applied your suggest: it works now!<br />
Could you please let me know if it exists a simpler way to create a list of articles to move the stock from a location to another on the same warehouse?<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Ex: I have to move the articles of a sales order from several stock locations to just a shipping location <br />
<br />
Thank</div></div><hr />
