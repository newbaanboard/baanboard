<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Yes, warehouse User profile is with the outbound Inspection series.<br />
<br />
If you look at my attachment, the same user is handling the Purchase return, but only line item no.1 the activity is 'to be inspected' and second line item is released for shipment.<br />
This is the first case since we've implemented ERPLN in 2011 and all the while the warehouse profile is with the Inbound and Outbound Inspection series.<br />
<br />
Your comments is higly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a purchase (or purchase schedule), the warehouse order procedure will not determine the inspection step.<br />
<br />
Instead the inspection flag on the purchase order line is checked. When that is selected, inspection will be an order activity for the warehousing order.</div></div><hr />
