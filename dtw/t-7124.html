<br />
We are so affraid to do that - and PST module will sit down for another 5 years - untouched if your answer is yes ...<br />
<br />
We do archiving of data as regulary full backup every day; <br />
and from time to time we make a copy of working company to make tests on real data ...<br />
<br />
I think archiving for statistic will be kind of redundancy or ...?<br />
<br />
Isn't it?<br />
:( <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS<br />
(I understand archiving of purchase data which is years old ... that's ok)</div></div><hr />

<br />
PST has to be updated while deleting purchase history (tables 050,051)<br />
<br />
hope this helps you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   PST is some simple yet useful data mart module for PUR activities. You can view a time phased summary of PUR activities (I like to call it PST's 4th dimension). The PUR activities can be categorised, for example by supplier group, supplier, item group, item etc (1st dimension). You can also choose whether the summary display actual receipt, order intake, or order cancellation (2rd dimension). The number displayed can be either amount, qty, weight, etc (3rd dimension).<br />
<br />
   Once set up, all you need to do is fill up the cubes with data from live company and you can arrange reports using any combination of PST's dimensions that you like (for example, the manager want to see the comparison between actual receipt and order intake amount per supplier group for every year during the last 5 years). And since the data are already in the cubes, producing reports that span large data in PST is much faster.<br />
<br />
   Once the cubes are filled you can archive the PUR if you need to and the data will still be in the cubes. Problem is if you have deleted the purchase order history for very old data, then those data can't be ported to the cubes anymore.<br />

   Sorry, pressed the submit button too fast.<br />
<br />
SO, yes, venkat500 is right, updating the PST should be done before deleting PO history.<br />

<br />
Please, answer me one thing more;<br />
why I need to define archive comapany in parameters before I look into purchase statistic for some period.<br />
(Is this only in case of archiving or this is mandatory.)<br />
<br />
It scares us - we don't want to archive anything ...<br />
<br />

   Oh, I see why you're asking about archiving. I thought you really perform archiving for your very old data. I think that parameter just show BaanERP where to look for really old data in case they're archived.<br />
<br />
   I usually just leave the parameter as is and PST will still work anyhow.<br />
