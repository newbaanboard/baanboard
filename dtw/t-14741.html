<br />
have you come accross this need.<br />
<br />
We have retail / seasonal business where in items are short lived.<br />
<br />
We have many items, that are not operational but may be useful for statistics. Since we are using B.I the data has been put on to the Datawarehouse already.<br />
<br />
Instead of deleting such items, we want to archive these items into the history company so that it is available for reference purpose.<br />
<br />
Since items leave trace on many tables and with referential integrity on -&gt; would this be possible,  <br />
<br />
any inputs will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
best regards<br />
<br />

<br />
items are copied to the archive company with each archive session that copies &quot;General Data&quot;.  (There is a button &quot;General Data&quot; in most archive sessions e.g. tipcs2260m000). The archive processes copy the items but don't delete them. <br />
<br />
To be able to delete the items in the original company, you would first have to archive all the reference data. Since you probably want to keep at least one year worth of history data in your system, you would for example move historical data (sales orders, purchase orders, warehouse data etc.) up to the end of 2002 to an archive company. If everything got cleaned out of the original company, you can delete the items that haven't been used after 2002 (in most systems a lot of data &quot;gets stuck&quot;).<br />
<br />
Even if you use a data warehouse, you should use the Baan archive sessions to move  the historical data to a Baan archive company. The archive sessions sort the data out correctly. (In some cases it's possible to remove data on database level but I would only do that when using the archive sessions is not possible for some reason.) If you get all necessary information from your data warehouse, you can just  delete the archive company afterwards. If you still want to compile statistics for historic data in Baan though, you'll have to keep it and do that in the archive company from then on. <br />
<br />
What I would do first:<br />
<br />
In tiitm001 there is a &quot;last inventory transaction date&quot; (tiitm001.ltdt). With an easy sql query you can find out how many items fall into past years. That will give you a first indication whether it makes sense at this point to think about archiving and deleting items. If you have for example only a few items that have a &quot;last use date&quot; in and before 2002 then that's probably not worth to start archiving for (unless you wanted to archive anyhow).<br />
<br />
I have programs that forecast which data has to be archived per year and afterwards check if everything got cleaned out. I also have a program available that checks for obsolete items that could be deleted and prints reports for those that still have references existing. I do thorough automated overall data checkups (remotely and on-site) at fixed prices.<br />

<br />
thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
some times we do using Transact SQL when we are sure where only the item occurs like newly created items)<br />
<br />
Your offer was good but if it involves cost i am afraid i cant take it any forward. Nevertheless mail/pm me the details of functionality , performance (how much time it takes to archive (move and delete) 1000 items having data on all pur/sls/inv /tf integration areas), features etc..<br />
<br />
then I will check out.<br />
