<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">17th December 2005, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">We are starting an SSA ERP LN implementation and one of the things that we want to do is create Warehouse Transfer Orders between logistics companies rather that having to use Purchase Order/Sales Orders. The LN documentation says that it can be done but does explain how to set the system so that Enterprise Planning can create the Warehouse Transfer Orders.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have documentation on how to set up the system so that Enterprise Planning will create these warehouse transfers? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
