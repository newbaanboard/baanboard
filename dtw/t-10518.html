<br />
1) I know that location control must be set to yes, and it is.  However, I still cannot add an item with a shelf-life.  Any ideas?<br />
<br />
2) does anyone have any documentation or helpful info regarding shelf-life and BaaN?  Like how it REALLY works?<br />
<br />
Thank you!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">26th June 2003, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">The item type cannot be of type cost/service/subcontracted. And of course location control must be implemented, as you've said.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">26th June 2003, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Also please note that the outbound  priority for the item should be FIFO /LIFO and Not BY location. <br />
<br />
By location items do not have a date so Shelf life is not applicable. <br />
<br />
you can change the outbound priority for item by using the session tdilc0232m000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">26th June 2003, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure Baan5guy, on b2/c4 we have items that are 'by location' from an outbound priority point of view and they have a shelf life, I must add however that the items are lot controlled too.<br />
Maybe this will be a good time to complete your user profiles and add your baan/system info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">singhalv</div><div class="date">26th June 2003, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">when u insert a new item with outbound priority as &quot;By Location&quot;, u can not maintain shelf life. If u choose outbound priority as LIFO or FIFO, u can maintain shelf life. However if u have item with outbound priority as LIFO/FIFO &amp; shelf life, u can change the outbound priority back to &quot;By Location&quot;.<br />
This way u can achive items with outbound pririty as &quot;By Location&quot; &amp; with shelf life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">28th June 2003, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a further question on this<br />
<br />
When there is no lot control and outbound priority is By location<br />
<br />
a) from where will the inventory date come in? how does the system calculate the expiry date. ( expiry date = inventory date + shelf life)<br />
<br />
When lot control is used and outbound priority in by location. <br />
a) System can have multiple inventories coming into the same lot.so how does one get different shelf lifes ? the lot date can mislead us here...<br />
<br />
Also I have not been able to think of a business process where one would like to keep a shelf life and yet shift out the goods by location rather than expiry date. It would be very interesting to know the business scenario where this kind of process is implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">30th June 2003, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">One more imporatant loop is that u have to run the session tdilc0221m000 to block the expired item. <br />
<br />
System doesn't automatically blocks the inventory which is expired.</div></div><hr />
