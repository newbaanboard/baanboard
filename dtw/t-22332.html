<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SMORES</div><div class="date">15th November 2004, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking to improve our current process of matching Purchase Orders to Invoices in Baan.<br />
<br />
Currently our A/P Department will begin an A/P transaction in Baan.  When they arrive at the matching screen, they will only match if the invoice price matches the purchase order price exactly (or very near).  If the prices do not match, they will back completely out of the transaction and send the invoice down to purchasing for either approval or a purchase order price change.  After purchasing completes their part, A/P starts the entry process over from the beginning.<br />
<br />
During our initial Baan training before going live, our consultants showed us a process of registering the invoices so A/P does not have to start over from the beginning.  However, they stopped doing this due to problems they encountered while doing so.<br />
<br />
Although we ask our suppliers to acknowledge our purchase orders, we still run in to problems with steel surcharges and other commodities that have monthly price changes.  We in materials would like to make life easier for the folks in A/P, but we are not sure how we can do this in Baan.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else encountered this problem with changing purchase prices and the inefficiencies in Baan A/P?  If so, have you created reports or used the registration process in A/P?</div></div><hr />
