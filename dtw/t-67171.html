We don't want different storage/inventory units.  Where do I find where to change the storage unit so it matches our inventory unit.  I've exhausted every part of the help section and gone through the entire Infor ERP sessions.  We never realized there were such things.  We knew about UOM conversions for sales and Purchasing but we didn't know about this and our Physical Inventory was affected.  Please help.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erplncons</div><div class="date">17th December 2014, 07:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi:<br />
There is a basic difference between storage unit and inventory unit. e. g. you would store say oil in barrels (of 200 liters). So Barrel would be your storage unit. But in the BOM, you would be using that same oil in liters (instead of barrels). So your inventory unit would be liter. There has to be a conversion factor between barrel and liter.<br />
Both of these units have been provisioned to ease your operation and help you in managing your inventory in better way.<br />
If you go to the item data session (and its sub-sessions) for this item, you would see the appropriate units for each purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donnawren</div><div class="date">18th December 2014, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I am working with Infor 6.1.  There is no place in Items General where I can see or change the storage unit.  Can you be more specific about the session you are using to be able to view (and change the storage unit of measure)?  Thank you so much for taking the time you already have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">18th December 2014, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">If you buy stuff in a purchase unit that differs from the inventory unit, that _purchase_ unit will be the storage unit that goes into the inventory structure table (whinr150) during the purchase order receipt procedure. In fact that's something that's rarely considered during ERP LN implementation projects, and then people wonder why they have weird situations when outbounding/cycle counting. However, in the units by unit set you can disallow a unit for storage purpouses. In such a case, the inventory unit will be used for the inventory structure. So basically, if you're inventory unit is &quot;piece&quot; and your purchase unit is &quot;package&quot; for a particular item, that item should have a unit set where &quot;package&quot; is not allowed for storage.<br />

Hope that helps<br />

But how can correct the inventory which is already present in whinr150 and not allowing to process cycle counting order.</div></div><hr />
