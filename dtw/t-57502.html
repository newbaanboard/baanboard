I wanted to know a way through which i could free the allocated inventory from orders.<br />
<br />
1. I executed a query on the table tdinv150 to get the list of various orders for a given item.--To check for the quantities allocated.<br />
2. For the sales orders i checked if the Order is still open (no delieveries maintained - tdsls045). If yes, then by deleting the respective SO line i found the allocated inventory count in Maintain item data also reduced.<br />
3. I want to know how can i clean up the same for Purchase orders, Production orders and other orders.<br />
This is what i tried <br />
-------------------<br />
1. I tried cancelling a released production order and was expecting the allocated inventory to be reduced, instead the inventory on order got reduced.But the particular record no longer appears in table tdinv150.<br />
2. Tried to check if a receipt has been maintained for a PO in table tdpur045, if no tried to delete the correcsponding PO line. But this did not affect the allocated inventory.<br />
<br />
i need to develop a session where in the user can check where all the inventory for a particular item is allocated and then clean it up.<br />
<br />
Am i right on my approach?? please suugest me a way for this..</div></div><hr />

<br />
In ln u can find the all allocated inventories by item in Planned inventory transactions.<br />
Regarding deleting those lines depends on th type of allocation,<br />
Like as u tld in sales in production also u can nullify the qty required by negative issue of th item from prodcution order in Material to issue.<br />
In warehouse order u need to delete th line if its created.<br />
<br />

If you want to fix tdinv150 first then run the session &quot;tdinv0250m000&quot;, this will fix the tdiv150 table. This session should be run in off hours.<br />
This will fix the allocation and onorder fields in everywhere besised tdinv150.<br />
<br />
I assumed you are refferring to soft allocations only.<br />
