<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belitre</div><div class="date">20th July 2005, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We have lots of expensive tools which are limited. For instance a laser, or other calibrations tools. <br />
<br />
  We used them in diferent warehouses (or clients home).<br />
<br />
  We'd like to control the stock, flow and transport of these items. How could manage this in BaaN?<br />
<br />
  There is another requirement. Most of times our tools are inside a packaging or container. For this cases we only want to control the flow and situation of the container o packaging. The items included in this packaing would be in a list.<br />
<br />
   Is tr packet the solution for this problem? <br />
   Thanks for your comments.</div></div><hr />
