<br />
For control purposes it is not possible for us to reprint a picking list after the packing slip has been printed. (To prevent the possibility of repicking the same order.) Within that constraint is there anyway to report on the date and time of when the picking list was first printed?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />
