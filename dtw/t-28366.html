New tax law require reporting sales (for tax collecting purposes)within a state , either shipping from an in -state warehouse to a customer or shipping to a customer within a state. iThe immediate concern is Ohio requires this to be done on a quarterly basis  while others semi-annually or yearly.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had to develope such a report or knows of a workaround using standard exsisting baan reports to collect the information.  From how this site has put in addresses, the state line on the delivery address etc all seem to have the state abbreviation plus the zip code.<br />
<br />
Anything would be apprevciated .<br />

Thanks<br />

Wehave created separate filed in our table where we have store the sales order address and then store the city, state and zip separately. The advantage is that - All address is one table and is frozen for that order.<br />
