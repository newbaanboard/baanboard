Dear all,<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me what the session tdinv0253m000 does and what are the ramifications of running this session?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sometimes tdinv001 and tdinv700 get corrupted. This session is used to recalculate the difference between the tables, the difference is written to historical stock in tdinv001.<br />
<br />
Depending on the size of tdinv700 it can take a lot of time.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Klaas</div></div><hr />

I think you have the problem right on dot.  We got a report showing old inventory as 0 and new inventory as -32. <br />
So obviously some corrution had taken place.<br />
<br />
Thanks once again</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please be careful in running this session. It looks nice to have a correct table tdinv700 and tdinv001, but from the logic part some weird things might have happened, specially if you're using ILC. There have been a lot of (well known) bugs that generated corruption. <br />
<br />
If historical stock is set to -32, where does the stock come from, is it financially covered for? And what if the historical stock becomes positive, where did the stock go? Just vanished? We had the same problem 3 years ago, it comes up when you want to run session tdinv6230m000, and the stock amount is not the same as is financially accounted for.<br />
<br />
With regards,<br />
Klaas</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess someone  could have done some archiving and this could be the result. Could this be correct?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can check that looking at inventory tables in other companies. But my best guess is several bugs in inventory part of Baan.<br />
