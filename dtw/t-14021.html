<br />
1. We are using LOT control, after we print the Packing Slip, the items delviered will be EDI to the receipt company, but NOT the LOT info. Is there a way to solve this problem ?<br />
<br />
2. Because of the problem in question 1, the deliveries to the receipient company will not be able to receipt automatically. The user have to maintain receipt and enter the LOT info. If the delivery company print the Sales Invoices before the recipient company maintain receipt, the Purchase Invoice created in the recipient company will not be match automatically. How can we <br />
solve this problem ?<br />
<br />
Hope to get some advice.<br />
<br />
TQ.<br />

If they don't have, add it to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kw_foo</div><div class="date">23rd December 2003, 04:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I am actually very new in EDI, if possible please give more detail guide on setting it up.<br />
<br />
What is the purpose of message 856S ? At which point it will be trigger on ?<br />
<br />
The lot code from both companies should be the same and it will be different lot code for each item each delivery. It is not practical to maintain the conversion (since they are the same) for every shipment.<br />
<br />
Hope to have more advice.<br />
