<br />
please to a search for proforma in your Infor help.<br />
<br />
Some remarks which I found in the help:<br />
<br />
For sales invoicing procedure<br />
In ERP LN 6.1, you can no longer print proforma invoices. This functionality is replaced by installments in Sales Control. For more information, refer to Installments.<br />
<br />
For Cash Management module<br />
Proforma invoices Changed in SSA ERP LN 6.1. The Proforma Invoices business object was removed from the Cash Management module.<br />
In ERP LN 6.1, this functionality was replaced:<br />
In Order Management, by installments of the type Advance. For more information, refer to Installments.<br />
In Project, by advance payment requests. For more information, refer to To use advance payment requests.<br />
Installments and advance payment requests are processed in Central Invoicing in the same way as other types of invoices. For more information, refer to Central Invoicing<br />
<br />
