Do we store the address where the check is to be mailed as a supplier postal address? (Table tccom022)</div></div><hr />

  From what i know, Baan doesnt care what postal address you put on your Supplier master. It would come down to a business decision in choosing one of them. My opinion, i would put the address the cheque is to be mailed just because, money matters. Another reason being during the process of making a purchase order, you have a provision to enter a delivery and a postal address. However, to reduce the number of times a different address has to be entered in a purchase order, one could even have the PO mailing address entered in the master. <br />
<br />
The choice is yours..<br />

If you create a postal address and put that address in the supplier master then the PO will go to the postal address.</div></div><hr />

Similar if not same question a few years later.<br />
<br />
Suppliers manufacturing plant is in say.. New York<br />
Suppliers Corp office is in New Jersey.<br />
<br />
Supplier wants the New York address to appear on our Baan Purchase Order.<br />
Supplier want cheques and invoices to print New Jersey office address.<br />
<br />
Maintain Supplier address = New York<br />
Maintain Supplier postal address = New Jersey<br />
<br />
Why does the Baan PO print the New Jersey address on the Purchase Order? <br />

In your case you have done reverse. What the suggestion was<br />
<br />
1. Put NJ address in supplier master as this is one that prints on check<br />
2. Put NY address in postal code. Attach this code on purchase order. So when a purchase order is printed it will print NY address.<br />
<br />
Based on yoru input you have done reverse<br />
1. System is printing NJ address on PO because that is getting attached in the Purchase order<br />
2. You should also check what address comes on check. I am suspecting it would print NY address.<br />

<br />
It seems the postal address is the address that prints on our checks, maybe a customization done long ago for reasons I am not aware of....??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">14th January 2008, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Jason,<br />
Thats strange. You can check if it is printing any specifice postal address code? <br />

<br />
Interesting I found the above thread RE:Factoring Companies.  <br />
<br />
You would think Baan would have addressed this issue in the past 5 years? Seems to be a simple request to have a different check &quot;send to&quot; address then the Maintain Supplier address.. <br />
<br />
Thanks again Arvind.</div></div><hr />
