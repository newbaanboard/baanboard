<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi-<br />
I have a situation where a large number of PO lines have been deleted and I'm not sure why.  Here are the facts:<br />
There are several old PO's with un-received PO lines against them.  When clerk tried to receive against one of them, there was no line against the PO Header.  The line needed to be re-entered before it could be received.  <br />
Further investigation against the PO line History (tdpur051) table showed that a large number of PO lines had been deleted ( record type=2) on the same day, within a few seconds of each other.  No one wanted these PO lines deleted.  <br />
I have been looking at the session Process delivered  Purchase Orders (tdpur4223m000).  There is an option to delete the PO line here but, I believe the order line must be received, invoiced etc...  before Baan will delete it.  (There are other criteria to be met before Baan will delete.) I have tested the possibility the tdpur4223m000 session may have done this but, the  session does not appear to update the tdpur051 PO Line History table when it deletes the lines.  I have many record type=2 (deleted/cancelled)records for the PO's in question on the tdpur051 table.  <br />
My question is this...  The PO lines in this case were still open!  No deliveries, no invoices.... etc.  <br />
What sessions are available, if any, that will delete 'open' PO lines up to a certain date?  Have I misunderstood the Process delivered PO session????  <br />
can anybody shine a light of understanding out there?<br />
Thanks!<br />

This will be in Maintain purchase order or Maintain purchase order lines. This will be done manually and will be by line or by order.<br />
Process Delivered purchase orders can delete order lines only if received and totally processed in the financial module.</div></div><hr />

OK, I understand the Process Delivered PO session correctly.  Whew!  <br />
I know that PO lines can be deleted one at a time manually.  The problem is.....  these PO lines appear to have been deleted en mass....  all at once....  only seconds apart.  I know the user id already.  It's highly unlikely they would do this on purpose.  The PO numbers are far enough apart that it would be darn near impossible for someone to lookup and delete each line manually.  <br />
Has anyone ever seen something like this???<br />
Thanks<br />
