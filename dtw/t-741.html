<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan allows a user to modify both the inventory and storage unit quantities when doing Maintain Inbound and Maintain Outbound.  Then users could conceivably change quantities so that they no longer are in the same proportion as specified by the unit conversion factor.  When would changing the proportion really make sense?  It seems like this could be a dangerous way to get inventory and storage units out of balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">It would usually not make sense to change the units of measure.  The entire purpose of the conversion was to all receiving, production (and sales) to use only the units appropriate for their function, with Baan doing all the behind the scenes activities of keeping them in stock.  I would recommend that receiving in other than &quot;customary&quot; units beshifted up a level from the shipping dock to make sure it is done correctly and that people know something different was done...  providing a trace if an inventoryu shortage or overage is found later.<br />
<br />
If this is happening frequently, then you should check as to why and considedr changing the default unit of measure for those items (make sure you advertise the change thoroughly so everyone knows they have to shift from one UOM to another).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">This was more a curiosity question.  One of our customers asked us to do some work on the Maintain Outbound session.  This was observed (and the fact that changing the storage unit quantity doesn't update the inventory quantity as you might expect -- I think it does in Inbounding) and led me to ask why someone would break the proportions.  I still am unclear about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">24th January 2002, 04:39</div></div><div class="posttext">In our experience, breaking conversion factors happen most when there are multiple packaging levels.  Although this is evident in most process manufacturing, it does happen in discrete manufacturing and distribution as well.<br />
<br />
For example, a purchase order for 1 metric ton of flour gets delivered in a truck.  The usage is in kilograms, so inventory unit is in kilos.  The flour is packaged in bags of 20kg each (standard conversion). Thus 1 metric ton is approximately 50 bags of 20kg each. It is possible, that the load is not exactly 1 metric ton at the truck weighing scale.  This means that either there are less bags in the truck or more likely, less flour in some bags.  For the latter, it means a different conversion factor from sack to kilograms. Thus the Baan functionality.<br />
<br />
Now, the problem is that for the case where there are less bags in the truck you change the number of bags (right?).  One would expect that the quantity in inventory unit should be changed based on the conversion factor.  Thus if you received 48bags, I expect that there would be 960 kilos defaulted in the inventory unit field in Maintain Inbound Advice.  This does not happen and the user has to do a manual computation to get the right inventory unit. Baan's argument is to allow for the flexibility.  Fine, but we are not reducing flexibility by giving the default conversion.  In fact, we should ensure accuracy by providing the default conversion into inventory unit.  Let the user have the option to change the inventory unit.  Most of the time, the conversion factors will still hold anyway.  <br />
<br />
The customer has around 200 SOs per day with an average of 3,000 lines per SO (yes!). At an inventory variance of 10% of order line, they have to change 60,000 lines per day.  They could edit the 60,000 lines but having to compute the inventory unit manually introduces a big margin for error, thats aside from the additional keystrokes. The customer has requested Baan PEG for this change in both outbound and inbound but it was refused based on the flexibility argument.  We suspect it has something to do with how the session is written because we think they simply had to insert the conversion function after entry of the stock unit inventory before transfering control to the inventory unit field.<br />
<br />
Has anybody had the same response from Baan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">24th January 2002, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow.  That sure is a lot of work.  Did you customize the script for them?  That is what we will probably do for our customer.  I suppose we could always make it calculate in one direction (say storage -&gt; inventory) and/or give them an input key to force a calculation.  As you suggest, it should be very simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foxguard</div><div class="date">18th February 2002, 06:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the late reply, was out at customer site for the last three weeks.<br />
<br />
Since the sessions inbound and outbound have seen and continue to see a lot of changes, we have declined to customized the session.  We reckon it's not effective for us to maintain the customization everytime Baan makes changes. We do hope that Baan PEG reconsiders their decision on this as it is a key functionality for installations with this scale of transactions.<br />
Baan Asia-Pacific's customization team offered to do the customization at cost to the customer but the customer insists that Baan do it for free.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
