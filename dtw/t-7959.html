Outbound advice is generated. The data appears in Warehousing Orders.<br />
<br />
When &quot;Generate Picking List&quot; session is run, there is an updation on whinh225 table. What factors decide the value of field &quot;Picking Mission&quot; ? Is it because of same item m ainitained in different location of same warehouse or different location of different warehouse?<br />
<br />
Can anyone pls tell me?<br />

Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sensoft99</div><div class="date">8th December 2002, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">A little more detail:<br />
<br />
My environment is BaanERP5.0b. Should be the same with 5c also.<br />
<br />
After I raise a production order in SFC, release it to warehousing and generate outbound advice, data has come into whinh225 (Outbound advice), but the fields whinh225.picm (Picking Mission) and whinh225.lseq (Picking Sequence) has no value in it till one generates a &quot;Picking List&quot;. When I generate a picking list, I use the &quot;Run Number&quot; that was generated during the OutBound advice generation process and when I generate a 'Picking List', it pops up with a menu that contains 2 options <br />
<br />
1) Order based <br />
2) Location based<br />
<br />
After &quot;Generate Picking List&quot; session is ran, the above mentioned fields gets updated.<br />
<br />
I just want to know, which field forces to create a new picking mission? Is the creation of 'Picking Mission' value in whinh225 independent of what the user chooses (order/location based)? Is it that Picking Mission is unique when user selects 'Location based'. <br />
<br />
Or... the option is only for reporting purpose?<br />
<br />
Please give me an answer, if anyone out there knows. <br />
It will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no influence on the Picking Mission because of selecting either of the Menu Options - Order/Location. <br />
