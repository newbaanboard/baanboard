The reason why the lot numbers are not sent vai EDI is becuase sometimes lot can be an internal number generated. Also one can add to existing lot any other shipment. In Baan Lot can be unqiue to an Item or to a lot. Hence, I think it was not part of EDI/ASN. Anyway ASN will not do the receipts. One still has to do the receipts of it. This will need modification to Baan if one needs to automate.<br />

Serial settings of an item were not same in both companies. In one company the item was serialized item &amp; in another company it was existing as non serialized item. Thats why serial nos were not received via ASN.<br />
