<br />
The scenario is:  Our supplier direct delivers items to our customers.  We enter a purchase contract for the supplier information and a sales contract for the customer (sales contract references purchase contract in header).  The purchase order is generated from each sales order through the direct delivery process.  Now our supplier is offering a discount, part to be taken from the purchase contract price immediately and part to be received as a rebate each quarter.  For financial purposes, we need to generate a purchase order payable that reflects the immediate discount (which works fine) but also book an entry at the time of transaction that takes the future discount to a different accrual account - without affecting the payable amount. <br />
<br />
We have tried setting up our purchase contract with the item line using the immediate discount amount and a second cost line for the future discount.  But, the cost line never gets brought through the direct delivery process (probably because it's not on the sales contract--and cannot show there for customer reasons).   Does anyone know how to generated direct delivery purchase orders from sales orders that include cost item lines on the PO?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why don't you have a look at the Commissions and Rebate module, and mainly the commissions part? There you can define your supplier as a relation and link him to your sls order to accumulate the acrued commission amount \the discount trhat is on quarterly basis\ see commission agreements parameters. While the line discount will just go with the pur order as you do it at the moment. <br />
<br />
And in case you have a link with Finance you can precise the operation type that goes with these quarterly invoices \invoice, credit or debit note, etc\ in commisiion parameters.<br />
<br />
I think this functionality might help you with this case.<br />
