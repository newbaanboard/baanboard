Is it correct that there is no functionality to create a back order for Sales Return orders in LN? <br />
<br />
If so then is there a reason for this, perhaps an alternative option?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Thanks for the advice but I'm afraid I need a bit more info. When I choose a return order type the shipping constraint field in the sales order header (and lines) is disabled. Is this where you mean I should make the change?<br />
 <br />
I have also found this in the baan help:<br />
<br />
You cannot enter a Hold Back Quantity for:<br />
<br />
 Items with a commitment policy.<br />
 Order (lines) with shipping constraints.<br />
 Cost items.<br />
 Service items.<br />
 List items.<br />
 Subcontract items.<br />
 Equipment items.<br />
 Generic items.<br />
 Collect orders.<br />
 Return order lines.<br />
 Order lines with delivery lines linked to it.<br />
 Order lines with an order quantity equal to zero.<br />
Thanks<br />

Any resoluion on this issue yet?<br />
Still an enhancement request or a solution?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">17th August 2007, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Reply from Infor on this issue:<br />
=============<br />
I am afraid this functionallity will never be added. <br />
<br />
The reason for the behaviour at present is that the customer shall take care of sending the complete quantity agreed for the return back to his supplier. The responsibility is put on the customer to decharge the supplier of such a kind of bureaucracy.<br />
<br />
Naturally, we can try to put in an enhancement request. But for this it really makes no sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">20th August 2007, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Flip, <br />
<br />
I've asked Infor for an update on the enhancement request. I'd be interested in knowing where you got the statement from INFOR from. This &quot;Assumption&quot; is a very weak one in my opinion. I can only speak from my experience with our customers but I can say that it is very commonplace for us to attempt to collect returns from our customers only to find that the goods are not ready or missing or simply that the warehouse person is not prepared to find the goods.<br />
<br />
The customers finance department will then chase up the credit and want a full history of our attempts to collect. We found, in Baan 4, that using the back order functionality allowed excellent control and monitoring of this process. This was the only true way to push responsibility back to the customer.<br />
<br />
I have also been told by an INFOR employee that it was essential that functionality is not removed when a customer upgrades. I'm afraid, in this case, that is exactly what has happened. This flexibilty should not have been removed just because somebody thought that all of our customers think like they do.<br />
<br />
That's got that off my chest. I'll let you know what my response from Infor is.</div></div><hr />
