Hi Folks,<br />
.<br />
I just want to receive a kit to a warehouse depending on a purchase order, and  depending on this receipt, I want Baan to receive all the subitems included in this kit to the related warehouses (default warehouses mentioned in their item definitions), respectfully. Is it possible?..  :confused: <br />
.<br />
Kind Regards,<br />

The Inventory Posting Status on the Purchase Order Line (tdpur041.btsp) should default to &quot;Post to Component&quot;. When you recieve this PO Line, it should zoom into a sub-session that allows you to receive the individual components.<br />
