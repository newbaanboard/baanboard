<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">searocket</div><div class="date">5th April 2012, 15:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of our sales orders for capital equipment are sold on finance.<br />
The end user will have a finance agreement with the finance company.<br />
So our sales order has the finance company as the sold-to/invoice to/pay-by business partner.<br />
But really we only want the finance company to be the invoice-to and pay-by BP.<br />
The value can be Â£20k-100k<br />
<br />
Because of this we lose the fact that we have sold the equipment to the end user.<br />
And usually it will start as a sales quotation to the end user - which cannot be converted as the sold -to BP changes to the finance company.<br />
<br />
Does any have a similar problem - and a good solution?<br />
As I understand LN does not allow us to specify an invoice-to BP that is different to the sold-to BP unless they are the parent. Which is not generally true.<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
