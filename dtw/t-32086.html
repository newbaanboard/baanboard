Before long, we will need to receipt raw material, with no cost, we will process it and we will sell the final product with the cost of our manufacture process. The scheduling of the receptions and sales will probably be different, this is why we need to be able to control inventory levels of raw and manufactured materials. I think this could be supported:<br />
-making the inputs of raw material throuhg the replenishment module<br />
-defining the necessary structures and routing<br />
-creating manufacture orders and making the neccesary wharehouse input/output transactions<br />
-creating the sale orders<br />
IS THIS THE CORRECT WAY? IS THERE ANOTHER APROACH?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Under this system, we plan for the materials we will need, send EDI 830 schedules to our suppliers for these materials.  The supplier however, sends the invoices to our customers.<br />
<br />
When we do a receipt in Baan for these, the receipt is at $0.00.<br />

In addition I have not supply chain extension. But it is true that scheduling can be another subject to think about.<br />
