<br />
Just about to start using Cycle Counting and the following initial questions have cropped up.<br />
<br />
1) If we have the parameter &quot;Block Warehouse During Cycle Counting&quot; set at what point are transactions blocked ? Are they blocked from the point that the Cycle Counting Orders are generated and then unblocked when either the orders are processed or deleted ?<br />
<br />
2) The INV parameters help screen talks about &quot;Turnover&quot; presumably this relates to the value of individual items but how is this calculated ? Purchase Stats ?<br />
<br />
3) In respect of the counting intervals being weekly how does this work if your planned count is delayed by a week. Presumably Cycle Counting orders will still be generated. Also if we wanted to bring a count forward by a day would the system not generate the orders ?<br />
<br />
4 ) When a B count is due are orders generated for both A and B items and when a C count is due A,B, and C items ?<br />
<br />
Any assistance appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) The INV parameters help screen talks about &quot;Turnover&quot; presumably this relates to the value of individual items but how is this calculated ? Purchase Stats ?<br />
You're probably talking about the Slow Moving Analysis? The system takes the annual issue from the inventory history tables.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) In respect of the counting intervals being weekly how does this work if your planned count is delayed by a week. Presumably Cycle Counting orders will still be generated. Also if we wanted to bring a count forward by a day would the system not generate the orders ?<br />
Cycle counting orders are not generated automatically, unless you don't run a job for it. The system does not generate orders if the interval is shorter than a week. There is a simple check against the value in Maintain Items by Warehouse (Form3) for each item. We had this issue once, when somebody processed the orders accidentally. <br />
<br />
<br />
4 ) When a B count is due are orders generated for both A and B items and when a C count is due A,B, and C items ?<br />
The system generates orders according to your selection, regadless whether the date is due or not. The only restriction is the shortest possible interval.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Oh, we don't have ILC implemented, but I think it's basicly the same thing.<br />

<br />
1) yes, inventory is blocked as from the moment the cycle counting orders are generated and unblocked when either processing or deleting them<br />
<br />
2) the turnover is calculated by using the data in table tdinv750 (item issue by period) by applying either the cost price, the sales price or the quantity as the basis for ABC analysis (in tdinv6210m000). In other words, you'll also have to have the INV-parameter 'item issue history' set to 'yes' in order to be able to calculate the turnover<br />
<br />
3) no cycle counting orders for item X will be generated if there's still an unprocessed cycle counting order pending for item X<br />
<br />
4) when a B-count is due, cycle counting orders are only generated for B-items<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
My company after being live with Baan for 8 years is currently in the middle of a major drive to make more use of the system. So as the man whose been here since day one my head is spinning at the moment. So forgive me if I need to update this thread in the future.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason Patte</div><div class="date">16th March 2009, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">How can you generate cycle counts by ABC Code? <br />
<br />
i.e <br />
One Count for all A items every 3 weeks.<br />
One count for all B items once every 3 months<br />
One count for all C item every 6 months.<br />
<br />
Anyone do this or simliar counting intervals by ABC class?</div></div><hr />
