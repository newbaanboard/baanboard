I have defined a number of new locations for different products in Baan V.<br />
After setting this up, made the &quot;adjustment order&quot; so as to move the existent units from the generic (former) location of Stock to each of the new defined locations.<br />
After the adjustment, the available qty. of units is the same, the only difference is that now they are found on a specific location.<br />
<br />
But when generating the picking list I received a &quot;Shortage&quot; message! ...but logically checking the stock session whinr1542m000 I could see that the units where available.<br />
<br />
I saw in the Forum that there were many posts for &quot;rebuilding inventory&quot; -so as to update all related data- and wonder if something similar could be happening to me in Baan V (like the system is not reading the adjustment I made, and therefore thinks there is no product available....).<br />
<br />
Did someone had a similar problem and/or know how this can be solved?<br />
many thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please check if you have defined the Warehouse as a location controlled warehouse in the session whwmd2500. If the field Location is set to Yes, please check if the Receipt Locations/Staging Locations/Pick Locations have been defined for that warehouse.<br />
<br />
This problem has been know to occur If the locations have not been defined properly.<br />

thank you for the answer! I checked the parameters you mentioned.<br />
<br />
Seems that what had to be defined was the same packing type (picking or bulk) for each packing option per code in session &quot;packing definition level by item&quot; whwmd4140s000. And that such types should be the same as the dedicated locations in the warehouse (per code, again).<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />
