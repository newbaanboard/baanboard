Any inputs really appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shashig</div><div class="date">9th November 2015, 06:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you mean to say, you want to put a particular inventory stock-point from Stock (Bulk Location) to Quarantine Location during Purchase/Production Process?<br />
<br />
Inventory in a quarantine Location only comes through result of Inbound/Outbound Inspection Rejection (for both Purchase and Production) You can not directly transfer inventory to a quarantine location without going through inspection, although there workarounds.<br />
<br />
For production you have option in session Report operation Complete session 'Move to quarantine' after you specify rejection quantity and quarantine functionality is enabled. <br />
<br />
For Purchase, Inventory gets moved to quarantine location after you reject inventory during inspection and quarantine functionality is enabled<br />
<br />
You can find help on detail setup process in LN Documentation No U9876AUS<br />
<br />
