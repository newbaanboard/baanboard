   Our customer have made several wrong shipments; either because of wrong sales order entry or simply failing to record the proper quantity during shipping. We have made entries to correct these errors. First we made entries directly opposite the wrong shipments, then we made ones reflecting the correct condition.<br />
<br />
   The customer would like to flag the wrong shipment records. WE're thinking of using reason code or anything on that line for this (we currently switch off the parameter requiring change reason be specified everytime we modify orders). I'm just not sure of the implications, if any, to order history or in fact to anything. Is this a good idea at all? Would you happen to know an idea that'd fit better? Pls help<br />
<br />
   Thanks<br />
