We receive partial quantity for a given P.O. line.  It is not a final receipt.  We have to discuss with our supplier to know when we should expect the remaining quantity.<br />
However, it seems that we cannot change the Planned Receipt Date because a receipt has already been performed.  I understand the behavior and it's ok because we can then measure our supplier (KPI).  However, for MRP purpose and also our own knowledge, isn't there a Schedule or something where we should be able to specify the &quot;new&quot; planned receipt date for the remaining quantity?<br />
Thank you.<br />

I guess, when you make the receipt final you will have a new sequence of backorder line created in Purchase Order lines. Now, if automatic confirmation of backorders off parameter is off, you can change the Planned Delivery Date else the system will confirm it and will become a part of receipt which will not allow you to change the date.<br />
<br />
I think there is no way you can modify it without Final flag is checked. The only way is to use Receipt Correction Option in whinh3512m000 which will generate a backorder line.</div></div><hr />

Ok got it.  I wasn't not aware of the &quot;Approve back order&quot; process where it triggers a new sequence for a new receipt to occurs.  Thank you!<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
