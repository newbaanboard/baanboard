<br />
We are having problems with back orders on PCS projects.<br />
<br />
A purchase order has a back order of 7 for a customized item. However, this quantity is not showing up on the &quot;planned inventory transactions by customized item&quot; session.<br />
<br />
Could someone provide any inputs on what could be causing the problem?<br />
<br />
Under what condition can a backorder not appear in the planned inventory transactions?<br />
<br />

Do we need to confirm purchase back orders?<br />
I know we need to confirm Sales order back orders.<br />
<br />
However, I am not aware of any sessions to confirm purchase back orders. <br />
<br />
If there are any such sessions, Please let me know. <br />
(We are using BaanC4)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ajit.</div></div><hr />

I found Baan's functionality to be a bit thin in this area, because there is no standard baan report that will show you everything that you are expecting to receive.<br />
<br />
You can print purchase order back-orders (tdpur4430m000)(prints only things that have had the backorders confirmed.)<br />
<br />
You can print purchase orders by delivery date,<br />
but it does not show what is still outstanding to be received.<br />
<br />
I ended up writing custom 'Expected Delivery List' reports, that incorporate this data including the various planned delivery dates, changed delivery dates, current planned delivery date fields in the purchase order lines.<br />

apart from expected deliver (ordered quanity); delivered Quantity<br />
<br />
 back orderquantity is available if i am right in understanding the discussion<br />
pls check tdpur4408m000<br />
isn't it?<br />
<br />
well for<br />
data including the various planned delivery dates, changed delivery dates, current planned delivery date fields in the purchase order lines.<br />
i didnt found any such report readilayy available<br />
so think customization required as said by jroberts<br />
:o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">7th April 2003, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I have attached the program source for my expected delivery list report.<br />
On the session form there are:<br />
<br />
 Supplier Range<br />
 Item Range<br />
 Order Range<br />
 Position Range<br />
 Expected Delivery Date Range <br />
 Items to be inspected Yes / No<br />
 Print Order Line Text Yes / No<br />
 <br />
<br />
It is not the fastest report, but it does the job.<br />
I hope this is useful to people,<br />
