<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">8th April 2003, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there an indication of when a sales order is completely closed and cannot be reopened?  There are some people saying that when process delivered sales orders runs, that makes them closed, but they can go back and add new lines to those sales orders.  I just need some clarification.<br />

Thanks<br />

Until then you can add sales order lines to the order.<br />
At this point you can only see the sales order info in the history tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">askajale</div><div class="date">9th April 2003, 12:40</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan system, each sales order line is treated as seperate sales order in the sence each line can have different status. The sales order line is closed at Process Delivered Sales Order status. After this the line can not be modified. In Process Delivered Sales Order session, there is an option to Delete the SO's / SO Line's, once the complete SO is deleted (all lines deleted) one can not add any lines to the sales order.<br />
