<br />
I have question on how the PRP run (tipcs5201m000) generate the PRP warehouse Order (warehouse to project). <br />
<br />
This is what I understand.<br />
Instead of generate a PRP purchase order/production order, PRP run will generate a PRP warehouse order for a project that need a item where this item is &#8220;available&#8221; in warehouse. The word &#8220;available&#8221; can be on hand or on order. In the later scenario, the user can&#8217;t put the warehouse order  to &#8220;Confirmed&#8221; as this is no stock on hand.<br />
<br />
Now my question come. Imagine this scenario. <br />
Inventory status on warehouse for item A<br />
On hand = 10pc<br />
On order = 20 pc<br />
<br />
Project A,B and C need 10 pc each of item A. After PRP run, BaaN will generate 3 warehouse orders to transfer 10 pc each of item A into project A,B and C respectively.<br />
<br />
How can BaaN allow the user to confirm all the 3 PRP warehouse orders as the stock is only enough for one order ? Although I am not sure, I think BaaN is not taken into consideration those confirm PRP warehouse order when determine whether there is enough stock for a PRP warehouse order when the user try to set the ordre to &#8220;Confirmed&#8221;<br />
<br />
Is this consider a bug or intent functionality ?Anyone can advise ?<br />
<br />
I am on BaaN4c4 SP15</div></div><hr />

  Tried your scenario and got the same result but it may not be a bug. Baan lets you confirm your PRP Warehouse because the requirement is satisfied by the combination of OnHand+OnOrder. However, when its time to transfer these confirmed Warehouse orders to the project, it only transfers whats in the On hand figure in a sequential fashion(lowest PRP warehouse order number first). Confirming doesnt do much in terms of movement of material so there is no reason why Baan wouldnt allow this to happen if the requirement is satisfied by the total of Onhand+OnOrder.<br />
<br />
Therefore my verdict would be..&quot;Not a Bug&quot;..<br />
Would like to see if anyone else has another explanation...<br />
We use Baan4c4 with SP 18..<br />
