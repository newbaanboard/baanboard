<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">5th April 2004, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a loaded question :)  The deliveries table is no more.  You are now talking about Warehouse Orders for deliveries, Central Invoicing for invoice data.  I'll list what I have stumbled onto, this is by no means comprehensive.<br />
<br />
Sales Orders is now tdsls400<br />
Sales Order Lines is now tdsls401, but this now has a sequence number.  This represents the breaking of the order line into Warehouse Orders.  Warehouse orders is where you are going to see the deliveries.<br />
<br />
Warehouse Orders:  whinh200<br />
Outbounding:  formerly tdilc401:<br />
  Outbound Order Lines:  whinh220 <br />
  Outbound Advice:  whinh225<br />
Shipments:  whinh430<br />
<br />
Those tables deal with the deliveries now, not exactly a 1 to 1 with the tdsls045 table.  Shipments is probably as close as you will get.   You can tie Shipements and Invoices to Order Lines via the 'Linked Order Line Data' tdsls402</div></div><hr />
