There is now a new requirement to take-on the additional stock from the cardex system into existing BAAN warehouse. Some of the stock has existing codes in BAAN yet new codes will need to be created for other items. <br />
<br />
 I do not have previous experience doing this sort of exercise please assist me with the correct procedure to <br />
(i) automate the takeon process - I have over 1000 additional items <br />
(ii) Stock from manual stores has both quantity and price, what is the best way to take these on and cater for average price of the resultant stocks in the warehouse. I mean how do we update the average price? Please assist with the correct sessions to run since I am new to BAAN.<br />
<br />
Any other hints to ensure this process will be accurate will be appreciated</div></div><hr />

Consider using Baan's API called AFS (Application Function Server) to port in those data you need. It's also available in BaanIV that you have. It shouldn't be that hard to learn. The manual is available free in Baan Support, and there's a special forum in this board discussing this if you ever have questions<br />

<br />
If your cardex system carries different prices per stock line in a manual fifo record, the first thing to do is to calculate an average cost price for the stock you still have on each item.<br />
<br />
Then you will have to create the item records where they don't exist.  If you have groups of items that are similar the copy item function is useful as is the default item data session where you can enter defaults for many of the item fields based on their item group and type.  <br />
<br />
When setting up the item data you will come to a field called purchase price.  If you enter your average cost here, the system should ask if you want that cost copied to the average purchase price.<br />
<br />
Where the records already exist, go back to them and enter the price in the same way.  When you have finished with item setup, you must run the calculate and update standard cost sessions; this will enter your purchase price as the standard cost.  Without this you can't issue the item to orders<br />
<br />
You don't say whether you are using ILC or not - if you are, you will have to set up warehouse and location data.<br />
<br />
The simplest way to take on the balances from the manual records would be to generate cycle counting orders.  This should produce counting sheets with zero quantities that can be used to capture the balances from the cardexes.  Then enter the balances to Baan as cycle counting results and process the cycle counting orders.  This will populate your inventory file with the stock at the correct cost and give the first record in the inventory transaction history.</div></div><hr />
