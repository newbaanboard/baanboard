<br />
I just need to make sure of something.....<br />
<br />
We have 2 customers, 70000 has priority 1 and 70001 has priority 2.<br />
<br />
A sales order was made for each customer, both having the same delivery date, both selling the same standard item (qty 1).  There is only 1 on hand of this standard item.<br />
<br />
An outbound is done and customer 70000 gets the item because it has greater priority.  This is cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
New scenario (same parameters, 1 on hand of the standard item):<br />
<br />
Now, when the delivery date is changed on the SO header and lines for the customer 70000 to a date that is 2 days later than 70001 (ie: 70000 delivery date is +32, while 70001 is +30) and an outbound is made, the system will still choose the SO with the customer that has greater priority, even though 70001 needs it sooner.<br />
<br />
Does this sound right to anyone?  If an item is outbounded to a Sales Order, the system will first look at customer priority rather than who has the closest delivery date?<br />
<br />
Just checking...:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice  testing!!1<br />
<br />
well i dont completly agree with you. as i belive any company will define it's priority Customer list after complete &amp; exhaustive brain stroming keeping past sales history or loyalty towards company in mind.<br />
<br />
So designating priority  is not relative to making delivery  schedules.<br />
<br />
it's more a stratigic decesion then operational decision.<br />
&amp; companies decide/review on it once or twice in year. <br />
<br />
as delivery date is something that so dynamic in nature &amp; changes so often that tracking it through pruiority is difficult in any scenario.<br />
<br />
there are other lot of parameters which you can prioratize your deliveries.<br />
<br />
well Baan is not so wrong  <br />
;) <br />
<br />
&amp; iam sure you are not planning/ executing deliveries though sales bound only <br />
you must be prioratizing them before running outbound  then running outbound.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sammeer</div><div class="date">5th April 2003, 06:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
in addition to above reply system selects sales order by Order number rather the priority allocated to it in customer master.<br />
so &quot;First come first serve&quot;.<br />
<br />
that,s why its always recommended to user to run Maintain outbound( selective) rather then generate outbound( multiple orders can be choosen here). <br />
<br />
so prioratizing customer for delivery is purely operational thing &amp; should not be mixed with priority defined in customer priority.<br />
<br />
it is significant in planning purpose &amp; drafting actual deliveries but not a alone factor for doing so.<br />
<br />
suppose as in your case you have single quantity but the customer 70001 is giving you more money then customer 70000  for early delivery would you like to generate outbound for 70000 or 70001????<br />
