<br />
does anyone know how to automatically adjust planned rpl order dates.<br />
<br />
This is the situation.  Say I have 5 in stock and a sales order for 5 with a planned delivery date of say 1 week later.  Someone then runs DRP for that item which has reached safety stock in a non-nettable warehouse.  Perhaps the safety stock level in that warehouse has just been changed.  There is no demand for that stock in the non-nettable warehouse.<br />
<br />
DRP will generate a planned RPL order with today's date.  After confirming and transferring it, it may be outbounded, picked and shipped, hence depriving the real sales order of that stock, with obvious consequences for the delivery of that order.<br />
<br />
Is it possible for DRP to date the planned order after the sales order - ie so that it won't steal the stock.<br />
<br />
Clearly, I can write a report to enable someone to modify the dates manually, but it will interrupt what I was hoping to be an automatic process.<br />
<br />
We are using Baan 4c4 and code is not a short-term option.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
