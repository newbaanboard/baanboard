Hi Dan,<br />
<br />
Funny you should ask, but I just finished putting together a quick solution that is working quite well for us.<br />
<br />
Starting at the Shipments (whinh4630m000) session, I customized a Print NAFTA Certificate of Origin session that prints the NAFTA document.<br />
<br />
We get the Item, Description, Country of Origin from the Items - General table and the harmonized tariff code is calculated based on the Item Group in the Items-General table. All of the coding is in the customized report script.<br />
<br />
I found the proper Tariff Codes for our products at http://www.foreign-trade.com/schedules.htm<br />
<br />
The NAFTA Certificate of Origin was designed using Hidox FormDesigner.<br />
<br />
Attached are screen shots.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps get you started.<br />
<br />
Mike</div></div><hr />
