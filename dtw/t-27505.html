In session whinh3522m000 when the approval is completed and saved, the orderline disappears immediately. Is there a way to change the approval once it is saved?  For example, in Baan IV, it is possible to change the approved quantity. (We have not implemented QMS.)<br />

Thanks,<br />

Why do you want to change the approved qty? If it was entered incorrectly then you can use the workaround of Purchase Returns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srikarthy</div><div class="date">26th July 2006, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Once we click approve without even entering the quantity, the session approves all the quantity in a receipt line which is fine since that will be the usual case. But if there occurs a single click by mistake, it has to be corrected through a return order. I was looking for some functionality similar to 'receipt corrections' which I might not be aware of and it seems there is no other alternative. Also I am yet to come out of thinking everything in terms of Baan IV. Thanks for the reply.<br />
