<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donaldreydia</div><div class="date">16th September 2014, 05:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi. I would like to ask why upon uploading csv file for sales order when released to warehousing, in the warehousing orders the sales orders are splitted. This occur when we save the csv file and the cursor is not on topmost of the file. That is my observation. May I know the real cause of the splitting. thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pointer position in your CSV file has nothing to do with the splitting of Orders. Check your data, there might be some differences which might be leading to create new sets. Also, I guess its a customized program, so ask for help from an IT guy and get it resolved.</div></div><hr />

We already checked the file and the same file we uploaded but pointer at the topmost and no splitting of files encountered.</div></div><hr />
