<br />
All we need is that we don't want to creat this transfer order without approval..<br />
<br />
<br />
any help please</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mohamed_alsadr</div><div class="date">29th August 2005, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Iam not sure about this, I can't see a session that can work as an approval in activities..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">29th August 2005, 11:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have access to BaanERP at the moment. But if you just go to the SO type editing screen and choose the sessions involved in processing that SO type, you'll see that you can add a session titled Release Manual Activities or something like that. You can only do it probably for new order type, not the one currently in use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mohamed_alsadr</div><div class="date">29th August 2005, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">If UR talking about tdsls4501m150, I've tried it but it give me this error &quot;Activity not allowed within sales order procedure&quot;..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">29th August 2005, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use manual activities in the order types session, just as Paul said. However, don't use the session code, but take a self-defined string like &quot;Approve Order&quot;.<br />
At the moment the sales order is ready for this activity you can go to session tdsls4501m150 (Release Manual Activities). Search for the activity &quot;Approve Order&quot; and select the sales order and via specific menu option you can release the manual activity.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't find what UR talking about..<br />
<br />
I am using Baan V.0c SP15 without any localization... if that matter..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">30th August 2005, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using also the standard version.<br />
I attached a screenshot with the manual activity.<br />
And also a screenshot of the release manual activity session, with the manual activity in it.<br />
May be that will help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mohamed_alsadr</div><div class="date">30th August 2005, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Evert-jan and Paul for your help,,<br />
This sure would help me solving some problems..<br />
<br />
Back to my main question..may be I wasn't clear about it.. once I choose generate transfer order (In case the quantity available is less than required), it is created automatically and appears in warehouse orders.. I want to block that transfer order or have an approval step for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">30th August 2005, 10:42</div></div><div class="posttext">That transfer session (tdsls4504m000 - overview and tdsls4242s000 - details) cannot be part of the order type procedure. I'm afraid, a manual activity in the order types will not help you.<br />
<br />
May be you can set user authorizations on that transfer session and assign a specific person that will handle the generation of transfer orders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mohamed_alsadr</div><div class="date">30th August 2005, 10:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank U Evert-Jan..<br />
I think we gonna use User authorizations</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">30th August 2005, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Succes with implementing!</div></div><hr />
