You can also try the same. <br />
<br />
Pl. go to session tgbrg0530m000 &quot;Enterprise Units&quot;<br />
<br />
Select the enterprise unit that was linked to your Warehouse entered in your Order line.<br />
<br />
Go to specific and choose &quot;Entities by Enterprise Unit&quot;<br />
<br />
You should see all the enities linked to that Enterprise unit including your Warehouse in your order line.<br />
<br />
If you do not see any enities, that is the root cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
There is a work around solution to solve this situation.<br />
<br />
Delete the subject Enterprise unit  (system will allow this as it was not linked to any entities)<br />
<br />
Add the Enterprise unit with the same code again.<br />
<br />
you will see all entities now and you may not get the error messages any more<br />
