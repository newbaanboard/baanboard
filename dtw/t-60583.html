<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kogelman</div><div class="date">24th May 2011, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">We have sales items which can produced in two plants with different boms, routings, costprices etc.<br />
<br />
We are thinking about the following solution to get this working :<br />
In supplying relations we connect Receiving Item SALESITEM in cluster A to supplying item PRODUCTIONITEMPLANTA in cluster A and SALESITEM in cluster B to PRODUCTIONITEMPLANTB in cluster B<br />
<br />
When we sell 20 SALESITEMS from a warehouse in cluster A, a distribution order is generated for the need of PRODUCTIONITEMPLANTA, so far it works.<br />
<br />
The problem is that in our plant the production doesnot follow the exact demand from sales and on a regular base have overproduction.<br />
<br />
So if we produce 22, the distibution order can be finished and 20 items are booked from sales to production, but 2 are left as PRODUCTIONITEMPLANTA<br />
<br />
Now we are looking for a method to transfer the stock of production items to the sales items automatically. In principle the production item and the sales item are the same and it's a big disadvantage to have stock registered on 2 items.<br />
<br />
I' amazed that all stock transactions are based on pull methods and I cannot find any push method at all.<br />
<br />
All ideas are welcome !! I'm stuck on this one.</div></div><hr />
