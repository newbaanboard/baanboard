Yes, you can implement web-based solution between Industry and Business Partner. By implementing this solution, It is expected also to reduce the order processing time, acknowledgement process, and other modification. This solution will ease communication unswervingly to and from ERP system.</div></div><hr />

You have to do some customisation in your BaaN system that should be linked with web-based application with user &amp; password.<br />
I do not have documents for the same at present.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">18th August 2009, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan IV I can do this in folllowig way<br />
<br />
1. Decide on template what supplier will be sending<br />
2. send the information to supplier via email<br />
3. Supplier sends back the information via email<br />
4. Read the emai attachment<br />
5. Convert the attacment into ASCII file<br />
6. Baan reads the ASCII file <br />
7. Update the table e.g. planned SIC order or planned MRP order table whichever one decides<br />
8. Confirm and transfer the orders<br />
9. PO would be created. Send email to concerned buyer of the new PO or PO changes<br />
<br />
These all steps can be automatedm but of course would need some kind of customizatio. We have already done this.<br />
For reading email attachment we use the ability of our EDI s/w, which can read email attachment and can transalate it into any format, thus theortically we can handle different format per supplier. This is not the most efficient way, but it will work and it doesn't require any technological invesment for us as all the techonolgy we have was in place.<br />
