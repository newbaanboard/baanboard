<br />
I was wondering, is there a way in Baan IV c3/4 that we can close an order?<br />
<br />
I know that we can not modify header or line that had been shipped and invoiced, but that does not prevent adding more lines into an order.<br />
<br />
Bottom line:<br />
Once an order had been shipped and invoiced, can we prevent the addition of sales order lines?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the thoughts.<br />

<br />
I don't know if that is a preferred approach though. I think the ability to add order lines even though the order is fully processed is often a business requirement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">23rd July 2002, 09:56</div></div><div class="posttext">This is std. functionality to add lines after delivery. You will have to remove the header via process delivered purchase orders. The option delte will remove the header if the financial transactions have been completed. You will still see the info in the history table (tdpur051) but will remove from tdpur040. The problem is that the order will be available untill you can delete it.</div></div><hr />

How does one cancel a SO in BaaN IV? I know it is available in BaaN V.<br />
The order is available till the session Process Delivered Sales Order is run wherein we have the option of deleting the order.</div></div><hr />

flip_j is talking about Purchase Orders.  I think  the other guys are talking about sales.  Tdiciple???  Which do you mean?  <br />
During Process Delivered sales orders there is an option to delete the order?  Does this leave the order history intact???  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">24th July 2002, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">The functionality is exactly the same for sales and purchase orders. The problem with the original question is that you can still add new lines before the order is deleted from the operational tables after finance is processed.  This solution will work if this time is short enough to solve your problem. The orders deleted from the operational table but will remain in the history table for reporting.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
I have just created a sales order without lines and deleted it. When I went to history, Iit doesn't exist. Can someone shed some light since I am trying to find some orders which does not exist or deleted.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
with SP 16 and higher in Baan IVc4 the delete option in sessions tdsls/pur4223m000 is removed and new sessions tdsls/pur4227m000 are available for deleting OR archiving Sales / purchase orders.<br />
<br />
Before deleting the orders, be sure that it is allowed to delete.<br />
In Germany it is not allowed to delete an order until 10 years old (because of &quot;GDPdU&quot;).<br />
Therefor SSA has created the new sessions.<br />
The &quot;old&quot; session have become new options!<br />
For the same reason the sessions tdsls/pur5201m000 are change, too.<br />
For deleting or archiving sales/purchase order history new sessions are availble: tdsls/pur5202m000.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

Check for it there <br />
<br />
Hope your problem for finding the deleted SOCs is resolved<br />
