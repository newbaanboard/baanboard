<br />
We are on Baan IVc4 NAS0, SQL database, SP19.<br />
<br />
I have a question regarding the copy PO session.  It allows you to enter a planned delivery date &quot;to&quot; when you are copying. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know a way to trigger it to just use the dates of the copied PO?  It seems it would just copy everything including the planned delivery dates and you could change them accordingly (if applicable), but it just makes all lines have the same date as you entered it on the copy session.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling it's just standard Baan functionality, but wanted to ask.  I guess throughout the years we haven't found this to be an issue until now.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</div></div><hr />
