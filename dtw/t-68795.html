<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pillai.ganesh</div><div class="date">7th April 2016, 09:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a scenario where my Buyer has a PR for 10 different items. All the 10 Items are supposed to be approved. <br />
But only 6 items need to be convert to a Purchase Order Today. For the rest 4 items he wants to create a separate PO in the next week. (There can be many reasons for this requirement of his.)<br />
<br />
I see that in session&quot;Prepare Conversion&quot;; Buyer has to convert all the lines together. i.e. he cannot select lines that he wants to convert to PO.<br />
<br />
Is this option parametrised? Or is it that the system doesn't allow this at all.<br />
Please suggest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pillai.ganesh</div><div class="date">20th April 2016, 07:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the help Sir Benito &amp; Bruning!! I had tried those options and found the below behavior-<br />
1. Convert will give error &amp; not create PO for any line, if we do not fill Supplier for even a single line.  Thus we cannot create PO even for the lines that we want to convert.<br />
2.  We do not have a Status called &quot;Approved&quot; in the PR line level. While u can reject a line by going to detail session of the PR line.... Approval is the process on the full PR. i.e. All the non rejected lines will get approved.<br />
<br />
I studied all the parameters, to see if this behavior can be changed. But couldnt find the Parameter for this... So was wondering if this is a short coming of PR functionality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in short you are right, it is shortfall of PR functionality that you can convert specific lines from PR to PO and balance you can hold for next time.<br />
in this case the only workaround is possible to convert few line of PR to PO by providing supplier code and balance line to convert into RFQ so next time you can confirm the RFQ and proceed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Line level conversion of requisition lines is limitation in LN. But we can customize this functionality by using add on tables and user exits on standard table. If you are interested in customization, I can share document.<br />
