<br />
This problem is related to ERP LN 6.1 FP2 &amp; Warehousing. Please refer the screen shots attached herewith for further elaborate the problem in detail.<br />
<br />
1)Please note that, a Purchase Order of 10 nos is placed for an item. And this is released to warehousing.<br />
2)There is NO Hard Stop on Quantity in Purchase  Itemdata for this item. Hence I can accept more quantity than the ordered quantity.<br />
3)Now against 10 nos Ordered Quantity, exactly 10 nos are delivered by the Supplier.<br />
4)Now this 10 nos Quantity is accepted &amp; Receipt is maintained in session Warehouse Receipts ( whinh3512m000/ whinh3112s000 ). Technically the order is completed because all the quantity is delivered. Hence system shows TICK mark for Final Receipt.<br />
5)But the End User manually removes this TICK mark for Final Receipt while completing the Receipt. The Line is kept open, for receipt of material against this line on later date.<br />
6)The transaction is completed.<br />
<br />
7)Now because of the Line kept open, the Status of the lines is shown as PARTIALLY for warehouse receipt in Purchase Inbound Stauts. i.e. the line is still open<br />
8)And because of this the Purchase activities can not be completed further. Print Purchase Invoices can not be RUN. And PDPO for this order can not be done.<br />
9)Now I dont want to receive material against this pending line. I WANT TO CLOSE this line and complete the Purchase Order.<br />
10)HOW SHOULD I CLOSE THIS LINE ? This is my main problem.<br />
<br />
Because of the extra curricular activities of the key users, there is problem in the system, the orders can not be completed now, and I need to complete the order &amp; close the same. I am unable to find a way out to do the same. There are a few cases as such pending in the system, and I need to clean these cases.<br />
<br />
Please work it out at your end, and please reply with solution to do the same.<br />
Thanking you.<br />

<br />
The only way (as far as I know) is to make another receipt with zero quantity (becouse you already received all quantity - not final receipt) and approve this new one. Anyway this is the way also when you received partially quantity and don't want to receive anymore.<br />

I do agree with what Lidia has suggested and tick te check box complete your &quot;Awaiting Receipts-warehouse&quot; step in your purchase order will  be marked as Done.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I would suggest to use session Receipt Correction &quot;whinh3121s000&quot;. You can goto this session via specific -&gt; Correction -&gt; correction receipt line. It will solve your problem.<br />
<br />

Please note that,<br />
1) While making entry in Receipt, the Final Receipt check tick was removed &amp; then the Receipt Line was CONFIRMED.<br />
2) Now after this Receipt line is confirmed, if I go in this Receipt Line (whinh3512m000)&amp; TRY to do Receipt Correction &quot;whinh3121s000&quot;. via specific -&gt; Correction -&gt; correct receipt line.<br />
Then in that case this subsession is already deactivated. I am not able to open this subsession.<br />
Please let me know, if I am following correct path as suggested by you.<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
We are also running with LN6.1 FP2, the same as yours.</div></div><hr />
