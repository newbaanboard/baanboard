<br />
I do not know how to solve the following issue :<br />
<br />
1- I created a sales order with 1 line (maintain sales order)<br />
2- I delivered this line with outbound (generate/release outbound)<br />
3- I invoiced this line (print invoice - final = &quot;yes&quot;)<br />
<br />
Then I realized the delivered and invoiced quantity was not correct, and needs to reduced. How to change that ?<br />
<br />
Can I cancel the invoice and the delivery ? How to proceed ?<br />
I tried to put a new line in the sales order with a negative quantity, but I am not able to generate an outbound to balance my inventory.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you have already shipped and invoiced the sales order you cannot add a new sales order line to that same sales order to reverse the situation.<br />
This has to do with the different statuses in Distribution and financial integration transactions in BAAN IV.<br />
<br />
You need to create a return sales order with the exact same quantity, sales price and amount, make a receipt and then process the invoice.<br />
Once the reverse has taken place you have to create a new 'regular' sales order and put the right quantity on the sales order line. Then ship and invoice.<br />
<br />
I know this is a long process but the cleanest way to keep everything in order in the system.<br />
<br />

Relevant status is on line-level not on order level so this should still be possible.<br />
For creating the reverse outbound, you have to insert a record using the maintain-session: generate a reverse outbound doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">18th April 2006, 08:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan sales order session has 'copy' faciltiy that makes this really easy for users to create a (in this case ) reversal order.  <br />
<br />
The copy function can be invoked  from the 'edit' menu and will use either the history or the actual delivery details for the copy.  If a 'return' type order is specified the order will be a return (credit)<br />
<br />
This transaction also record the return order number in the sales order line item table to provide a cross reference.</div></div><hr />
