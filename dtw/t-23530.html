<br />
I encountered a problem in distribution that some items are stucked at rec location and we are unable to transfer into gen location because these items are showing allocation in rec location when I cleared the allocation from the table then now I am able to transfer that item in gen location.<br />
I want to know the root cause of this problem why the item is stucked in particular location.<br />
<br />
please revert me soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Or it could be a transfer order was done half way.</div></div><hr />
