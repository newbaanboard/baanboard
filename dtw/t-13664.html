<br />
Question: in my company we mainly use customised items (generic configured) manufactured with a project. One project corresponds to one Sales Order. At the end we pack different projects/sales orders in one packet.<br />
<br />
Now we are trying to sell standard items. We have realised that BaaN is not able to connect the sales order with the manufactured standard item.<br />
<br />
Do you know if there is any functionality in the standard BaaN IVc4 which is able to solve our problem? If not, any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

After extensive research I'm afraid the answer is NO using standadr functioality. I'm sure you know that you can launch a work order for a standard item from the sales order. However there is no link created on either side (sales of shop floor). The only way to do it that we're aware of is to pass through projects just as you said.<br />
Sorry!</div></div><hr />
