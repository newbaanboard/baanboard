<br />
Recently we upgraded to SP2 with some additional solutions.<br />
<br />
I am getting error &quot;Cannot switch to company 0&quot; when I try to confirm a shipment line. Sometimes this happens when I am trying to confirm a Receipt.<br />
<br />
Any idea what could be the problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks a heap in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somehow BaaN is trying to probably get some info from 000 co. like user name based on login code etc etc &amp; you probably dont have permission to switch to 000 .... not sure about it since it should have thrown a fatal error <br />
<br />
Are you getting a fatal error or a baan message box ? Is the problem happening occasionaly or everytime.<br />
<br />
At this point i feel you should report it to BaaN, since it appears to be a BUG based on initial decription you provided in your post.<br />
<br />

<br />
This could be e.g. the business unit or the warehouse (table tcmcs003).<br />
<br />
The Select uses this company field to query the correct LN company.<br />
<br />
Can you please check e.g. Session tgbrg0530m000 or related Tables for handling the receipt if there is a field for company having a &quot;0&quot; value and possible change this to your correct logistic company e.g. &quot;100&quot;.<br />
<br />
You can get some related tables with &lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;SHIFT&gt;+8.<br />
<br />

<br />
The problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
After SP2, we found that there is a field in whinh200 which is office company. This was not updated properly with the company number and was 0. For new orders it was okay, but for the existing orders it was giving error.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your suggestions and help.</div></div><hr />
