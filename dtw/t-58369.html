<br />
is this still a problem? Indeed, it is possible that you face data corruption, but it is more likely that you miss a solution. I think this problem is software related.<br />
<br />
Can you let me know which FP you are on? Kindly also post the complete error message (the part [last function ..] is missing.</div></div><hr />

Please check the cost component of the item your using in Item purchase  sub entities and  in item costing data in manufacturing module.<br />
<br />
In the both positions the cost component should be same..<br />
<br />
And also raise the  ticket to Infor...<br />
