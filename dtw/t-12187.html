<br />
<br />
Scenario is as below.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) defining the items by cost set and cost set by purchase list and supplier is done.<br />
2) the parameter &quot;Automatic Recalculation of Additional Costs &quot; is set to automatic in tdpur4100m000<br />
3) set up two customised items with different suppliers.<br />
4) Sales orders inserted for both the customised items.<br />
5) PRP is run to generate the demand<br />
6) Planned PRP purchase orders are confirmed and transferred to purchase<br />
<br />
Problem - If there are 2 purchase orders generated, the additional costs is only added to the 2nd PO and not the first. Just to generalise, the additional costs are added to only the last PO.<br />
<br />
Any clues?</div></div><hr />
