<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VilasoorRavi</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 12:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We are having products relating to multiple divisions but within one BaaN company.  These products relating to multiple divisions are sometimes supplied to one customer.  We would like to get the details of the outstandings by division(each division invoices separately) as well as total outstanding of the customer, for credit control purposes.<br />
<br />
Similarly, one division of ours maybe supplying to different divisions of the same customer.  Here, the customer requires separate division-based invoices.  Here also, we would like to get the outstandings by customer's divisions as well as total outstandings.<br />
<br />
Can some one help me on this?<br />
<br />
tks and rgds,<br />

I am currently on V - it has been over 5 years since i used IV.  But, in V and I believe I recall it being there in IV as well, there is provision for setting up a parent/child relationship in the Customer.  In V this is in the Business Partner master (V combines the old Customer and Supplier masters into single BP file).  In IV this would be in the Customer Master.  Each of your 'divisions' can be linked to a parent and then you can write reports based on the parent</div></div><hr />

<br />
U can use Sales rep as one of the workarounds. If possible can you define diff sales rep for diff segments.<br />
<br />
If this is possible, u can get the desired results through standard Ageing report, I Think.<br />
