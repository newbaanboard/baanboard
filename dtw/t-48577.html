<br />
lately encounter an industry that they mainly do recycling work, doing some research and was thinking how to handle this kind of environment.<br />
<br />
example: they have a purchase item, let's say item-a with weight of 100kgs in item data and keep in the form on roll.<br />
<br />
the storage unit can also be roll/sheet/carton etc and when the actual goods arrive it will definately have variance in the weight. eg:<br />
<br />
receive item-a <br />
2 rolls in 105kgs<br />
3 rolls in 98kgs<br />
<br />
ps: item-a weight only know during receiving and not during issuing po. item-a will than be use as raw mat for their production hence the weight figure is important to be distinguish for each receiving items.<br />
<br />
is there any standard functionality in ln to handle this kind of case? <br />
any ideas will be much appreciated, i can test it out. <br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />

You could get these items to be lot-controlled by using the Lot Control option in Baan where-in you could individually define each rolls..<br />
For E.g:<br />
Item A - Lot 1 - 100kg<br />
Item A - Lot 2 - 105kg<br />
...<br />

<br />
Another easier way other than Lot is , i feel we can use different storage unit like rol1 , rol2 etc and one inventory unit kg so we can have different conversion factors and the costing / accounting part will be taken care. Never tried this but just an idea.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

I think so maintaining new unit for each new entry and maintaining conversion will not be feasible in dat-to-day scenarion<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Eden</div><div class="date">10th April 2008, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest you inventory the item in weight rather than rolls or any other unit. That way you would be able to receive the actual quantity.<br />
<br />
LN does not allow you to define a storage unit the way it was in earlier versions, so the alternative to this is to use lot control if you need to know how many units are in stock (how many lots)<br />

Paul is right.<br />
For more information, at one of our clients place, CRCA Rolls are used for manufacturing.<br />
So the Purchasing, Inventory &amp; Issue to production is done in base unit of &quot;kgs&quot; only. Normally the supply comes in the form of ROLL only, but transactions are done in Kgs only.<br />
Generally in these industries, what matters most is Rate in Rs/ 1 Kg of CRCA, hence its only feasible to control it that way. The weight variation per ROLL dont matter much, as we pay against the actual weight. Also for added working, the Suppliers are instructed ( out of Baan ) to Supply the material in size ( outer dia/ inner dia/ reqd width ) &amp; the weight ( 250 Kgs minimum ). Its working fine.<br />
