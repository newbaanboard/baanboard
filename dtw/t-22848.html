<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danny Leolux</div><div class="date">13th January 2005, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">When performing a slow moving analysis (tdinv6220m000) we experience the following problem:<br />
<br />
For new items that have stock but hardly any requirement yet the analysis results in a &quot;slow-moving&quot; qualification.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
New item A was purchased on stock 100 pcs<br />
Sales orders for 5 pcs have been entered<br />
Slow moving analysis calculates: turnover = cumm. requirement / stock<br />
<br />
In this case turnover = 5/100 results in a slow-moving qualification???<br />
This although the item is brand new !!!<br />
<br />
This results in a slow-moving overview that is polluted by new items.<br />
<br />
Has anyone any idea how to avoid this ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would expect that item usage of new items is extrapolated. If e.g. in the last 4 months the item usage is 5, then the expected annual usage is 5 / 4 * 12 = 15.<br />
<br />
For the slow moving analysis at least three periods of issue must be present. If not, the Expected Annual Issue of the Item master or Item/Warehouse master is used.<br />
<br />
If this does not work it seems to be wrong to me.</div></div><hr />

Thank you Kees,<br />

You are right, Baan IV handles new items (uptill 3 periodes) differently in the Slow moving analysis. Then instead of the actual issue the expected annual issue from tiitm001 is taken. This solves my problem (that actually never really existed  :o ).<br />
