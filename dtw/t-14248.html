<br />
BaaN Vc<br />
----------<br />
<br />
My field confirm backorders automatically is set to 'Yes' in sales order parameters.<br />
I make a Sales order line for a cost item for a qty of 10 hrs, then in the session Release to Invoicing, I put delivered qty as 5, the system asks if backorder should be created and if I give &quot;yes&quot;, still no backorder is created. Moreover in the session 'Maintain and Confirm Backorders', this record does not show up. The back order field in the session tdsls4510m000 also shows zero, while the ord qty and del qty value is correct. I do not have any shipping constraints also.<br />
<br />
Have I missed out on some parameter? or something else?<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please make sure that confirm backorder automatically is set to &quot;yes&quot; in sales order parameter.<br />
<br />
I have tried with both scenario and it works.<br />
<br />
For automatic backorder:<br />
System will automatically create one new line in the session release to invoice as soon as I release to invoice the line which has qty delivered &lt; qty order.<br />
<br />
For manual backorder:<br />
System will not create any record in the session release to invoice after I release to invoice.<br />
Run session maintain and confirm backorder, select the order line and click &quot;confirm&quot; from specific menu.  Then, system will automatically create 1 new record for the remaining qty as holdback order.<br />
<br />

Thanks for your reply. Ideally it should work the way you have said. But I am not getting it. I am wondering if this could be due to some missing patch as I have tried umpteen angles and somehow the backorder does not appear at all. and yes, my sales order parameter is set to Confirm backorders automatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitting</div><div class="date">14th July 2005, 06:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the reason of cost item</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is also another factor coming into play in this automatic back order creation thingy. If in the sales order, the delivery constraint was set to single delivery only, then even if you do just one partial delivery, BaanERP will not let you make any more delivery for the particular SO line. Worth checking that out<br />
<br />
The cost item thing possibility that kitting suggested should not have been a problem, I think<br />

<br />
Actually the problem got solved by itself. I am wondering how.....<br />

I currently work for (B4c4) has some customization in process to confirm backorders automatically in combination with SSA WMS 4000...........</div></div><hr />
