We need to use the EDI functionality DELJIT and DELFOR message<br />
<br />
          We r evaluating for an automotive client which Baan product version would suit the best.<br />
<br />
We have minimal documentation...<br />
  Out of which we infer that Baan4 AGS  is not MCR compliant...<br />
Could any one give some insight if MCR is supported in Baan4 AGS0 or AGS2?</div></div><hr />

Right now I believe the only option is baan IV ags</div></div><hr />

  I had spoken to SSA Support but could not get very clear answers.<br />
Purchase and sales schedules are supported in Ln. They could not clarify if the DEFOR can be supported. <br />
  Does any one has the EDI information for LN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">19th March 2005, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I previously posted a document about AGS on the thread below<br />

<br />
I believe you are out of luck with MCR and AGS. MCR is a seperate extension that is a layer over standard baan IV functionality in the same why as AGS but the two extensions cannot be used at the same time.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is supported.<br />
<br />
 We need to use the EDI functionality DELJIT and DELFOR message <br />
Is available in the BEMIS format.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is BEMIS format? Is it capable of handling ODETTE standard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">23rd March 2005, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">BEMIS stands for: Baan Electronic Message Interchange System.<br />
<br />
SSA defined an internal standard which is used for SSA's EDI Business Documents (Inhouse Standard). The EDI Translator Software converts SSAs internal standard to an external standard like UN/EDIFACT or ODETTE.</div></div><hr />

The support centre does not have enough knowledge..... on Ln<br />
  They should be fast , the product has been released quite some time back, and as the speed matters for most customers....they wud lose customers....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">5th April 2005, 09:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Difficult to react on this.<br />
<br />
I think the knowledge of the support centers is oke when it comes to standard procedures. Purchase and sales schedules is brand new in LN. May be that's the reason why you say support centers don't have enough knowledge and documentation is not available.<br />
<br />
One question: did you see already the SSA Web Help? I think that can you help a lot.<br />

<br />
  The said solution is released but it can not be downloaded....<br />
Who is facing the pains... the customer....<br />
   The documentation for EDI and most other packages for LN are not yet available...<br />
  It really becomes difficult to work with a product which does not have enough documentation....</div></div><hr />
