<br />
Baan sasy this should only be run for sreious problems, but we end up running it all the time. I figure might as well run it as a job weekly.<br />
<br />
We are on 5b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">18th January 2002, 09:23</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a good idea to run this session in a job at night on a regular basis. Typically it solves a lot of problems. <br />
<br />
In BaanIV the session you mentioned is tdinv0250m000, but there is also check inventory data tdinv0252m000 which you can run in the job as well with 'adjust' set to yes.<br />
ilc users should also include rebuild inventory data (tdilc0250m000).<br />
<br />
I've found it extremely useful to run these in jobs regularly (when no-one logged in) - especially on older versions of Baan. In theory they shouldn't be necessary or a lot of the problems they solve could be solved by installing patches / SPs.<br />
<br />
Not sure why Baan should recommend against this. Perhaps someone else could shed some light on the subject?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sturla</div><div class="date">18th January 2002, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Jason, run the rebuild session on a regular basis.<br />
There is some problems, and thats maybe the reason that Baan don't recomend to run it without serious problems in the system.<br />
<br />
I know companies using the A&amp;D extention have had problems using the rebuild sessions, because they have to generata a new PRP (TP) after rebuilding, and that can cause problems. There have also been bugs in the A&amp;D extention, that have made new problems instead of solving them. <br />
Companies using PCS/PRP should do the same (run PRP after rebuilding), but they very often avoid to run PRP on regular basis, and skip the rebuilding.<br />
On older versions of Baan IV, I have seen that tdinv0250m000 have made serious damage if special choises have been used at sales order lines (phantom item at the line and issue components). This have caused a lot of negative allocations on items, that sholdn't have been there. I don't know why. This bug is solved in c4.<br />
Another reason to not run the rebuild is as Jason say, you have to do it when everyone is logged out. That is a problem for companies working 24 h a day or multi site environments having users all over the world (also working 24 h a day).</div></div><hr />

<br />
We tend to run it when we find problems prior to raising a case with Baan support and 9 times out of 10 it solves the problem and a case does not have to be raised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sturla</div><div class="date">18th January 2002, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not surprised, Jenny.<br />
<br />
The most common recommendation I give my clients when they call me and have a problem is &quot;Run tdinv0250m000, Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">21st January 2002, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We just went through a very painful issue <br />
where planned inventory movements were not being <br />
created correctly.  tdinv0250 was not working properly as well,<br />
it was not correcting errors in the planned inv movements.<br />
<br />
We updated tdinv0250, (Baan IV c4)<br />
with solution 156388, and that really helped, now the rebuild<br />
is working correctly, and we have been able to solve the<br />
root issue as well.<br />
<br />
Planned inventory problems are very tricky / difficult to solve.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francoisp</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 04:45</div></div><div class="posttext">As John mentionned, make sure you have the lastest solution installed. In Baan 5c, we found out the hard way that it was not considering Purchase Quotation during the rebuild process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought that we had solved our root problem, and Baan had stopped generating negative planned inventory movements for production issues.<br />
<br />
It has come back.<br />
So when you report production, it takes some of the items from the estimated materials, and creates negative planned inventory issues against these items.  It only occurs on about 50 different items, and I can not find anything consistant with these items as to why this is happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 21:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Detailed Report <br />
<br />
I know BAAN created a detail report for session &quot;Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions&quot; (whinp1200m000) in the BaanERP versions: B50b and B50c. <br />
<br />
This extra report shows information on order line level, not only total changes. If incorrect planned inventory transactions do occur, use of the detail report easily leads to root causes.<br />
<br />
The detail report was delivered with solution 114784 in May 2001.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 14:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Please keep this discussion clean. <br />
<br />
The original problem was reported in b50_b so all replies should be related to session whinp1200m000 (Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions) in either b50_b or b50_c.<br />
If there are any problems/issues/remarks with session  tdinv0250m000 (Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions) in b40_b and/or b40_c please create a new thread for that.<br />
<br />
The way Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions is handled in b50 is different from b40.<br />
<br />
One more advise: be careful running whinp1200m000 in b50 because in the past there were re-occurring bugs in this session  causing negative planned transactions. So, the more often you ran it the more problems you were getting. Even double allocations were created by it.<br />
These bugs were especially an issue in b50_b.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">16th April 2002, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Edwin<br />
<br />
I respect your comments re keeping it clean but as half the posts concern 4X and the rest 5x , can you as moderator create and re-post to a 4X thread ?<br />
<br />
This is a Baan problem which they must fix . <br />
<br />
They (Baan) did agree this as far as 4Cx was concerned and at a Tech Sig meeting in the UK today it was reported some &quot;tests&quot; were taking place in a user site on some of the issues, so progress is being made.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of any commitment from Baan to resolve the issue in 5x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">9th October 2002, 10:03</div></div><div class="posttext">After a gap of some months ----<br />
Baan recommended for us to install 5 solutions namely<br />
<br />
125678<br />
158556<br />
158136<br />
121365<br />
158441<br />
<br />
These we are in the course of testing . These solutions of recent release probably aim to tie up the loose ends on the various sessions concerned<br />
<br />
Incidentally does anyone know of a reason why on the report Changes in Planned Inventory by Warehouse we should get a list of items with all the &quot;changes&quot; with a value of zero  ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">2nd December 2002, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone else recently upgraded from Baan 4c4 SP? to SP9 ?<br />
<br />
If so have they come across an &quot;apparent&quot; change to how the<br />
tdinv0250 session now runs ?<br />
<br />
In our company the factory areas run 24 hrs 4 days and sometimes at the weekend so we obviously have problems in running this session when no-one is using Baan . This has not created any any issues for us &quot;runtime error&quot; wise under SP 4 thru SP8 but having upgraded to SP9 we find we get some Error 100 s the job failing after 10 retires.and runtime errors<br />
As this is a &quot;pre&quot; MRP job the consequences are serious<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we have found this error 100 even if &quot;it appears&quot; users are just logged on having left their session open and gone home.<br />
<br />
In our operational circumstances this is not &quot;friendly&quot; and creates a problem for us.<br />
<br />
However it would have been nice if Baan had included something about it in their documentation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rseguire</div><div class="date">18th December 2002, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">How long does this session take to run on average. Baan 4c4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">18th December 2002, 19:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously it should depend upon the number of records in the various tables , I guess but the run times on 2 different coys vary<br />
from 1 hour 10mins to 1 hour 45 with the shortest being 28 minutes .<br />
<br />
As all the Jobs run times were staggeringly shorter on this weekend we put it down to the fact we had rebooted the server late on Friday evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AW_Cal</div><div class="date">23rd July 2003, 03:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone experience running this session (whinp1200m000) in Baan 5c?  <br />
<br />
We have quite a few invalid planned inventory transactions.  I have used the session for identified problems on an item by item basis and did not experience any incorrect results, but I'm a bit hesitant in running it wide open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">23rd July 2003, 05:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
What you can do initially is to run the session wide open without the &quot;Update&quot; box checked.<br />
Then you can verify whether the results look good and run the session again with the &quot;Update&quot; box checked.<br />
<br />
Based on my experience in b50_c you should have no problems running it wide open.<br />
It may be a good idea to make sure you have loaded the latest solution available for whinp1200.<br />
<br />
