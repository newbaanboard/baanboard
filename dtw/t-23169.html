We have general customer numbers for these kind of sales orders and we want to use one default customer per showroom. We use one Baan account (login) per showroom.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have a default customer per login in this situation to enable even more easy order entry, without doing any programming ?<br />

Many thanks in advance,<br />

Perhaps you could try to freeze defaults once by using the option in the menu (Menu-&gt;Option-&gt;Save/Get defaults)</div></div><hr />

Thnx Renegade for the provided sessions.<br />
Though it might lead to tremendous workload for admins, it's a nice option to stay in control of business with more then 1 production line, each with seperated and dedicated sales/production/engineering and scm-teams, always complaining about &quot;who the  :mad: changed my orders/items/etc.<br />

Thanks for the replies sofar, but this is not what I'm looking for. Sure I can limit users by entering (ranges of) data in the session mentioned, but my goal is to assist the user not limit.<br />
<br />
I also tried the mentioned User Defaults but this doesn't work unfortunately.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a default customer in the field tdsls040.cuno of session tdsls4101s100 (whole sales functionality) per login. Preferably without any programming (sinds this is a standard Baan session).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
I faced a similar situation during one of my implementations. I made the procedure a little simple by having the code of the business partner in single digit. Eg. 1 or 2 etc. This made the job of the user easier by just clicking a single key.</div></div><hr />

If u wish the  that user is not able to change the customer , then set attr.input to false in zoom program and export it .</div></div><hr />

Sometime the solution lies in doing a simple customization and not worry about work around. All you need is table like Customer by login or Cutomer by showroom etc. You can customize the order entry screen to get the customer from the custom table. It would be a simple customization, but I think this will be the simplest working solution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jan van dillen</div><div class="date">23rd February 2005, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Wouldn't is be possible to define per user login the data in session ' Maintain Defaults by User (Sales)' (tdsls4123m000)?<br />
In that way you can define for each user the default order type, warehouse, order series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">23rd February 2005, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The good news is that it is not a major operation, the bad news is that it involves a crucial Baan session, so customization of the original session is not an option.<br />
<br />
To avoid problems with future updates on your sales order entry sessions and still keep development efforts low, your best bet is to create an alternative sales order session that addresses the original functionality through API.</div></div><hr />

Hi Everyone,<br />
<br />
thanks for all your input. I like Hitesh Shah's suggestion best sofar. Su much that I tried it out. I copied the form to our customisation VRC and changed the field concerned to autozoom. I created a (very simple) session based on the mentioned example and made the autozoom of the field zoom to it.<br />
<br />
It works !! BUT it created a new problem. When returning from this zoom session and returning the found customercode to the formfield (tdsls040.cuno) I'm no longer able to change the value without getting an error message. This ttstps0105 error message seems to been a standard tools error saying 'Customer not present in table &quot;deliveryaddresses&quot; '.<br />
Somehow I have caused a referential problem by filling the formfield via the autozoom, it seems.<br />
<br />
A mind boggling one huh ? <br />
<br />
Anyone any idea how to solve this? Many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th February 2005, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to be some data specific issue . If u can elaborate (like  old value , new value , on changing or on adding etc ) , probably somebody can help.<br />
<br />
Technically what u r doing is just automation and not process customization. So the same error should come when inputting /changing the same manually.</div></div><hr />

Like Francesco said, it is still a customization. And that too the components of a key session in Baan is being copied to a new VRC. Along with these comes new headache in the form of patching in the future as Baan comes up with new solutions.<br />
<br />
Best would be not to copy this session components but go for an entirely new Sales Order session. Even here as Baan beings in any functional enhancement in Sales Order, You will have to do the same in duplicated session.<br />
<br />
Just a hint of things to come !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">28th February 2005, 13:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Danny,<br />
I am not sure what issues you have with customizations. You can always use product like Qkey that removes any headache of adding patches to your programs. In such product you never touch the source and still be able to customize the current program. I assumed you are on Baan IV, so there is no major upgrade now. We don't onw the source code of Baan and we have more than 300 customization and we aremoving to Baan IVC4 frpm IVc3. And I have no issues with source customization. I have done many table changes and that is what I have to concentrate- no biggy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">28th February 2005, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, yes I agree with Arvind - the wrapper programs would let you add this validation without modifying the standard code (or even having the source).  I would mention that besides QKEY from Fullscope (http://www.fullscope.com/) , there is also our product - RMCgen, from RMCis (http://www.rmcis.com).  Also, there is the freeware wrapper program on these boards - search for 'rush' in the Code and Utilities section.  The freeware is nice, it does the job.  The supported versions (QKEY and RMCgen) come with additional tools to use during upgrade (at least I will assume that QKEY does...)<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
