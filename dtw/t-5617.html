They would also like one summary ASN showing all items shipped for each day.  Is this possible?  I believe it would still be acceptable to have the individual packing slips and ASN's along with the 'master' or summary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
is your customer using Transportation? <br />
We solved almost the same problem with the help of Transportation and a small customized report.<br />

This will combine multiple shipments under one load thus one packing slip.</div></div><hr />

I know this is sort of a tangent as PremDev is in 4c4, but are you sure you can produce one packing slip per load? Is it in 5.2a? In 5.0c we still can't do that. I don't know what's going on inside the head of the people in Baan when they decided to print one packing slip per shipment, while shipment number will be assigned based on WH order set number, and set number based on planned rec/del date. Indeed, it'd be nice if we can print one packing slip per load<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">18th October 2002, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Think of a load as a truck. Truck has multiple deliveries to multiple customers called shipments. You combine shipments going to the same customer in &quot;Split Shipments&quot; and then delivery documents specific to the customer are printed for the shipment.</div></div><hr />
