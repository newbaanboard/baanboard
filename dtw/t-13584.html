<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zyilmaz</div><div class="date">12th November 2003, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">We use Baan IVc. Most of our suppliers offer unit price and in additon, transportation cost. In purchase orders we have to write unit price and use it during the process. But in this situation we can not control changeable transportation costs. I tried &quot;cost&quot; type items. But I found out that these type of items are components of &quot;general costs&quot; and based on orders, not on items as we need.<br />
<br />
For BaaN IVc, is it possible to maintain additional transportation costs over unit purchase price? We are not using Baan IV Transportation Package and we do not want to use it either. We'd like to find a solution in Distribution package and Cost Accounting module? Is there anyone who has an idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I regret to say that if you want such a detail bifurcation of cost you need to use Transportation module.<br />
<br />
in case you are not using it as you fear it might elaborate user work load, its not like that as all processing is done automatically<br />
as for eg<br />
<br />
Copying of PO to Transport Order &amp; refrence linkage is also there which you wont get if you try to handle it throught distribution Module as thier you have to keep manual refrence between 2 orders.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just explore this option Iam sure you will be benifited.<br />
as i had done this at  6 sites &amp; all are happy with this feature..<br />
<br />
