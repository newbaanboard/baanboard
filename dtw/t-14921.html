<br />
The main purpose is to avoid to create a new PO number for this cases..<br />

<br />
If the case is the item has come in but once you looked at it you wanted to return it, because it was the wrong item or what ever, you could implement a simple QMS inspection that was simply a &quot;visual&quot; inspection where you could say if the item is wrong reject it etc.  The down side to QMS is that the receiving folks would have more steps to go through, but the upside is that the item shows up in inventory as having arrived, but it is put on-hold untill dispensation of the item is determined.  Then if it gets rejected it is added back to the existing PO.  No cry no foul.<br />

Just some ideas...</div></div><hr />
