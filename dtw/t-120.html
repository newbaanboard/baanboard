has anyone seen this problem earlier. <br />
any inputs to correct this is welcome<br />

thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smartone75</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">INV allocation - When a production order is maintained, allocation for all child items present in estimated materials increased in INV table based on estimated qty. <br />
<br />
There will not be any effect on ILC allocation at this point.  <br />
<br />
ILC allocation - Gets effect only when you generate out bound for these items (Hard allocation for ILC implemented companies). Once out bound is released both INV &amp; ILC allocation get reduced with inventory issue.</div></div><hr />

Which rebuild sessions are you running?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhaswar</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">we are using the correction session rebuild inventory data (ilc, tdilc0250m000). this runs in a job every day along with the session tdinv0250m000. <br />
whenever we change the allocation in the table tdilc101, it comes back after this rebuild job! that means there is some demand there. but cannot be located. any ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">You could also try running check inventory - tdinv0252m000. This will give you an additional report of items which should allow you to identify and correct the differences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhaswar</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">i just checked the job. that session is also included in the job that runs. <br />
is there another correction program or something?<br />
another question... does the outbound still exist in the maintain outbound table after processing the order. if i go to genenral table maint. i can see outbounds but i cannot see anything when i see the session maintain outbound!<br />
<br />
is this where the missing piece of the puzzle or is it normal functionality.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">4th September 2001, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">re. out of sync - sometimes there are problems when tdilc101.strs is different to tdilc101.stks even though the inventory and storage units are the same and it has to be fixed in table maintenance. Are these in sync in your example?<br />
<br />
What is the other issue you have - you want to maintain outbound after it has been released? That is not possible as far as I know. You can only delete or maintain outbound as long as it hasn't been released. I presume this is not your question though. Let us know what is happening in the tables that you don't believe should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
check in the job input parameters that you have it set to adjust and not just to check. This is sometimes quite useful at fixing ilc/inv issues that arise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhaswar</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 09:40</div></div><div class="posttext">well the stks and strs are in sync. but when u go to print outbound using the session print outbound data there are no outbounds existing! now if i go to the session then (tdilc1514m000) there is an allocation shown. so i made changes using gtm and i set the allocation equal to the allocation of inv table. the job runs in the morning (with the above mentioned sessions) and the allocations are back. <br />
now where are the allocations comming from? i believe it should be only for outbounds existing... correct me if i am wrong. well then where are the outbounds? now if i go to the table using gtm then i see that there are outbounds existing for old orders. my ques: could the allocation be comming from there? do the outbounds remain in the table even after the outbounds are realeased and the orders are confirmed? <br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are still showing allocated quantities against outbound in inv / ilc enquiries after the order has been processed i.e lines fully delivered - status 6 or 7 then you could try running tdinv0251m000 Rebuild allocated for picking lists. This may clear out any differences you have remaining.</div></div><hr />
