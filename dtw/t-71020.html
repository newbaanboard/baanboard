<br />
We have a central parts warehouse and then those parts get distributed out to multiple DC's.  Trying to figure out why some of the demand shows up on the planned RPL reports only, some show up on planned INV purchase order reports only and some show up on both!  I know there is something about nettable versus non-nettable, but parts are showing up on DRP for nettable warehouses so i'm wondering if anyone has any information.<br />
<br />
LN took care of this by putting all the demand on one report.  Right now, we have to run both to make sure we cover our needs.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
