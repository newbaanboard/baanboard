<br />
I have a problem with allocation of additional costs to purchase lines and calculation of cost price. When i receive a invoice/s after delivery of materials usually there are two lines in invoice/s:<br />
<br />
1. costs for material<br />
2. additional costs<br />
<br />
I want to allocate additional costs to P/O lines and calculate cost price of materials. For this purpose I use cost items in purchase order lines. I execute correctly every step of Purchase Procedure to &quot;Close Received Purchase Orders&quot;. Then i am entering invoice in system and connecting with purchase.<br />
<br />
I try also with additional cost (tdpur4128m000).<br />
<br />
With mentioned operation i can not allocate additional costs to PO lines!<br />
<br />
Can someone help me?</div></div><hr />

different with and without additional costs like freight, packing... When i <br />

be match with amount of PO, because compared it is more. In FINANCE/Accounts <br />
Payable/Transaction Processing/Maintenance/Maintain Transactions i try to match <br />
invoice with purchase order, but matching is by PO line! The PO <br />
have a one order line while invoice two lines. The total amount of PO is <br />
different from total amount of invoice. For the rest amount i have to select <br />
ledger account where additional costs accumulate. In this case i can not <br />
include this additional cost to item cost price. The sessions are:<br />
tfgld1101m000 -&gt; tfacp1110s000 -&gt; tfacp1131s000 -&gt; tfacp1130s000</div></div><hr />

When i receive supplier invoice with additional cost/s line/s i have to <br />
allocate manually this cost/s (proportionately or like percentage for amount of <br />
line) to every PO lines apart. After allocation i've to put them into field <br />
&quot;Invoiced amount (tfacp1131s000)&quot; summarized with item price, again manualy . <br />
After this operation the system will calculate correctly average purchase price <br />
and last purchase price for every items.<br />
I want  the system automaticly to allocate additional costs to PO lines!</div></div><hr />
