<br />
I created a new ordertype with ttaad4100. I did this before and it works fine.<br />
<br />
But now, for orders with this ordertype it is not possible to change the quantity after you print the order acknowledgement.<br />
<br />
For all other ordertypes (also some own created) it works perfectly, but not for this one. The only difference with other ordertypes is the order of the steps, and I added a special session that has to be run. This same session is also in other ordertypes, and gives no problem at all.<br />
<br />
What can be the reason of this problem?<br />
<br />
Please do not tell me about risks and disadvantages of creating own ordertypes, I did it for more than 7 years and it works very well normally.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any reactions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />
