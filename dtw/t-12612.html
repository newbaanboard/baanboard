<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmathew</div><div class="date">17th August 2003, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an item with MTR as the unit for purchase price in item master. While we create a Purchase order the purchase unit by default is MTR. When we change the purchase unit to FT the purchase price unit is still MTR and does not change to FT. We have upto SP12 in Baan IV c4 and on Windows 2000. <br />
<br />
Conversion from FT to MTR is also available and the inventory unit for this item is MTR.<br />
<br />
Are we going wrong somewhere :confused: <br />
<br />
While changing the purchase unit the purchase price unit also need to be changed. How is this possible?<br />
<br />
Require help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Purchase Price Unit can not be changed in the purchase order. So even if you change the purchase unit in the PO the purchase price unit remains as what is defined in the item master. To change the purchase price unit in the item master is not desirable unless the change is permanent. This is because changing the price unit does not update the price lists whyou may have entered</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you were seeing is a pricing flexibility designed into Baan. It allows you, for example, to buy in tons but specify the price in terms of kg. Baan wouldn't automatically change the purchase price to be in terms of purchase unit.<br />
<br />
In BaanIV, please check out the purchase price by item/supplier/price group sessions and see whether using those can help solve your problem<br />

<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
