<br />
I have got the EDI functionality to work on our BaanIVc3 environment. The system generates the Purchase Order 850out flatfile with the x.12 ansi settings.<br />
<br />
The next stage in the peice of work is to pass the output files to an eGateway (we are using webMethods) - The problem is the output files from baan are not in a pure x.12 format, therfore webmethods can not interpret the messages.<br />
<br />
To avoid having to translate the messages, has anyone configured baan to create PO messages in pure x.12 ansi format?<br />
(or a format that webMethods can directly interpret?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help or advise would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Andy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, when I want to add more partners, my customers/suppliers will only accept X12 'real' standards (BEG/ST/ISA/N1/...)<br />
<br />
Has anyone written custom conversions defaults?<br />
<br />
I have delved into the dlls some, but is there a lot of logic based on the level id's or could they be changed?<br />
<br />
agray - any luck out there?<br />

<br />
If the EDI file need to be created in X12 ANSI format directly from BaaN, then a lot of changes has to be done to the EDI conversion setup in BaaN. The person doing this should have through knowledge of BaaN EDI processing. Also The interchange controls in BaaN need to be used to create ISA/GS segments.<br />
<br />
In this board you can find threads, someone earlier mentioned that they created X12 EDI files from BaaN.</div></div><hr />
