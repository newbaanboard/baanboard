   my problem is in an order, the ordered quantity was 200 pieces. i have delivered 125 pieces. Now the back order quantity should show as 75 pieces but it is showing 0. when i m going for maintain &amp; confirm back order for that order there i m unable to get any back order. i have checked it in the session tdsls4531m000(display deliveries) there the back order is showing as 0.<br />

<br />
Second possibility is, that in the customer data the field &quot;tccom010.back&quot; has the value &quot;no&quot;, then the field &quot;back order quantity will be set to zero automaticly.<br />
<br />
I hope this help You.</div></div><hr />
