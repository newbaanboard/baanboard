<br />
We have created and defined text group (tttxt1120m000)ex:2,3,50,22.<br />
 <br />
and this group we linked with the tttxt1112m000 .<br />
<br />
( we are running on windows 2003).<br />
<br />
when we try to enter text on tdpur4107s000 , it is opening on notepad. but the details are not restricting to 50 characters. it is allowing more than 50 characters.  according to the logic it should allow 50 characters 1st line and 51 characters should start from 2nd line.<br />
<br />
is there any issue with baan or notepad.<br />
<br />
How and where we can set .<br />
<br />
please advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would also help if you mention the specification of the text window you created. <br />
<br />
Based on what you said, it should work just fine as it did for me and so i guess your text window set-up should tell us more..<br />

'tmp097394561-Notepad'<br />
now let me know how  to resolve the users problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">25th October 2006, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">From what you explained, i guess its opening up an instance of Windows Notepad, just in the same fashion as how it opens up Report Scripts. The restriction of a Text Window in Baan &quot;might&quot; only be applicable to Baan Text Editor and not to a Notepad. I stand to be corrected..<br />
<br />
Out of academic curiosity, how did you get it to open Notepad for the line texts? What parameter settings was changed to enable this? <br />
<br />
sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">25th October 2006, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I found out how an external text editor could be used. So out goes the curiosity bit..<br />
<br />
Apart from that i also found out that, when using an external text editor like notepad, Baan saves the text entered in same setup as the text group which in your case is 50 characters wide. However while entering the text, it doesnt restrict you to 50 characters. Once you save and open the text that you entered, you coud find out that the text appears as 50 characters wide.<br />
<br />
If you need restrictions at the time of entering texts, why not use Baan Text Editor. To do this, just remove the Text Group entry from the session Maintain Text Groups with External Editor (tttxt1116m000). <br />
<br />
It would be interesting to see if anyone knows how to restrict Notepad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">26th October 2006, 00:11</div></div><div class="posttext">What about the number of lines... can we restrict the number of lines that could be maintained in the text editor? Though the text window gets resized to the display the number of lines as maintained inthe text window session, however the application allows the user to add lines beyond the number of lines maintained in the text sessions.<br />
<br />
Also has anyone used session wise text groups, i.e. for tdsls4500m000 session the test group/text window is 1 and for tdpur4500m000 it is 2 (the dirrerence between the two text group/text window would be number of columns and lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">26th October 2006, 10:22</div></div><div class="posttext">From what i have seen the notepad doesnt restrict you from entering the text in the way you have specified in the text window but after saving and returning back to the notepad, you would see your text window column size applied but no restriction on the number of rows.</div></div><hr />
