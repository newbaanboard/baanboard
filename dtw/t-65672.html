<br />
Use Warehouse Order Price<br />
If this check box is selected,SSA ERP uses the Order Price, as specified in the current session, for the financial transactions related to the outbound-order line.<br />
You can only specify or modify the order price if the current check box is selected.<br />
The current check box is only available if the order origin is:<br />
Transfer or Transfer (Manual), and the outbound-order line concerns a transfer between two warehouses, and no invoice relation exists between the two warehouses. <br />
Transfer or Transfer (Manual), and the outbound-order line concerns a transfer between two warehouses, and an invoice relation that is based on the commercial price exists between the two warehouses. <br />
Transfer or Transfer (Manual), and the outbound-order line concerns a transfer from a warehouse to a project. <br />
Invoice relationship <br />
SSA ERP only uses the commercial price if an entity-entity relationship is defined between the ship-from entity and the ship-to entity of the warehousing order. You can define such a relationship in the Entity - Entity Relationships (tcemm2110m000) session. To this relationship, you can link an application process of type Goods Transfer. You can specify a goods transfer relationship in the Goods Transfer (tcemm2150m000) session. The goods transfer contains information about:<br />
The invoice relation between the two entity types. <br />
The price type; Commercial Price or Valuation Price. <br />
Note<br />
If a shipment with the Confirmed status exists for the outbound-order line, the current check box is unavailable.</div></div><hr />

- budget control and a production manual/service manual order.<br />
- issue from a project wip warehouse on a project (manual) order.<br />
<br />
You can make a simple customization.</div></div><hr />
