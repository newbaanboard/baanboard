I can see these orders in tdpur4101m800 (confirmed backorders purchase). Now we decide we want to cancel or delete this order.<br />

I can not find a way to do this? What is preventing me from deleting the back order?<br />

Thanks in advance.<br />

Thanks for your hint, I just overlooked this icon to go in the details. I now was able to cancel most of the back orders.<br />
<br />
Now I still have two Back orders which I can not cancel, this has to do I think that these Back Orders have a confirmed receipt, however it is a confirmed receipt of quantity 0.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get these Back Order canceled?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advnance,<br />

Hi Dirk,<br />
I had same situation but slightly different- <br />
I had a subcontracted purchase order in which I had received the material partially and a back order is generated with that remaining Quantity.<br />
Now I want to delete or cancel this back order (with zero Quantity) as well as Close the Purchase order too.<br />
So that I can close my Production Order as currently I am not able to do that as error message shows that Purchase order is open<br />
Please can u guide in this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue might be resolved to use the below mentioned activity most probably.<br />
<br />
(1)	Confirm the Back Order with ‘Zero’ Quantity<br />
(2)	Put the accounting entry in finance to book the Purchase invoice <br />
(3)	Execute the activity upto PDPO</div></div><hr />
