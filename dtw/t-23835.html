 <br />
Has anyone has some ideas about how to effectively implement Pull notes with DRP. At the moment we are using DRP to replening the WIP Warehouses in the Production floor. But since this method we have to replenish the qty (rather push) for a days production. <br />
Ideally we would like DRP pick lists to work in conjunction with Pull notes. So lets say the Pick list recommended the qty of 100 for a pat A. We should then use pull notes to actually do phased delivery of parts to the floor. <br />
<br />
Has anyone used Pull notes in Baan. How well does that work for a situation like this? Any ideas or suggestions is welcome. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
