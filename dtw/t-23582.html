<br />
In SSA ERP LN 6.1 you can define in the user data the logistic and financial company separately. I guess you are looking for that possibility. However, that's not possible in older versions.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply. I followed your guide but when I create new supplier address, the Defalut Financial Comapany in Form2 tab in Maintain Suppliers (Tccom2101m000) still does not change to 312, it still was equal to 311. Does anyone have the other suggestion to help me?<br />
best thanks and regards<br />

So, my previous reply is totally not valid!<br />
<br />
How the standard Baan IV software works<br />
When you have a single financial company setup, the financial company is defaulted automatically. But in case you have multiple financial companies, no financial company can be defaulted and the session falls back to the current company. <br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
Probably you work with multiple financial companies.<br />
In that situation the current company is defaulted.<br />
There is no way to change the defaulting mechanism, unless you customize the session.</div></div><hr />
