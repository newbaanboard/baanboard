<br />
I'm running Baan version 5c.<br />
<br />
I was wondering what methods people are using to transfer inventory between logistical companies. Has anyone tried to customize to do so by using Warehouse Transfer Orders? Any thoughts on the matter would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!<br />

<br />
You can't just look at that issue from warehousing point of view. What was the reason for the separation of logistic companies? Are they separate legal entities? How would the accounting dept like the transfer to be booked as? At what value it should be booked? With answers to these questions, people will be able to give more appropriate suggestions<br />
