He brought one &quot;series&quot; to me today.  <br />
<br />
In his example, an order was shipped on 4 separate days.  <br />
<br />
* The first shipment contained 7 items, and showed no backordered amount.<br />
* The second shipment contained 1 item.  It also showed no backordered amount.<br />
* The third shipment was for one item, which on further investigation fulfilled the quantity for an item in the first shipment.  The packing slip showed a backorder for one item.<br />
* The fourth shipment was for the backordered item from the previous shipment.  The order has now been completed.<br />
<br />
<br />
My first guess is that the user is not doing something correctly, but...<br />
<br />
Thank you all in advance.</div></div><hr />
