<br />
We are changing our production system.<br />
The supplier will deliver himself according to stock level, without PO.<br />
A WIP warehouse is to be completed according to KANBAN <br />
We dont use the SCC or AGS.<br />
<br />
We are thinking for example of a simplified reception process with barcode reading and a global session which simulates PO creation, PO reception and inbound.<br />
Do you have some experience with the consequences in Baan IV, would AGS be a solution for that production system ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suppliers sends (by whatever platform: EDI/Email/Pigeon) a file, representing an ASN, which fills the proper EDI-table (currently at home w/o Baan conncetion so please zoom from the pack slip field in tdpur4120m000 an you know which one I mean).<br />
I AFS-programm creates, based on this data a PO and extending the source a bit I guess you can automatically create goods receipts etc.<br />
I'm not a techie (just functional a few years experience :) ) but can't be too hard.</div></div><hr />
