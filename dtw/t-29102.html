If user has entered wrong quantity than the physically received quantity, then you need to rectify it. But then how come the stock is zero now? Does that mean somebody also issue wrong quantity, eg wrong production material issue? So there are 2 people entering wrong quantities, one in purchasing and one in issuing?<br />
What happened? Without description of what actually happened on the field, it's hard for us to give suggestion<br />

Has the receipt been confirmed ?  If not, the stock might indeed be zero.<br />
It is strange that you can no longer find the receipt line.  <br />
A possibility might be to make a stock adjustment with a correction code to indicate what went wrong.</div></div><hr />

when looking for this i found that the field tdilc101.stra has a value of 200...<br />
and the item is still in receipt location, i need to release inbound in order to get a stock &gt; 0?<br />

   If i understand you correctly, you can see stock in your system but when you try to reduce it, it says stock is zero?<br />
If so, then do tell me if the storage unit is different from the inventory unit? <br />
If they are different then check the table tdilc101 and check if the field strs and stks to see if they conform to the standard conversion rates. In rare situations, you would see strs has some figure in it while stks might be zero.<br />
In the event that the units are the same then check the field stra and stka and find out if at all there is a valid allocation for this item. <br />

<br />
I think you have processed the next order step that is why you are not able to see the record in maintain receipt session. <br />
<br />
If maintain approval process is involve in orderstep then you can open the same session and change the approved quantity and show the rejection for the rest.<br />

(Based on your warehouse parameters)<br />
