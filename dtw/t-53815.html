How are the various roles in business partners session set-up when several branches of a customer are involved? Does anybody have  some documents that explains how to set-up the Business Partners when the customer has multiple locations? I am aware of setting-up the BPs to a reasonable extent. For example, if a customer has 10 delivery locations, create a parent business partner with sold-to, invoice-to, pay-by roles and create multiple BPs with only ship-to role and link to the parent BP. However, I think the use of business partners session is more than that. e.g. there is a field &quot;ship-to BP&quot; in sold-to role and &quot;sold-to BP&quot; in ship-to role. How are they used? I want to get a reasonable knowledge about the Business Partners. Can someone send me some documents?<br />
