I am new to Baan ERP LN and have a basic question. I would like to see the Inventory details by a Warehouse and location.....which means that for a given warehouse and location, I would like to see the list of items and the stock available. How can I see this on screen and how can the same be printed?</div></div><hr />

There 5 sort orders in this session. You can use any one which is convient to you.</div></div><hr />

Thanks and I was able to view the inventory in a warehouse by location. In case I want to transfer all the inventory in a warehouse and a particular location, is there an easy way to do that. Or let me know how I could do this bulk transfer from a warehouse and location to another warehouse and location.</div></div><hr />

In the Same session select one of teh record and right click. When you right click you get a menu. In that you select Move to location and than give the location where you want it to be move.</div></div><hr />
