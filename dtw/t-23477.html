Fist all, version that I am using is Baan IV 4c<br />
I am new in using Baan. I am facing some problems in Sales Order Module<br />
1 After I created new sales order successfully, now I want to implement &#8220;Print Order Acknowledgment&#8221; session or &quot;Print Pack Slip&quot; session but there appears an error message: &#8220;No data with selection&#8221;<br />
I don&#8217;t understand why there appears that message<br />
2 I want to know whether the tax information such as tax amount can be stored in Order Acknowledgment or It only is stored in printed orders or invoices. Can you explain clearly about this problem?<br />
<br />
Please help me as soon as possible<br />
Best regards and thanks<br />

<br />
In order to be able to print the sales order acknowledgement and the packing slip you need to have printing the sales order acknowledgement and printing the packing slip defined as a step in the procedure linked to your sales order type (check tcmcs0142m000). Besides that you need to have reached that point in the procedure (check tdsls4533m000 - if 'ready for' for the order is set to a step before the SO-acknowledgement, it won't be printed yet. The same goes for the packing slip). Next to that check your customer data (tccom1101m000): if the field 'acknowledge by exception' in form 6 is set to 'no' there'll be no problem but if it's set to 'yes' the step will be skipped in case you don't have an 'acknowledgement code' assigned to the sales order line.<br />
<br />
VAT should be printed on the SO-acknowledgement.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

3 Generate Outbound Advice<br />
4 Maitain Deliveries<br />
5Print Pack Slips<br />
6 Print Sales Invoices<br />
7 Process Delivered Sales Order<br />
Thank for your reply. I implemented all steps that you gave to me and I printed Sales Order Acknowledgement sucessfully,however there does not show tax amount and I had to face with another problem. <br />
When implementing &quot;Generate Outbound Advice&quot; session, there appears error message: &quot;Report tdilc401m000 Outbound Advice Shortages&quot; and if I continue to press &quot;Continue&quot; button, the program will corrupt right away, at that time I can't quit this session. I want to know whether  I ran wrong or not to display that message<br />
I attached filed that show the above error message <br />
 I have another question: when implementing &quot;Print Sales Invoices&quot; session, there appears an error message again: &quot;Financial period not open this date&quot;<br />
(this date is today). I want to know how to open Financial period for this date. Could you or anybody help to solve that problem?<br />
Best regards and thanks<br />
