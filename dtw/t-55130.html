<br />
On a Sales Order, start entering a new line with an item which is not meant to be drop shipped. After entering the quantity, change the Direct Delivery Flag to yes and override the default price and save the record. Now delete the line and see if you get the question to 'Recalculate price and discount of line'. If you get that message, click Yes.<br />
<br />
Now once the line is deleted, look at the sales history record of that deleted line and you will see that the deletion record has now different price/discount then the order entry record.<br />
<br />
Strange part is why would even it asks to recalculate price/discount in case the line is being deleted. Of course user should not click Yes but the question should never pop up in first place. I have looked at the code and sure enough under before.choice section of choice.update.db the function check.if.price.and.discount.should.be.recalculated() is called in case of modify.set or mark.delete. <br />
<br />
Does any one else on a latest or at least higher service pack then ours can reproduce this error?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
