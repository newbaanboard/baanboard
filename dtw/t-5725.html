<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karlovac</div><div class="date">27th January 2004, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">In the &quot;Sales Control (SLS)&quot; module, invoicing by installment allows you<br />
    to create invoices for amounts - beforehand or afterwards - without the<br />
    concomitant physical delivery of goods.<br />
    Whether or not the customer is to be invoiced by installment can be<br />
    indicated in the sales order header. If invoicing by installment is<br />
    desirable, you can add a number of installment lines to the order. An<br />
    installment line consists of an amount and a number of additional<br />
    details. Such lines can be placed on an invoice whenever this is<br />
    desired. Billed installments are settled (subtracted from the goods<br />
    amount) when the goods are delivered and invoiced. Settlement can<br />
    take place in two ways.<br />
<br />
    Indirect Settlement<br />
    In this case, delivered goods are not invoiced until the installment<br />
    order receives the status &quot;Closed&quot;. However, the customer<br />
    can be invoiced for one or more installments in advance. When the order<br />
    receives the status &quot;Closed&quot; the invoiced installments are<br />
    subtracted from the goods amount on the invoice. The advantage of this<br />
    method is that deliveries of goods need not be immediately accounted for<br />
    by billed turnover. A disadvantage is that the revenues from the sales<br />
    of goods only become visible in the package &quot;BAAN Finance&quot; the moment<br />
    the installment order is closed. Graphically, this could be represented<br />
    as follows:<br />
<br />
                 |  installment order is closed           |<br />
                 |  customer invoiced for goods and       |<br />
                 |  installments                          |<br />
                 |  (guarantee) installments are settled  |<br />
                 +----------------------------------------+<br />
     |                              |                                     |<br />
     |                              V                                     |<br />
    -+--------------------------------------------------------------------+<br />
     |&lt;- customer invoiced for    -&gt;|&lt;- guarantee installments are      -&gt;|<br />
     |   installments, not for      |   invoiced                          |<br />
     |   goods                      |              ---------&gt; time        |<br />
<br />
<br />
    Direct Settlement<br />
    Billed installments are directly subtracted from goods deliveries. If<br />
    the installment value that has been billed is less than the value of the<br />
    delivery, the customer will receive an additional invoice for this<br />
    amount.  In this method, the revenue from sold goods is immediately<br />
    apparent within the &quot;BAAN Finance&quot; package. A disadvantage is, that<br />
    each delivery must be directly accounted for by billed revenue.<br />
    Graphically, this could be represented as follows:<br />
<br />
                 |  Installment order is closed           |<br />
                 |  Customer invoiced for goods and       |<br />
                 |  installments                          |<br />
                 |  (Guarantee) installments are settled  |<br />
                 +----------------------------------------+<br />
     |                                |                                   |<br />
     |                                V                                   |<br />
    -+--------------------------------------------------------------------+-<br />
     |&lt;- customer invoiced for      -&gt;|&lt;- guarantee installments are    -&gt;|<br />
     |   goods and installments;      |   invoiced                        |<br />
     |   installments settled directly|                                   |<br />
                                                     ---------&gt; time<br />
<br />
<br />
    Two types of installment lines are possible: normal installments and<br />
    guarantee installments. The former are billed before or simultaneous<br />
    with the goods. Guarantee installments can only be billed after all<br />
    normal installments and goods have been delivered.<br />
<br />
    After delivery of the physical goods and after the customer has been<br />
    invoiced for the normal installments, the installment order must be<br />
    assigned the status &quot;Closed&quot;. This can be done in the<br />
    session &quot;Maintain Installment Data (tdsls4106s000)&quot; by choosing option<br />
    &quot;Continue&quot;. Changing the status has various purposes:<br />
<br />
<br />
      - If the amount for which the customer has been invoiced is too high,<br />
        a reverse entry will be created, and a correction installment will<br />
        appear on the invoice<br />
      - Guarantee installments for which the customer has not yet been<br />
        invoiced are subtracted from the invoiceable amount<br />
      - Invoices can be created for guarantee installments<br />
