<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gabymore</div><div class="date">5th November 2003, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: <br />
<br />
We have Baan IV C2 MCR. One of our companies that runs manufacturing in Process and lotifies producction, is continually showing negative inventories, which by definition is not possible.<br />
This means we can sale a product we don´t have. This not only happens with sales, also with material comsumptions in production lots, etc.<br />
There is a paremeter in Distribution Parameters for Stocks that is set in NO, meaning it should not allow negative inventories.<br />
So far, Baan has not offered an explanation.<br />
<br />
Any ideas out there?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot:confused</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">6th November 2003, 13:21</div></div><div class="posttext">LTC implemented = ILC implemented = Negative inventory levels are not allowed (conceptually).<br />
<br />
So far so good.<br />
<br />
But what inventory levels drop below zero?<br />
Are you talking about actual stock-on-hand or economic stock (that is expected stock, so with including allocated and on-order).<br />
<br />
It may well be that one of your software components allow you to generate negative stock on hand, but that should be solved in a software update... may need some updates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baandude</div><div class="date">7th November 2003, 04:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely if ILC is being used, there is no way a negative qty is possible for inv thus, you will not be able to generate sls if no stock on hand, <br />
<br />
Could you send screen shots where you see the negative qty, as i agree in std baan no negative qty is possible with ILC implemented.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gabymore</div><div class="date">7th November 2003, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you are right, with ILC implemented there should be no way to get negative inventories, that is on-hand-inventory, yet it happens.<br />
<br />
I´m attaching a screenshot.<br />
<br />
if it were a software upgrade, shouldn´t Baan know it? we have been talking about this for months....<br />
<br />
Thanks for your prompt replies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">7th November 2003, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Which report is this?<br />
Do you use standard Baan or with some localization?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gabymore</div><div class="date">7th November 2003, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">We have some localization, but this is a standard report of table<br />
tdilc700</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">7th November 2003, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">OmeLuuk: Which report is this?I mean, what session code is used to make the report. I found no session that has tdilc700 as main table... (non existing table) nor tdinv700...<br />
If you look in sessions tdilc1510m000, tdilc1511m000, tdilc1514m000 etc (in mtdilc10003001), do you see negative stock there too? These tables read on tdilc101 directly.Do you use standard Baan or with some localization?What localisation? Does that have ILC related components? (I have seen a poor implementation of ILC in localisations...).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gabymore</div><div class="date">7th November 2003, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no session attached, it´s just the table.<br />
Yes I have negative inventories y the tables you mentioned.<br />
<br />
Also in tdilc1413m000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">8th November 2003, 08:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the report is tdilc3410m000. This report takes information from tdilc301 and not tdilc700 (or tdinv700 ) . <br />
<br />
As  Omeluck pointed out the error could be due to installation or use of a program component with a bug in updating stock or validating stock. In the past there have been lots of solutions and correction program for correcting data in ILC . <br />
<br />
Further check the session information (ttstpsessinfo) for sessions tdilc4202m000 , tdilc4113s000 , tdilc4123s000 etc to find out the date these session were complied (search for 'ptd' in the output).<br />
The thumb rule is that the later the date the lesser the bugs in the software .<br />
<br />
In the past these sessions have been corrected for such errors many times. I think the problem could be due to MCR extension u are using and the older B40c2 version which may not have all the latest solutions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is transaction report. A transaction report unless taken from day one may show you negative balances. This is because if you take a report from some date after the transactions commenced, it does not take into account the transactions before that date.<br />
<br />
Can you give a screenshot of tdilc1511m000 or tdilc1410m000.<br />
<br />
However I have found that sometimes lot balances do go negative due to some bug particularly if you are using containerisation and inventory unit is different from storage unit. I find that users do amke mistakes in entering the correct unit at all times.<br />
<br />
Run session tdinv0252m000 WITH THE FIELD 'ADJUST- YES/NO' SET TO NO'.  If the field is set to yes you will get incosistency between Finanace inventory valuation and  and Distribution inventory valuation</div></div><hr />

<br />
We appreciate ypur help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gabymore</div><div class="date">10th November 2003, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes the date issue seems to be a prblem too. Thanks for your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gabymore</div><div class="date">10th November 2003, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I´m attaching the screenshots you asked with examples.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 11:01</div></div><div class="posttext">All your negative stock are these small amounts? Then it appears to me to be rounding problems... You do not use storage units on these items? <br />
<br />
What is the crnd for your unit kg? Do you round it on 0.01 kg?<br />
And is there some conversion issue that may cause this for this item?<br />
<br />
Your item is named MORTADELA ESP. 2,5 KG. C/T ARI, does this mean that your purchase or sales unit contains 2,5000 kg? What if your crnd on your sales unit is 0.1 kg and on inventory unit it is 0.01 kg ... then you may cause these kind of differences...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gabymore</div><div class="date">11th November 2003, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Omeluuk:<br />
<br />
This was just an example, we already checked the rounding factors and storage, sales and production units.<br />
<br />
My guess is what you already proposed, maybe some patch we are missing or a problem with our localization.<br />
<br />
