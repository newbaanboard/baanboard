<br />
I have a problem during maintain purchase receipt which is the error dialogue &quot;Purchase order cannot be written to finance&quot;.<br />
<br />
The data in the PO/PO lines are actually uploaded using customized program and tables updated are tdpur400, tdpur401, tdpur450 and tdpur451. Is there any tables that we need to update?<br />
<br />
Tq in advance...</div></div><hr />

<br />
But most likely is that the data in tdpur401 does not match with tfacp240 and or tfacp245. Either the order data is not present in finance, or e.g. a sequence number or packing slip ID is wrong.</div></div><hr />
