<br />
I understand that after a receipt has been registered for a PO line, we can't delete away or cancel the PO line.<br />
<br />
To &quot;cancel&quot; the line, what I tried to do is follow:<br />
1) Do a receipt correction using session whinh3121s000. Allthe received quantity should be reversed.<br />
2) during the reversal, the field &quot;Final Receipt&quot; is check, hoping that user can't create anymore receipt.<br />
<br />
However, I still find that the user still can create receipt for his PO line.<br />
<br />
Can anyone advise how can I &quot;cancel&quot; the PO line after receipt is registered.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I though when I click on the &quot;Final Receipt&quot;, future receipt is not allowed. Unfortunately, this is not true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Baan4 when you receive an item with 0 quantity, the balance would come under a field called as &quot;Back Order&quot;. When that field is also put to 0, the order would be closed as in no more receipt would take place.<br />
<br />
So what would happen in your scenario If you receive 0 in the Maintain Receipt session? Does the balance get shown in any other fields on that session? If yes, then can that be put to 0 as well?<br />

If you checked &quot;final receipt&quot; at the receipt, the field should be open for change.</div></div><hr />
