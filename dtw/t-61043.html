I have a problem: when I run a tdilc5210m000 Generatin ILC counting orders,<br />
program does not generate orders for all items.<br />
<br />
I deleted all previous orders, and nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Later, I tried to change inventory location for one item, and then I generated a cc.<br />
It seems that there are problem with location - but when I look on the data for first and for the second location, I cannot see the difference.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have an idea what to try to do next?<br />
<br />
Thnks, <br />

No, it was not the first time for generating order for that items, because there were several counting orders before.<br />
<br />
I still don't know what happened, but there is a strange thing:<br />
<br />
I made an Inventory Transfer from one location to another, and after that I could make a cc order.<br />
After that, I made an Inventory Transfer form one location to the same location, and the result was the same, I generated a cc order.<br />
<br />
So, as I needed to make a cycle counting, a made a list form inventory to look like a cc order list, and for the items where we found differences, we made a procedure described above. (Luckily, there were only few items which had differences).<br />
