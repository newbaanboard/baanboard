<br />
I would like to use the &quot;selection&quot; option in de SMI module of BaanIV. It concerns the sessie tdsmi0170m000 where one can create selection scripts that can be use in sessions tdsmi2210m000 and tdsmi2220m000.<br />
<br />
I would like to create a script that makes it possible to add and /or replace an activity to a relation based on another activity. In other words activity B should only be added to the relation if activity A is alrealy linked to this relation.<br />
<br />
My main problem is I don't know what syntax to use when creating a script like this &quot;selection&quot; script. Help text mentions the fact that this &quot;selection&quot; functions like a boolean (True/False) but doesn't mention how to invoke this.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated and perhaps anybody has a working example they want to share with me?!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Danny</div></div><hr />
