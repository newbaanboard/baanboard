<br />
Anyone know how to do partial delivery of BOM line item.<br />
<br />
example: a construction end item call &quot;Windows-L20-W1-S1&quot; which consist of <br />
<br />
level 1 bom item : inner frame, outer frame , glass &amp; handle.<br />
<br />
the sales order only specified the end item &quot;Windows-L20-W1-S1&quot; but in actual fact during operation, they will deliver all this BOM item from time to time. finally only assembly up on site.<br />
<br />
that case they want the D/O all appear the BOM line item which belongs to Windows-L20-W1-S1. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

This is a known requirement but quite complicated because no sales prices are available on the BOM level. So the shipment can not be used for invoicing. <br />

<br />
How BOM by operation is going to help in this case???<br />
<br />
:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">more_rajiv</div><div class="date">23rd January 2008, 07:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Jay,<br />
<br />
Say for example Brickwork is task - T101 <br />
and material required in Block 4&quot;,Block 5&quot; , Cement and Sand River. Assume any qty.<br />
In typical construction enviornment, all material is required Task wise like Excavation, Plinth Beam , Slab , Brick work, Wood work etc.<br />
<br />
So if u use the BOM by operation,<br />
<br />
Then Operation-10 --- Task T101 ( Brick work) ----- Material 1 Block 4&quot; ( Operation 10)<br />
                                                                                   2 Bleck 5&quot;  ( ---&quot;---)<br />
                                                                                   3 Cement   (---&quot;---)<br />
                                                                                   4 Sand River (---&quot;---)<br />
This all material will get issues either by backflush or manually depend upon setting.<br />
So in this case one can issue the material part by part till the full operation gets completed.<br />
We have successfully implemented this BOM by operation technoque in our construction division last year and working fine.<br />
<br />
I am sure it will help you.<br />

<br />
I think you misunderstood the requirement. If I understood correctly the requirement is sales shipment of one of the BOM componets from an SO , where as what you have mentioned is SFC Backflushing - issue of materials against a production order. <br />
<br />
Hope I am clear.<br />
<br />

<br />
anyhow any input welcome, any will count, forum spirit~<br />
been study this case and found out just the solution for it, still need more time to test and research, but basically this is how u can do it.<br />
<br />
use handling unit when you create sales order for items that you want to do BOM line delivery, instead of by main item, use by component. <br />
there are several conditions have to meet, once ok, you can generate packing slip by bom item. <br />
<br />
invoice part not much of an issue as can combine using ci <br />
<br />
anyone using this method? have any issues or limitation? <br />
<br />
