<br />
On little digging, I found out that there were few orders that made it partially into Baan successfully (Like one out of five lines) and then apprently it ran into an issue and put the whole order back into Messages to be Received Queue. <br />
<br />
Is this a normal behavior? Shouldn't EDI module first check the whole order to make sure it will make it through without error and then process it rather than putting partial order in the system and then putting it in the error queue?<br />
<br />
The issue it is causing is that our users then look at the Customer PO number and see that it is already there in Baan (and don't look whether all the lines are there or not) and then delete the order from error batch.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Our system doesn't allow partial orders. <br />

Thats what I thought should be the behavior but I have found multiple orders that have this partially imported and still order is present in messages to be received. <br />
<br />
I will wait and see if someone else has seen this behavior.</div></div><hr />

While checking the EDI file check the second field (bano) of the EDi segments and ensue its unique for entire PO file.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">11th March 2010, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Guys and you confirmed what I thought was the case.<br />
<br />
In any case, it kept happening and finally we were able to find out that the EDI job is throwing a duplicate error on tdsls041 and that caused the order import to fail in the middle of an order. As the job failed, the 850S file did not move to store_recv folder and hence when the next time the job ran, we got the error back in Messages To Be Received queue as duplicate.<br />
<br />
The duplicate on tdsls041 looks like is caused by a bug in Baan and we are going to open a case with them. We have two 850S-In setups, one that uses the customer PO line number as our sales order line number and one that will let Baan generate its own sales order line numbers. If in a single 850S file, we have orders for each setup, then we will get this error. <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
