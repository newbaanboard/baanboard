Are you talking of going in for Infor ERP LN or is there a add-on for BaanIV (your profile mentions only BaanIV). If you are going on for LN then there are many good features in LN as compared to BaanIV. Don't just compare requisitions.<br />
<br />
In LN the Purchase Reqn approval process is not good... again it will depend upon your company requirement, but the approval features in LN does not fit into most customers requirements.</div></div><hr />
