<br />
We are facing a peculiar problem recently while releasing collect orders.<br />
<br />
The Process what we are following is as follows :<br />
<br />
1. Maintian Planned Deliveries.<br />
2. Change status to &quot;In Preparation&quot;<br />
3. Print Delivery<br />
4. Confirm Deliveries.<br />
<br />
Now in the last step, when we confirm deliveries , Baan pops up a question &quot;Automatic Release Outbound Recommendation&quot;, We answer it as yes, then it asks for the Device Input for Outbound Data to be Released, after we input the Device, it does not maintian/releases the outbound Data.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then we have to go and manually release the outbound Data for the order created.<br />
<br />
My problem is &quot;why it is not automatically releasing the outbound data for the order&quot;. <br />
<br />
Also this proces is working fine in other comapny, can't think why it is not working in this company.<br />
<br />
Can it be because of some DB File Size issue, because we have set them to autogrow of size 100 MB, and the respective DB Files are 99.8% full of their inittial size.<br />
<br />
Please suggest .<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ankur</div></div><hr />

<br />
