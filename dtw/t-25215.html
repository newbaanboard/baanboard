<br />
We have Baan ERP 5.0b with SP12. In item purchase data, when I go and delete the Buy-From BP Fieild, it gives me an error message &quot;ttstp0108-Buy-From BP Not Allowed&quot;. To test this with a new item, i created a new item, it allowed me to keep this field blank initially. But, once I filled in the value at Buy-from BP and then tried to delete it, it again popped up the same error message. Does anyone else has faced the similar problem. Please advise.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 09:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I could not reproduce the error on the 5.0b system (latest version).<br />
Something was solved in the 2002 related to this problem: solution 129582. I gues you already installed this one. But you never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 10:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I have Baan 5.0B, and I see this happening also. We moved at once from SP 9/10 to SP16. I see that we have old records in which the BP is empty, and if I go over the field now again, and leave it blanc, the system will give me the error. I can however force it, and go over it, and save. The system will save the record, yet will also give me a message &quot;did not update the item/supplier data table&quot;...<br />
<br />
Solution #128071 was aimed specifically to make the field mandatory, and half a year later (04/2003) came solution 162165, and reversed the changes. It could be that there were other modifications made by 128071 which were maybe not documented?? or by different solution, DUE to 128071.. and which were then not reversed by solution 162165. OR more likely, there is some other solution regarding the item/supplier data which is causing this strange behaviour... <br />
<br />
It is for sure not correct and neat functionality to on one hand give an error, yet allow forcing it, and it would be nice knowing what the correct functionality is intended to be like.. So I recommend that you log a case with Baan support about this... (in assumption that you have a support contract..)<br />
<br />
Please keep us posted about the case here on the board...<br />

<br />
Solution 162165 deals about changing units.<br />
It says nothing about the Buy-from BP.<br />
<br />
What I see in the code (dal tdipu001) that solution 128071 introduced the check on the BP and solution 129582 removed that check.<br />
<br />
Still I cannot reproduce the situation you both have. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 11:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Evert, indeed  meant 129582, my mistake..<br />
<br />
About you not being able to reproduce: how does it behave by you, it allows leaving BP blanc? What SP do you have? DO you have all patches installed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">As employee of SSA, I'm testing on the SSA system. So, latest of the latest SP and patches:).<br />
<br />
It allows leaving the BP blank. It does not give any message.<br />
When I enter a new record in item purchase data and I leave the BP blank, I get the message at moment of saving:<br />
tdipus3025: &quot;Note : record not inserted in item/supplier information.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a little off topic, but, hi Evert. And thanks for dropping in BaanBoard and answering support questions too. We appreciate the little extra effort you personally give to service existing Baan users, aside from supporting them through Baan Support web site (or are you obliged by SSA to do so :) ? ). Just wanted to make sure your personal effort is thanked by someone from this board, if nobody ever done so before.<br />
By the way, I'm mostly involved in 5.0c and never come across the bug scp mentioned yet<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Paul.<br />
I like to have this kind of discussions about the software we build.<br />
And this way I get also more feeling about which problems users have in their day-today business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Paul, Evert and all our friends here on the board, that with all due respect, Evert as a SSA support employee does not deserve any less or more credits than all us other users. <br />
<br />
All of us, whether it is Pauls, Evert, myself or anyone else, benefits from, and gives to BaanBoard. At least that is the target, the aim. I think this is in fact also being done. And I know as for fact, that many of Evert's colleagues are also very intense BaanBoarders, and get a lot of benefit of the board.. and why not... that's what it's all about.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
