<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">26th May 2004, 01:38</div></div><div class="posttext">is anybody using Baan 5b or 5c with blanket POs and also using some sort of a supplier rating system? <br />
<br />
We use discrete purchase orders with some suppliers, which is great because I can look in Baan at planned inventory transactions and see exactly whan that item is going to arrive, and in what quantity- and I can use the vendor rating system to track actual quantities and delivery dates with planned quantities and delivery dates.<br />
<br />
We have a few suppliers who deliver to us every day, and it does not make sense for us to create a daily line item for the same item, so we create a weekly line item, and simply email the supplier each day with the quantity to deliver (the release). The problem with this is that I cannot measure my suppliers to delivery date and quantity with this 1 weekly PO. <br />
<br />
I tried using PO schedules, but I ran into many bugs and Baan does not suppor tit anymore from what i understand. Does anyone have a solution? I also tried using a main PO line, and then using the 'split line' functionality, but this seems to be a pain.</div></div><hr />
