<br />
I have an issue regarding the Price Level of a Subcontracting Purchase Order. I understand that the price of an item in Subcon PO get its price from the maintained price in Subcontracting Rates, the price that appear in the Price field of the Suncontracting PO is right though,but why is that everytime I generate a subcontracting PO, the &quot;Price Level&quot; stated there is &quot;Item File Price&quot; where it should be &quot;Supplier / Item&quot;?. Will running the session &quot;Calculate Cost Prices&quot; (ticpr2210m000) or Update Cost prices (ticpr2220m000) correct this issue? Will appreciate help asap.:D  Thanks!<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
The Purchase Price of this item maintained in item master is 38.30. The Subcontracting Price in Subcontracting Rate is 23.50. I maintained and released a Production Order and run the session Generate Subcontracting Orders, the price posted for the item in the generated PO is 23.50 which is the subcontracting rate for the item but when i checked the Price Level of the generated Subcontracting PO it still appear as &quot;Item File Price&quot; and not &quot;Supplier/Item&quot;. I tried to delete the purchase price in Item Master and did the same steps but the result was still the same. Is there anymore possible factor that is causing this problem? <br />
<br />
Please advice. Thanks in advance.<br />

I want to map subcontracting process in ERP-Ln6-FP2, so please provide the functionality of subcontracting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good Day!<br />
<br />
1. We maintain Production Order for subcontracting item (tisfc0101m000)<br />
2. Release Production Order (tisfc0204m000)<br />
3. Generate Subcontracting Order (tisfc2250m000) - a Subcontrating   Purchase Order will be automatically generated thru this session<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
Subcontracting rates were properly maintained for subcontracting items.<br />
Subcontracting Items for Manufactured items were maintained in a customized sub-session in Maintain Item Data which is Maintain Item Master Extension<br />
The price maintained in Maintain Subcontrating Rate session is the price of the Subcontracting Item of the Manufactured item.<br />
e.g.  Manufactured Item   = BC-293255-R<br />
       Subcontracting Item = BC-293255-R-S (Item Master Extension)<br />
<br />
Hope you can help me on this issue.<br />
Thanks!<br />

The price posted in that Purchase Order is the correct price which is the subcontrating rate of the item.<br />
<br />
If the price of the item in the PO gets it price from subcontracting rate, why is that the Price Level is &quot;Item File Price&quot; and not &quot;Supplier / Item&quot;? <br />
<br />
Still waiting for an answer.<br />
Thanks!<br />
