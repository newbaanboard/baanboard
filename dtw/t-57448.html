I generated sales quotation from budget project (tipcs2240m000) after that there is a change in pricing &amp; quantity so I again calculate cost prices by project (tipcs3250m000) so whatever changes done in cost prices should directly update in sales quotation which is created for that project by running recalculate price/discounts quotation line (tdpcg0240s000)<br />
 Whatever changes done in budget related to cost is not updating in sales quotation which is derived from budget so please provide how to update latest prices in sales quotation <br />
<br />
Thanking You,<br />
