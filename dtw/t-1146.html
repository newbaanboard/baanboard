As you will probably know, this field is important for the different planningruns. You will find difficulties when you change the types and use for instance mrp runs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would be well advised to run an mrp report for the items effected both before and after the switch to make sure planning demand is correct.</div></div><hr />
