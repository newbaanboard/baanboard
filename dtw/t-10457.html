<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">21st June 2003, 03:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We have Baan4c4 with ILC but I think there is very little difference in SLS and ILC in this area with IVb.  We need to correct problems like this from time to time when a dispatch is accidentially made or it is decided to ship a short supply item to a different customer at the last minute.<br />

In genereal there is no easy way to undo the release outbound for a sales order programatically or with GTM.  <br />
<br />
The settings of pmask (order steps) have some influence on the processing required and the sequence of the steps. In any event there a number of tables involved which have to be updated in concert.  However, my strong recommendation is to not attempt a fixup unless you a thouroughly familiar with the programs and the tables involved -- perhaps not even then.<br />
<br />
The approach we use as a matter of procedure is to complete the dispatch process and produce the invoice. Then reverse it with a RETURN order and Credit invoice. After that  start all over again with a new order.   This is a nice clean old fashioned method that can be traced by auditors and does not risk incorrect/incomplete fixing with GTM or the writing of special fix-up program.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BBailey</div><div class="date">23rd June 2003, 22:53</div></div><div class="posttext">that's exactly the procedure we do as well.  <br />
There's no quck, easy way to undo Outbounding other than to complete the incorrect transaction, do the exact reverse as a return order, then do the correct sales order.<br />
It's cumbersome, but once users go through this a few times, they become very good at NOT making outbounding mistakes... <br />
<br />
I heard a rumor that Baan V has &quot;Un-Do&quot; method of Outbounding...any comment from Baan V users?</div></div><hr />
