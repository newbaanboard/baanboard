<br />
BaaN Iv c4.<br />
We are nearing the year end and  are facing problem regarding lots of difference between the Inventory valuation and the Finance Ledger for each month end (31st to be exact). <br />
<br />
What could be the reasons  for this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Are all integration records posted to finance? Any Errors? You will have to go into detail. Check the transaction types that are used on the inventory accounts. Is there anything unexpected? Probably you have done manual postings. <br />
No general advice can be given here. But in my experience, those differences mostly arise from wrong integration setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">31st December 2002, 07:49</div></div><div class="posttext">2nd biggest source of differences is postdated or misdated inventory transactions. Inventory Valuation report is derived from inventory history tranasactions (I believe primarily inv700). <br />
<br />
Any postdated inventory transactions entered after a monthend will impact ledger and Inventory Valuation reports differently. Need to reconcile these differences through tfgld410 analysis.<br />
