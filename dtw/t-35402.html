There appears to be a lot of solution code for the problem Corrupted Inventory however they all refer to the same session whcor0200m000.<br />
<br />
Maybe you need to install those solutions and then run the whcor0200m000 again. Alternatively you could always ask OPS to assist u.<br />

<br />
Well there are a lot of solutions relating to corrupt inventory after SP14. I remember one of my client is also facing a similar problem and they contacted OPS for solution. I think you should do the same rather than applying the SPs by yourself.<br />

<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
already run whcor0200m000. There is an error report printed. You can refer to the attachment. I don't know which session to run after that error.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

The output is coming means there is definately the corruption of inventory.<br />
Did you run it in 'UPDATE MODE&quot; , with both the rebuild inventory checked in the first form?<br />
Please make sure you give some variable name also to correction location.<br />
<br />
Try this and then see if the problem is fixed?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I have checked the update options in the first tab. I have placed correction location as DUMMY. Yet, still the same error. I think I have to use GTM to change the necessary differences manually. The Clear Corrupted Inventory seems unable to solve it. What do you think?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<br />
I have also encountered the same messages from clients, and I run the correction program and it gets fixed.<br />
<br />
I suggest you to check all the transactions for the item for which you are getting the error message.<br />
<br />
Check whinr110, whinh200/whinh210/whinh220, whwmd tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toletofhitachi</div><div class="date">17th May 2007, 06:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi KS,<br />
<br />
thanks for your information.<br />
<br />
I have solved the problem using GTM. The files involved are whwmd215, whinr110, whinr140 and whinr150. The figures should tally in all these files. Then, run whcor0200m000 (update mode). There will be an error report printed but user be able to run the issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
