<br />
We are in the process of migrating from b2 to c4. in our newly setup c4 company, we cannot access the price field (tdsls041.pric) of the maintain so lines session. <br />
<br />
We are using the standard session; the field type is also set to &quot;input&quot;; all our items are cost price calculated.<br />
<br />
After the order qty field  is filled-up, the cursor jumps to the amount field?! skipping the price field!!<br />
<br />
Any parametric set-up we missed? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time!</div></div><hr />

thanks martin! yes i wasn't able to access the field in any case. I'm so sorry that i'm such in a hurry i forgot to include more  details.<br />
<br />
actually there is this error message that appears after i keyed in the order qty, &quot;Actual calendar not found when planning forward for work center on this date with 0 time units of planning time&quot;.<br />
<br />
i was able to work around this error by updating our company calendar in the process module.<br />
<br />
so sorry for the lack of info...<br />
<br />
thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />
