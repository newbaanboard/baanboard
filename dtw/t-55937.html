<br />
Dear Baanboard,<br />
<br />
we have the following situation:<br />
<br />
1 headquater with production having 1 local warehouse 010.<br />
<br />
Now an electronic department is part of the company located far away from the headquater, having it's own warehouse 020.<br />
<br />
Both are working in 1 BaaN company, but now having 2 warehouses, with 2 purchase departments.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
<br />
Some of the items are used by the main company as well as the remote department which has it's one purchase department.<br />
<br />
How can we handle this in BaaN IV. Up to now we just use MRP. But MRP is not dividing the 2 warehouses.<br />
<br />
What are other posibilities (like INV, DRP or multilogistic). The solution should be very easy to handle.<br />
<br />
In short: <br />
How can we manage the 2 different warehouses somehow independ from each other, having own settings like minimal inventory or safety stock, the goods from the supplier should be delivered directly to the warehouses (either 010 or 020).<br />
<br />
Thanks for any ideas.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

<br />
(1) Main inventory 010, disponible = Yes -&gt; Using MRP<br />
(2) Remote inventory 020, disponible = No -&gt; Using INV<br />
<br />
We can not use DRP, because the material flow should be possible directly to the remote inventory 020. As far as we understand, DRP Requirement is transferred to the highest level, where the main inventory is filled by mrp purchase order proposals. The material flow from the supplier is only possible to the main inventory. Then the material is transferred to the sub inventories using DRP transfers.<br />
<br />
Any comments ...<br />

1. First create a normal warehouse &amp; define two different locations in the same warehouse , where you can define the safety , inventory stock <br />
2.You can use Supply chain Functionality where you can take receipts of the same PO &amp; line in two diffrerent warehouse by generating a session from the ASN receipts</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you for your answer.<br />
<br />
Can you please explain how to setup different locations within one warehouse and how to define specific values per location e.g. safte stock.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

One way to do is using DRP, but DRP will not let you transfer the inventory between two netable warehouse and you need 010 and 020 to be nettable warehouse.<br />
<br />
This is what I think one of the approach in standard Baan<br />
<br />
1. Create two WIP warehouses and attach them to workcenter.<br />
2. Define supply chain for the parts to be transferred from 010 and 020 and you can set t<br />
3. When MRP runs it will create Purchase order in primary warehouse.<br />
4. Once production orders are created and released on the floor, the requirements will be transferred from 010 and 020 to the respective WIP warehouses<br />
5. DRP can then be run to generate replenishment order.<br />
<br />
Other approach will need customization, but is fairly simple customization<br />
1. Create a Baan session that will check where the inventory needs to be transferred say with in X days<br />
2. Based in this create a plan DRP order (automatically) and transfer it to RPL<br />
<br />
This is what we have done in past. We implemented this in focus factories and there were lot of parts that were common and we don't want to go for DRP. So we customized it.<br />

<br />
thank you for your answer and solutions.<br />
<br />
One important point for the solution is:<br />
<br />
We have 2 purchase departments for each warehouse.<br />
<br />
They want to order the items by themself and the shiping from the supplier should be direct to the warehouse (either 010 or 020) where the order was started.<br />
<br />
As I understand BaaN IV standard, this is not possible with DRP. <br />
<br />
We first want to check the standard before trying to find a solution by customizing the standard.<br />
<br />
Any further ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">19th June 2009, 07:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Its the limitation of MRP.<br />
<br />
MRP generates a consolidated PO (thats the principal of MRP), so it may generate one PO for requirement for both 010 and 020 warehouse, if criteria is met like with in order interval etc. So, common components will be an issue. MRP orders will get generated to one warehouse. so for e.g. if 010 needs 50 pcs and 020 needs 60 pcs of a certain component in same order interval, system may generate one MRP order of 110 pcs, and at times you can see the two orders will get generated 50 pcs and 60 pcs. Also, only one buyer can be attached in item master, so when such POs are transferred, then it wil be under that buyer. To separate the POs as per warehouse, system modification would be reqd, that will split the MRP POs and also attach correct buyer. I won't say this is a difficult cusotmization, as it involve only changing one table and that will give you the desired result. <br />
<br />
<br />
You can use DRP the way I mentioned. DRP cannot be used between 010 and 020 directly, but can be used between WIP and nettable warehouses. The draw back of using WIP warehouse is that the requirements are transferred to WIP warehouses only when the production order is released, and in our process, this was too late. Hence we went for customization.  Again it is a very straight foward customization.<br />
