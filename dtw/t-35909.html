Please can you tell me if there is anyway on Baan 5 to check which user booked in (receipted) a cost purchase order.  I can find the time and date, but no user id.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

You can use whinr110 in Baan 5 which records all the inventory transactions.<br />
or.. the other way you can go to warehouse order line history and look fir the last set of that PO. The login there will be of the person who received the material.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I asked this same question of our systems department quite some time ago and was told that they could not retrieve this information since it is not logged anywhere in the tables. The log-in id is recorded for our part numbered items (PP), but not for cost items (CST).<br />
<br />
One thing we considered was adding a field to the receiving transaction screen that would require the receiver to enter their initials. That way we would have something to reference when issues arose.  However, we have not moved forward with that at this time.<br />
<br />
If you find a solution to this, I would appreciate it if you would let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sue</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you use audit management, you could try printing an audit report off for tdpur table and look for the transaction by receipt date.<br />
<br />

In that screen you can find the user that did the receipt. See also attached screen.</div></div><hr />
