<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">26th August 2010, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that tdsls401.cvps and tdsls401.cvqs has got a high value sometime after Sales order line was created but before getting Released to Warehousing. I know this because I looked at tdsls451. And then the order line got shipped. The sales unit, sales price unit and inventory unit are all the same as per inventory transactions and also on Sales order header. <br />
<br />
Am trying to simulate if that is possible. So, I would like to know, when are the times during which these 2 fields are getting updated. <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />
