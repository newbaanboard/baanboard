<br />
We have just implemented Bar coding using Lot Control.<br />
<br />
We are having some issue with Outbound and was hoping somebody may have some suggestions.<br />
<br />
We generate our outbound advice, which in turn creates suggested lots on the advice line.  <br />
<br />
When we pick the goods we dont necessary pick what is suggested by baan. We select the first advice line and change the lot from the suggested to the actual and can also change the quantity.<br />
<br />
If this fulfils the total requirements we then carry on to confirm shipment.<br />
<br />
But in back ground on the outbound advice line the other suggested lots are still allocated on the stock unpicked (giving us problems when trying to ship these out on other orders).  <br />
<br />
At present we are having to manually go back into the advice highlight the suggested lots that have not been picked and delete them off to free up the allocated LOT number to allow us to ship out on other orders.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else come across this problem using lots? :(</div></div><hr />

We addressed this issue in Baan IV, more that 10 years ago. Actually when we picked the lot we do lot swapping. We used to check if the lot that was picked was on other order, if so swap it with the order, else then it is assumed that the lot that is picked was not allocated. For this we created a index in the outbound table with Lot and Item (and other fields) as index. <br />
I don't see any other way. But if your requirement is to track the lots shipped to customer, then probably you don't need to implement lot control in Baan. In my current installation we only keep track of lot that are shipped, and the same info is captured while shipping (by our shipping systeM) and is transferred back to Baan and we store that in additional table.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I have come up with a solution that I think might work.<br />
<br />
Instead of Generate Outbound and letting Baan suggest the lots required.  I create the outbound advice by scanning in the lot number to be used, this way we are only allocating lot numbers that are going to be despatched to customers.<br />
<br />
I'm just going to trial it with our bar coding system and see how we get on.<br />
<br />

You essentially are creating Maintain Outbound data your self. However, I have two question- 1. What document will the picker in warehouse will use to pick the goods. 2. In what sequence will the orders come to warehouse, how will you handle if the item is backordered etc. I am assuming your shipping operation is pick pack and you are in make to stock envrionment. Becuase in such environment, your suggestion is not practical. However, if you are always shipping against an order etc.. then it might work.<br />

<br />
We do both Roll to order and stock goods.<br />
<br />
We have for years been using an 'advisory picking list', a report we created in baan.  They use this to pick the goods and then we use the picking/shipment stages in baan as the loading/despatch stage.<br />
<br />
So our warehouse guys will have a form of pick list already to create these outbound advice lines, this should work for us and our barcode system.<br />
<br />
If goods are not in stock then they are automatically put on a backorder and the office will print another advisory pick list for the balance of the order.<br />
<br />
We should be testing this process out this week.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
