during release purchase order to warehouse I get the message<br />
&quot;Language is required in warehouse orders&quot;.<br />
But in the session &quot;warehouse orders&quot; is no Language field.<br />
I presume it is filled from somewhere else, as a default.<br />
But I don't no where.<br />
Can anyone help me.<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

if you look more carefully you should be able to see a language field. In LN at least it is part of the warehouse order details as part of the miscellaneous. It will most likely impact some of the documents that will be part of the procedure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">schweizer</div><div class="date">8th November 2006, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jens,<br />
thank you for your answer but there is no Question about the importance of the language field rather than to find a way to fill it.<br />
If I start the release to warehouse procedure from the Porchase order I have no choice to enter it in the warehouse order so it has to be a default.<br />
And else, when I start the warehouse order session directly I have no choice to fill it either because it is not on the form and where is only one form.<br />
If I watch the details of an older outbound (not the lines) I find the language field filled. <br />
And furthermore, when I start the warehouse order session a question pops up &quot;filling defaults yes/no&quot;<br />
and I found defaults but without a language field.<br />
So what you think about that.<br />
Best regards <br />

in tccom0500m000 the country and (or) language has to be defined and when it is used as default in warehouse orders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've recently encountered the same problem (LN 6.1, FP5) and found this thread. Thanks for posting it.<br />
<br />
I've got it resolved by entering the 'Language' in &quot;General Company Data'  (tccom0502m000)</div></div><hr />
