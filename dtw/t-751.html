<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Commandeur</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 21:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on baan ERP 5.0c.<br />
<br />
We have discover a problem for us : baan has generated one shipment for 2 of our sales order. It was told by baan that it was not possible. But according to tables and sessions structure it seems possible and it has happen.<br />
<br />
Do you think it is a bug, a new functionnality, and if someone know, is there a paramter to change to stop that. It creates big problems for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Commandeur</div><div class="date">12th January 2002, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan support respond to us. It is an standard functionnality. I call that an hidden functionnality because there no parameters and it is not tell in baan docs. Here is the full response of support :<br />
<br />
We checked the sources and did some tests our internal system. Here the outcome of our analysis with the Product Owner of Baan ERP Warehousing:<br />
<br />
What you observed is the standard functionality. When the shipping data, planned delivery date (&amp; time) and delivery data are identical, the system consolidates the relevant order lines into one shipment ID.<br />
<br />
The system is indeed not checking on sales order number. The address is what is important. There is no parameter to split this.<br />
<br />
In case the following properties are the same, the same shipment ID will be used (as long as the shipment is not confirmed yet):<br />
<br />
· Ship to code<br />
· Ship to adres<br />
· Ship to type<br />
· Ship from type<br />
· Ship from code<br />
· Ship from adres<br />
· Route<br />
· Planned delivery date<br />
· Terms of delivery<br />
· Load<br />
· Carrier<br />
<br />
So basically if you ship something to the same address with the same delivery date and carrier along the same route, it will be put on one shipment Id. Which makes sense. It should not matter with which sales order the goods are delivered.<br />
<br />
<br />
As said they have tested on them system to check that, so they was not aware of the functionnality.... <br />
<br />
So beware, if you using baan ERP 5.0c take care of that!</div></div><hr />

The sales order with 137 was all shipped to the same BP ship-to address, same delivery date for all lines.  All lines were outbounded from the same warehouse.  I'm currently testing the impact of shipping contraints ('None' is the setting for the header and lines).</div></div><hr />
