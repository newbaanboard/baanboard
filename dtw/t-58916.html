<br />
when i enter a new purchase order's line, for some items, the price is extracted and for others it is not. <br />
For those which have the right price; in order's line details; price's origin is &quot;supplier price list&quot;.<br />
For those which don't have prices, price's origin is &quot;item purchase&quot;. <br />
All items have correct prices filled in session tdpcg0131m000.<br />
I declared my unique pricelist as the default supplier's pricelist in tdpcg0100m000.<br />
<br />
Could you please help me ?<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SujithKumar</div><div class="date">30th July 2010, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">It appears to be a price list set up issue (price matrix/sequence etc), thats why it shows up for some and not others. Even though default price list is there, it probably overrulled by additional setup<br />
This is from a Baan 5 perspective. It might be little bit different in LN</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pricing can be maintained for the supplier via Pricing Module by putting matrix definition &amp; sequence with and/or price list also can be maintained which can be linked with particulars supplier or others also.<br />
<br />
Setup of Pricing:<br />
(1)	Matrix Definition &lt;&gt; integration with attributes of Supplier<br />
(2)	Matrix Sequence<br />
(3)	Price Book Codes<br />
(4)	Price Books &lt;&gt; put the price rate of Item<br />
(5)	Price Matrix &lt;&gt; integration with supplier<br />
<br />
Easy Work around: Price list can be made to avoid any complexity also.</div></div><hr />

Regarding the prices problem, i should be ashamed ;)<br />
The error was SOO simple : prices were entered with a wrong supplier's code lol.</div></div><hr />
