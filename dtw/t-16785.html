<br />
  My Question is based on Baan Vc.<br />
<br />
  I'm using the session whina1210m000 (Perform Inventory Valuation by W/h &amp; Item).<br />
<br />
The output of the session gives me the Inv. Val Amount, Inv. Val on Hand and the Inv. MAUC per Item  ... among other details.<br />
(This report is printed without the Cost Details)<br />
<br />
I'm interested in knowing how the value of this &quot;Inv. Val Amount&quot; is calculated (This is a report field). Is there any specific table I can look at for this value or any dll I can call to calculate this value. <br />
(Can I directly pick the values from tcibd007 or the ticpr300 series tables ?<br />
Sometimes these are different than what's printed on the report)<br />
<br />
Please advise. Thanks<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Little John</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are on BaaN 4C4, Location &amp; Lot Implemented. When we run this inventory valuation report on a specific day and on specific items, the inventory on hand is in negative. How is this possible under lot control?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In B5.0c, it is possible to print &quot;Cost Components&quot;, as there is separate flag in the session.<br />
<br />
The amount is calculated based on the 'To-be Consumed Qty' present in whinr112 table, along with the amount present in whinr113 table.<br />
<br />
Note: In B5.0b, both quantity and amount are present in whinr112 itself. Since whinr113 is not present, the amount is the cumulative amount and is not possible to find amount by cost components.</div></div><hr />
