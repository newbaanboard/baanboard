Here I have query regarding Purchase Collect Orders. <br />
<br />
As far as I know , collect order means online posting in Inventory and Finance ( By-pass Receipt step) at the time of order maintain.<br />
<br />
But how the receipt Number is generated for Collect Order , Like I have define Receipt &quot;TWO Digit&quot; for Receipt Number in Purchase Parameter.In tmcs0147m000 (maintain free Numbers ), I have two series say 10 and 20.<br />
<br />
Then where can I define receipt series should be selected for Collect Order ??<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance <br />
<br />

<br />
System will not generate any receipt number for collect orders. Once you complete keying-in a purchase order line, subsession tdilc4113s000-Maintain receipts(ILC) will be invoked and you have to tab through that session which will default with the order line quantity. If you see the receipt no. in 'display receipts' session, it will show zero as receipt number. This is the standard functionality. In fact, while creating the order type, you might have noticed that system did not allow to add 'Maintain Receipts(tdpur4120m000) as an order step for collect orders.<br />
<br />
If you want to change the received quantity, you have to go to the Purchase order line-&gt;special-&gt;zoom-&gt;Maintain Receipts(ILC) and do the changes. Also there is no back-order business for collect orders. Meaning, if you change the quantity in tdilc4113s000, PO-line will automatically change to that quantity.<br />
