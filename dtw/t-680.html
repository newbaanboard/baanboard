We use 'UPS -Worldship' just a standalone application.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">23rd January 2002, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an interface between UPS &amp; Baan as well as worldship standalone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">25th January 2002, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">can you share more info on what data you put throught the interface ?<br />
Does it work with Baan Exchange?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francoisp</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 04:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Which ways should the interface work? From Baan to UPS (supplying customer #, address, order number, packing slip #) or is it from UPS to Baan (order #, waybill #)? Or maybe both ways?<br />
<br />
I know a company that generate a flat file (using the outbound advices data) every hour or so, FTP the file to a FTP server accessible by their UPS system. The file is manually uploaded in the UPS system by the shipping person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">31st January 2002, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">We work from Baan to UPS. At the point of release outbound a file is created to print a label and and additional file is updated with the delivery details. At the end of each day this file is used to print a manifest document for the UPS driver and is also emailed to UPS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">1st February 2002, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like the solution we are going to create will be UPS (WorldShip) to Baan.  Tracking information will be brought in and stored in a new table, and freight costs will be read and used to update the delivered quantity of the freight &quot;cost&quot; item.  WorldShip allows you to customize the export to happen immediately and include the data you want.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all for their information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dieter</div><div class="date">26th March 2010, 13:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anybody created in the meantime an interface to Worldship ? <br />
<br />
I have a customer on ERP LN FP3 who need such an interface on short notice. I am thinking about a customisation in ERP LN to create the necessary XML files for Worldship 12.0, but I don´t want to invent the wheel again ;-)<br />

We also expanded that to include FedEx as well. We have successfully implemented this with customers running on Baan IV, V and LN. It provides a one way or two way integration, and handles all of the following: <br />
<br />
* Interface to Sales Orders by optionally inserting a freight line<br />
• Updates for freight amount, freight type, quantity shipped, tracking ID, etc...<br />
• Exception reporting to identify and correct potential issues immediately<br />
• Extensive historical tracking<br />
• Option to configure sales order(s) into shipping cartons (Compose and<br />
Confirm Shipments) and Pallet Assignment<br />
<br />
Email me if you would like additional information: kbarthelt@crossroadsrmc.com.<br />
