I would like to know in Standard Baan during inventory adjustment why doesn't Baan check whether a lot is blocked or not? Logically, should it not check whether a lot is blocked before during inventory adjustment? I am using B4c3</div></div><hr />

<br />
inventory adjustment is very often used for outbound to nowhere resp. inbound from nowhere. This is very simply and practical for many users. But theoretical this is an correction. There are 100 pieces in Baan but physically there are 80 pieces. Why should Baan not allow to correct it i.e. adjust the inventory.<br />
