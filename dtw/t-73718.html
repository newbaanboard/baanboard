<br />
One of my major customers would like to send a Sales Order Through normal process (Not EDI), But would like to receive the Invoice thru EDI. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to do this setup?. Have anyone had such scenario before.<br />
<br />
If anyone can give some ideas, it would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">9th February 2021, 13:53</div></div><div class="posttext">We have that setup in my current workplace. The customer places Sales Order through the web which integrates into LN. The SO comes up as CRM Order type. Once it gets processed, it get invoiced through EDI. I wasn't involved in the setup of this. I just noticed it when they wanted a series of invoices re-processed, which I did through EDI.</div></div><hr />
