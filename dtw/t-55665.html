<br />
I have this testing results regarding the use of Consignment(not woned) warehouse and hope someone can help to confirm this is what Baan can offer<br />
<br />
I understand and tested that when the inventory in the consign warehouse is transfered to our warehouse, the invoice process is triggered. In the background, Baan actually create a PO and a receipt for this.<br />
<br />
Imagine I transfered multiple items from the same consign warehouse using the same warehouse order (transfer(manual)),  Baan also create multiple PO number for this. <br />
<br />
My question : is there any parameter to set so that if the items are transfered from the same consign warehouse, there should be only one PO (with multiple line) generated instead of multiple PO.</div></div><hr />
