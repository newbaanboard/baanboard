<br />
I m fixed in a situation and client's requirement is such that i m confused. can somebody help me on this.<br />
<br />
Actually, Client have Service contracts with various vendors on Annual Basis(Monthly Bucket) and as per the agreement he has to release payment every month. But now every time he has to create a purchase order with item called service and qty as 1 and then after maintaining its receipts, he is able to release payment. But every month he has to do this process and he wants to avoid this scenario. In starting he has maintained a Purchase Contract for whole year and he wants that when ever he wants to relaese payment, he doesn't want to create PO.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to handle this type of query. may be thru Service Module or thru Blanket Purchase Order or some other work arround.<br />
<br />
please advice.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
