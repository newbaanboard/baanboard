When the order qty is 100, in maintain deliveries, more than 100 is delivered and the system accepts. Can we have any check on the quantity at this point?<br />

<br />
This is a good example, however, of a task that would be very simple to do with a little programming knowledge and one of the various tools (e.g., RMCgen (http://www.rmcis.com/rmvgen.html), QKey, etc.) available for customizing Baan scripts/libraries without having the Baan source code.  You could just add a simple if clause to the check.input section for the tdsls045.dqua field.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps/makes sense.</div></div><hr />

But if there is a concept of Tolerances, then setting up the Tolerences should help you to an extent. This way you need not customize anything on standard Baan.<br />
<br />
For your information, This problem is not there on Baan V.</div></div><hr />

Maxime, was right, overdelivery originally was not allowed in 5.0c. And talk about human are never satisfied, our client was previously on 4.0c4 and there they're happy because they can overdeliver, but now that they're on 5.0c, they actually complain about the inability to overdeliver. Contrast this with Kumars' case, where the site was complaining about the ability to overdeliver in 4.0c4 :)<br />
<br />
However, lately Baan has ported the ability to overdeliver from 5.2a to 5.0c. We haven't fully installed this new feature on the client's 5.0c, but I think we will soon. And when we've finally done it, their 5.0c will be able to overdeliver like the old 4.0c4 :)<br />

This is possible as well in Baan ERP 5.0b. The kind of control in ERP 5b is to set up the parameter fo Delivery Tolerance percentage. With this while making deliveries / receipts we get the warnign message. But still user can ignore the same and go ahead.<br />
<br />
So only option to avoide Excess delivery / receipts would be to customize the standard.<br />

Overdelivery is not available in standard 5.0c. Baan issued solution number 124852 to enable overdelivery for this release<br />
