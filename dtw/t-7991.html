<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">9th December 2002, 08:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to use slow moving items inventory. I am working on BIVc4 &amp; ILC is implemented in live company.<br />
<br />
For a particular item there is an annual issue of 36 nos, but the slow moving analysis report is showing an annual usage of 108. <br />
<br />
Please find attached both these reports generated by running sessions tdinv7410m000 &amp; tdinv6220m000.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me in understandung this functionality.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">9th December 2002, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is some information from Baan's knowledgebase regarding the calculation of annual issue for that report:<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
Perform Slow-Moving Analysis by Item (tdinv6220m000)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
How is annual issue in slow moving analysis calculated?<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The slow moving average is calculated as the annual issue divided by the inventory on hand.<br />
<br />
The annual issue used in the slow moving analysis of an item is calculated on the basis of data in table tdinv750 (Item issue by period). <br />
<br />
The programs looks at the data of the most recent 12/13 periods (depending on the setting of &quot;Period Length for Item History&quot; in &quot;Maintain INV Parameters&quot; (tdinv0100m000)) in table tdinv750. Within this period of 12/13 periods the quantities issued are cumulated (added up) and then divided by N (see below) to give the average monthly issue in the last 12 months. The average period issue is then multiplied by the 12/13 to give the estimated annual issue.<br />
<br />
The number of periods N starts with the oldest period within the last 12/13 periods with a quantity unequal to zero (negative is also possible) and continues until the present period. So the first period with an issue unequal to zero is the starting point. Later periods with issue equal to zero are included in the calculation of the average.<br />
<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE(S):<br />
<br />
Period Length for Item History = Month<br />
Current Day = 4/July/2000<br />
Item = 11114496000<br />
<br />
Year Period Issue<br />
****** ******** ******<br />
1999 4 200<br />
1999 5 651<br />
1999 6 0<br />
1999 7 0<br />
1999 8 0<br />
1999 9 0<br />
1999 10 0<br />
1999 11 509<br />
1999 12 400<br />
2000 1 0<br />
2000 2 0<br />
2000 3 0<br />
2000 4 300<br />
2000 5 0<br />
2000 6 217<br />
2000 7 10<br />
<br />
The slow moving analysis starts with the item issue in period 8 in 1999 and ends with period 7 in 2000.<br />
The total quantity is: 509 + 400 + 300 + 217 + 10 = 1436<br />
<br />
N starts with period number 11/1999.<br />
The next found periods are 12/2000 and periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of 2000. This is a total of 9 periods.<br />
<br />
The calculated monthly issue is 1436/9 = 159.6<br />
the estimated annual issue is 159.6 * 12 = 1915<br />

<br />
Thanks for the detailed reply. It works fine in my case. I hope I will learn a lot from you in future.<br />
<br />
Can you please favour me by sending me detailed documentation regerding inventory module.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">You are welcome.<br />
<br />
However, I do not have any detailed documentation regarding the inventory module.  Our company requried a customized report so that they could specify different slow-moving analysis parameters by item group, so I had to investigate how that session ran to mimic the calculations.<br />
<br />
Sorry.</div></div><hr />
