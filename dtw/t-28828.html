<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nidyar</div><div class="date">9th December 2006, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be total 5 inventory tables for Inventory:<br />
1. Item<br />
2. Lot<br />
3. Location<br />
4. Warehouse<br />
5. Planned Inventory transactions.<br />
Condition is Inventory on hand, Inventory on Order, Inventory Allocated and Inventory Blocked for a given item should be same in all the tables. If it is different, BaaN Usually gives this kinda error message. This situation will come when you have a conversion factor such that the transaction goes into too many digits after decimal. Also if the server date is modified be someone (Which is a CRIME) same situation may occur.<br />
There is a solution available somewhere in BaaN site. you can modify the inventory to match all the tables through GTM. Try to get the inventory tables list.<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your feedback, the problem was resolved by correcting records in whinr140 and whinr150 tables for ERP LN 6.1<br />
the allocation was a problem.<br />
<br />
Lots of thanks to you for addressing additional info.<br />
