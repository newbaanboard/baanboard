<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">28th September 2006, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a case where the goal for sales of an item is at, let's say, 5000 units.<br />
<br />
Because they are of high value, we don't order a lot of them in at a time.<br />
<br />
Because of the human factor, there are chances to want to reorder stock for inventory that may well go over the 5000 yearly limit mark.<br />
<br />
5000 to sell per year,<br />
Inventory in at 1000 units, now only 4000 left for the year<br />
Inventory in at 2500 more, now next inventory in can only be a max of 1500 ....  until the end of year is determined.<br />
<br />
We are wondering if there is a way to  limit inventory replenishment from occurring past a set Max of time?  The current functionality we see can limit each replenishment to a max value of quantity, but not a time stamp.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great !</div></div><hr />

Example: <br />
planned stock for January: 1500 pcs<br />
planned stock for February: 2000 pcs<br />
<br />
In that case you might consider the use of MPS, if not already active at your company. Just search thtrough the board and you'll find lots of queries on this topic which can be of any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">29th September 2006, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we do use MPS here on product but it will not prevent someone from ordering more than a yearly maximum, at least not that I know of ...  :( Still fairly new at this stuff ...<br />
<br />
Because the product is a model year only inventory, we don't want to stock lots of items at the end of the year with a 2006 part number when the 2007's are coming out.<br />
<br />
So, if a yearly sales target is ONLY 5000 units, and we have sold 4500 units as of November ( only 500 itens posible now for reorder), we want to ensure that someone doesn't decide in November to order up another 1000 items into our stock. <br />
<br />
We want to prevent human judgement from ordering 1000 and tell them the max for they can order is only 500 items for the 2006 period ( in this example ).  Does that help for an explanation ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">4th October 2006, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried purchase contracts ?<br />
They allow you to set Effectivity and Expiry dates,<br />
and quantities to order within that period for a specific supplier \ item.<br />
<br />
As you 'consume' the contract against purchase orders, it keeps track of how many you have purchased against the contract.<br />
<br />
I have never used purchase contracts in production, but it may be of some assistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">4th October 2006, 21:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting. Nope, we've never used them. We'll check out that functionality and report back ...  thx !  (Y)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">5th October 2006, 03:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
You can keep track of quantity in Purchase Contract. And then I believe if you update the Inventory Allowed date, system will not plan for the Item, also you can add signal code and block for purchase. I guess, this is a small customization, but will easily accomplish that you are looking for.<br />
