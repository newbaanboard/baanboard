<br />
We are in BaaN 5c<br />
We have received an Item and on 19-09-2019, however the &quot;Calculate Cost and Valuation Prices&quot; date for the Item was done on the 23-09-2019 (after reception) now that we want to approve the inspection, 02-10-2019, we get error &quot;XXX-XXXX Item does not have standard cost for date 19-09-2019&quot;.  I have tried to run the session &quot;Calculate Cost and Valuation Prices&quot; (ticpr2210m000) backporting date to 19-09-2019 but doesn't do the calculation ( and I understand, you should not be able to calculate in the past). So, we cannot approve this reception.<br />
<br />
I have checked tables ticpr300 301, 305 and 340, I could do GTM with the 19-09-2019 but, I am not sure if I have to use this last resource to solve this issue.<br />
<br />
All inputs are appreciated.:confused:</div></div><hr />
