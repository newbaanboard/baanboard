My company is running scenarios in a test environment with ILC turned off.  (We are accustomed to using the ILC environment).<br />
<br />
We have Sales Orders for customized items with a project attached to it.  We've gone through the whole Sales Order delivery process and noticed when we look at some of the Display Inventory transaction sessions, the project is not visible. It seems like the project has disappeared. <br />
What happens to the project once the Production order is complete and the Sales order is shipped and processed? <br />
Is there a way to keep track of the projects tied to the inventory and it's location in the warehouses all the way through the processing?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />

But do you know what happens to the project once the production order is closed?<br />
Is there a way to see what has happened to the inventory?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
My speciality Finance , but I have had enough experience with the PCS module to know that to track inventory movements the Location control must be switched on.....otherwise you will be staring into a black hole.If you had ILC switched on you can track customised inventory in tdilc1520m000 to name a few.<br />
Once the Prod Order is closed you will have in stock the customised inventory, but you will not be able to get any details as you have your ILC switched off.<br />
