<br />
I was working in maintain deliveries (tdsls4120m000) and released two lines with qty 0 for invoicing. However, the qty wasn't supposed to be 0. Normally, I would be able to put the positions into backorder to change the order. However, because the qty is 0 that is not possible.<br />
<br />
I tried removing the lines in maintain deliveries (tdsls4120m000) but then it tells me that isn't possible.<br />
<br />
Is there any solution to this?</div></div><hr />
