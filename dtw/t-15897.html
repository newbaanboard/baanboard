<br />
Transit warehouse is required in when you want to use the RPL Functionality.<br />
For this you have to define a warehouse in&quot; Maintain Warehouse&quot; and Warehouse type:Transit. No need of any other settings.<br />
<br />
Hope the above solution is clear to you,<br />

<br />
We use the functionality of Transit warehouse in Replenishment Order system, and it is used as have been told by Ramakrish (by making a warehouse of type transit as in defined in Maintain warehouses) <br />
<br />
After doing this make a order type in RPL orders which has both Maintain RPL Deliveries as well as Maintain RPL receipts as Order steps and then while you would be making RPL Order it will automatically ask for Transit warehouse.<br />
<br />
Hope the above resolves all your queries.<br />
