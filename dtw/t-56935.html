<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">twinsett</div><div class="date">6th October 2009, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone ever added a new record to the single file conversion set ups.  I need to add one to the 856S for serial numbers.  I created the new record set up, but it only gets the first record per the LIN and not all the records associated with the LIN.  We have source code and I also modified the specific dll for the 856 outbound for the new data.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">9th October 2009, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">The change has to be made in the EDI DLL in such a way that it reads the serial numbers for each line record. It appears, its reading the value for the first record only. If you are sure, the DLL changes are correct then check the EDI conversion setup.<br />
<br />
Add the new field in the LIN segment that it can read in the middle ( by choosing the appropriate sequence number) of the LIN values. Some times, adding the new field in the end of the LIN segment will not work if it was not porperly looped.<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">twinsett</div><div class="date">9th October 2009, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks so much for the reply.  I have the LIN properly ended with the looping since it is sequental.  This new segment occurs after the LTX, which is after the LIN.  I named it SRN and have it as repetitive.  I have tried making it sequental, but that didn't work either.  I will check my DLL again to make sure it is correct.  Since I have multiple serial numbers per item, I created the SRN below the LIN segment.</div></div><hr />

We are also working with this and have not yet managed to solve multiple serial number for a line.<br />
Who did you set it up in the Dll?<br />
Best regards<br />
