<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">2nd January 2006, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally spoken you get this message only when you try to generate a pull call off (from assembly) before a pull forecast schedule exists. The solution is then to let EP generate a pull forecast schedule. After that, a call off can be generated.<br />
<br />
In your situation, you try to generate a pull forecast schedule from EP and you get this message which is meant for call offs? Do I understand you correctly?<br />
<br />
By the way: is the flag 'Purchase Schedule in Use' in the purchase contract lines set to Yes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes .. that what my problem is ....<br />
<br />
As far as Item base data is concern , Schedule in use is YES and schedule type = PULL schedule.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evert-Jan Bosch</div><div class="date">9th January 2006, 09:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably the problem is that EP generates planned purchase orders. That is meant for actual purchase orders. When the planned purchase order is transfered to order management, purchase decides that is should be a purchase schedule. And then it will not work.<br />
<br />
In the EP - purchase schedules integration, planned purchase orders are not used. EP has a direct integration with purchase schedules. During the planning process, the purchase schedule lines are removed, updated and inserted automatically.<br />
<br />
I attached a screen dump of the web help concerning the integration EP - Purchase schedules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the reference of above comments, we able to generate the pull forecast schedule, now the problem is we are not able to generate the &quot;pull call off schedule&quot; and receiving against these schedlue. A pull call off schedule with the same number as pull forecast is required to receive the components.<br />

Any suggestions ?<br />
