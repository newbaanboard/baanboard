<br />
When we implemented Baan 4c4 years ago, our people made a decision to setup all our Items to be Outbound Priority FIFO.  This has just complicated our environment unnessacarly.  The would like to change all of our items back to Outbound Priority Location.  <br />
<br />
I know when we do this for one or two items we would be required to adjust the inventory to 0, change the Item master field, and adjust the inventory back into the system. <br />
<br />
Is anyone aware of a session for Baan 4c4 or another way to do this for all items?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your  help.</div></div><hr />

You put in the old priority and the new.  You can run this over several ranges.  This session will then re-write the location data without the date.  I would test over a single item first and if you are happy go for it.</div></div><hr />

when you know what you're doing, do it with GTM:<br />
change itm001 and ilc101 (erase date fields)<br />
obviously: test first<br />
