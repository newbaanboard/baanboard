<br />
I am trying to create a Purchase Order in BaanERP 5.0c. PO Header gets created successfully but when I try to create a line, I get the following error<br />
<br />
Currency of Warehouse WH-01 not found.<br />
<br />
I have to pick this particular warehouse and I don't know why I am getting this error message. Has anybody an idea what I need to setup in order to overcome this error?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I'm running IVc3. I don't even see where I could assign a  currency to a warehouse!<br />
BaanV I haven't seen for so long I don't remember... :) So, I will assume you can specify currency for a warehouse.<br />
:D<br />
I have dealt with currency.  Have you defined the currency for the warehouse as a generic unit?  Session ttaad1106m000?<br />
Then the format? Sesion ttaad1107m000?<br />
I had messages like the one you described when I didn't define these things.<br />
Hope it helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 06:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure that you can do that in BaanERP 5.0c as well. Atleast I couldn't find any place where I could define a 'Currency' for the warehouse. <br />
<br />
More ideas???</div></div><hr />

It looks like you are setting up a new company.<br />
<br />
It checks for the warehouse currency in the following way.<br />
<br />
In tcmcs0503m00(warehouse), there is a enterprise unit field.<br />
Go to enterprise units(tgbrg0530m000), there is a company attached to it. Check for the currency fields in this compay in tcemm1570m000(Companies). You might not have filled the currencies Properly in the Company Data.<br />

<br />
Make sure the Enterprise Unit of the warehouse exists in the session Enterprise Units in tcemm.<br />
I have seen this error a few times after a new company was created from a copy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Also please check the package combinations and VRCs are correct. <br />
<br />
Some of our users faced this problem when we accidently shifted them to a higher VRC ( which was for development only)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">14th October 2003, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys. You were right. I was working on our 'development' environment' and using one of the test company, which I guess was not completely set-up. After setting the enterprise units right, I did run into other 'setup' problems but in the end, now it seems to be working fine. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help.</div></div><hr />
