<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">13th December 2002, 14:55</div></div><div class="posttext">This is great for taking care of the accounting, but we don't want this to show as a separate line item on the invoice to the customer.  For all they know, they are receiving product at a delivered price of $140.  They don't need to know that $100 of this is product and $40 of this is freight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">13th December 2002, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, or original implementation had freight as a cost item AND a direct delivery item.  Worked great to create the payable at the time of the transaction and everything.  We added code to the invoice routine to &quot;hide&quot; the freight - but had to spread it to ALL the items on the invoice (a little more work!).<br />

Just wondered, mostly from an accounting perspective - what other companies were doing.<br />
