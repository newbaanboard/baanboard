<br />
We are a little company located in Spain, we are thinking in to start the warehouse module in our BaaN.<br />
<br />
At the moment, we are using the SCH module and a little implementation of EDI to control the customer orders received by Internet. The last service pack which we are installed is the SP7.<br />
<br />
For this reason, we're looking someone who are using these functional qualities to knowing their experience.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help,<br />

<br />
Many, basic functional decisions must be made before implementing warehousing.  I would get a decent manual and study the functionality.  I would also gain a solid understanding of the parameter settings relevant to warehousing.  Include staff from planning and cost accounting as your decisions will/could effect their areas significantly.</div></div><hr />
