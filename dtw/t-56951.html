<br />
We are solding wire cables packed on wooden spools. These spools are belonging to one of our suppliers and they are serialized. <br />
Our customers have to return these packages within a certain delay of time otherwise the packages would be sold to him. Offcourse, in this case we have to pay our supplier.<br />
<br />
We would like to manage these packaging units on ERP LN.<br />
My idea is to create serialized item for these packing units and to set them as &quot;owned by supplier&quot;.<br />
<br />
I would be grateful to know your opinion about this case.<br />
<br />
I think the challenge would be how to change ownership : this change mustn't happen when we sell the cable to customers. but, only if the customer did not gave back the package in time.<br />
But, maybe &quot;ownership change based on delay&quot; can solve the problem. <br />
<br />
Actually, i can manage serialized spools in warehousing. I can enter the serial number manually when receiving goods.<br />
I also created one Warehouse for consignement (owned by our supplier), one order type dedicated to consignement...and i'm waiting for financial parameters to be set to continue testing.<br />
<br />
Any comment would is welcome.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />
