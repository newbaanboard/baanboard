<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">3rd December 2009, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We need to change the  &quot;Primary selection field in 'Maintain Deliveries' as  &quot;Picking list Number&quot;  from  &quot;Order Number&quot;  in  Maintain sales order parameters.  Before apply the changes, i have following questions.<br />
<br />
1.  What will happen to the old pending orders (waiting at Maintain deliveries stage) which are not having order step as &quot;Print picking list&quot;.<br />
<br />
2.  Is there any correction session available to correct the pending sales orders steps.<br />
<br />
(I have tried the above with test environment and  i could not deliver the sales order that are not having picking list as order step. System simply hangs until I revert the parameter to &quot;Order Number&quot;).<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The correct procedure would be to create a new order type including the Print Picking List step.  Let the old orders work out of the system.  Then change the Maintain Deliveries selection to Picking List Number.</div></div><hr />
