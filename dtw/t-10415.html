<br />
we are going to reorganize our statistics groups for purchased items. Is there a way to get a full statistic update which takes the new statistics groups into consideration? What effect does the setting Actual Supplier Data = YES has? Do we have to change the statistics group in the history table manually?<br />
<br />
Any help is highly appreciated :)<br />

<br />
No, after executing a full statistic update all the statistics data are deleted and to rebuild them the system uses the item statistic group stored in the historical table. Changing the item statistic group on tdsls451 should solve your problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;What effect does the setting Actual Supplier Data = YES has? &quot;<br />
<br />
If it is set to yes, the statistics are calculated on the actual supplier data on the supplier file. Otherwise the system uses the supplier data stored in the historical tables when the order had been inserted.<br />
<br />
Available for any further explanation.<br />

We have had the same problem, for sales: item groups, sales reps etc frequently change and we want statistics to show the information according to the latest information. Solution was to write a correction program that changed the information in the relevant sls tables (order and history) and do a complete update of stats.<br />
<br />
This can be done for purchase too. But be aware that  some of the field you can change using a correction program might be in finance as dimension, so the relation will be lost.<br />

This does not have any impact on integration.<br />
