we are trying to figure out how to manage rental through sales order. What we want to achieve is manage a sell of a service via sales order but I don't know how to properly manage trasfer of material (actually it still belongs to me) to an external warehouse. All manual?<br />
Do you have any idea to share?<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

This would need proper understanding of your situation and then give you solution. From the above your requirements are not very clear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andrea.mior@ing</div><div class="date">16th March 2017, 18:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks for answer.<br />
I want to sell a service, a rent of my item. To achieve this I have to give my item to my customer. For the rent period, the item is still mine but it is placed at customer's plant, so outside of my company/my warehouse.<br />
What I'm not able to understand, my fault, is how to manage all these aspect. I think I have to produce a sales order and sell an item of Item Type &quot;Cost&quot;. Here is my problem: how do I move my item outside of my warehouse and maintain a sort of evidence that 'this' item was shipped for rental, linked to a sales order? maual transfer and a note?<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe  the Maintenance Sales Order functionality should be considered<br />
as an option for below.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

@Ajesh, not all my inventroy is rented, only some kind of items.<br />
In general it looks strange to me that no one has similar requirements in LN.. :(</div></div><hr />

For above situation you should Go with Part Loan &amp; this is part of MSO . so using this you need to use  service module and this would definitely help  you out in respect of selling service and &quot;company owned ownership&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this would answer your query.<br />
<br />
