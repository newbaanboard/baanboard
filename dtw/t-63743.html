<br />
I would like to know solution for this scenario (BAAN IVc):<br />
<br />
If we have 50.000 widgets and we have 30 different orders with different widget amounts (total widget’s on order is 100.000). Would it be possible to pick and choose orders and quantities we want to ship to different customers? I would like to short ship to 30 different orders instead of completely full filling just a few. <br />
I don’t want some customers to get complete order and another one are not getting anything. <br />
<br />
I also want system to automatically deduct amount of widgets shipped from each order, instead of us readjusting quantities based on a short ship amount.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advanced.</div></div><hr />

If you don;t have elaborate location system then you can custom right a logic to allocated 50,000 pcs to 30 orders. But it will be custom logic.<br />

Shouldn't be than possible to ship just a few positions from each order and the rest would show as back order?</div></div><hr />
