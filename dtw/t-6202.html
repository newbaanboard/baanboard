<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">13th August 2002, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">The series for Warehouse Orders are hard-coded in the source code.  To be able to reset the series and re-use numbers  within the series it will be necessary to archive your INV/ILC (if applicable) data.  You will need to archive using sessions tdinv1201m000 Archive Warehouse Transactions by Item, tdinv7210m000 Archive Inventory Transactions by Item, and if ILC is implemented, tdilc3211m000 Archive/Delete Inventory History by Location.  When these archives have been completed, reset the first free number in session tcmcs0147m000 Maintain First Free Numbers for the specific series.  Be sure to first check <br />
what the actual first free number is by using the history sessions (in the case that you don't archive to the current date).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">venkat500</div><div class="date">13th August 2002, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">you can also just reset the number to '1' in the first free numbers for the warehouse order / inventory adjustment series. Baan will start to reuse the number once again from '500001'. Only you will have multiple records against the same order number as it is being reused without being archived. So if you have any reports running on warehouse order number or the print integration transactions sessions you will have multiple records (the old and the new one) for one order, of course on different dates. If that is OK then you can reset the series without archiving.</div></div><hr />
