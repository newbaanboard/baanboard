When we consume the the stock a Purchase Order Payment gets created. Which is correct. In some case it appends a new line into an existing Purchase Order.<br />
Can someone tell as to in what condition a new order is created and in what condition a new line is appended to an existing Order?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some details:<br />
When generating the purchase consignment payment order, a search will be done for already generated purchase consignment payment orders. If found and appropriate for use, the order will be re-used. An order line is added to that order.<br />
Fields that must match when searching a consignment payment order:<br />
- Ship-from BP<br />
- Consignment Payment Order Type<br />
- Purchase Office<br />
- Currency<br />
- Self Billed Invoice flag<br />
- Buyer<br />
The Self Billed Invoice flag and the Buyer are defaulted from master data, before checked. Reason for this is that the values of these fields can differ per item.<br />
An order line can only be added if the order is not yet closed. That means:<br />
- None of the order lines is matched / approved in accounts payable in finance.<br />
- None of the order lines is processed in session Process Delivered Purchase Orders (tdpur4223m000).</div></div><hr />
