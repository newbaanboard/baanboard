It is possible to change the inventory unit to an Item with history of stock movements like purchase, sales, corrections etc?We went through something like this due to rounding of a unit (pcs with rounding factor 0.01 instead of 1). I think we ended up in changing where we were allowed and recreating alternative items where we could not. In our case it was quite harmless, to replace the old with the new value, we had to look up values like 0.98 and change them into 1.00 on some occurrences. What is the reason for your change?</div></div><hr />

Our case, was similar. For some reason, the conversion factor started to unbalance the sales order invoice. By example in some cases, the figure 9.80 starts to show 9.899 We found that changing the factor from 0.001 to 0.0095, correct the problem.</div></div><hr />
