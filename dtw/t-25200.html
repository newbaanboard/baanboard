<br />
we are implementing ilc &amp; ltc for produccion orders and we are having a problem to generate the Outbound advice to issue the materials.<br />
<br />
we have the feeling that we forget some setup. DO you have any documentation about how to implement it and about the procedure?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

In such case, I would ask whether your manufacturing consultant has actually requested material to be issued from warehouse to start with. But you're on BaanIV, and the production material issue procedure might or might not be the same<br />

<br />
we could finally generate the Outbound Advice. The problem was that there was no qty entered to Issue for the production order.<br />
<br />
Our problem now is that the system generates the outbound advice and selects automatically the Lots and we are not able to change the selected Lot.<br />
<br />
Do you know is if possible , is there a way, to change the selected lots in the outbound?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">29th September 2005, 06:40</div></div><div class="posttext">So I was right that you guys forgot to request for production material in the first place. The purpose of generating outbound advice is for BaanIV to help you look for the most appropriate lot (or stock unit) to issue out of warehouse. If you'd like to specify manually which lot (or stock unit) to take, then create your own outbound advice, don't ask BaanIV to generate it. If you only want to follow some of the advice generated by BaanIV, then delete the advice you don't like and create new ones according to your liking<br />

<br />
I was afraid that the answer was this.<br />
<br />
Do you know the rules that BaaN follows in order to select the Best lot to be issued?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
In BaanERP Item Warehousing Data, there's outbound priority setting. There, on per item basis, you can choose whether BaanERP will suggest oldest lot to go out first (FIFO), newest lot to go out first (LIFO), or whichever lot happens to be in high(er) priority warehouse location. If I'm not mistaken, there may be similar setting in BaanIV. I haven't touched BaanIV for long time now<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">30th September 2005, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on the outboundpriority as set up in item master data it will generate outbounds based on FiFo (first in first out), LiFo or by Location. Last one is perhaps easier when stock dates are irrelevant for your business and saves you lot of extra data handling.</div></div><hr />
