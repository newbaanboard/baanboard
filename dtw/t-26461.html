What G.T.M. fix is needed to enable me to literally delete this line item from the purchase order. When I try to do it now I get the message &quot;Receipts already recorded. Deleteing not allowed&quot; because of the erroneous receipt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My suggestion since the purchase order line is already at a status of deleting line is to not do GTM becuase you already have your financial integrations and a payable out there for the line.<br />
<br />
What I would do instead is create a new line on the same purchase order with the same item for a negative quantity of the amount received.  Go ahead and process it and inform AP that the original purchase order line was received incorrectly and that you created and processed a corresponding negative purchase order line to net out the financial affect to 0.</div></div><hr />

If the Receipt was created for 0 quantity you will have a backorder that you need to process.  Either Delete the Back Order Quantity or Confirm it if you want to receive it.</div></div><hr />
