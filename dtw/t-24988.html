I am attempting to set a Sales Contract in EUR when our home currency is GBP. The Maintain SCH Sales Contracts session does not give me an option to change the currency and just defaults to GBP. <br />
<br />
Does anybody know how I can use a non home currency on a Sales Contract ?<br />

I found the currency defaults from the supplier details so you have to create a new supplier delivery address and set that to euro. you can get to the sub session from form1 or form2 of maintain customers under the special tab. when you create the sales contract you select the customer and the delivery address if this is the one with euro as currency then it will default to euro's. you also have the option to have a fixed or variable exchange rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had my fingers crossed that this would be the case as we had the customer set up to Euros. Thankfully the first Sales Order generated from a despatch done over the weekend came out in Euros.<br />
<br />
Although I've just discovered that the user put the contract price in as Euros so my guess is the system will convert this price. I'll have to wait and see if Finance hit the roof.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback.<br />
