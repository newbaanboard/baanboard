You would set up a VMI warehouse and issue product to it via an Inventory Transfer and then bill the customer using a special Sales Order type for consignment inventory.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm working in a Baan 4c2 environment.  How is VMI possible?  What is the set up needed as there are no consignment warehouses in Baan 4 that I have found anway.  How is product issued to the warehouse and how does the customer get invoiced when the product is used?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for any guidance.</div></div><hr />

We use replenishment orders to transfer stock from our normal warehouse to the cosnignment warehouses, and then use normal Sales Order/ Sales Invoices to bill the customer (ship from the consignment warehouse).<br />

How is your consignment warehouse set up?  Is it Nettable or Nonnettable?  Normal, WIP, or Transit?</div></div><hr />
