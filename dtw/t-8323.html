I am unable to find similar sessions at all in Baan V. Can anyone tell me how it is handled in Baan V? Some elaboration please.<br />

Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">DRP in Baan V is accomplished using Clusters and Supplying Relationships.  Not only can you define distribution relationships between clusters (which are typically warehouses) for a particular item, but you can define distribution relationships for different items in different Clusters...for example...I don't have Item X in Cluster 001 so satisfy the requirement with Item Y in Cluster 002.  <br />
<br />
The necessary sessions are all within Enterprise Planning.<br />
<br />
Don't hesitate to get in touch.  I'm currently unemployed and replying to the forum out of sheer boredom.<br />

Functionality offered in Baan V is very rich compared to Baan IV.<br />
<br />
One of the functionality which I like the most is ATP and CTP. It has multi-layered, multi-site Order promising capability - like when a customer asks for a material, then you have various options - from which warehouse I can ship the requested quantity, when can I promise him the whole quantity, if whole quantity delivery is not mandatory, then what are the dates on which I can make partial shippments. Apart from this, you can check capacity availability and material availability right upto Purchase from one end of distribution echelon. You can also see the constraints in your company which prevent execution of this order.<br />
<br />
Explore its capability!<br />
