    <br />
      Could you help me find the solution about the session maintain approvals. Fill data in the subsession tdilc4123s000 maintain approvals, as long as save &amp; return the main session, approved quantity is still zero. only few items have the problem.<br />
<br />
     What's the matter? My system version is BaanIV C4.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hpcarol</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem has been solved, I found the system is confused, when I used &quot;Fast Approval&quot; in the session maintain receipt, approval could be executed.<br />
But I feel confused about some information as following:<br />
  tdpur4120m000   Pack.Slip Qty    5  <br />
                              Delivered Qty   5<br />
but when I entered the subsession:<br />
  tdilc4113s000 maintain receipt(ILC)<br />
                              Nothing here<br />
<br />
I think it is a system error !<br />
<br />
Have someone met such the problem before?</div></div><hr />
