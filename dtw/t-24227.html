I have a general functional doubt. Why is it that in Baan IV you can maintain lots only in ILC enabled environments. I could not think of any reason for this. Can anybody help me?<br />

Baan stores inventory  information in different tables. Becuase of the current  table structure Baan doesn't support recording lot based inventroy without implementing location system in a Baan company. I guess it is application level restirction or limitation.<br />

If lot control is switched on it means that you are controlling your stock/lot and need accurate info about the lot. This includes where the lot is physically stored. Without this info your lot info will be incorrect wich asks the question why you are using lot control? This is the same reason why you don't backflush lot controlled items.</div></div><hr />
