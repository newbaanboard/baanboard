<br />
It seems 'release outbound data' has been completed and hence it is not possible to delete the line. The 'confirm' field is a flag to carry out the next step, say printing invoice. As far as 'baan' is concerned the order line has been delivered and this you can confirm by looking at the inventory transactions(tdinv7520m000) and the decrease in inventory. At this stage there is no option other than proceeding further and invoicing the line. A return order may be created for that item and the credit note may be assigned to the invoice in Finance.<br />
