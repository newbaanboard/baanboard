At the time of processing billing requests for generating single invoice for multiple sales order,it is not generating single invoice, it is generating multiple invoice for each sales order. <br />

<br />
Please Check Receipts Against Shipments check box in the CMG Parameters (tfcmg0100s000). If this check box is selected, then you can not have single invoice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I have checked invoicing method (tccom4112s000) but everything was already correct as per your suggestion.<br />
I'm unable to create single invoice.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Please check the other check boxes in invoicing method you choose for this BP. There must be some different among those orders you want to combine. Normally, it may be tax code, delivery adress, sales rep., currency etc.<br />
If those orders you choose to combine into one invoice have all same information mentioned in the tccom4112s000 check box, they can combine into one invoice.<br />

Please find more details about composing criteria to spit invoice <br />
<br />

For example, invoice lines with different invoice-to addresses or different invoice currencies cannot be grouped on one invoice. In addition, to support dimension accounting, invoice lines that must be posted to different dimensions cannot be grouped on one invoice.<br />
Two types of composing criteria exist:<br />
· Fixed general criteria (Its fixed/Predefined Which cant be changed)<br />

Try to set it to &quot;invoice date&quot; - and if that fixes your problem, please file an incident with Infor, so they will finally fix it - I have reported this problem for three customers now and still no solution.<br />
