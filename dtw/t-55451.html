While maintaining the purchase order(tdpur4101m000) we have entered 2 lines. <br />
The first line item(A) has been received along with item B(2nd line).<br />
We have maintained the item B in 2nd line.<br />
Later we found that the item B is a part of A item &amp; should not be maintained seperately.<br />
Now we want to delete the second line but we are getting the following mesage &quot; unable to delete, recordbeing used in other table&quot;.<br />
