Although it is not a usual activity, we would like to make purchase orders for services. I have just create a service article and when I make a purchase order with this (quantity=0), finally I have to receive this article (it is not possible to omite this action). How can I do?<br />
<br />
Thancks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smartone75</div><div class="date">11th October 2001, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I know some companies use cost items (Create Cost Item in Item Data &amp; Maintain Purchase order) for services like rentals. Not sure about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">invensys user</div><div class="date">11th October 2001, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">For purchasing services you should use cost items. First of all because you do not need to receive cost items via warehosuing (in Baan ERP), second of all because you can vary the quantity by ordering one LS (Lump Sum):)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">12th October 2001, 00:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, cost items can also be used in 4c3 and 4c4 to do this without having to receive goods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">houstoce</div><div class="date">12th October 2001, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">A cost item is the way to go. Once you have specified a cost item in the purchase order lines, you have access to the fields on form 3 where you can specify the ledger account and dimensions to be debited with the value of the cost item. If you make the purchase order a 'collect order', the transactions will be posted to integration immediately on saving the line.<br />

Thank you for your replies,<br />
<br />
I have BaanIVc4 and when I use an article defined as cost article or service article (&quot;what is the diference of these, they are the same for me!&quot;), then I have to receive it to change the status of the purchase order despite the quantity=0. If you create a new type of order with cost order=yes in tcmcs0142m000,you must define the reception procediment, however I can create a new type of order omitting the reception procediment chosing the 5th field in this session, but what quantity passes to finance when we do the integration? I think that with a normal purchase order it passes the quantity of the reception to finance.<br />
<br />
thank you!!</div></div><hr />

Once you have inserted a PO line for a cost item and saved that line, it is already received, and the status is updated to process delivered purchase orders. <br />
I cannot see what exactly your problem is?</div></div><hr />
