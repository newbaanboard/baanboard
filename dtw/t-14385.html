We handle in slightly different way. Since, price sent by customer is important for transactions like 855 we have to bring that in our system. After bringing the price, we replace it by Baan price and store the customer price in custom table. We also send a price discrepancy email to our cusomer service group, so that they can contact the customer for correct pricing and resolve any issue. Otherwise you know it might get heldup in payment. So my suggestion would be to bring the price and then replace it with Baan price. This will involve some work, but I think this is required.<br />

I forgot to tell that we customized the report 'Remarks in copied messages' a little bit to print both price structure price as EDI message price in case there is a difference.<br />
