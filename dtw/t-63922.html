I have this issue and hoping some one can advise.<br />
<br />
In Baan IV It is observed that user can still be allowed to enter transaction like make inventory transfer, make GRN,delete GRN etc even when the warehouse is blocked through cycle count.<br />
<br />
Can someone advise what is happening ?<br />
<br />
Thank in advance.<br />

<br />
Blocking inventory transactions during Cycle counting is parameter driven. Check the inventory parameters if blocking is set to &quot;yes&quot; or not. If this is set to &quot;no&quot; inventory transactions are allowed during cycle counting.</div></div><hr />
