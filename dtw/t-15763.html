am a Baan V user.<br />
When looking at the ATP proposed schedule (before accepting a customer order for a certain item) I receive a proposed date. <br />
I understand that is the date when I can commit the delivery to my clients...<br />
The point is that when I look at the planned transactions see that that such date is actually *previous* to the date when stock is available. Actually is 15 days before the arrival of my supplier's shipment. In addition in such date projected inventory is negative! ...a situation that, by definition, is not &quot;ATP&quot;<br />
<br />
Any inputs or help about the ATP logic?<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">25th June 2004, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">check the lead time you have on the item.  maybe you actually have time to place a new PO to satisfy the demand.  If so, the system tells you a date sooner than the delivery you already have scheduled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ale_baan</div><div class="date">25th June 2004, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you. I think is a good point -the thing is that this supplier in particular has a 2 months lead time, and the date suggested by Baan is within 3 weeks!<br />
<br />
In addition I tend to think that checking the possibility of a new supply corresponds to the CTP capability and not to ATP (which only sees planned supply &amp; demand). Am not sure about this last thing but I believe works in this way.<br />
<br />
Other thoughts?<br />
thanks again!</div></div><hr />

Item has components? And component ATP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ale_baan</div><div class="date">5th July 2004, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark.<br />
The item has no components.<br />
<br />
...still, could you kindly ellaborate more on the CTP Timefence option?<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />
