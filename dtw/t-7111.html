Maybe you should try this and then repost if you run into any specific problems with the code...I would probably use tdpur041 as the main table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your need is just as what you described in the description of your posting, then that can be handled in purchase statistics (PST module).<br />
<br />
If you require the one described in the title of the posting however, it's gonna be quite complicated to customise. But you can still use PST to get the numbers, post it to Excel, and come out with the top 10 report if the managers are OK with that not-so-automatic procedure. Yet another way is to use reporting tools like Crystal Reports which can extract any top N or bottom N data easily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karlovac</div><div class="date">11th October 2002, 08:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello EV, hello Paul<br />
and thanks for reply<br />
<br />
but, you catch me in my dilema:<br />
<br />
We never dealed with PST module;<br />
I started to do the way EV suggested - from table tdpur041;<br />
<br />
Thing what make me post the question is very slow report ...<br />
<br />
So I expected of PST to make me faster opportunity  -  cause I tought that top lists of customers, suppliers, purchase items ,,,<br />
 is a standard way of report in companies ...<br />
<br />
Tell me - to deal with PST or with programming in custom session?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">11th October 2002, 22:51</div></div><div class="posttext">depends on what you are more comfortable with.  I would write a custom session rather have to learn a new module but that's just me.  From what little I know of PST it is not a quick process to set it up but once it's ready to go you would probably find more uses for it (so it might be time well spent)... either way it is your call.<br />

<br />
First report is finished - (we made it as new session from tdpur041);<br />
<br />
but, I'll take some time (whan I catch it) to go into PST ...<br />
<br />
Thanks to all<br />
and have a nice day<br />
