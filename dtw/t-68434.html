<br />
I have a set up where are two different Landed Costs Sets- <br />
1. Freight<br />
2. Inter company profit mark up<br />
 <br />
In some cases I want both the landed cost be linked on my PO line.<br />
<br />
Is it possible with my current set-up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pillai.ganesh</div><div class="date">15th December 2015, 07:15</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not possible to have landed costs codes out of multiple landed costs sets linked to one order. As soon as the first landed costs set has been found to the system stops searching for further sets (and will only look inside this set for multiple scenarios).<br />
<br />
The system searches for landed costs sets on alphanumeric basis, so a cost set with code AA1 will be found before AA2.<br />
<br />
Within the (one) landed cost set (for example AA1) multiple cost codes can exists an can be proportioned to the order (based on priority if you so desire).</div></div><hr />
