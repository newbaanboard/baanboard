<br />
ASN (Advance Shipment Notice) is something that you create (either manually or through EDI) based on the Shipment details that you've received from your Supplier.<br />
<br />
Elaborate your query so I can help you better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raviteja31</div><div class="date">25th July 2017, 06:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Sasikanth, Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
When i click on &quot;Add expected shipment&quot; from receipts session (whinh3520m000).Then it opens &quot;Expected shipments &quot;session (whinh3821m000) session. So in this session when i give the ASN number and receipt date. it throws an error &quot;ASN nr. is case sensitive,no data found. is there any table where the ASN numbers are stored ?:( want to know why is this error pops up.because which  the receiving in the warehouse cannot be done ?:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sasikanth</div><div class="date">1st August 2017, 09:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure that the ASN number that you're trying to search is available in the ASN Table. <br />
<br />
Also, as the message says, the value is case sensitive, so you need to take care of it as well.<br />
<br />
If you still have an issue, do let me know.</div></div><hr />
