But you need some customizations on sessions. In this way each departmant can see their own PRQ to approve. That' all.<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are using the purchase requisition module on 5b and we encountered the same problem.  We decided not to make any customizations because of the technical problems we would encounter when upgrading.<br />
You should also consider what would happen if someone cannot approve a requisition because he or she is on holiday.  Does the requester need to wait until the approver returns ?  Is there someone else who is replacing the first approver ?  In that case, he or she should be able to approve someone else's requisitions.</div></div><hr />
