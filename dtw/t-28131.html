   How is it that when the network connection fails you are able to have Baan open in the first place? At the very instance of a bad connection Baan just freezes up and then you get the bw connection error. So how did this happen, where you saw something different on the client to what was there on the server?<br />
<br />
Care to throw some more light into this?<br />

<br />
What do you say is true.<br />
But this happen lost connection with server so make table tdilc402 is not update for that transaction. But in another table related with report operation completed is okay.<br />
so this not usually transaction.<br />
<br />
this connection between head office and factory.<br />
thank you.<br />
