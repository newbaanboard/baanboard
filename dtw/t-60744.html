<br />
The current Inventory evaluation method is BaaN standard cost based on Fixed Transfer Price Unit(ftp). At this point, would like to know the actual cost by each SALES ORDER and the actual cost of EACH LOT. I would like to know what tables/fields/sessions keep the ACTUAL COST OF EACH LOT and Sales order.<br />
<br />
Following are the pre-requisites<br />
1) Would like to keep the current Inventory valuation method as FTP.<br />
2) Do not want to change the current business process and procedures.<br />
<br />
This request is just to know the actual cost of Lot and Sales Order for profit management purposes.  <br />
<br />
Thanks!!<br />
Fredrick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th June 2011, 07:01</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan IV  ,  the lot tables tdltc001 , tdltc004 and tdilc102/4/6 used to store information relating to lots , lot prices (valuation method lot price) , lot results and lot tracking. AFAIK this is not changed in Baan V  too . The tables along with ticst/sfc/hra tables may help u develop the actual cost reports.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since the valuation method is FTP, could you please let me know which tables will help me to arrive at the Actual Price per lot. Incase you do not have access to Baan V, please let me know the same in Baan IV.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help and thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
