<br />
We were using Maintain deliveries i.e. tdsls4120m000 in Baan IV C4 for delivery the goods.<br />
We implemented Location Control and made some transaction, but now we do not want to use this module, we want to use only maintain deliveries but system is not allowing us for this.<br />
<br />
How can we go back to old setup (Maintain Deliveries tdsls4120m000) ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Below given is the standard Baan solution,<br />
<br />
1. Inbound needs to been Actualized (tdilc4204m000) or needs to be removed (tdilc4213m000).<br />
<br />
2. Outbound needs to be removed (tdilc4211m000)<br />
<br />
3. Warehouses have to be changed to warehouses without locations again (tdilc0231m000)<br />
<br />
4. In case a ordertype has been used with &quot;Generate Outbound Advise&quot; (step 8), the procedure mask (Field: pmsk) of the table tdsls045 needs to be changed to 'n'. This only is required if the steps are:<br />
1,2,8. <br />
<br />
Also the orderstatus (Field: ssls) of the table tdsls045 needs to be changed from status 8 to 3 (&quot;Maintain Deliveries&quot;).<br />
<br />
5. Also the procedure mask of the table tcmcs042 needs to be updated if step 8 became part of the procedure. Step 8 has be removed and the other steps need to be moved upwards.<br />
<br />
6. To be sure no incorrect data will remain in ILC and other tables , the session tdilc0250m000 needs be executed.<br />
<br />
NOTE: The session tdilc0250m000 can only be executed, when there are no user on the system. This is very important to prevent errors occurring. <br />
<br />
7. Finally the parameter ILC needs to be changed back to &quot;NO&quot; again. This is not possible by using the session tdilc0100m000, but can only be changed manually in the table tdilc000.</div></div><hr />
