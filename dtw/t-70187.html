<br />
Often and because of container and logistics constraints, our Shipment Lines are NOT sorted in Item sequences therefore the Output in the ASN file is the mirror of the lines sequences.<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to reorder them by ITEM in the ASN conversion so we can regroup at the ASN output the Lines by Item and their related data (Packaging, etc..) and this BEFORE the EDI message translation in EDIFACT.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your kind replies.<br />
<br />
Best regards from France, :)<br />
