<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pvellini11</div><div class="date">4th September 2023, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, I'm working on 10.8, I've found out that in tdpur301 the key of the table has been extended with a field sequence (tcpono). <br />
I've tried to manage different lines with different sequences but the system gives an error due to the fact that i can't manage different values from 0. also from ttaad4100 (dal active!) the problem is the same!.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering which is the process meaning of this field.<br />
maybe when managing mandatory quanitities but i'm not sure.<br />
anyone has found out the meaning?<br />
thanks in advance<br />
