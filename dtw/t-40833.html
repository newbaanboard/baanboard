<br />
I face a crucial problem related to the Raw Material Inventory. The RM Warehouse shows different inventory from the tiitm001 table. When we saw the inventory report from the standard session tdinv6230m000 or customised session tdcus6230m000, it also show the different from the Inventory transaction by Item REPORT.<br />
<br />
Now, we are confused, how we correct the inventory record in all tables related to inventory.<br />
<br />
Please help me and suggest, how it possible.<br />
<br />
We are not using lot control module. Also, the Table tdinv700 show the actual record and accurate balance of inventory after transaction, which was matched with our physical inventory.<br />
<br />
I am waiting for your valuable response.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Run &quot;Check Inventory Data&quot; tdinv0252m000. I don't think it is on any menu. You should run it when there are no transactions occuring. But you can run it anytime with &quot;Adjust&quot; set to No to see a report only. Change Adjust to Yes to actually correct the inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ks_ks_</div><div class="date">22nd August 2007, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
In Baan IV, there are 3 major tables from which Baan takes the value (when you look at the session tdilc1512m000).<br />
<br />
These are tiitm001 (total item inv)<br />
tdinv001( inv by warehouse)<br />
tdilc101 (inv by location and warehouse)<br />
<br />
If there are few items, these tables can be changed according to tdinv700.<br />
Or else better run the correction program as suggested in the earlier post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I run the session tdinv0252m000, you are requested to please specify the meaning of this report column like : Old Inventory, New Inventory, Old Block, New Block.<br />
<br />
The Old Inventory and New Inventory columns have differences, the old Inv. column have the huge qty of stock but zero shows in the New Inv Colmn.<br />
<br />
Also explain, the meaning of old block and new block.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your valuable response.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">24th August 2007, 15:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to take so long to get back to you. It has been a while since I've seen the report (you don't see it unless there are errors).<br />
 <br />
As I recall, it assumes that the inventory in warehouse inventory by item (tdinv001) is correct, and adjusts the inventory level in the item master (tiitm001) to match it. In our case we don't sue lots, locations or containers.<br />
 <br />
You can verify this yourself by comparing the report to a session like tdinv0510m000 &quot;Display Warehouse Invnetory by Item&quot;, or the equivalent session for your inventory setup. If you look at this session for the items on this report, you will see that the total line (which comes form the item master) does not equal the sum of the detail lines. This should give you an idea where the old and new values are coming from. <br />
 <br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DineshSharma</div><div class="date">29th August 2007, 07:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
We also run the rebuild session tdinv0250m000, it update all transaction in the tdinv001 and other table but not in tiitm001.<br />
<br />
Now, the problem is, when we make a single transaction in any RM item, this transaction was update in all tables but not reflect the tiitm001 table.<br />
<br />
Please suggest the suitable solution<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayant Keskar</div><div class="date">26th September 2007, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Item master shows the inventory at the company level. Thus if you have more than one warehouses for similar items then the inventory figure of one warehuse may not tally with the inventory as per item master.<br />
<br />
2. You have stated that you you are not using lot control but have you implemented location control? <br />
<br />
3. The session tdinv0252m000 is in 3 parts. The first part shows the difference between item master inventory and inventory as per tdilc101<br />
The second part shows the difference between inventory as per tdilc101 and tdinv001 by each warehouse. The third part is not applicable to you as it shows difference between lot inventory<br />
<br />
4. Old inventory for the first part means the existing inventory as per item master and for the second part means inventory per tdinv001<br />
<br />
The best way to rectify this is through a cycle count. You may want to experiment with this with inventory adjustment for a single item<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you require any further information</div></div><hr />
