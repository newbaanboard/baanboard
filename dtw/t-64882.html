We purchase components from electronic suppliers by packet and use a purchase unit of measure of PKT. The items are stocked as EA (each).<br />
Occasionally we switch to a new supplier who may have a different packet size.<br />
This is a problem because we can't change the conversion factor for the item to reflect the new packet size.<br />
The only way we can see round it is to create a new unit of measure code and record the purchase to stock conversion factor for the new unit of measure then reassign the item purchase of measure to Item Purchase data.<br />
Is there a better way than this (other than creating a new item and changing all the BOMs)?<br />
If not, does anyone have a good unit of measure coding scheme to use for the various Packet unit of measures?</div></div><hr />

We have the same problem in c4 but I am surprised this is still an issue in LN and they have not come up with a better way of handling it.</div></div><hr />
