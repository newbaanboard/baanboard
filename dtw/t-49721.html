<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">24th March 2008, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been reported a problem by finance who are trying to enter in an Inventory Adjustment on an item in the Enter Inventory Adjustments screen. We get an &quot;Order NUMBER not allowed&quot; message box pop up.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me what I should be looking at to assist them? Originally, it looked like a series number problem but these are created automatically for warehouse orders as there is no series definitions yet for inventory adjustments.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the vagueness of this request, but detailed info was just not available from user ...</div></div><hr />

   I think you ran out of free numbers for your Warehouse Order-Inventory Adjustment series. To check, open the Maintain First Free Numbers {tcmcs0147m000} session and go the &quot;Warehouse Order&quot; and see whats the First Free Number of Inventory Adjustment. In your case it might show 100000.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">25th March 2008, 13:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that's the funny part. This is a 6 month old approx company. I only have under 'Warehouse Orders' a series 8 for Inventory Re-Evaluation and that FFN is 1 .... no other transactions have occurred for the other series, etc....<br />
<br />
I expected Baan to create a new series for us in this instance, as was the user. But, for some reason, it will not work ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">25th March 2008, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it looks to be solved. When the company was configured, parameters were copied across to the new company, but I never ran &quot;Initialize Parameters&quot; for the Distribution Module.<br />
<br />
After doing so, I now moves past the point and we see what we were supposed to see ...  interesting ...<br />
<br />
Perhaps I better run Initialize params in all modules just in case I forgot other ones  :) ....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shall we anly reset series to 0 ?<br />

All history tables can take duplicate numbers. Just check the main table takes it or not.I think date is part of index so it might take.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">19th February 2014, 20:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, date is part of index. We did set it to zero and worked fine.<br />
<br />
We will do some achiving for Inventory Transactions by Item (tdinv7210m000).<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
