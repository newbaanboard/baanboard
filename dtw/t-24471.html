<br />
   I am on Baan Iv c4 and I am about to setup an EDI on our system to send a packing slip to our external warehouse which is run by another company everytime we ship goods in baan from that particular warehouse to their system. Since it's an outgoing edi message only, do I require a translator or anything else for this purpose? When do I require a translator?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">6th July 2005, 20:48</div></div><div class="posttext">No you won't need a translator for this as the data needs to stay in the Baan EDI  (BEMIS) format. You will only need a translator when you are converting into or from BEMIS.<br />
<br />
I've never done anything with internal EDI but I think the only thing you need to do is to move the EDI file generated by the Print Packing Slips session from the appl_from directory of the outbound EDI network (sending company) to appl_to directory on the inbound EDI network (receiving company).<br />
<br />
We have a piece of bespoke software on our system that handles the moving of the files and sends an E mail to whoever is repsonsible to signify a New EDI Message.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and good luck.<br />

<br />
   I have already setup the EDI paratmeters but when I run the Generate EDI message to generate an outgoing Packing Slip, I am getting a message that &quot;No message to process&quot;. I am also reading a baan documentation which is still insisting that once the ASCII files have been exported from BaaN, it will be done by a tranlation software(Do I still need one?). Another question is when does the ACSII file gets generated, is it after running the session Print Packing Slip in Baan Iv c4? Appreciate any suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you set up tcedi0115m000 - Maintain Outgoing Messages by Session.<br />
<br />
Relations also have to be set up against each network and then the EDI message is linked to a relation. See sessions tcedi0128m000,0110m000,0111m000.<br />
<br />
The ASCII file will be generated when you run session tcedi7201m000 - Generate EDI Messages.<br />
<br />
Concentrate on producing the ASCII file at this stage and then worry about the format of the file. I believe that you will NOT need a translator.<br />

<br />
          I am still getting the same message &quot;No message to process&quot;, I have attached my EDI setup file, probably I missing something which you might spot. When does a user run the generate edi session, is it after pinting a packing slip session and do we setup a special print device for edi?<br />
<br />
Much appreciated.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you get a message like &quot;New EDI-Message generated&quot; when you print the packing slip? If yes a new record is inserted in table tcedi700 (Messages to be Generated). You can check it in session tcedi7100m000 (Maintain Messages to be Generated) or tcedi7500m000 (Display Messages to be Generated). <br />
If you don`t get such a message then there is something missing or wrong in your EDI Setup.<br />
<br />
If I played with internal EDI some years ago, i remember there a the fields &quot;Affiliated Company&quot; and &quot;Affiliated Company No.&quot; in the Customer and Supplier Master data which have to be set. But it`s a long time ago .....<br />

<br />
I am using Internal and External EDI with BaaNIVc4, and BaaN only needs some kind of translation software on EXTERNAL EDI, changing the format of BEMIS to the format of Costumer.<br />
<br />
In your case, I agree with Juergen, I think you have some problem with the EDI-message generation: first, you must prepare the EDI-Message with the session described in tcedi0115m000 (it is not a process to do with the incoming messages), then the prepared message must be generated. With that process, an EDI-message called how it has been defined in tcedi5112m000 has to be created on appl_from.<br />

   I have managed to import the defaults.edi file and ihave reset the setup sessions but I am still getiing the mesage &quot;No Messages to process&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have sent our EDI setup for our ASN to you to have a look through. Not sure if you've amended some of the following since you first posted the doc.<br />
<br />
1) Maintain EDI Messages you do not have an Outgoing Library defined.<br />
<br />
2) Maintain EDI Messages Supported by Relation you do not have a conversion setup (as downloaded in defaults.edi) defined.<br />
<br />
3) Maybe worth checking form 2 on Maintain Networks where Supress Std Communication should be set to &quot;Yes&quot;. (No idea why this is something I was told by a consultant a long time ago)<br />
<br />
4) On the doc your Conversion Seup Relationship was blank this should have some fields in it see our doc.<br />
<br />
A few other tips. Check out the trace files generated in the directory of your EDI network. Also check the permissions in the network directory.<br />
<br />
From looking at your setup I suspect that files are not yet being generated.<br />
<br />
Good luck and let me know how you get on.<br />
