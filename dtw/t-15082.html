<br />
Is it possible to declare a production for warehouse 003 and maintain inbound in another Warehouse. <br />
<br />
The main objective is to transfer stoc without going throught the replenishment order process.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
The technical objective is, as you said, &quot;to transfer stoc without going throught the replenishment order process&quot;. What's the objective on the business process side? I can't quite see why you'd want to do that from business stand point<br />

<br />
I guess you are running ILC..<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion from a non ILC-guy: assign warehouse 004 to the production order (destination) and put warehouse 003 to the estimated materials (source).<br />
When you report operations complete, the finished item will be posted to warehouse 004 and the materials will be taken from 003. Hopefully this is your intention..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madmax33</div><div class="date">20th April 2004, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">fist of all I will answer to Paul; From a business stand point it is purelly a time and efforts saving reason. since the truck driver that does the transfers between warehouse is there early in the morning and will know only then what he can fit in the truck, he REP process would force the paperwork to be done only for the products being shipped and requiers a person to be on site. That is the way we do it now! But we would like to just print out manual shipping documents for the driver the previous evening and he could pick and choose what he is really carrying. and we would not requier REP orders. Personally I beleive we should keep doing it the same way but you know how some peaple like to ak for weird things. <br />
<br />
Now Martin.<br />
You are right this is what we want to do, ultimatly, but we also need to keep track of what is in the production pipeline for that warehouse. Unless we use the estimated materials table as a base table for reporting.<br />
<br />
Let me check it out.<br />
<br />
Thanks to both.<br />
