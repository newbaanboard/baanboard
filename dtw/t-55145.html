<br />
We are trying to use SIC Planning of LN.<br />
<br />
I have simulated the factor and constant and everything works fine.<br />
<br />
However, the problem is the advice does not give a delivery date based on the requirement date.<br />
<br />
Eg:<br />
<br />
I have an allocation on 15th March. So till 4th March, my economic stock is below ROP. When the order horizon crosses 5th March, it generates an advice but the delivery date is coming as 10 days from today as I have set the supply time as 10 days. Maybe I am wrong, but what I expected was the system should give me a requirement date or delivery date based on my requirement of 15th march.<br />
<br />
The help also says as follows:<br />
<br />
To determine the requirement date:<br />
The requirement date is the date on which the projected on hand drops below the reorder point.<br />
To determine the actual requirement date, SSA ERP takes into account the actual calendar. If the requirement date is not available according to the actual calendar, SSA ERP looks backwards for the first available date/time before the requirement date. SSA ERP sets the first available date/time as the actual requirement date.<br />
To determine the planned receipt date<br />
SSA ERP determines the planned receipt date by planning forwards from the requirement date and taking into account the actual calendar.<br />
SSA ERP determines the planned receipt date as follows:<br />
<br />
planned receipt date = planned requirement date + outbound lead time + inbound lead time + item safety time + supplier safety time<br />
<br />
Any suggestions???</div></div><hr />

TPOP generally considers the requirements and deliveries and based on it, plans the material.</div></div><hr />

SIC planning will not consider Delivery dates. SIC plans material as if it needs it today. Hence it takes today plus Total supply time.<br />
<br />
For Delivery (Requirement) date based planning, make the item as planned and then use Enterprise planning..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy_baijun</div><div class="date">18th March 2009, 03:48</div></div><div class="posttext">SIC and MRP use the differenct logic to calculate the delivery date.<br />
MRP use the requirement and the LT to calculate the requriement date and delivery date.<br />
<br />
While in SIC logic, just use the ROP and inventroy to compare, if the inventory lower than the ROP, then the SIC will take effect. <br />
the next question, how much ?<br />
this depend on which way you use the replenish the inventory.</div></div><hr />
