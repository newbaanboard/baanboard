<br />
In BaanVc when orders are released to warehousing a warehouse order is created and lies are grouped into order sets.  When releasing a backorder to warehousing the backorder line picks up the same order set as the original line item.  Has anyone came across this?</div></div><hr />

   B5 groups lines in WH orders into sets according to their req date. Lines with the same req date will be grouped into one set. If back order is confirmed without specifying new req date for the remaining (the back order), B5 will put it in the same set again.<br />

   Actually ignore the second part of my msg, it was rubbish.<br />
<br />
   Yes B5 does it the way you mentioned. It all has something to do with how Baan designed the inbound and outbound order lines table (whinh210 &amp; whinh220). Order set actually is not a necessary key field as seen in other index beside index 1 for those tables. The necessary key fields are, as what we would thought as intuitive anyway, WH order origin, WH order number, WH order line, and sequence. Hence once an order position is thrown from PUR, SLS, SFC or what have you to INH, it will be assigned a set number. And from that point on, the order position will be stuck with that particular set number.<br />
