On a PO, the system calculates the planned delivery date, which is the date we need the product at our warehouse. SO, the printed PO shows this date<br />
<br />
What we really need on the PO, is the date that the goods should leave our supplier's warehouse, so they know when to ship this. On a sales order, there is a planned delivery and planned receipt date (which uses the distance by zip code table to calculate delivery &amp; receipt date). I do not see this on a PO. How can we handle this?<br />
<br />
Currently the suppliers are shipping the products on the date we need them in our warehouse. We need to offset this by the trasit time.</div></div><hr />

You can modify the report with a message, as Martin suggest.  As a further technical suggestion, you can add a field to the Suppliers called &quot;transit time&quot;  You can then modify the report by finding the Planned Delivery Date field and subtracting the Transit Time from the supplier from it.  The supplier fields *should* be read in the main program script.   Also, then, add the field Transit Time field to the report input fields.   Make sure to test it well (develop in a test environment if possible!), I did not code this and test myself.<br />
<br />
You would have some shortcommings  - you will find it will put the dates prior to the current date if you order with not enough lead time...there is coding you can do instead of this simple solution to fix that if you need...Post back if you want more info on any of this.<br />
<br />
Would be better if a functional person could answer this one though without mods!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">22nd March 2002, 03:40</div></div><div class="posttext">The one thing that can be done is to kind of abuse the field &quot;Confirmed Delivery Date&quot;  in the PO header (tdpur400.ddtc) and the PO lines (tdpur401.ddtc).<br />
This date can function as the date the supplier has to ship the products from his warehouse.<br />
The planned delivery date remains what it is: the date the goods are expected to arrive in your warehouse.<br />
The system will accept that the confirmed delivery date is before the planned delivery date so you are set.<br />
When printing the PO for your supplier you can pick up both dates and they indicate for your supplier when he is expected to ship and when the goods are expected to arrive.<br />
<br />
You will still need to make a modifications for the report tdpur440101000 Purchase Order.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it is a manual process and I hope this works for you because sometimes in BAAN the system is just not doing what we would like it to do.<br />

<br />
I'm not sure about Baan V, but if it behaves like Baan IV (and I strongly believe it will) Bryan will get trouble with that advise: When entered, the confirmed date will be the date the system uses for planning (like inventory forecasting, cash flow forecasting). So better do not misuse this date.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would really start with the business needs for that issue: Why do I have to tell my supplier when he has to deliver from his warehouse??? I normally would tell him when I want to have the goods at my side, and it's up to him to meet that requirement.<br />
<br />
If it's really a business issue (a little bit of supply chain planning) then the new field in the supplier table (or warehous table, or ?? - it depends on your business needs) will be the clearest software architecture. I would prefer this solution.<br />

<br />
I'm not sure about BaaN V, but in BaaN IV there are two fields on the item data under the order data section that should help you.  They are the Order Lead Time and Safety Time fields.  These fields play into the calculation of when your PO is sent to your supplier in order to get the goods to you on time.  If they are available in BaaN V, they may solve your problem.<br />

<br />
One of our customers had a real need to receive such information on their PO too. This was mainly connected with the fact that our customer himself was responsible for the organisation of transport and wanted to have more accurate information and to separate supplier reliability from transporter relyabitity analysis. So, in order to know exactly when the supplier should be ready to ship the goods, and to distinguish the transport time we added several new fiels in the header and lines of the PO. These fields showed the planned shipment date, planned delivery date, confirmed sh.&amp; del. dates, changed sh.&amp; del. dates, actual shipment date. Entering the planned shipment date gives the information when the goods should be shipped by the supplier. Automatically is calculated the pl.del date based on transport time and so on. <br />
<br />
This solution, however is very customer specific, but can gfive you some idea of what can be done. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenix</div><div class="date">25th April 2002, 11:07</div></div><div class="posttext">The calculation of delivery and shipping dates is not that easy as it sometimes seems to be.<br />
<br />
To use the security time for this calculation would have the same effect than safety stock. You will order items earlier and the capital requirements for the items on stock will be much higher. Your finance guys will not be happy about this fact.<br />
<br />
Another thing which has to be taken into consideration is the forwarding agent. The forwarder might change from order to order and therefore a single field added at the supplier table will not really help.<br />
<br />
Is EDI used for the transmission of the orders or not. If it is used the converter of your supplier would be able to calculate a shipping date.<br />
<br />
In any case you will have to talk to your supplier and fix a definition for the dates you provide him in your POs.<br />
<br />
If you want to handle this problem internally think about this:<br />
create a new table 'Transportation time per supplier and forwarding agent'. Then change your report script for the PO in that way that during printing the order the delivery date will be reduced by the number of transportation days you have entered in the new table for that supplier and forwarding agent.<br />
<br />
Using this way you do not have to change a standard table and the PO is normally customized at any Baan environment.<br />
The solution gives you a high flexibility to maintain the transportation time per supplier (if there is no entry in the table for a supplier you can define s standard transportation time) and it will have influence on your capital requirements.<br />
The development could be realized in a short time (approx. 1.5 days).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Linda already noticed, you may use the field Safety Time, which value is used by calculating the delivery date.<br />
So the delivery date = Needdate minus safety time.<br />
Also it is possible to use the field Inspection. If the value is set to Yes, there is another step to do before you may use the material.<br />
That's why the delivery date also becomes earlier.<br />
But both ways also set the planned orderdate earlier too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">24th March 2007, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">This is already an old thread, but I would like to add to Rancheva's comments (inactive member?) as we have added almost the same fields to our PO's.<br />
<br />
The background: we are located in Europe, our Supplier is in the far-east.<br />
The supplier ships the goods, we pay for the transport.<br />
The two shipment methods used are air and sea.<br />
Boat shipments take about 50 days, air shipments take about 4 days, but are almost 10 times as expensive ! <br />
Obviously as we pay for the transport ourselves we try to purchase as much as possible using sea shipments, but given already long manufacturing times of the items, and inability of our customers to forecast/buy in advance we try to keep safety stock low and we end up with most of the orders on air shipment.<br />
If our supplier does not meet their confirmed shipdates, and items are to be send by air in a rush instead of the schedule sea shipment we can claim back the additional transport costs from them.<br />
<br />
To control/monitor the planned inventory we also added extra fields in the PO line as planned shipdate, confirmed shipdate, changed shipdate, and a field shipment method that automatically adds the shipdays to planned shipdate to calculate the planned delivery date.<br />
<br />
We found however the matter quite complex to manage, e.g. MRP does not consider transport time but creates suggestions simply based on the needed delivery date. Deducting the transport time from this date sometimes resulted in that the supllier had to manufacture far within his standard lead time.<br />
What we would also want is that MRP would suggest the correct shipment method -&gt; sea if possible, otherwise air. <br />
BaaN standard functionality is to limited here; adding either a) the air transport time or b) the sea transport time in the item master as order lead time or safety time would create either PO's that a) would costs us unnecessary transport costs, or b) would order items far to early.<br />
<br />

<br />
I am not an expert in this area - but if most shipments are by air then why not apply the 80/20 rule and add the air shipment lead time in to the item master?  Then you only have to worry about exceptions.  Then why not create something on the purchasing side to look for savings opportunity.  For example a session that looks for PO's which can be released to a vendor early with sea shipments versus air.  Maybe tell your customers - hey if you order with a short lead time it is $100 and if you order with long leadtime it is $50.  Not really sure about how your business works or if you could even encourage you customers to order early.<br />
<br />
Another thought is (and this depends on the how many parts) - creating two bills.  One with part x+a air shipped and a second with part x+s for sea shipped.  Then you could have two parts with different lead times.  More item, bom maintenance but maybe feasible.  We do something like this - we might make a part one-time, even though it is cheaper to buy it(requires a longer leadtime).</div></div><hr />
