This is with reference to BaanIVc4 IS4 SP18<br />
The material after Purchase reciept is sent to Inspection for Approval in session tdpur4121m000, where we do the Approval or Rejection of the material.<br />
The end user requirement is, the lead time calculation, from Reciept date to Approval date, wherein he will see the performance.<br />
For this data capture, we need the Date of Approval when the Approval is carried out in tdpur4121m000 for that specific reciept. The date we are not able to find out, or rather the date is not there is Reciept table.<br />
Please anyone can suggest, how should we capture the date of Approval ?<br />
If its not there in standard, and if you have any customization way known, please let us know.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
