<br />
Can anyone suggest ways of carrying out transactions for the same item with two different cost prices. This item is goes through the entire cycle from purchasing to the sale of the end product and returns .The item concerned here is bottles.<br />
Currently we are maintaing a standard price for the item which is being picked up for all transactions.The item price will be changed (Price B )next month but we will still be handling transactions for the item with the old price (Price A). <br />
<br />
I am still getting acquainted with BaaN and the package we are usign is BaaN IV C3.<br />
<br />
I would very much appreciate help from you experts in this area. Any suggestions will also be appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanking in advance<br />

Therfore, if the cost price is changed today new orders will use the new cost price any any previous orders will use the old cost price.</div></div><hr />

But if you change the costprice of an item, a revaluation booking will be inserted in the integration for those transactions in the past, so you might be better of using a different item!</div></div><hr />
