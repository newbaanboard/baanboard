<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tapzhou</div><div class="date">2nd August 2004, 09:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone please enlighten me on how BAAN 4c4 does inventory valuation. What session is used to do this. What accounting transactions happen with respect to current average price of goods in stock, PO price and latest purchase price (invoice price).<br />
<br />
I had 8200 units of stores item xxxx in stock @ average price of $5096.00 . On the 18th I received 20 additional units with supplier's invoice price @ a new unit price of $6880 dated the 14th of the same month. This transaction was entered on the same day. There was no further movement for the stock item. On the 22nd  a look at GL document history shows that a revaluation occurred and the new average price rose from 5096 to 6880 (the latest invoice price). There was no movement of the item until the 27th when an inventory valuation report showed all the 8220 items valued @6880. I would have thought these items would have been valued at the new average price? Can someone please enlightem me on what really happened here and why.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">2nd August 2004, 13:56</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan inventory valuation is done at the standard cost price maintained<br />
in tiitm0101m000 . The standard cost price is calculated based on purchase<br />
price priority in ticpr1101m000. In ur case it must be latest price for <br />
standard cost price calculation code (maintained in ticpr0100m000). When<br />
user approves invoice in finance (tfacp1140s000) or changes price discounts <br />
(tdpur4122m000), the average price and latest  purchase price in tiitm0101m000 <br />
gets updated. After this updation (based on ur latest price 6880) the <br />
cost price recalculation (ticpr2210/2220m000) may have taken place which<br />
generated the new cost price and revaluation (u saw in GL). U can print<br />
standard cost prices in ticpr3401m000 to get the correct cost price for<br />
the item.<br />
<br />
If u wish the revaluation at average price u need to change the purchase<br />
priority in ticpr1101m000. Also the parameter 'Method of calculating <br />
average price' in tdpur4100m000 is relevant for this purpose.</div></div><hr />
