<br />
I would like to know how I can handle surcharges to our purchase orders in Baan 4c4. <br />
<br />
Currently, we have set up the surcharge tables for each item. But these surcharges are a percentage and an estimate only. During the actual receipt of the purchase, there is an actual surcharge to the purchase order eg. freight amounting to $12.00 and duty amounting to $14.50. How can we add these ACTUAL surcharge values to the order? <br />
<br />
I was thinking of additional costs but I don't think it is correct because these actual surcharge amounts is having its own invoice from different suppliers. It is not paid to the supplier whom we purchase the item from. The freight need to be paid to the transporter. So how else can we capture the actual surcharge cost into the standard cost? Is using the surcharge tables the only way?<br />
