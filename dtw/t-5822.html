<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">20th July 2002, 10:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Using SQL trigger, I can do this.  But I can't display proper error msg to user when they tried to make project for blocked orders.<br />
<br />
Is there any other way to stop in BaaN ?</div></div><hr />

Baan functionality. Please explain why you don't want to generate the project structure, maybe there is another way of solving your problem without changing the software.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">22nd July 2002, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">If the sales order is blocked (credit limit exceeded, invoice out standing ..etc..etc..), we dont want allow user to go further steps of processing the order like,  generating project structure,  transfer PRP production to production order etc. Once production order is generated, no one will check in the production about the status of the sales order. They will face only problems in delivery.  So,  we wanted to implement the blocking stage at the time of generating project structure. is there any other way to implement these... please. advise me.</div></div><hr />

- Item signal (Requisition) Block<br />
- Project status (Change to simulated)</div></div><hr />
