<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinovk</div><div class="date">3rd July 2002, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi some info to stat with. <br />
We use BaaN 4C4 SP6 (go to sp 9 in a few weeks).<br />
All our items in tiitm001 are purchase items. <br />
We have NO stock. But we need,to keep te BaaN process running, one warehouse. (only as administrative warehouse). All our goods are delivered by our sister company/factory.<br />
<br />
When we put in a sales orders, we generate a project trough (special/zoom) tipcf5260s000.<br />
Then the system should generate ONLY PRP-purchase orders.<br />
<br />
With two items things go wrong Baan keeps making Warehouse orders as if there is stock available. But there is not.<br />
<br />
We dont have a clue what goes wrong. <br />
The session tdinv0252m000 gives no help.<br />
<br />
can anyone out there tell me how to correct this in a way that even our finance boys an girls can be happy with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />

<br />
It had NOT the result we hoped for.<br />
<br />
One of the people with &quot;the brains&quot; said he could solve it in ttaad4100.<br />
<br />
Result 0<br />
<br />
And because of the 4100 your solution had NO effect.<br />
We have to find some other way to correct our problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What happens, processing the Warehouse-orders?<br />
Do you get an error?<br />
If not, it may be the easiest way to solve the problem, by finishing the process.<br />
Did you take a look into table: TIPGC040, TDINV001, TDILC101, TIPCS021 for the two items? (I don't know if those tables are in use at your company.)<br />
<br />

We dont use PGC and ILC. We checked the other tables no problems were found there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We found the ttaad4100 changes. Re-corrected it. Run the sessions Flip suggested and  problem solved.<br />
<br />
One way or the other we still dont have a clue where it came from.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />
