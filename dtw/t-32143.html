I want to know how to convert the inventory structure of items that are in stock. For example, the package definition is 1box = 10 ea for an item. Suppose there are 30 ea as per the inventory structure and I want to convert it into 3 box. At present I use a transfer order to achieve this. Is there any other way to accomplish this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

We had the same problem here.  The only thing that helped was making a transfer order or an inventory adjustment.  I don't think there is any other way.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to do that, maybe it would be an idea to start using the new storage unit box and use the items with storage unit ea untill there are no more in stock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. Basically our requirement is this. We buy steel in lengths of 5m. The production demand is for 5m, 2m and 3m long pieces and we cut them accordingly. Is there a way to store the material in warehouse which reflects the lengths of the pieces? Also is it possible for the outbound advice to pick only the 5m piece if the demand is 5m and show shortage if 5m piece is not available? Is it possible to somehow accommodate this using the package definition. Is ther any other way to handle this?<br />

If you are interested, I could give you a short view of the concept. <br />
I know C4 isn't B50x, but the basic for the concept is the same.<br />

Certainly that will be helpful even though it is for Baan IV. Can you please elaborate the concept? If you have any document that elaborates the customization please send me.<br />

<br />
all docs I have are german... . And the changes haven't been done within one project.<br />
<br />
Just a short abstract:<br />
<br />
Table modifications<br />
We've added a unit field to the fixed location tables (tdilc007 in C4)<br />
New table for the allowed units by item (not done in the tiitm004 because of warehouse dependent units <br />
for a CaseCalculation and we had some bad effects with the data in tiitm004) <br />
<br />
Program modifications<br />
Generate outbound:<br />
New rules: Split the order quantity depending form the units in the new table and look<br />
first: where a fixed locations with this unit (only picking of this unit allowed)<br />
second: are there fixed locations with unit empty (all units allowed)<br />
At our system always such a record exists.<br />
<br />
We do the same with replenishment and purchase entry to find the correct location (automatical split of the quantitys, automatic find of the locations, ...)<br />
<br />
It's just a short abstract of a part of the system, but I hope it explains the idea behind a little.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the information. It may be difficult to get acceptance for table changes. But based on your information I can explore whether having different warehouses in BOM for different sizes and configuring a supply relationship between the warehouses in EP will help.<br />

Thanks,<br />
