In our test company I have set this up so that the replenishment order acts like an inventory transfer between one warehouse and another. (We do not yet use location control (ILC)).<br />
<br />
My problem is that our Logistics department have requested that any backorders that are created should be confirmed automatically rather than a user having to manually confirm the order line(s) for each order. Because this session (Confirm Backorders, tdrpl0120m000) requires additional input this cannot be done in a job. Therefore I was wondering if there is any other way that this process could be automated?<br />

we faced the same problem some years ago. We did not find any way to succed without customization.<br />
We also experienced some functional problems with this session which finally led to corrupt inventory transactions. So we choosed the pragmatic way: no backorders at all. In case of backorders we create a new rpl-order which in the end requires the same time and offers the advantage to directly enter a new and correct delivery date.<br />
