<br />
If I delete the backorder form a Purchase Order for subcontracting Production Order. How can I complete the Production order if not all the material will be received?<br />
<br />
Second question: If someone deleted the backorder for the subcontracting order, how can I put it back if the Purchase Order is already closed. Create another line in the PO? but will not be linked to the Production order.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

You can still complete the production order if you receive partial purchase order. The Purchase order is onl for services and the difference will go as production result.<br />
<br />
Its quite simple to re-open a subcontract PO. Just add in tdpur045 and tdpur041 the back order qty and you can receive more on the same line (of course this needs to be done at table level). Since, it is not a purchase/manufactured item, sno other tables are not involved. You may also have to update the supplier balances.<br />

I put back the back order on tdpur041 and tdpur045 manually!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The subcontract order is only for subcontract service. you can receive the subcontract service many times. there are two ways to receive it:<br />
I: in the subcontract material, if you choose release to Warehouse in the purchase data, the process is same as common purchase material.<br />
<br />
II. if you uncheck this option, you can receive it in the purchase control. when you enter the receive qty less than the order data, and the Final receipt is not checked, you can enter the subcontract receive again and add more receipt. when the enter qty is equal to the order qty, the final receipt is checked automatic. And then, you can't receive more .</div></div><hr />
