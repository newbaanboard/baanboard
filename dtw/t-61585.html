<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dmcnally</div><div class="date">6th December 2011, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Session tcmcs0176m000 “Maintain Reports by Document Type” will let you specify a number of extra copies for certain shipping documents like the ASN and Master Bill Of Lading.<br />
<br />
I discovered this session after a user asked me to change the number of copies of the Master Bill of Lading that were printed by default every time they ran tdssc3417m000 “Print Delivery Documents by Advice Note/MBOL” .<br />
<br />
It took quite a bit of sleuthing to find this session, because, as far as I can tell, it does not exist on a menu.<br />
<br />
I finally stumbled on it by reading session help for tdssc3417m000 and finding something about tcmcs0175m000 and then looking at table tcmcs075 and then discovering table tcmcs076 and figuring there must be a maintain session for it, so I just did run “tcmcs0167m000” and badda boom,  badda bing it popped up.<br />
<br />
I even submitted a support ticket and Infor support could not find it on a menu either.<br />
<br />
Obviously a consultant must have known about it during our installation (about 5 years ago, which was before my time) because it contains defaults for the ASN, MBOL, and EDI documents that are printed.<br />
I guess this is one of those things deep in the bowels of Baan that didn’t make it to the surface.<br />
<br />
So I am posting this to potentially save somebody some time<br />
<br />
If anyone knows of its existence on a menu, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

Yes, that appears to be the case as the session only exists in the agso VRC.<br />
