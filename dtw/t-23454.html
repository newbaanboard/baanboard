How to use the   EDI Messages Del4r and and DELJIT in Baan 5.0c sp14 as Sales Schedules functionality is removed after 5.0c sp6.<br />
Any work arounds for the same?<br />
<br />
<br />
Does any one have the background why this was removed at the first instance?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">16th March 2005, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">BaaN has developed the Supply chain extension on BaaN IVc4. The latest version is AGS1 and it is added on BaaNIVc4. I heard from our SSA Global Sales rep that all supply chain functionality is not available in BaaN V and also in ERPLN. And now there are looking to add the missed functionality in ERPLN.<br />
Definately not sure why there are no Sales schedules functionality after SP6 in BaanVc.<br />
<br />
DELFOR's can be used for the forecast.<br />
The DELJIT's can be treated as Sales Orders.</div></div><hr />

Now post sp6 as there is no sales schedules functionality, which tables it updates?<br />
Can any one provide defaults.edi file for sp14?</div></div><hr />

<br />
they took it out because they couldn't get it to work properly and upset a lot of people in the process as many of them only found out about it being removed after they had patched it</div></div><hr />
