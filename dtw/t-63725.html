<br />
My company has used Baan for many years over numerous locations around the world. I have been tasked with setting up some new cycle counting procedures for our location. They want to do standard ABC type of counting, so that we generate and print a count sheet for a selection of parts based on ABC values. With the goal being at least once yearly all of the items are counted. <br />
<br />
The problem I am having is that nobody seems to understand if Baan allows this or if it does how to go about it. I have read the documents for cycle counting and made many attempts at generating counts, but I don't seem to be able to get a count sheet that changes. I have tested using a small location section, and tried entering count results for those items, then run another count and entered dates in the Last Counting Date ranges. But it seems it still generates a count for those same items. <br />
<br />
We would like to do a daily count of a certain number of items, and not have those items appear on a count sheet again under normal circumstances. I see on the cycle count sheets there is a column that should show if an item is a A, B or C item, and seen screenshots in our documentation of parts showing this, but none of the counts I generate ever show an item as an A, B or C. So I don't know if perhaps there is some other configuration missing on the items themselves. <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have tried for years to get this information from our corporate office, where Baan is administered, but for some reason nobody seems interested in helping me. It seems this should be a basic function of the cycle counting procedure, but I can't figure a way to implement it. <br />
<br />
