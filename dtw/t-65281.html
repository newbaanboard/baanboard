<br />
Check in the Planned Inventory Transactions for that item if there are any planned issue transactions. <br />
<br />
There can be Outbound advice's which are not yet picked, there might be some Warehouse Orders which are not yet processed, there might be some production orders to which the material is allocated but not issued i.e. in the to be issued state.<br />
<br />
If everything is fine, use Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions sessions to correct the inconsistencies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you for your quick reply,<br />
when I checked in the Planned Inventory Transaction I saw only the same order line 920 in the same Sales(Manual) WHO008265 that can't confirm.<br />
I have run the session that you told me  Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions (whinp1200m000) but nothing happens.:confused:<br />
<br />
<br />
Reagrds, <br />

<br />
Ok I got it. Delete the outbound advice, create new line, when you go to lot code field, do a zoom and select a lot. Go to transaction date and select a transaction date where inventory exists.<br />
<br />
It happens because, on the date-time you have given on the outbound line, no inventory exists. Change the date and its done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand you, but the date-time that I have given is 30.03.2013 <br />
inventory exists on 26.06.2009<br />
For this item quantity was 33 m, with sales (manual) WHO008265 I issue only 3 m with date 30.03.2013, but  another 30 m I can't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check the date in Stock Point inventory and use the same date and time.</div></div><hr />

I tried what you told me but again nothing happens.:confused:<br />

<br />
When you create a new line in Outbound advice and zoom to the lot code, get a screen shot and attach it. Check the date and time for that lot and also check what is the inventory in hand, blocked, allocated. If its still showing quantity in allocated after deleting the present line, there might be some pending advice's.<br />
<br />
Also, try running check and repair inventory in simulate mode and see if it shows any inconsistencies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">borko_ri</div><div class="date">16th January 2014, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">HI Bhushan,<br />
<br />
Before I created a new line in outbound advice the inventory for this item in session whwmd4100m00 is:<br />
on hand - 30 ; economic - 30;<br />
after created a new line :<br />
on hand - 30 ; allocated - 30;<br />
(you can see in a attched file)<br />
<br />
I hope I've explained properly.<br />
<br />

<br />
You create a new line. Now, create an Outbound advice. Make sure you can view Lot &amp; Inventory Date fields. Now, create a new Outbound advice. Don't use &quot;Generate Outbound&quot; instead create it manually.Select a lot and check its inventory date and quantity in session Stock Point Inventory (whinr1540m000) and put the same date and quantity in your Outbound advice line.<br />
<br />
You might be missing something. Also try check and repair inventory session and run it in Simulate mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I done what you told me, and when I click on the &quot;Release&quot; button occur the following message:&quot;Outbound order line (Sales (Manual), WHO008265 - 1/920-1): Negative inventory not allowed&quot;.<br />
<br />
I saw the check repair inventory session, but I've never used it before. What did mean &quot;Simulate mode&quot;,. without check &quot;Update Mode&quot;?<br />
<br />

<br />
Check and repair checks for the inconsistent data in a few inventory tables and gives you are report if there are any inconsistent entries. If you run it in simulate mode, it will not correct the inventory in those tables but only give you the report about it. If you run in update mode, the data in the tables will be changed.<br />
<br />
I will advice you to run it in simulate mode first. <br />
<br />
Also, check these things once again:-<br />
<br />
1. Check if there are any Outbound advice's against that item in session Outbound Advices (whinh4525m000)<br />
2. If yes, delete them and recheck the stock point inventory for the item if its showing allocated or not.<br />
3. If no, try creating a new advice as I mentioned with proper lot code and inventory date appearing in the stock point inventory for the item and lot.<br />
If its still showing allocated inventory in stock point inventory for the item and lot, run the session check and repair inventory for the item and the warehouse in simulate and see if prints any report.<br />
<br />
A way to run it is as shown in the snapshot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I checked everything you told me and finally I decided to run the session &quot;Check and Repair Inventory&quot; in update mode and correct differences. Тhen allow me to process the order.:)<br />
<br />
Тhanks for your advice, it was very helpfull to me!!<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
