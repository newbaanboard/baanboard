I have a problem when I run session tdinv1550m000. The problem is appear  when we display Purcase Item. The error message is &quot;tisfc0003: Display Planned Inventory Transaction by Item&quot; in header. And &quot; Actual calendar not found when planning [Forward] for work center on 28-06-2002 with 73 time units of planning time&quot; in content... <br />
<br />
Actually what wrong with that and how can we fix it<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">1st July 2002, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">As the post earlier said you have to Update Company calendar, tirou4201m000. This session will tell you if you have broken links. Probably you need to maintain for work center &quot;ZZZ&quot; - which is for whole company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">9th July 2008, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you need to maintain &quot;ZZZ&quot; even though you are setup By Workcenter and not Whole Company?  I'm getting this error when running the Update calendar session.  I cannot get passed it.  I have Calendars out through the end of 2009 for both the work center it is specifying and for &quot;ZZZ&quot;  It keeps stopping on the same production order and says (Forward) planning.  I've changed the planning to (Backward) for this production order, changed the delivery date all to no avail.  Any ideas?  oh and, my message says ... with 5671 units of planning time....how is that converted in days??  that may explain some of this.  I would know why it would need that many days??<br />
