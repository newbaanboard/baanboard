<br />
We have a problem with the additional costs.<br />
We charge a fee if the order amount is under a certain value (for some BPs).<br />
<br />
Sometimes the fee gets invoiced separately, and that annoys some customers.<br />
Is there a way to ensure that additional costs and items always are invoiced simultaniously?<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
Eric</div></div><hr />

<br />
we developed one report:<br />
<br />
It prints all purchase or manufacturing item with status &quot;print sales invoice&quot;, if at least one orderposition is found, it will search for cost item in the same order with status less or equal &quot;print sales invoice&quot;.<br />
<br />
The user who is responsible for printing uses this report to get all order pos lines to the status &quot;print sales invoice&quot;.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Thanks again<br />
