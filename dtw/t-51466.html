Could you also check whether you have any outbound data transaction with the same item, date and location that has not been released? <br />
<br />
Could you also provide some snapshot of the error message you are getting on the Outbound Data session along with the snapshot of Display Inventories by Warehouse/Item/Date or tdilc101 table? It would be more helpfull to see whats going on than to imagine...<br />

   In the snapshot of tdilc101 table, there seems to be 1.29 in the allocated field. Can you please verify if this is true and there is such an allocation from any order. I am not sure if this is a hard allocation or a soft one but it seems like this is the reason why you are getting to only outbound (3 - 1.29) 1.71 in Maintain Outbound Data session..<br />

<br />
where i cheched the allocation for particular order. i dont have idea about allocation. in table tdilc101 i have not seen allocation inventory for other item. <br />
our store incharge enter all this data entry. why it allocated for this particular items. where i chached the allocated inventory. is their manual allocation for particular items.<br />
i apriciate if you clarify in more details. <br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">8th May 2008, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the Hard Allocation sessions under Location Control. Go to the sql level and query all open orders (sls, sfc/cst, rpl, ilc tables) for this particular item...Find out if such a requirement (of 1.29) is there on any of those orders. Check all other location based tables to see if such an allocation is reflected in those tables as well. If you dont find any then i guess you could manually remove it from this table.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">8th May 2008, 23:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Check for allocation in ilcl101 - there are two allocation fields- invenotry unit and storage unit. You can also check for allocation in ltc001 for lot also. <br />
<br />
These are the only two tables that you will need to check.</div></div><hr />

Thank for you reply, i have chacked  the allocation in ilc 101 and ilc001 table. i have seen allocation in table ilc101 for particular item in field allocated inventory storage. <br />
i have not seen allocation in table ilc001 for this item.<br />
how can i remove this allocated inventory from table ilc101?<br />
<br />
is there any session through which inventory can allocated in inventory storage.<br />
<br />
i apriciate if you clarify in  details.<br />

If there is no actual allocation from any transaction for this item, you could remove this figure from ilc101 using GTM..<br />
<br />
**Prior to running this, you could try running Rebuild Planned Inventory Transaction {tdinv0250m000} or Rebuild Inventory Data (ILC) {tdilc0250m000} for this item and see if that takes care of the allocated stock or not. <br />
