<br />
Attempting to set up an inbound ASN via EDI and have managed to create one record in tdpsc040 during testing. However the advice number assigned is 0 and when trying to reprocess further EDI I get the message ASN number 0 already exists.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that the problem lies within the session &quot;Maintain EDI Mesages Supported by Relation&quot; and in particular the setting Type of Number and subsequent series.<br />
<br />
Can somebody please advise me to which &quot;Type of Number&quot; I should be using for an inbound ASN.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I am currently experiencing the same problem.  Did you manage to get around this?:mad: <br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry for the delay only got back today.<br />
<br />
No unfortunately we never sorted this out. The problem appeared to be related to the fact that we were using the extension sch0. According to Baan the inbound EDI message is only supported from sch1 upwards.<br />
<br />
We are still discussing this along the grounds that the Maintain Receipts session in sch0 asks the user whether they want to use an ASN but the EDI session doesn't work and puts it into series 0.<br />
<br />
Just as a matter of interest are you using an extension ?<br />
<br />

<br />
EDI session for inbound asn populates tables tdpsc040 and 41. I can get this to work first time but as the series is not being picked up correctly it allocates an advice note number of 0 in the table.<br />
<br />
Therefore when I run the session again I get an error as asn number 0 can not be generated again.<br />
<br />
I have set the number type to a receipt series with no effect.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">3rd April 2004, 07:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe there is a receipt/purchase order series setup in the purchase perameters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">7th April 2004, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Cannot find anything in the PUR parameters relating to this.<br />
<br />
There is a receipt series in the PSC parameters but this is set and relates to the series for Purchase Orders generated by the receipt. I think the ASN is another series.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 05:29</div></div><div class="posttext">This number starts at 1 and increments. When you receive a new asn (not using the same  supplier/shipping doucment) this number should increment by 1. This is not a first free number that needs to be maintained.  Have you tried to manually enter a couple of ASN's in this session<br />
(tdpsc0140m000)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">8th April 2004, 10:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks I think I'm finally making some progress. <br />
<br />
Entered ASN's manually via tdpsc0140m000 and received them succesfully. <br />
<br />
During the receiving process I was also asked if I wanted to process the financial transactions. I'm not entirely sure what this means so this needs further investigation.<br />
<br />
I will now amend my ASN message accordingly and see if I can process it.<br />
<br />
