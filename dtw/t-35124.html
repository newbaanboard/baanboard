<br />
I have created a Sales Order, following are the details<br />
Sales Order	:	SLS10001<br />
Pos.	10<br />
	Item	-	X<br />
	Qty	-	10<br />
	Price	-	100000<br />
	Amount	-	1000000<br />
<br />
Now i want to get rid of this Sales Order, since the Amount is too big which is listed because of wrong qty. I would like to ZERO the qty.<br />
<br />
Before creating the sales Order, this was position of inventory for item and warehouse, refer to STEP 1 defined in Excel file attached<br />
<br />
After creating a Sales Order and Line, following was the Inventory position, refer to STEP 2 defined in Excel file attached<br />
<br />
Now since by mistake i have specified qty and price as wrong<br />
I CANCELLEED the line so that Business Partner BALANCES also goes back to normal i..e the same state where it was earlier before creation of Sales Order<br />
<br />
After this i saw inventory position got perfect, refer to STEP 3 defined in Excel file attached<br />
<br />
but the BP balances were still a problem, so i reverted back CANCELLED Flag for Pos. 10 back to 'NO' via GTM and deleted the line from Sales<br />
Order Line session, although Supplier Balances are shown correctly in session tccom4513m000, but problem is now with the inventory. <br />
Since I have deleted the line via Sales Order Line session it affected my Allocated Inventory.<br />
<br />
Refer to STEP 4 defined in Excel file attached<br />
<br />
So basically i want to perform 3 tasks :<br />
1)Get rid of the Sales Order line<br />
2)Get the inventory position back to normal what it was before order creation<br />
3)Revert back to Supplier old balances.<br />
<br />
Now problem which i faced after doing GTM, although it corrected supplier Balances, but it touched inventory allocated qty, should i do GTM at that level ? which means change whwmd215.allo field via GTM from -10 to 0 ? or is their any other better way ?<br />
<br />
Refer to attached EXCEL file<br />
Note : Sales Order Header is blocked , and Sales Order has not been Printed yet.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />
<br />

I would suggest that you first run session &quot;Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions&quot; only for that item and not click the update button and see what the result is. If it corrects it then you click the update button.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the same, it worked. The Rebuild inventory worked.<br />
<br />
Just to give more information, the main reason why we landed in this situation was when we created a SO line with a big qty and price, after we cancelled the line, it did not bring the Customer Order Balance back to original, ideally cancelling a line should have brought the Customer Bal. back to normal i.e. the same order bal. should have come which was exisitng before creating this bad line.<br />
<br />
We found a solution with baan 210884, which solves the issue of updating the Customer Order Balances in case if we cancel a SO Line....... will try installing the same.<br />
<br />
Of course other way of bringing or rectifying Customer bal. would have been to run Rebuild Customer Order Balance.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
