We have been live on Baan 3 yrs and have done routine cycle counting but never a total &quot;count everything&quot; cycle count.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions from someone who has done this?  My feeling is that the only way to have Baan produce a list of every item is to change the parameters?<br />
<br />
I look for ward to your suggestions.</div></div><hr />

   You're right. The easiest way to produce a counting list for everything is to set the counting interval parameter for all classes (A,B,C) to minimum. This way, BaanIV will allow recently counted stock point to be recounted. In case you wonder, this particular parameter change is harmless. There's no adverse effect on BaanIV operation.<br />
<br />
   Once you're done with this physical inventory, return the parameter to the original setting if you intend to perform the physical inventory only once. If, however, what you mean is that your company is going to switch from performing cycle counting to only performing physical inventory every year, then you can probably just leave it at its changed state.<br />
<br />
   If only you're on BaanERP 5 you wouldn't have to change the parameter. There's an option to &quot;force&quot; cycle count.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">8th October 2002, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">The only downside to this we have found is that when you process the cycle count all of the last count dates will be identical. If you then reset the parameters back to the original settings your regular cycle counts will not select any locations until the interval elapses and the items become due again. At that point all the items will become due at the same time and if you do not restrict the number of locations to be selected you end doing another physical whether you want to or not.</div></div><hr />
