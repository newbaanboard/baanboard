VERSION(S): <br />
6.1_a3 <br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: <br />
&quot;Print Purchase Orders&quot; (tdpur4401m000) <br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
It is not possible to print a purchase order without price information with session &quot;Print Purchase Orders&quot; (tdpur4401m000). On previous versions this used to be possible. This functionality is needed when a copy of the purchase order is sent with the goods. People handling this order should not always see the price. <br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
A new field &quot;Print Prices&quot; has been introduced in the session &quot;Print Purchase Orders&quot; (tdpur4401m000). With this field the user can decide if the prices need to be printed when the order is printed. <br />
<br />
Any customizations to the report?</div></div><hr />
