<br />
Lot Date<br />
The lot's inventory date. <br />
LN assigns the inventory date to the lot when the lot is received.<br />
<br />
You can use inventory dates to retrieve lots based on the outbound priority.<br />
<br />
If the outbound priority is LIFO or FIFO, the default for the inventory date is the receipt date. <br />
If the item has a particular shelf life, the inventory date is the lot's product expiry date. <br />
An item has a particular shelf life if:<br />
<br />
    The value of the Period for Shelf Life field in the Item - Warehousing (whwmd4100s000) session is Days, Months, or Years.<br />
    A number of shelf life periods is specified in the Shelf Life [Periods] field in the Item - Warehousing (whwmd4100s000) session.<br />
<br />
LN determines the product expiry date as follows:<br />
<br />
product expiry	date = receipt date + period for shelf life * shelf life [periods]<br />
<br />
If the outbound priority is By Location, the lot's inventory date is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Give more details , what happens , example<br />

good day,<br />
<br />
here's an example of my problem<br />
<br />
Outbound item 504121111 with a shelf life of 12(months) configured in item-warehousing, with a lot code: 06302019 and inventory date of:  05:17:2021 14:24:37<br />
<br />
now upon receive dated: 05.19.2019 8:54:52 PM<br />
the error shows as follow:<br />
&lt;-- <br />
Confirm: receipt line:<br />
RRD124214 / 100<br />
<br />
Lot date 01-14-2021 of lot 06302019 differs from the inventory date 05:17:2021 14:24:37 of receipt line RRD124214 - 100<br />
<br />
--&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
item has the same set up from sending company to receiving company...<br />
