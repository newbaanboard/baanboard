We are working with LN 6.1 FP3<br />
<br />
We have a Warehouse order of type Transfer that has been Shipped from Replenishing Warehouse and and now there is a Inbound Line ready for Receipts. Now we need to cancel this warehouse order.<br />
Is there a way to delete the Inbound Line and revert or delete its Outbound process?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for every reply!</div></div><hr />

The workaround would be to receive the inbound line and then transfer it back to the original warehouse.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Consumption amounts for original order (Warehouse Transfer (Manual) nr..) cannot be determined.&quot;<br />
<br />
We don't know how to manage this scenario<br />
<br />
Thanks for you reply!</div></div><hr />

I think you have not mentioned transfer price in warehouse order.<br />

yes there is no transfer price but this is a wip transfer (from Central Warehouse to WIP) and we have other orders like this one with zero price for which LN allowed the Outbound and Inbound confirmation.<br />
<br />
There is something different in this last order and we can not find what. Maybe there is a missing record on whina114 or whina115 tables but we don't know when these records are inserted and how.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are both waerhouse same ...which was in earlier transaction ..I mean as was in last transaction ....You can check ECC No. of both warehouses(If applicable)....<br />
You can attached details, whatever you can provide.<br />

You can double click the receipt line and check whether the date is later than the shipment confirmation date and time.</div></div><hr />
