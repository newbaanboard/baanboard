It is session tppdm7260m000 (Read in and/or Print Buy-from Diskettes).<br />
You can find it in the menu browser:<br />
BAAN Project<br />
  Project Master Data<br />
    Standard Cost Objects<br />
      Buy-from Business Partner Diskettes.<br />
It is a strange place in the menu. It should be in the pricing module. It seems very generic. I'm very curious whether you can use it or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Basgla</div><div class="date">9th February 2005, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Session is also available in 5.0b. Reading the helptext it seems that this is the session I am looking for! It is indeed in a very strange place in the menu and I had never find it.<br />
<br />
I still have to test this session so I am not sure if it works the way described.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply.<br />

Kind Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">16th February 2005, 06:25</div></div><div class="posttext">By looking at session, it seems the session loads Price Books for only one BP.<br />
Would be really nice if Baan can allow users to load in a range.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, it would be a good idea to write an AFS based import session from a file.</div></div><hr />

I think so.<br />

What do you mean with AFS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">17th February 2005, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">AFS is Application Function Server. You can enter data through the front end of Baan, programmatically. This means that all default Baan messages/popups/errors are captured and written to a file and hence you upload data programmatically through the front end and hence without bypassing the application layer.<br />
<br />
Prevents any upload error to a table if done through backend. There are many many posts on AFS in this site. Check them out if you are interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">17th February 2005, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Session tppdm7260m000 looked promising initially but am afraid it would not be useful. <br />
<br />
It requires that we maintain data in sessions like tppdm7550m000 and tppdm7156m000. These tables maintain mapping between the supplier's item-code and unit-code and that of the one found in tcibd001. If this is not maintained, we are not going to get update on supplier-specific price book or on Default price book.<br />
<br />
Too many constraints as I go deeper. I gave up. I would write an AFS on session tdipu0101s000 to update Item Purchase Price so that it updates Default Price book automatically. It will be a different story if I have to update the Supplier-specific Price book.</div></div><hr />
