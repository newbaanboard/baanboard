<br />
I have a problem with allocation of transportation costs to purchase lines and calculation of cost price. When i receive a invoice/s after delivery of materials usually there are two lines in invoice/s:<br />
<br />
1. costs for material/s<br />
2. costs for transportation<br />
<br />
I want to add transportation costs to cost price of materials and for this purpose I use cost items in purchase lines. I execute correctly every step of Purchase Procedure to &quot;Close Received Purchase Orders&quot;. Then i am entering invoice in system and connecting with purchase. That is not work!<br />
<br />
I try also with additional cost (tdpur4128m000), also not work!<br />
<br />
Can some one help me to solve this problem!</div></div><hr />

Check to see if you have any existing lines that need the costs, if none, run a test and that should work for you.<br />

This is a rather tricky thing to model in BaanERP. Have you seen the following discussions:<br />
Item Surcharges? (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=15140)<br />
Standard cost freight charges (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=5541)<br />
