<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BhushanPatil</div><div class="date">6th November 2007, 06:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Experts,<br />
This is related to ERP LN 6.1 FP2 &amp; Warehousing. I am working on test company.<br />
Please refer the attached file for screen shots.<br />
1)I have got sufficient Inventory in Warehouse for a particular item.<br />
2)But when I try to adjust the negative inventory in Easy Adjustment Entry (whinh5202m000 ), the system is not allowing me to do it. It is giving warning message that Negative Inventory not allowed.<br />
3)Please note that the stock point inventory is shown in warehouse. But the same stock point inventory is not shown in the session Easy Adjustment Entry.<br />
4)Also please note that in this is happening with range of items across different warehouses. Also in this same warehouse it is happening with lots of items, although there are some items where such thing is not happening. Hence this is not one of case as such.<br />
5)When there is sufficient Stock Point Inventory for some items in the session Easy Adjustment Entry, the negative inventory adjustment is allowed without giving the warning message. Hence this is not related to Negative Inventory indication, which I have maintained NO.<br />
6)Hence there seems to be problem of appearance of the Stock Point Inventory in Easy Adjustment Entry session.<br />
7)Why the appearance of Stock Point Inventory in this session is behaving in such manner ? Whether there is any setting to be done ?<br />
Please study it &amp; try to give me reasoning &amp; solution for this problem. Please help. Thanks.<br />

<br />
Looking at your screen shots I noticed that you've entered inventory date 11/05/07 06:25:16 PM in the session 'easy adjustment entry' while at the same time I can't see any inventory present for that inventory date (and time) in your stock point inventory session.<br />
<br />
Whenever you fill in the inventory date the system is only looking for stock that is present for that particular inventory date and therefore in your case doesn't find any. In case you fill in for example 11/05/07 05:46:35 PM I don't think you will have a problem.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
Also please check the outbound method for item in warehouse. I assume it should be LIFO or FIFO. This results into storing of Inventory Date with every Inventory Unit.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotjens</div><div class="date">13th November 2007, 09:44</div></div><div class="posttext">One should even consider to change the outbound method to By location: that way it becomes easier to make adjustments and there is less data to be stored. This of course only if the outbound of the items is not by LIFO or FIFO. To change the outbound method one can use whwmd3202m000.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I had gone through your document.<br />
 <br />
According to my observation since your stock point is different i.e. Inventory date is 05/11/2007 at 6:25:16pm where you do not have the stock point inventory. If you observe the time part of the Inventory date it does not match with your Stock Point Inventory report. <br />
 <br />
Secondly, you must be observing this problem in items where your setting of Outbound Method in Item Warehousing session ( whwmd4100s000) is on LIFO or FIFO basis.<br />
If have not done this setting purposely then change your outbound method to Location , by using session Define New Outbound Method ( whwmd3202m000).<br />

<br />
If you want to do some adjustment in your Inventory whose Outbound method is FIFO/LIFO, you need to select the the exact stock point in which you want the adjustment.<br />
<br />
For selecting accurate stock point inventory you can zoom the button next to &quot;INVENTORY DATE&quot; in &quot;Easy Adjustment Entry&quot; session.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your replies. You have pointed out the real problem in this case.<br />
With the help of your suggestions, I was able to sort out the problem.<br />
<br />
1) 1st Method is, in case where the Outbound method is set to FIFO, I selected the exact stock point to do the negative adjustment.<br />
For selecting accurate stock point inventory, the zoom button next to &quot;INVENTORY DATE&quot; in &quot;Easy Adjustment Entry&quot; session is used.<br />
<br />
2) 2nd Method is, In session 'Define New Outbound Method' (whwmd3202m000), I changed the outbound method to Location, instead of LIFO set earlier. And now there is no need of going for exact stock point selection and the negative adjustment is happening easily.<br />
<br />
Thanks once again, for the help. The case is closed.<br />
