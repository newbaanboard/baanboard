We are using Baan IVC4. <br />
I have a question about Maintain Order Types. In this session, we want to change the field &quot;Block As Of Step&quot; on form 2. This is because of an audit requirement.<br />
We are currently blocking as of step 3, but want to change this to step 1.<br />
We have never used blocking, but somehow the field got set when we implemented Baan IV.  Now we just manually block when the situation arises.<br />
<br />
Has anyone used GTM to change the field 'Block as of step' tcmcs042.blcs?<br />
Does anyone have any other suggestions how to change the step where the order is blocked?<br />
We talked to SSA/Baan support and they suggested creating a new order type and set the block to the new step, but we have so many open orders in various steps of completion, it would take a long time to finally close all of the old orders.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />
