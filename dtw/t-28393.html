<br />
We have set up LN so that warehouse transfers should be generated and processed by the TPOP function however, when we generate transfers we get a message saying that the item field has an invalid value in Outbound order lines. Does anyone know why this happens<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Is the item warehousing data properly set for TPOP. I believe that the error occurs while generating a warehouse order and not while processing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">16th October 2006, 12:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, Yes you are right. It is appearing when we generate and it is happening for all items. I think that everything is set up correctly but it is possible that we may have missed something. It also happens with Kanban, we get the same message.<br />
<br />
I was hoping that we would find somebody who has had the same problem and resolved it.<br />

<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">17th October 2006, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you attach the screen print of the item warehousing data for one of the item that is being set for TPOP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">18th October 2006, 08:54</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry, could you be a bit more specific please. I'm not sure that any of the forms on the items - warehousing session are too relevant to this. The &quot;line supply&quot; tab on the &quot;warehouse - item&quot; session is the most relevant and this is completed. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">18th October 2006, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry, its warehousing - item session and line supply tab.<br />
<br />
Also try creating a warehouse transfer order for this item for transferring it from warehouse A to B. This will help in narrowing down the cause of the problem, if there is some problem with TPOP setting or the item master wherein the outbound order line cannot be generated for this item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SDerrick</div><div class="date">25th October 2006, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">We have discovered that this is a bug. The wrong number group is being taken when TPOP is trying to raise a transfer order and therefore the session is trying to overwrite an existing transfer order. Infor are looking into it for us. <br />
<br />
If I find out any more info I'll post it in case anyone is interested.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />
