<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pillai.ganesh</div><div class="date">11th August 2015, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I have inventory for a Item whose &quot;Effectivity Units are Interchangeable&quot; checkbox is  set No, with a particular  &quot;Effectivity Unit&quot;. <br />
My new Sales Order is selling the same item with different &quot;Effectivity unit&quot;.<br />
<br />
I want to ship this item present with me which is of different &quot;Effectivity unit&quot; in Inventory.<br />
<br />
So now I'm setting &quot;Effectivity Units are Interchangeable&quot; checkbox to YES at Item General level.<br />
<br />
But this dosent work :( Even after setting the checkbox to yes for the Item I'm still not able to ship the item present in Inventory which is of a different &quot;Effectivity Unit&quot; than my SO line.<br />
<br />
As its a partial Shipment sequence.... I cannot change the &quot;Effectivity Unit&quot; on my SO line.<br />
<br />
Any Idea as to &quot;Effectivity Units are Interchangeable&quot; checkbox on Item- General Session?<br />
Is this parameter applicable only from the new orders?</div></div><hr />

To deliver the sales order, you may carry out inventory adjustment (-ve inventory for the item present in the warehouse &amp; +ve inventory for the item required for the sales order).<br />
As per my understanding the effectivity unit is prospective and not retrospective. So henceforth all the items &quot;manufactured&quot; / &quot;purchased&quot; by you would be having interchangeable effectivity unit.</div></div><hr />
