<br />
My problem is as follows:<br />
- we are using session tdsls0104m000 Maintain Prices by Price LIst and Item<br />
- we have an item price 0,0795 â‚¬/item<br />
- we tried to change price for -6% by session tdsls0201m000 Global Update of Salaes Prices and Discounts:<br />
   - when we did it in productional companiy, in table tdsls032 we got price 0,0748 (we need it to be 0,0747)<br />
   - in another (test) company, everything works correctly, and we have correct price in tdsls032 - 0,0747.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have an idea which parameter or something else I have to change to have correctr result in productionala company.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I found solution. If I try to do all that thing manually (insert new item in price list), everything works correct. Then I found out that initially price list was imported form Excel file, and obviously there were more decimal places than I could see in table (ttaad4500 Display General Table INformation). I rounded data, and everithing is fine now.<br />
<br />
Thanks everybody for reading this thread.</div></div><hr />
