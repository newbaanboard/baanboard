<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rocky6</div><div class="date">16th June 2005, 22:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Inventory adjustments up (increase inventory) will always be done at standard cost. There is no other place for Baan to get a value for the item, unlike when you buy it on a PO, or produce it on a production order.<br />
An inventory adjustment down (decrease inventory) will be done at the value of that inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sandy_baan</div><div class="date">17th June 2005, 15:53</div></div><div class="posttext">The adjustment was done thru Cycle counting / Inventory Adjustment Orders</div></div><hr />

As one of the member mentioned, negative inventory adjustment happens based on the MAUC. And the correct answer for your positive inventory adjustments question is:- <br />
<br />
when you do a positive adjustment choose the existing inventory date by zooming in &quot;Valuation Date&quot;. Each valuation date stores different cost (i.e. based on the receipt / inv adj transaction. By default baan will put the current system date and time. Since there is no cost exist for the current date and time baan gets the cost from Standard cost.<br />
<br />
Refer the session whina1512m100, it stores the values based on each receipt transaction date. (it's like lot pricing, but uses date to store the price). Hope it clarify your question.<br />
