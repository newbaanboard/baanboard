We would like to find out if there is a way to block the end user not to change a zero price on a PO.  Please advise.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">4th August 2007, 12:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Have you considered using the &quot;Purchase Order&quot; transaction type in session Enter Inventory Transaction by Item {tdinv1101m000} instead of using the mainstream Purchase Order sessions? In this session, there wont be any purchase price associated with the transaction.<br />
If you still want to continue using the Purchase Order sessions, you could place a restriction on the user in session Maintain Table Data Authorization {ttaad4134m000} where you could enter that the user is &quot;Not Authorized&quot; for &quot;pric&quot; &quot;greater&quot; than &quot;0&quot; in table &quot;tdpur041&quot; .. where the double quoted words are the variables and options available in the session. This ofcourse provided that the user wont be using the PO for any other regular orders.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m2_wnt</div><div class="date">5th August 2007, 10:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, SK for the info and for a very good lead in using session tdinv1101m000.  I am wondering if we restrict the user entering a purchase price greater than 0, does it mean the restriction applies to all PO type for that particular user or the restriction can be specified to a specific order type for a specific user ?  Thank you again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">5th August 2007, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes its possible. It only came to my mind after i posted the reply to your thread. Instead of going to Maintain Table Data Authorization {ttaad4134m000}, you could go to Maintain Table Field Data Authorization {ttaad4135m000}. In this session, enter tdpur041.pric as the table field, &quot;Read&quot; as the Data Authorization. Next, instead of validating the order type, i suggest you validate the supplier code. This is because you can only validate one table at a time and order type doesnt exist in pur041(table that we selected). Since its an intercompany transaction, i assume there may not be many supplier code. Therefore in the detail part of this session, enter &quot;suno&quot; under the Field column, in the Operator column choose &quot;equal&quot; or &quot;in&quot; and you can put the supplier code in value 1 and value 2. <br />
When you create a purchase order to recieve items from the source company, this session will check the supplier code and blocks the person from changing the price column..while the other orders of other suppliers wont be affected.<br />
 <br />
Hope i am clear..<br />
