<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metbaan</div><div class="date">3rd May 2007, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We're a company that is currently using Baan IVc4. We're in the early stages of analyzing options for a barcoding solution that provides us with the following features:<br />
<br />
a) Receiving <br />
b) Generating Inbound<br />
c) Receiving Labels<br />
d) Paperless Picks <br />
e) Outbounding. <br />
<br />
I've worked as a technical / functional analyst on Baan for several years now (EDI, Manufacturing, Distribution and Finance), but have no experience in Barcoding. Could someone give me a high level overview of any available data collection applications and how they could be applied to the scenario above. <br />
<br />
As I mentioned earlier, this analysis is in the early stages and we're trying to get a high level view of the solution and identify time and cost estimates for this. <br />
<br />
Any tips or guidance would be a huge help. <br />
<br />
Regards, <br />

<br />
We have a bar-coding solution which can easily accomplish the transactions mentioned along with any other transaction for that matter. The flexibility of  the technology ensures that it can adapt to any desired workflow. It can also be used to chain together transactions to create functionality not native to 4c such as KANBAN purchasing or KANBAN/lean manufacturing. <br />
<br />
Our approach is vastly different from traditional offerings. A large part of the flexibility is owed to the manner in which we integrate with BaaN. We achieve our integration without the use of  traditional function servers,  BOIs or custom code. This approach allows us to effectively accomplish any type or any series of transactions without causing issues each time a service pack or upgrade is applied.<br />
<br />
Our approach effectively removes BaaN from personnel, increasing efficiency and eliminating errors.<br />
<br />
If you would like to know more visit our website (http://www.xpert-inc.com) or it would be my pleasure to take you on a webinar tour of the solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank-you</div></div><hr />

<br />
ARC Gateway offer RF Gateway for Baan - an off-the-shelf solution which includes all the functional areas you mention and more.  In fact a, b &amp; c above are all handled by a single screen with as little as 1 barcode scan!<br />
<br />
RF Gateway takes unnecessary Baan order/process steps away from the user whilst maintaining Baan business logic rules and combining multiple sessions in the background so there are no nasty corrupt database surprises or support problems in the future  whilst at the same time working over many service pack updates without further modification.<br />
<br />
All transactions remain in Baan where at any stage in the process they can also be accessed/progressed from the normal Baan sessions.  Offline processing mode allows 24x7 system availability to the shop-floor when Baan may be down for backups or maintenance.<br />
<br />
Hardware, OS and database independent and compatible with the widest range of fixed and portable wireless terminals - for more details have a look at http://www.arcgateway.com</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for replying to my question. At this point, we're still in the budgeting phase for our warehouse barcoding needs. Would it be possible for either (or both) of you to give me an estimate of the time and cost to implement such a solution with your products. <br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">9th May 2007, 18:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello again metbaan - you should have received a baanboard private message with some additional info and questions so as to provide a quotation.  If you have further questions or don't receive the message please email bb@arcgateway.com<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
