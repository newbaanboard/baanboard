<br />
we are on Baan IVc4 and are starting to use the SMI module right now.<br />
Is there any restriction in session Tables to be Displayed in SMI? We added table tdsls041 and tried to create a report based on this table. The output is simply nothing. Only the report header is printed :( . All other reports concerning customers, contacts.. are working pretty well.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

<br />
sorry, but this is not a problem of writing customized reports (software developement) as it might appear in the subject of the thread.<br />
The SMI module offers the user a session called &quot;Maintain Reports&quot; (tdsmi1120) where a normal user can design simple reports. A second session, &quot;Maintian Selections&quot; offers the opportunity to enter a &quot;selection&quot; by using the text editor. Both, report(-layout) and selection, will lead to simple listings of customers, contacts and features.<br />
All this is working without writing a line of 4GL-code. We try to find out where this &quot;tool&quot; has its limits.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
