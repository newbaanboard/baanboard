For some of there items they use direct delivery via EDI.<br />
They also use cost sets (cost items called fright costs) <br />
We plan to change the distribution parameters, <br />
And select not to print cost items on picking and packing slips. <br />
We tested the change and it was OK as long as we delivered locally <br />
The customer uses Location control (Not Lot Control) <br />
When the delivery went out from a local warehouse its OK <br />
When testing the we found a problem with direct delivery orders <br />
<br />
For a regular order<br />
Create a new order 2 lines 1 regular items and the cost items <br />
The cost item status =  3 (maintain delivery / release outbound) and when the real item is released the cost item status changes to 6 (Print invoice) <br />
<br />
But if the real item is delivered via direct delivery (Purchase order) the cost item does not get processed. <br />
<br />
This is standard Baan functionality.  The automatic released of cost items happens in the &quot;release outbound&quot; session but the direct delivery orders does not use the release outbound session when the order is being processed. <br />
<br />
So how can we get the cost items in sales orders to be processed when using direct delivery?</div></div><hr />
