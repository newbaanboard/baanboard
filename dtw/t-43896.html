   As far as Lot tracking is concerned, Baan4 had Lot Control with it and this was an excellent module to track an item by batch or pieces depending on how you setup your Lot. I am sure you could find this in Ln as well, with much more feature than what Baan 4 had. <br />

LN also has serial number tracking which takes lot control to an extra level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually which function do you advice me to activate for the lot control ?<br />
<br />
Serial number tracking seems way to complex to activate for us.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">7th November 2007, 03:52</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll need lot control parameters whltc0500m000 and also review the setup of the other warehousing parameters.  Review the settings in your warehouses and other misc warehouse master data.   In Item data tcibd0501m000 check field &quot;Lot Controlled&quot;.   And you should be good to test it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">20th November 2007, 16:07</div></div><div class="posttext">If you need serialization, use it.  The system is flexible in that it can be turned on by item coupled with the degree of control you wish to have...low volume or high volume.  For tracking purposes, especially at the finished good level, setting serialization up for tracking isn't that difficult to set-up or manage.  Sure, lot control is slightly easier, but not much.  It really depends on your production order quantities...among other factors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanfer</div><div class="date">20th November 2007, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hy, i'm working for a implementation project of Infor LN.<br />
You can use the lot control and also the serial number to track a single item, for example is very helpful for Service.<br />
To be complaint with Iso you also could install Quality management to manage inspection orders and the Object data management to be complaint with document managemt (acquisition of certificates, ddt, and so on).<br />
The state of the art implementation includes DEM to manage the workflow.<br />
If you want a detailed explanation you can contact me at amixgio@gmail.com<br />

Lot Control &amp; Serialization are two different concepts, A lot is designated to a grouped quantity of an item which is produced or purchased at a single instance(batch). And serilziation gives individual serial nos to each of the items produced or purchased.. i.e helps in identifying each &amp; every unit of the item produced or purchased at a single instance(batch).<br />
However if we need to designate lot nos. of an item &quot;by unit&quot;, this  acts the same as serial Nos.<br />
