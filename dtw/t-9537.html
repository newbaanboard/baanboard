<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbezdek</div><div class="date">7th April 2003, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">When entering sales order lines, we have some lines with cost items that will be for miscellaneous charges (i.e. freight, price adjustments, etc.). When the user enters these, we would like to be able to have them add a standard text, based on the item. For example, if they use the Freight item, the text might be &quot;Freight Charges for SO 89810832, Customer PO 1237293&quot;. Is there an efficient way to add these without having to re-key the same wording for each order line, and just have the user fill in the blanks with the order numbers. Basically looking for a way to have sort of a text template that they could use. We have looked at the standard text functionality and there are ways to make that work but it would be better if there was a more efficient way.</div></div><hr />

well that repetetion of work will definetly be a compulsive activity<br />
unless some customization solution is there( for that also i am not sure)<br />
<br />
but yes<br />
if your purpose is to:<br />
<br />
--Calculate &amp; record freight for each sales order <br />
--you need extreme transperency for your cost booking<br />
--moreover subcontractor wise(Transporter-wise) expenditure reports.<br />
---Or you want to bifurcate your cost to lowest level including multi mode , Multi subcontractor &amp; currency involved<br />
---you want to know diffrence between your estimate freights &amp; actual freights<br />
---Or you want to save energies of maintaining/entering diffrent orders to record freight &amp; then manually maintaining refrences with concerned sales orders ( as either you customize or use standrd you have to link refrences manually &amp; that invites great room for error)<br />
--- Or you are recording your fuel maintainance or other expenditures through purchase orders or by cost item functionality &amp; still not able to get  essential reports<br />
<br />
--Or you wish to record any expense &amp; activity for such cost items<br />
<br />
<br />
In summarized language  if you need complete picture of your freight  with lowest amount of manual intervation <br />
I have a solution<br />
<br />
If your requirement matches to what i understood<br />
i will be obliged to help you out.<br />
<br />
waiting for your reply<br />
<br />

You would need to either customize the sales order line script or use a tool like RMCgen or QKey to call some text functions at the appropriate time.  If you need to prompt the user for more input, then things become a bit more complicated.</div></div><hr />
