<br />
We are running 4c4ags0 and have an issue when booking in receipts (Supply Chain) version whereas the software will let you book in the same packing slip twice. This had led to duplicate bookings.<br />
<br />
I think the theory is that the qty on the Purchase Schedule should stop you booking too much but if the schedule has been inflated or you are due another delivery this is not always the case.<br />
<br />
Anybody think of a way out of this issue without customisation.<br />

But doesn't help if the schedule is inflated anyway. <br />
My ultimate way to fix this if I ever have the time is to make a secure website where the suppliers login view/print their schedule and when they make their delivery, they update their schedule with what they have shipped I then bring that into the edi asn tables and goods in staff only use the asn receipt booking. I have tested populating the asn tables and using the asn receipt that works fine, one day I will hopefully get round to the rest of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ASN's is something I definitely want to try and move towards and a simple home made web site may be the way forward. EDI seems to be too much like hard work for our supplier base where E mail and Excel is God.<br />
