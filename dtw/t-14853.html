It is possible to change the Approved qty in tdpur4121 (Maintain Approvals), but the delivered qty is still wrong and the Inventory is also reduced to much. How to correct?<br />
Accept that the Delivered qty in session tdpur4120m000 and tdpur4121m000 is wrong and do an Inventory adjustment? Or is it any other method?:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">19th March 2004, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm not familiar to approvals but we have a similar problem with wrong entered quantities:<br />
once the order step &quot;Maintain Receipts&quot; is done and the orderline is processed (tdpur4223m000) the delivered quantity can not be modified any more. <br />
We enter a negative orderline for the same PUR-order and process is normaly. The effect is: proper inventory adjustment and no problems when matching the invoice :cool: <br />
Dont forget to ask you finance poeple if they or ok with this procedure ;) <br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
We also only run our &quot;Process delivered purchase orders&quot; oin a nightly basis. With this, we can delete any receipt from the current date and then re-enter or change the appropriate line to the correct amounts.<br />
