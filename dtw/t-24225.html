I have a sales order for 10,000 pieces. I have delivered 8000 pieces and have 2000 pieces as back order. The customer has now cancelled the back order of 2000 pieces. I tried making the back order quantity as zero and then to confirm the backorder, but the backorder with zero quantity does not get confirmed also.<br />
<br />
What is the best way to cancel the backorder?<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Or you can delete the remining order qty in the sales order lines details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your replies.<br />
<br />
The problem is when I go to the specifica menu, only the Confirm Order is accessible. The cancel part is on display mode.<br />
<br />
In the sales order lines, the details button is also on display and no field is changeable in the lines as well.</div></div><hr />

&gt;Sales Order- select your order(mark on) - klik on the left top of your baan screen on SO session &quot;Sales Order Lines (below SAVE picture shortcut).<br />
&gt;In Sales Order Lines you can see the last sequence of the SO Lines that's your remining qty order. If we mark that lines and you see the delete shortcut is up that's mean the order still open and you can delete it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you very much for all your support.<br />
<br />
I solved the problem and it was a bit straightforward. The sales parameter for back orders was set on automatic confirm and hence I was unable to cancel the backorder as the order was getting confirmed automatically.<br />
<br />
I unchecked the parameter and now everything is fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best way is to cancel the back order Qty giving a reason as &quot;Customer Cancellation&quot;.<br />
<br />
Select the Sales Order Lines....Go to Deliveries and Select the Back Order Qty of 2000 Pieces and click Ctrl+F5, given Reason for Cancellation and click on Cancel.</div></div><hr />
