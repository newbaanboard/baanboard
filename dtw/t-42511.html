I have one query in case of the shipment lines(whinh4131m000) in LN 6.1. There is a  button on this session &quot;Return not shipped goods&quot; ,  what are master parameters settings required , so that this button is activated/highlighted.<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance<br />

So if you for example picked 10 pieces but have only shipped 8 than the option will enable and allow you to move from the staging location the 2 pieces not shipped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all thanks for your reply. If our warehouse is normal w/h(not location controlled ) then will it be going to be activated ? I had tested it , my warehouse is non location controlled , and the  button is not activated in case of the partial shipments.<br />
<br />
some more clues regarding this................<br />

<br />
as far as I know this option is only relevant and therefore enabled if you have partially shipped goods and are using location control. As a result a transfer order will be generated that allows to create inbound advice to move goods from staging location back into storage locations. If you don't have locations there is no need to do as much in the system. Of course physically you still might move goods back into stock but the ERP admin is not influenced by that.</div></div><hr />
