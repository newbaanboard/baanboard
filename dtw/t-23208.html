<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ben Snoeijs</div><div class="date">18th February 2005, 11:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a question about warehousing. I've read the literature about BAAN IV. But I can't find anything about the FAS method. I don't understand how it generate his orders and where they go to.<br />
<br />
For the information I have to say that we are an project organisation. But we don't use the project module and also we don't use any MPS ore MRP planning. On this moment the warehousing is SIC. But we get more and more problems to control this.<br />
<br />
Problem is that we can't generate a warehouse order when we don't have a project number. Some parts of the products are planned to produce anonymous. But we want to produce more if we have some hot prospects. But we can't control the situation then anymore. <br />
<br />
Someone any solutions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">18th February 2005, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed Baan help files don't tell you much about FAS. Reading your post, in my humble opinion there's more to answer then: how does FAS work.<br />
<br />
First: FAS only works (according to Helptext) in combination with Generic items. <br />
Second: you're currently not using Baan projects or not even PCS (I guess, refering to your post being a project driven comp, you do use PCS)<br />
Third: what you might try in case you are using PCS: produce unther the flaf of an internal project and, the moment the order comes in, tranfer the end-item with a PRP-warehouse order to the externa project.<br />
<br />
For other solutions are hard to provide: insight details of your complete business processes are required I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ben Snoeijs</div><div class="date">18th February 2005, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">That's exactly a big problem for us. We don't use PCS because the system is not flexible enough to change orders which are planned. And we do have a lot of orders which are changing afterwards. So that's the reason. Our current production planning is still in excel. So we have to make changes, but it's not easy because our organisation is very complicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">21st February 2005, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">looks like a challenge to me: have some experience in very complex customer order driven organisations, and tuned Baan in a way that even order changes till the very last moment (even at customers approval when installations are already completely build) are managable.<br />
<br />
can't imagine to work without PCS: it's one of the reasons Baan stands where it is today: to support order driven businesses.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ben Snoeijs</div><div class="date">21st February 2005, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a big challenge and they tried it ones before. To plan the production into BAAN IV. But then the problem was that the orders which were definitive weren't easy to change afterwards. Result: to much hand work when some time or products we're changing. Could you maybe tell me something more about you're solution? In which way do I have to search?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">22nd February 2005, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">depends on what root cause of most of the changes are:<br />
1: changes in capacity planning: we've developped some tools to automatically reschedule orders based on lead times and prio's<br />
2: changes due to customer request which leads to new materials demand: developped enhancements to automatically update estimated materials via interfacing from PDM-engineerings database, even when orders are already released (of course only workable for materials not backflushed/allocated yet)<br />
<br />
wasn't involved in both issues myself, so don't know all details.<br />
where are you located btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ben Snoeijs</div><div class="date">23rd February 2005, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your help. I'm also not having the details, because I'm busy to get to know how the system works. And later on I want to do some improving tests. It's for my final scription for school and I'm located in Raamsdonveer in the Netherlands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pengod</div><div class="date">10th April 2007, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">FAS module is a fantastic tool to maintain fixed assets. We can group the fixed assets into main groups &amp; sub-groups, name the locations. We can quickly define depreciations method and additional depreciation method to a particular asset or group of asset similarly the simulated data also useful in generating various outputs that are required. The revaluation of assets, reduction costs permits to experience hands on over baan.</div></div><hr />
