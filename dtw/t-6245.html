We are using Baan IVc4 with location control.  Our outbound data table (tdilc401) has 110,000 records in it.  109,000 of these records have a processed flag of 'yes,' meaning that the outbound data has been released.<br />
<br />
The standard session, 'Delete Outbound Data,' removes the non-released entries from this table, but leaves the released entries alone.<br />
<br />
Is there a standard baan session for purging these processed records ?<br />
Are they required for historical data ?  I don't think so, since the actual inventory transactions are written into the inventory history tables.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">15th August 2002, 23:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan support proposed the following solution:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you about deleting outbound records but I was doing some exhaustive testing to ensure that there would be no problems encountered in any areas.<br />
<br />
The session tdilc4211m000 (delete outbound lines) is meant for deleting outbound that has not yet been released.  For outbound data that has already been released (shipped), the normal sales order processing steps remove the completed outbound lines.  During the process of deleting sales order data in session tdsls4223m000 (Process Delivered Sales Orders) using the delete order data option, the relative tdilc401 (outbound data) records are also deleted.<br />
<br />
If for some reason you do not routinely delete the fully processed sales order data, then the completed outbound data will also not be deleted.<br />
<br />
Part of the testing which I carried out was an unsupported work around whereby I manually deleted the relative outbound data through table maintenance.  Once the Sales Order was fully processed and ready for 'deleting line', I deleted the outbound data for the order in tdilc401 and found that I was still able to run tdsls4223m000 in delete mode for the sales order<br />
<br />
Interesting, I never thought to test Process Delivered Sales Orders in delete mode.<br />
<br />
Does this approach sound acceptable for getting rid of these processed outbound data lines:<br />
<br />
Write a custom baan session that does the following:<br />
a)<br />
Reads tdsls045 to find sales sales order lines that have been processed through to 'deleting lines'<br />
b)<br />
For each of these records in tdsls045,<br />
lookup tdilc401 for records that have the processed flag set to yes, and delete these records.<br />
<br />
Obviously, significant testing would be carried out on this session.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
John<br />
<br />

Yes, that is what I would probably do.  Just be careful to ensure that tdsls045.ssls = 7 AND tdsls045.pmsk position 7 = 'e' otherwise if the status is 7 but pmsk step # 7 = y then the sales order line is only ready for 'process delivered orders'.</div></div><hr />
