<br />
When does Baan delete records in tdilc402 Inbound Table ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dkulikow</div><div class="date">20th April 2004, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi!  In answer to your question about the tdilc402 table and when it gets deleted, it is deleted when the session tdpur4223m000 is executed.  Please note, this session will also delete data from the following tables:<br />
tdilc111, tdpur040, tdpur041, tdpur042, tdpur045, tdpur046, tdpur47, tdpur048<br />
<br />
Updates:<br />
tdpur301, tdpur306 and could tdsls041, tdsls045<br />
<br />
I hope this helps out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
at SSA Baan ERP IV (4c4) with solution 164842 (febr. 2004) the delete option was removed from session tdpur4223m000 because You can delete and/or archive the purchase orders with session tdpur4227m000 (solution 164461)!<br />
<br />
Because of GDPdU in Germany, there should be no purchase order deleted anymore but archived, if nessessary. So SSA implemented this new functionality, on the sales too.<br />
<br />
This for Your information !</div></div><hr />
