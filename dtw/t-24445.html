The session tfgld4410m000 definitely can give the information u mentioned . Maybe it's not in the format one would desire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mahadevan</div><div class="date">3rd July 2005, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I was using same report for cross checking. Now I want how this amount is fallen , is there any way to check how the difference is calculated.<br />
<br />
please advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">5th July 2005, 06:18</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  For the Revaluation, when the cost price updation is done, the system  <br />
    prints a report almost exactly in the same format as you want. This shows <br />
    prev std cost, curr std cost, qty, change in invrntory value. <br />
    It is the normal practise by users to just display this report only instead<br />
    of printing. Then when accounts ask for details, they try to give the <br />
    Print integration details for Reval, which is not quite the format which <br />
    accounts need. So next time a reval is done. pls ask the user to print the<br />
    report and submit it to you. As a trial u can ask any one item to be <br />
    revalued and then check the report output also.<br />
<br />
2.  For the ppv, the standard integration report only shows the difference<br />
    between the std cost and the PO price in homecurrency. But most of the<br />
    operation people would like to see the PO price and std cost also in the<br />
    report. This is quite complex and needs to be customised. Care has to be <br />
    taken to differentiate between ppv-1 (diff between std cost and PO) and <br />
    ppv-2 (diff between invoice price &amp; PO price).<br />
    We have customised this but were able to show the details for only ppv-1 and the staff are quite happy with that.</div></div><hr />
