<br />
could you tell me how to separate supplier and customer.<br />
<br />
Actually customer and supplier are in the same table. (Business partner)<br />
<br />
That's means buyer can access to the customer service contact information.<br />
<br />
Any idea to solve this issue ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Dear David,<br />
<br />
is it possible to create two category ? <br />
<br />
One view with only the supplier, and an other one with the customer ?<br />
<br />
I need to separate it for confidentiality issue. The customer service manager don't want that our buyer can see the customer data !<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot !<br />

<br />
If the BP header (tccom100) is also a problem with the business owners then you could use field level security to limit the access to specific records. This however is extra burden on the database so performance suffers.  So I'd push back on the manager requesting this.   However if you were going to do field level security you'd need to define something to tell the system what is a Supplier, Customer or Both.  You could use the numbering series such as what David suggests or if using LN FP2 or higher there is a hidden field tccom100.bprl which classfies a BP with 1 of 4 options (Customer, Supplier, Customer and Supplier or None)  This field is updated based on the roles that have been assigned or not assigned.</div></div><hr />
