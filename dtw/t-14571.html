I am using adjustment orders to enter warehouse opening balance in Baan Vc. In order to enter correct quantities and prices, I set item item type to purchase and then entered a purhase price and calculated the item standard price. then I created an adjustment order and entered the required quantities for opening balance and then processed these adjustment orders. So far no problem, item quantities in warehouse is correct as is warehouse valuation. The problem occurred when the client was rechecking the warehouse valuation and discovered that some item price had been incorrectly entered by the data entry team. The solution that came to my mind was to create a new adjustment order with negative quantity for that item and then enter a new item purchase price and re-calculate the item standard price and then finally create a new adjustment order with the correct item quantity and process the last adjustment order. What actually happened was that Baan completely ignored the new purchase price and calculated item standard price. The warehouse valuation was increased by the old item standard cost price. How can I change the item cost price that will be used in inventory adjustment?<br />
Hope somebody can offer quick assistance<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faditimo</div><div class="date">24th February 2004, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for the speedy reply. I've already tried your suggestion to change the calculation method in the first priority of the actual price calculation code. I set the first priority to current purchase price and after calculation and actualization the item standard price is correctly updated. However when I create a new adjustment order the inventory is adjusted with the old item standard price and the new calculated standard price is not used. I tried this again now with an item with price 10. I adjusted the inventory by +10 pcs and the inventory valuation correctly increased by 100. Then I changed the item purchase price to 15 and recalcuted the item standard cost price which was then correctly updated to 15. I then created a new adjustment order for another +10 pcs. After processing the second adjustment order the inventory valuation was again increased by 100 and not by 150 as it should have been. Is there something I am missing or is this some sort of bug? Also is there some other way to create warehouse opening balances? I've thought of manual warehouse purchase orders but our finance consultant says it would cause complications. I've tested the idea of using manual warehouse purchase orders and the inventory valuation is correctly updated but I'm worried about the financial implications.<br />
Thanks again and hoping to hear from you again soon</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faditimo</div><div class="date">24th February 2004, 13:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Flip_J<br />
I've tried your suggestion to change the item valuation method to ftp. I set the item purchase price to 10 and then used a purchase order with purchase price 20 just to check how the inventory valuation would turn out. The system values the item at 10 which is the fixed transfer price I have defined and is as expected. While this is great for entering the opening balance, I can foresee problems in the future such as :<br />
<br />
1 - Actual purchase price entered in purchase order will have no effect on inventory valuation which will always be incremented by the item ftp. This will not produce a correct inventory valuation although I imagine the financial transactions will use the actual purchase price<br />
<br />
2 - If this item is issued as a raw material for a production order, it will be valued at the inventory valuation price (item ftp). This will produce inaccurate production order costing and will result in inaccurate finished product cost and valuation.<br />
<br />
Of course if I change the item valuation method to ftp and then enter an adjustment order, I will be unable to change the item valuation method back to MAUC once economic stock exists for this item in a warehouse.<br />
Thanks for the assistance and sorry to keep bothering you but I need to wrap up this problem quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">24th February 2004, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do an inventory adjustment for a new item with no inventory MAUC = FTP price. From now MAUC will be used on stock transactions and not the FTP price. This is only valid for the very first inventory adjustment where MAUC = 0.<br />
You will not be able to change the valuation method once you have stock. In your case you need to create a purchase order for a dummy supplier. Make sure you have no stock and then the price on the purchase order should be the MAUC after receipt. Not a nice solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">24th February 2004, 19:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep rereading your initial post and wondering about the transaction date(s) on your adjustment orders. Specifically, are you backdating the adjustments to the initial opening balance stock date?<br />
<br />
Say, for example, you are loading inventory as of Feb 1 and on or before Feb 1 you initially calculated a std cost of $10 (based on item purchase price). An adjustment of 10 units dated Feb 1 gives the inventory valuation of $100.<br />
<br />
On Feb 2 or later, the client discovers an error in the item price, so you reverse adjust the 10 units (as of Feb 1), enter a new item purchase price of $15 and recalculate the std cost as $15. If you now re-enter the adjustment order for 10 units backdated to Feb 1, the valuation as of Feb 1 (the start-up date) will still be $100 because the effective date of the newly calculated std cost is Feb 2 (or later). <br />
<br />
That definitely should be the result if valuation method is FTP. I think it is also the way a backdated warehouse adjustment order would be valued under MUAC if there is no economic inventory of that item in the warehouse when the adjustment is entered, but I dont have access to a Baan V system to test/check. <br />
<br />
Just a thought and youve probably already considered/eliminated this, but I was hoping to find a simple explanation.<br />

What you are saying is correct. If you use ftp then items entered into warehouse using adjustment orders are valued at the currect standard cost price (which i've calculated using the current purchase price in item purchase). However if you use MAUC then items entered using adjustment orders are valued using the latest MAUC. In my case, since the item had already been adjusted then MAUC already exists for this item. Any new adjustments are valued at the existing MAUC (in your example 10). This occurs even if the adjustment order date is after the latest item standard cost price calculation date. So even if I have calculated the item standard cost price on Feb2 and set it to 15 and then create a new adustment order on Feb3, the warehouse value will be increased by 10*item qty (the 10 being the old item standard price which was set as item MAUC when I made the first adjustment order). I can't find any way to change the item MAUC short of using purchase orders from a dummy BP which as Flip said is not a good solution. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I can't think of any other way to enter opening balance in warehouses.</div></div><hr />
