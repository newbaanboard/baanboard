<br />
We have a Sales order created in the system with the currency in US $. The sales order is processed but invoice is still not printed. The currency was input wrongly and we would like to change the currency at this stage. <br />
<br />
The only way that we know is to use the session &quot;Change prices and discounts after deleveries&quot; where the price could be changed in the same currency. But however the currency cannot be changed.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to change the Sales order currency in Baan in the above given scenario???<br />
<br />
Please help!!!!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />

Change the currency, enter the correct price &amp; amount (both &quot;foreign&quot; and &quot;home&quot;), fix the conversion factor and rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 09:48</div></div><div class="posttext">As you say: quick and dirty: think about all integration transactions (sales/deliveries) that may already be posted.<br />
Currency changes after SO line entry and price changes after deliveries/invoicing are candidate for improvement.<br />

One has to be so careful with ttaad4100. Especially when all the integration transactions with Finance are involved.<br />
I would recommend to run your invoice in USD, do a credit invoice in USD against this sales order as if you are doing a return shipment and then process the sales order with the correct currency and invoice it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this is the safest way to deal with BAAN's &quot;over-the-fence&quot; way of programming.<br />

<br />
The idea of using ttaad4100 actually came from Baan Support.  We logged a question about an incorrect currency on an order, and their reply looked like mine does!  Obviously I must have missed out on the integration part, but I can't remember the finance guys complaining, so I assumed everything went ok.  If I get a chance, I will contact the financial guys at the customer to see what they say about this...</div></div><hr />
