When the demo item is sent to the client, you could create a Financial Sales Invoice against the SalesMan's Customer Code... <br />
If there is no document (Sales Order) which shows the item is sent to the client, then you could create a Sales Order in the name of the SalesMan's Customer code and invoice it. This way you take care of your stock and you charge your SalesMan..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">6th March 2008, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">In our scenario, we take a GL hit when we create a Demo stock. All Demo stock is valued at zero standard cost. But in our case we need to monitor the stock as salesmen keep shifting the stock back and forth. We have created a Demo warehouse with location for each sales person and we keep moving the inventory using RPL order. When salesmen quits we know how much demo inventory he is carrying and then Bill it or recover. If we ever have to sell from Demo we create a sales order and sell it from there.<br />

Can I suggest you make another location in the warehouse for each salesman. One would show inventory in house, the other would show inventory with the salesman. You could do a simple location transfer to move the goods back and forth if the items physically move in and out of the warehouse.<br />
