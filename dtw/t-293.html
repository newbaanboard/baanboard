<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Bailey</div><div class="date">18th October 2001, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to use Purchase Requisitions in Baan 5c, but have run into a snag. The first problem is that it does not allow us to convert cost items into purchase orders. More than 55% of our purchasing is MRO purchasing, so this is a problem. The second problem is when we put a cost item on a requistion, we can not enter in the GL fields. We need to be able to do this in order to charge the correct accounts in the GL. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Also, have you thought about e-procurement?  Its directly aimed at the MRO procurement function.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see why you have problems with cost items, because you don't get a Purchase Price Unit with a cost item, which is supposed to be an additional charge to an order rather than a non-production item.  <br />
<br />
It works fine for items of type Service though!:)</div></div><hr />

It is possible to create &amp; convert requisition lines for cost items to Purchase orders. Maybe you still have a warehouse in the Requisition header?:p</div></div><hr />
