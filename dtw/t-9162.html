<br />
How did this happen? If production operator reports the wrong quantity (say report qty produced of 1000 when only 900 is actually produced) and this quantity end up in SFC module, this wrong quantity should have been caught by store personnel checking incoming product. The store personnel should have keyed in the right quantity to your barcoding software on the warehouse side and this right quantity would end up in INH module. And since the right quantity is recorded in INH, the financial record will also be based on the right quantity.<br />
<br />
However, if both your production operator and store personnel missed the wrong quantity, then I guess you would have to report negative quantity completed in SFC side and proceed. This can be performed in BaanERP, I'm not so sure about BaanIV<br />

<br />
1. The Qty reported &lt; Actual Qty<br />
    --&gt; This case could be more straight forward, you can report additional qty completed (provided production order is not closed). You may face problem in Lot Number (if Lot by Lot)<br />
<br />
2. If Qty reported &gt; Actual Qty<br />
   --&gt; You can create the Inventory Adjustment for the additional qty and take out from stock with reason code. But this will have the impact on Production Order costing.<br />

However, I did want to use askajale suggestion because of the costing implication etc.<br />
Any more ideas how to deal with this since its not an ideal world?<br />

Thanks guys.<br />
