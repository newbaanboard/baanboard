<br />
This has come pretty slow for us especially for customers with huge account. The system would literally go to a standstill. Then the same thing happens if you maintain sales order lines, texts.<br />
<br />
Is there any workaround to this? It just gets frustrating for our sales order people to have to wait several minutes for entering just one sales order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st October 2002, 01:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...Page Mode (set on the User parameters) may help you some.  They can tab around the page at least.  However, all those checks will just happen on the 'save', but you can see if it helps you guys.<br />
I think (very roughly) what page mode does is take the entire form (session?) entry like a batch job.  So the check inputs, etc, do not get performed as you tab through the fields, but only once when you either go to the next form or choose save.  Not sure of all the details.<br />
<br />
Also, some sessions and actions are not available using page mode, but you should find that out pretty quick.  It gives you an error message.</div></div><hr />

<br />
check the parameters in Session tdsls4100m000 (Maintain<br />
Sales Order Parameters)<br />
<br />
Parameter:<br />
- Block if Credit Limit is Exceeded<br />
- Signal if Credit Limit is Exceeded<br />
<br />
I think in your case these parameters (one or both) are enabled.<br />
If you don`t need these checking, disable the parameters.<br />
<br />
Additional you can check:<br />
- Block  if Invoice is Overdue<br />
- Signal if Invoice is Overdue<br />
<br />
In our company all of them are disabled.<br />
