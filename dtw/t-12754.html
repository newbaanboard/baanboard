We are on BaaN IV C4 and were on SP4 earlier. Then in the Purchase order lines we could define the quantity and then skip the price and then the system would allow us to define the total amount.<br />
<br />
Now we have upgraded to SP12 and the system does not allow input of total amount when we define the quantity. Is it a change in functionality or a bug?????<br />

There is no change in the Functionality, I think due to the Bug, you are facing the Problem. Just now I checked on SP12, it was working fine. <br />

In our system it allows only in case of Cost or Service items. It does not allow in case of Purchased item. Have u tried for Purchased items in your system with SP12.<br />
<br />
Let me know.<br />

Thanks!!!<br />
