<br />
we have a foreign branche which orders through EDI. Now they have a second warehouse, on a different location. Both locations have the same baan system, and also the same company number. The only difference is the warehouse code in their order.<br />
When they send an order through EDI, the warehouse code is included in the ascii-file.<br />
<br />
Is there a possibility to have this warehouse code converted into the delivery address of our sales order?<br />
<br />
So, what I want is when they order for warehouse 1, the delivery address in our sales order should be 1, when they order for warehouse 2, the delivery address in our sales order should be 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which type of message does the incoming order use ?<br />
<br />
Download the EDI definition from this site <br />
<br />
http://edi.baan.com/ <br />
<br />
Check out the position within the ASCII file. You should be able following through the mapping to see where within Baan the warehouse code is being written. <br />
<br />
My experience is more related to supplier chain where the customer plant code must exist on the sales contract which is attached to a seperate delivery address.<br />
<br />
Hope this is of some use.<br />

Also remember that unless you turn it off EDI is going to pickup the delivery address for the line based on the PO Line warehouse in the 850.7 record.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abhijeetp</div><div class="date">4th February 2004, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a provision in EDI to maintain conversions for certain codes. Check the &quot;Code and Conversion Tables1 ---&gt; Conversion In&quot; you will find a session to &quot;Maintain Conv. of Delivery Address Codes by Customer (In) --&gt; tcedi3110m000<br />
<br />
Maintain the conversion between the incoming code in the message and the required outgoing delivery address code for the concerned customer and this should set things right.<br />
<br />
for e.g. if the code of warehouse in coming message is 001. and the delivery address for your sales order is 100 for Customer E1000 then....<br />
<br />
Customer code = E1000<br />
Organization = &quot;EDI&quot;<br />
Address Code ID = &quot;ZZZ&quot;<br />
Code in message = 001<br />
Code in application = 100<br />
<br />
Hope it helps...<br />
<br />
