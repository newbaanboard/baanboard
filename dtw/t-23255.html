My user created SO with 200 w/h and generated PO for SO with 200w/h. He made receipt for PO now material in stage location. now he realised that w/h should be 210 in SO so he changed W/H in SO.<br />
<br />
Now the problem is how to move material from Stage location to Normal location with in W/H 200 and how to move these inventory from 200 to 210 so that user can outbound from 210w/h.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. I tried to move material from STAGE location to NORMAL but it is not allowing me to move. Because order is cross docking that means material reserved for particular ship-id.  <br />
<br />
As our order is supply chain order. i.e SO linked to PO. <br />
Steps to simulate issue<br />
1. Create SO with warehouse WH1<br />
2. Generate PO for SO<br />
3. W/H in both SO and PO is WH1<br />
3. Release to warehousing batch for PO &amp; SO<br />
4. Now user realized that W/H on SO side is wrong so he changed W/H to WH2 on SO side.<br />
5. Inbound the material to W/H1<br />
6. But He could not able to outbound material from W/H2.  <br />
<br />
I appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
