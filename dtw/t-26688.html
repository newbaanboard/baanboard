<br />
I'm new to Distribution module in Baan IVc4 and I;m using the demo company data to do some testing. I have faced a few problems as mentioned below:<br />
<br />
1. In Form 2 of session tdpur0101m000, I can't set the value of Gross/Net field from Gross to Net for a selected item but I can set from Net to Gross. The discount method in parameter is set to Parallel. Any idea why I cant change from Gross to Net?<br />
<br />
2. I've defined appropriate cost item and cost set, and linked the cost set to a certain supplier.The &quot;Add Costs Interactively&quot; field in session tdpur4127m000 is set to Yes.<br />
<br />
I then tried to create a PO and select the specific supplier (the one defined in cost set) and another standard item. Upon saving and exiting the tdpur4101m000 session, I was prompted to select whether I wanted to add additional cost, which I've selected Yes. However, upon selecting Yes, the defined cost item (associated with the cost set and supplier) is not added automatically, even though the Add Costs Interactively setting is Yes. I have to go to tdpur4102s000 session and manually add the cost item to indicate the additional cost incurred.<br />
<br />
Is this the default behaviour (where I have to manully insert the cost item)?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help. Thanks.</div></div><hr />
