<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shalini_narang</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I was getting an error message while trying to confirm the shipment: Could not confirm shipment line SH0023527 - 1.<br />
After analysis, i got the reason of this error: The sales order line was cancelled against which this shipment is generated.<br />
<br />
Now my question is if the sales order line is canceled then how it can be displayed in the pending sales orders ?<br />
Pls help me out in finding the solution of this problem y it is happening ? Is it a bug or some other problem ?<br />
