<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ale_baan</div><div class="date">13th August 2004, 10:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I am trying to understand what is the logic of the products' flow -inbound and outbound- in the warehouse. Meaning, what are the locations proposed by Baan (Baan V by the way) when different priorities, fixed positions per article and ohter variables are set.<br />
<br />
I found, on session Locations whwmd3100s000, that both a Priority and a Sequence can be defined for each Location ...and would like to understand what is the meaning of those 2 sections (2 fields per section). i.e. how to use them. Am attaching the picture to make this more clear<br />
<br />
anyone with expertise on this?<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the help text for the first field that i am sure you already read:<br />
&quot;When generating inbound advice, BaanERP first checks whether any fixed locations are available where the items can be stored. If so, BaanERP then checks the inbound priority as it has been recorded in the Dados de localização por artigo (whwmd3102s000) session. With equal priorities, the location code is the decisive factor.<br />
<br />
When items cannot all be stored in the fixed locations, BaanERP will consider locations that are not fixed if the Aviso de entrada por localização livre check box in the Parâmetros de dados mestres (whwmd0100s000) session is selected.<br />
<br />
If more locations are available which are not fixed, these are also handled in sequence of inbound priority. This priority can be recorded with a number by location as well as location by item. The lowest number has the highest priority.<br />
<br />
When there are many non-fixed locations for the same item, BaanERP will advise by sequence of location code (when priorities are equal). <br />
The lower the code, the higher the priority.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the inbound order first checks fixed locations, then the item data and afterwards the free location parameters (where you can define a priority for this in this session) to determine to where it should store.<br />
<br />
The second field for the inbound is a way to order the storing list (arranging the locations in a logical and less costly way).<br />
<br />
For the outbound is the same thing.. the first field defines the outbound priority for the itens, the second is the picking order sequence inside the warehouse.<br />
<br />
Hope i could help,<br />
