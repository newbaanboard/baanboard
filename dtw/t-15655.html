<br />
We had problem in our customer site regarding this item transfer feature. Sure it is a very useful last resort tool when somebody creates inventory transaction using wrong item code, but it creates a little mess in Finance module. Problem is BaanERP will book the movement of the source item at its valuation price (whatever it is you set for in Inventory Valuation Method for the item group of this source item), but will book the movement of the target item at its standard cost price. Hence, we have imbalance between outgoing and incoming value. Depending on how serious this thing is to your Finance people, you might want to find other alternative rather than using this feature<br />
