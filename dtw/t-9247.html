<br />
I would like to know the updation sequence in the following tables:<br />
<br />
tdpur045<br />
tdpur041<br />
tdpur901<br />
tdind020<br />
<br />
We are customising various reports, for receipts and purchase orders.  For some transactions, the values (e.g., basic price tdpur045.pric and tdind020.pric) are different, when picked from tdpur045 and tdind20.  I would like to know, what could be the reason for this change?<br />
<br />
and also, Whenever change prices and discounts after maintain receipt session is run, which tables does it affect?<br />

<br />
Updation sequence is<br />
tdpur041, tdind020  - PO Lines and Lines Extension<br />
tdpur045, tdpur901 - Receipts and Receipts Extension<br />
<br />
As for why 045.pric and 020.pric is diffrent, this depends on your localisation version<br />
<br />
for in5 - these would be same since localisation is seperated from <br />
std baan, for localisation versions prior to in5 tdpur045.pric includes taxes and duties, while tdind020.pric is actual basic pric.<br />
<br />
What happens when change prices is executed, for BaaN4c4 sp9 and above if price in changed in &quot;Change prices after maintain receipts&quot;, it will be updated in PO lines also ( tdpur041, tdpur045, tdind020, tdind901). Previous verions only tdpur045 and tdind901 were affected. Incidently help text on this session remains unchanged and gives wrong info.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />
