There is no place where Baan keeps who generated the o/b. Only thing is there is run number. However, it can be acheived by modifying it. And you don't need a source code. You can modify the generate o/B report. This is based on assumption that user will always print a report.<br />

You can either create a new table or modify tdilc401. It should be very straightfoward. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">7th July 2007, 15:23</div></div><div class="posttext">For the above step to work, you have to enable the checkbox named &quot;History&quot; in Maintain User Data for the particular user. The downside of this procedure is that the file that stores the history grows at an alarming rate and unless its purged periodically, you might even run out of diskspace. Once you purge the whole purpose of logging the history is gone..So i doubt the usefulness of the above step...But its a start..<br />

can u try the following<br />
1. Create an AFS to call session &quot;tdilc4101m000&quot; and copy the standard table &quot;tdilc401&quot; and add a field user name. <br />
2. Generate outbound through AFS, it rus as per standard &quot;tdilc4101m000&quot; then it updates the field username along with. <br />
<br />
try it out, and let me know the result.<br />

<br />
That is true that you can not use the session Print user history for a specific sales order number. If u want this for a specific order, you can create a SQL Query in which you have to use these two tables: Outbound Advice (whinh225) and Runs (whinh400). First search the run number for that order number in whinh225 and then go to table whinh400 &amp; find the login name for that run number. on the form level, just input the order number.<br />
<br />
Try this, hope it will work for u.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">13th July 2007, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, we did a customization to trap all changes (add \ modify \ delete) to outbound data.  We debated doing this through the oracle level using triggers, or to add it through the baan tools.<br />
<br />
We ended up doing it through baan.  We modified :<br />
- generate outbound,<br />
- maintain outbound<br />
- delete outbound<br />
(plus a bunch of custom sessions that affect outbound)<br />
<br />
to insert records into our history table.<br />
<br />
We wanted this logging to be able to track who was changing outbound.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

In which case, i think the triggering option is not bad at all. You could place a trigger on insert/update/delete on the outbound table and update a local table with the information you need as and when any of the update event takes place. <br />

The easiest, by which i mean to say the simplest, solution would be to initiate auditing. By having the audit turned on for a table(of your choice) you could record who does what on it and could be helpfull in your cause. Since the audit creates a lot of files, you can have a piece of software read those files and store the necessary info in some table outside baan. This will let you delete the audit files to save space on the server. I have not implemented audit management and so you would have to check Baan for the documentation part or even search baanboard.<br />
 <br />
The same applies to Sales Invoicing. Sls051 table would have been a great source for your requirement, unfortunately it only stores the user who processes the invoiced orders and not who invoices it. Turning on Audit on the Sls045 table could help you in this regard, unless ofcourse if someone out here knows a table that stores the info you seek...<br />
