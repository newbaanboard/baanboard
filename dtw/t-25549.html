I am facing a problem during inbounding. When I select some item to be inbound I get a message &quot;Quantity received already allocated or issued&quot;. It doesd not allow me to inbound the material and continues to show in RECP or INSP Location. I think someone had run the Generate Inbound / Outbound session. I have released all inbound outbound. But the problem persists. Can anybody tell me why this is happening and what can be done to remove these from INSP / RECP location and from pending inbound.</div></div><hr />

Also check if cycle count orders are present. If both are not in, try one of the recovery sessions because then tables are messed up.<br />

Good luck<br />
