We're gonna port our business partner data from one company to another. Would doing import and export through Exchange on tables<br />
 tccom100 bp<br />
 tccom110 sold to bp<br />
 tccom111 ship to bp<br />
 tccom112 invoice to bp<br />
 tccom114 pay by bp<br />
 tccom120 buy from bp<br />
 tccom121 ship from bp<br />
 tccom122 invoice from bp<br />
 tccom124 pay to bp<br />
 tccom130 addresses<br />
 tccom140 contacts<br />
be sufficient? Or should we develop API session to make sure that the data pass through session logic of the receiving company before recorded there? Thanks very much for any pointer. Have a nice day (or night since we're a global community :) )!<br />

Just ripped open the gut of tccom4205m000 Copy Business Partner. Turned out that it just read a business partner data on the tables tccom100 to tccom124, do a bit of clean up (e.g. clean the contact, credit limit information, etc.), then insert the clean data as new business partner using DAL.<br />
<br />
I think I'll just replicate it using Exchange - Excel - Exchange thing then since Exchange can import using DAL too. <br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<br />
If you are using Electronic data by business partners, then may be tccom131 and tccom141 as well.<br />
