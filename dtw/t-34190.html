Is it worth it? DoeÂ’s anyone have any horror/success stories that you might share? Would be most appreciative. Currently using a paper system<br />
<br />
One issue I see is that very few of us have BaaN training so time, $, accuracy, etc. I guess is the question we must ask!<br />

Thanks Much!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">18th April 2007, 06:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I ended up never implementing the Purchase Requisition module, simply because the users find it too much of a hassle to first find out whether item code exist or not for the thing being requested. It's pretty hard to find all combination of possible item description used by purchasing people previously for the thing being requested (Ball joint, B joint, BJ, whatever). BaanERP is for from streamlined in its item search capability. And imagine after all that tinkering, user can't seem to find item code for the thing he/she wants (e.g. ball point pen), and just type free text, only to discover later on that there's actually already an item code for it (e.g. writing utensils).<br />
<br />
But don't take my word for it. Draw up your user requirements, test the Purchase Requisition module yourself based on that, and if you find it to be sufficient, then let the users try it out themselves afterward. After all those, then you decide whether to implement the module or not<br />

<br />
We have been using purchase requisitions for quite some time and we revised the procedure last year.<br />
Instead of creating several possible items, we created general items per department.  These items are of type &quot;cost&quot; and are not subject to goods reception.  <br />
Every user who wants to make a purchase requisition then selects the general item for his/her department and uses the requisition line text to define what is to be ordered.<br />
<br />
Example : suppose I am from the IT department and I want to order a computer.  For the IT department there is a general item, named &quot;GENIT&quot;.  I create a purchase requisition line for the item &quot;GENIT&quot; and enter the specifications (like brand, HDD, memory, ...) in the requisition line text.  If i want to order another computer (or maybe software), I enter another requisition line for the item &quot;GENIT&quot; and enter the specifications as order line text.<br />
<br />
The users who enter the requisition (requester) can print and submit it to their department manager (approver).  He/she the puts his/her signature on the requisition and approves (or rejects) it in the system.  Then, the requester can convert the requisition to a purchase order an send it to the supplier.  We made sure that the requester cannot change the purchase order, only print it.<br />
<br />
The problems we have is that most users find the requisition procedure not very user friendly (but what can you do ?) and that you need a backup to approve the requisition if the department manager is not in.<br />
<br />
The advantage is that a user can not order anything without an approval from the department manager, that is, if you do not permit a requester to approve the requisition.  <br />
<br />
Of course, one could always work around the system and create an order on paper and then fax or mail it to a supplier.<br />
<br />
These are my experiences with purchase requisitions.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you to decide whether to use them or not.<br />
<br />
