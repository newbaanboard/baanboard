<br />
We are on baan 5c with sp19, on the sales order side, we need to specify freight at item level, how can i do that ? One option i thought was to specify freight as a cost item , but disadvantage would be that somebody needs to manually perform the step &quot;Release to invoicing&quot; for this cost item and in worst cum scenerio , customer might receive 2 diff. invoices, &amp; also if the customer receives the part after lets say 5 days , he might receive Frieght invoice much earlier than the part .. any idea how should i handle this situation ?<br />
