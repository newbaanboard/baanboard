<br />
I am on BaaN 5 c with sp19.<br />
<br />
I have an Item &quot;A&quot; with economic stock as 100 qty, now i went ahead &amp; created a Sales Order for Qty 15, now when i look into session whinp2500m000 Inventory Commitment is not populated with that Sales Order.... which is fine for me or in other word no record craeted in whinp2500m000 for Item &quot;A&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now i did the same thing in Service, created a Service Order with 20 qty and i saw that whinp2500m000 Inventory Commitment is populated with 20 qty against that Service Order &amp; Item &quot;A&quot;.<br />
<br />
So my question is why it is NOT doing for Sales and why it is doing for Service Order ... is there a parameter where i can stop even for Service so that Hard Allocation doesnt happen for Service Order. :confused: My ultimate goal is to stop hard allocation for Service.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
1st of all, your log in nane is very good'Learner'. Now there is not any kind of parameters called Inventory commitment parameters. <br />
<br />
Now the second thing is, when you create the sales order then you can commit the finished good items to those sales order if you are in the scenario of 'made to stock'. Means you just mfg the finished goods and stores the same in the FG Warehouse. And as far as I know in the service order we used to give the spares and service. So we can commit the raw material to any service order. <br />
<br />
I hope the matter is clear, if not just revert back. <br />

<br />
In case of sales it is Item-Sales data where you do the setting for committment and in case of Service it is Work Order Parameter (order control tab, committment section) where you set the committment.<br />
<br />
This is based on LN, but I believe it should be same for Vc also.<br />

<br />
Since we are on BaaN 5, I am unable to locate that specific parameter. I guess its not there in BaaN 5, since i searched all the Service parameter sessions :-(<br />
