<br />
Here's one way to receive all 3 lines at once...<br />
<br />
- Open the corresponding Warehousing Order for the Purchase Order<br />
- Make sure no Inbound Lines are selected<br />
- On the Inbound Lines grid ... select Specific ... Receive ...<br />
- The Warehouse Receipts session starts showing all line received<br />
- Select Specific ... Confirm Receipts ...<br />
- Done!<br />

<br />
Thanks for your valuable input.<br />
But when i create a Purchase order &amp;  When I do Release Purchase order to Warehousing it will generate two warehouse orders with transaction type as Receipt.<br />
<br />
I want that both lines would be in a single order so is there any parameter which may be I am missing?<br />
In your pdf in a single warehouse order three lines r populating which are missing in my case?<br />
<br />

<br />
I checked your attachment, it seems both are different items and mostly they are going to receive in different warehouses, so I guess in that case you need to maintain two different order lines, if both the items are receiving in the same warehouse then you can find only one order line.<br />

Roy is correct. If you have 2 PO Lines, each in different warehouses, you will wind up with 2 Warehousing Orders. In my example, all 3 PO Lines were in the same Warehouse, resulting in one Warehousing Order.<br />

I think You both are correct.<br />
<br />
Actually my scenario is as mentioned -<br />
<br />
I had a Subcontracting purchase Order in which i have three line representing three sub con items (which shows three operations of the Production order which are subcontracted)<br />
<br />
So now I want to Generate only one GRN for all lines.But I am not able to generate it in single receipt.It is creating three different receipts.<br />
<br />
So here warehouse does not come into picture as Subcon item is a Ghost item which is not inventorised.<br />
<br />
Please Guide<br />
<br />

<br />
Even on Subcontract Purchase Orders that are generated from Production Orders with subcontracted operations, the corresponding Warehousing Order has a Ship-to Warehouse.<br />
<br />
I think that the system gets the warehouse for each PO Line from the Warehouse field on the Items - Purchase Data table for the subcontracted Item. If the warehouses are different, more than one Warehouse Order will be created. If all the items have the same warehouse, one Warehouse Order will be created.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the Item Purchase Data in the attached .pdf.<br />
