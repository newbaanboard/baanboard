<br />
we are on :  B40c4 / SP14<br />
<br />
we have a problem in Maintain Receipt for LOT items.<br />
<br />
we have items having many lots such as:<br />
<br />
ITEM00001         LOT1      (supplier lot)         supplier : SUP001<br />
<br />
now in purchase order, supplier is : SUP001<br />
in lines, item is ITEM00001    Lot selection : SPECIFIC     : Lot code : LOT1<br />
<br />
in Maintain Receipts,<br />
if I select the option delivered = to be delivered (Global Delivery)<br />
it does not register the Qty in receipt location by iteself. Instead we have to click on field Received Qty and it itakes to subsession tdilc4113s000, then we have to put the qty there as well.<br />
<br />
Problem is we have orders with more than 900 lines with items having specific lot. We want to do a global delivery in receipt and go and maintain the exception qty.<br />
<br />
Any idea for lot items, is it always required to go thru the subsession :tdilc4113s000 and the option delivered = to be delivered (global delivery) does not work fo this situation ????????????<br />
Or is there any purchase order or ILC parameter thru which I can achieve the above purpose.<br />
<br />
Highly appreciate your inputs<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
I don't think you can receive all the lines in Maintain receipts session without entering the specific lot code. The functionality designed in such way that you have to maintain the Lot code. The reason was Item was set as By Lot in the Item Master Level.<br />

Somewhere in this forum Mark has posted AFS code for purchased receipt  which u can use with some modification in ur case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually I am using AFS only to maintain receipts. with our good baan board &amp; baan fans , I could fix all the problems (boi.call, sub-session activation etc..) of this Maintain Receipt AFS.<br />
<br />
But my AFS maintains individual lines as it would have been with the manual receipt entry. We have receipts with 500-900 lines. I tested for a receipt with 200 lines, it takes 15-20 minutes.<br />
<br />
So to speed it up I was exploring the Zoom option in Maintain Receipts (Global update of Receipts  Delivered = to be delivered). This works fine for non-lot items, but for lot items it does not work.<br />
<br />
When my Lot selection is &quot;specific&quot; in purchase order line and items O/B priority is by location (not FIFO), why it still goes to subsession to register the receipt Qty....?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">12th June 2004, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Because lot control at the item level is by lot  (as suggested by ramkrish), <br />
the system will always go to the subsession. If it  had been not <br />
applicable , outbound priority were by location (as in ur case) and <br />
inventory/purchase/storage unit were same , Baan allows to eliminate the <br />
ilc receipt session depending on a parameter in ilc . <br />
<br />
I understand ur requirement and it appears logical because lot selection is<br />
specific. I think u may refer the same to SSA support .</div></div><hr />
