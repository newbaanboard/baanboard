  The parameter setting you changed would only make Baan stop an issue when there is a chance of the stock going into negative figures. What you are trying to do is to block a negative entry being used for the Tran. Type &quot;Production Issue&quot;. <br />
For this you might have to modify the script running behind this form. Another way, which i am not sure will work, is to customize the form tdilc1120m000 and use the [Input/Ref. Expression] option of the field &quot;Planned Qty&quot; to block quantity below zero. This however will have to be done only when the Trans. Type is &quot;Production Issue&quot;, otherwise it will stop you from entering negative figures when you do other transaction for e.g Inventory Adjustment..<br />
<br />
I hope i am clear...<br />

 Yes i know it adds onto the stock. I was just stating that the parameter setting you changed will not solve your problem, as you have found out, and what it was really intended for.<br />
<br />
As for solutions to your query, i have given two options. Script modification and Form modification(not too sure if it will work). This is what i could think of. Just try the form customization and if you have license for development then you could try customizing scripts behind that form..<br />

In BaaN 50c, we can set user authorization where we can define table field data authorization. Try if that would help you.</div></div><hr />
