<br />
Any order in B5 with possible implications on the warehouse side (SO, PO, MO, etc.) will always have a corresponding Warehouse Order (WO). For a normal SO, when goods to be delivered are staged for loading, outbound advice must be made and released for the WO related to this SO. This will create Shipment IDs. When goods are then loaded, the shipments should be confirmed. This shipment confirmation time is what BaanERP considers as SO delivery date, and it will remember this by making a copy of the delivery data inside SO line table as a new SO line (this last part may be confusing, but you'll get used to it).<br />
<br />
So, what you saw in tdsls401 was indeed a copy of the actual delivery date found in WO and shipment tables. Welcome to B5 jungle :) !<br />
