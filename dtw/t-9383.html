<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sammeer</div><div class="date">26th March 2003, 13:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi i am working on Baan IV<br />
<br />
Ist query:<br />
<br />
I want to track fuel Purchase, consumption, inventory movement/transactions &amp; fuel issue to vehicle / driver wise/ period wise from own service station through Baan <br />
<br />
As I can only record fuel issue to vehicle in Baan transportation module through session Maintain Fuel intake (trtfc2100m000) &amp;<br />
<br />
Moreover no financial entry is generated through session Maintain Deliveries to Own Service Station (trtfc1120m000) against the supplier &amp; service station is no where linked to Warehouse in session (tcmcs0103m000). Therefore I cant make fuel purchase through transportation Module<br />
<br />
Therefore I will be using distribution for fuel purchase &amp; inventory movement/ but my original purpose to track &amp; record fuel consumption, stock transaction vehicle wise/ period wise/ driver wise/ service station is not possible , I have to use transportation for this.<br />
<br />
I know that there is no direct link between Distribution (for fuel Purchase, inventory) &amp; Transportation Fuel Control (Issue to vehicles).<br />
So if I want to record Inventory Transaction, supplier payment, and delivery status I have to use distribution &amp; for fuel consumption per vehicle per period driver wise service station wise I have to use transportation.<br />
<br />
So what should I do to solve the issue so that this problem can be solved?<br />
<br />
IInd Query:<br />
Confusion enhances on viewing help for session Maintain Item &amp; Inventories by service station (trtfc1110m000) which says:<br />
<br />
The inventory of the item can be recorded, which only applies to owned service stations with warehouse order control. If the service station is not owned, the field inventory is skipped<br />
<br />
<br />
Now after reading this help it seem there is linkage between Transport fuel control &amp; Warehouse Control (transportation). <br />
<br />
But on exploring Warehouse Order Control I inferred its primary input is third party item i.e. it cant be used for items (In this case Fuel) owned by my company. I can inbound, outbound, transship or store items for my customers only.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will be obliged if someone can clarify teh situation<br />
<br />
