If no records exists then there are no materials inside this item for you to issue.<br />

    This means that there is no estimation done on this production order. If there has been any issues done (physically i.e), you can record it by manually adding the production order number and the materials issued in the session Enter Material Issue for Production Orders {ticst0101m000}. Since the production order is already past the released/active stage, you may not put any estimation. You will have to directly enter in the above mentioned session. <br />

<br />
The production order is complete stage and I manually try to add the production order number and the materials issued in the session Enter Material Issue for Production Orders {ticst0101m000}. But this session is not excepting new order number manually and the order which is in complate stage and are not come for selection. <br />
<br />
Please suggest me what to be done for solving this problem.<br />
<br />

   First of all, this order would not come automatically in the Enter Material Issue session as there is no estimation. The idea is to book the actuals. For that you would have to insert the production order number (existing production order number) by choosing the &quot;Group Insert&quot; button and then the materials by using the &quot;Insert&quot; button. <br />
<br />
If the above is not working then do check the setting of the item in this production order.<br />

<br />
ItÂ’s not working? we have closed these order without running this session enter material issue. Can you tell me what will be the effect to account ?<br />

Try running the session Print Actual Costs by Production Order {ticst0401m000}. <br />
