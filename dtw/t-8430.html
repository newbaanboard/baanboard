We require a system to search the BOM attached to a sold item, and construct an MSDS notice for the sold item..This notice needs to be sent to a customer on the first delivery of that product. From the second delivery onwards a summary label is only required to be printed.<br />
<br />
If you have handled this task within Baan or have interfaced a third party MSDS system into Baan I would be very interested in understanding how you approached the task.<br />

Are you using DEM?  I worked with a company which attached the MSDS using DEM and Word.  The shipping people were instructed through shipping notes which MSDS to associate with each shipping line.  They were only making approximately 10 -15 shipping lines per day, volume was not an issue.<br />
