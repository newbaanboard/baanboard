<br />
According to the accounting standard in Indonesia, we need to have a single MAUC in one company instead of multi MAUC( In Baan 5.0c, The MAUC is calculated by warehouse, so that an item may has some different MAUC depends on number of warehouses).<br />
<br />
We are exploring the possibility of using Locations in Baan Warehousing, then we conducted simulation of all logistic transactions. The problem is, there is no field 'location' in session tisfc0520m000 (Reports order completed)<br />
<br />
Does anyone know about Locations in Baan Warehousing? <br />
In order to meet our Business Process, can we set the Locations in Baan as warehouses/storages in our company? (we need to do Warehouse Transfer, Production Issue and Production Receipt, Purchase Receipt, Sales Issue, and Adjustment Order on the warehouses)<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />

Deciding which location to store goods to or to withdraw goods from is within the realm of responsibility of warehousing personnel. That's why in BaanERP, this is handled in Warehousing module:<br />
 Inbound advice handles goods inbound movement, including which location to store the incoming goods<br />
 Outbound advice handles goods outbound movement, including which location to draw goods from<br />
This is why production supervisors don't have to enter which location to withdraw material from and which location to store finished goods to<br />

Is there a place where a default location is setup when production is finished?  Actually, they are telling me any sort of inventory transaction is going to this same location.  I know nothing about location control in Baan - need some insight on this module.<br />

<br />
in case material is booked to one location it gets occupied (flag in whwmd3500m000) - there exists a inventory handling parameter in whinh0100s000 -&gt; use unoccupied locations only ; means inbound logic looks for free locations only.<br />
<br />
Additionally you should check capacity feature of locations, this optimizes the usage of stockyards.<br />

I will need to see if there are equivalent session in BaanIVc3<br />

<br />
You can do all kinds of warehousing actions (issues, receipts, transfers, adjustments, cycle counts, ...) when you define locations.  You can even define location capacity (infinite or finite), use picking lists, block locations etc.<br />
Have you taken a look at the BaaN documentation yet (available on the Infor support site) ?<br />
I suggest documentation numbers UP073A, UP074A, UP075A and UP077A.  The latter mentions the definition of locations in the master data.<br />
<br />
Hope this leads you to a solution.<br />
<br />

The receipt location to which all completed articles from SFC are going to is stored in tcmcs0103m000. The inbound advices tells you in which location the goods need to be stored. Very often, the inbound advice comes with a non-fitting location: when no other settings have been prepared, it will come up with the, alphabetically, first location in the destination warehouse.<br />
<br />
2 advices:<br />
- take a look at tdilc0130m000 Location per Article to register fixed locations per article. (priorities are also granted)<br />
- you could also abuse storage conditions to define zones or isles in your warehouse.<br />
<br />
Good luck (en merry X-mas)</div></div><hr />
