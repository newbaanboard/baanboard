<br />
Our data architect here is asking what is the tdsls051.ckor field used for. I noticed the field type is byte, not enumerated. I have been looking through the system and have not found the answer as of yet. Does anyone out there know what this is used for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kimmda1</div><div class="date">25th June 2002, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Record Type:<br />
1.)  When a line item is entered on an order it is stored in tdsls051 as record type 1.  If any updates are made to the line item it creates a new record with the same record type of 1.<br />
2.)  When a line item is deleted it is assigned record type 2<br />
3.)  When a line item is invoiced it's assigned record type 3<br />

I might add that when you make a change to a sales order line, it creates two tdsls051 records: a reversing entry and an entry to represent the new tdsls041 data.<br />
<br />
This data is then used in several places.  One place that uses this extensively is commissions.  It reads the tdsls051 table  looking for records with certain ckor values (depending on your commission parameters) when calculating commission and rebate amounts and percentages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">5th July 2002, 10:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't rely on field tdsls051.ckor = 3 for getting invoiced amounts for an order, if you are using PCS. It might be, that during project calculation, old cost prices are adjusted. In that case, a new line will be generated in tdsls051 for the same delivery line and invoice. The old (now invalidated) record in tdsls051 gets tdsls051.pcsr = tcyesno.yes. So, to avoid getting invoiced amounts doubled, always use <br />
... where (tdsls051.ckor = 3) and (tdsls051.pcsr = tcyesno.no) <br />
in your queries!<br />
