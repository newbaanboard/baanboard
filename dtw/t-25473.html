If someone can tell me the typical order steps for making a Proforma Invoice I would be glad. I know about tdsls4435m000 Print Proforma Invoice and tfcmg6200m000 - Link advance receipts, but what else is needed? I am running Baan IVc4 and want to invoice customer and receive payment before sending any standard goods.<br />
If there is a hint to some documentation it would also be good.<br />
<br />
Best Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Steps:<br />
1. create order with ordertype that includes step 'Proforma Invoice'<br />
2. fill in Advance Payment Schedule<br />
3. Print Proforma Invoice<br />
4. Link Advance Receipt to Proforma Invoice<br />
For some reason (unclear to me) the standard functionality is that the step 'Link Advance Receipt' should immediately follow 'Print Proforma'. This is okay is you do not want to do anything before you have received the payment, but in some cases you may want to continue with the order process (like generate outbound etc.).<br />
We had customers placing an order with advanced payment because we had stock on hand, but by the time the money had come in the stock was allocated and shipped to other customers....<br />
