<br />
Our company would like to charge a restocking fee for returning product after a 90 day period.  This fee would be a percentage of value of the product or a flat rate.  That has not been decided yet.<br />
<br />
The ultimate solution would allow us to use the Sales Order entry, when entering a credit to the customer, do not credit back the whole amount to the customer.  Sort of a discount to the credit amount.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have something like this Baan?  Can Baan Standard functionality handle this or is this a customization?<br />
<br />
We are Baan IVc4.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />

What you can possibly do is create a routine that can be called automatically in session tdsls4105s000 that blockes the entry of the selling price and instead computes the price less the charge based on the quantity returned, the item master selling price and your formula.<br />
There are two flaws to this method - firstly the item may have been sold at a manually entered price originally in which case unless you know the sales order number you won't be able to determine the original selling price. The other flaw is that this 'charge' won't have it's own cost price component and will therefore integrate into finance together with the normal sales transactions rather than somewhere of your choice.  <br />
<br />
Let's bash this one around some-more...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">15th August 2003, 13:31</div></div><div class="posttext">There is already functionality for adding additional costs to an order.  The setup for this is under Sales Orders/Miscellaneous.  Maybe try that and see if it would work for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">15th August 2003, 13:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Good idea Maria, but in this case the order would be a return order - can the additional costs in this case a) be proportional to the order amount b) take the form of a discount so that the credit note would be for a lesser amount than what the goods cost?<br />
<br />
How are things there?<br />

I doubt that the additional cost functionality will cater for all of those specific needs, but it is a good starting point.  It may be necessary to do a bit of customisation to the rules for applying these additional costs.<br />
<br />
Here things are cool.  I'm looking forward to next week as I'm going on holiday.</div></div><hr />
