I have set up internal EDI but need to know whats requried to set up external EDI. Somebody has told me that I need to use an EDI Translator. <br />
<br />
Can anybody give me some idea on how external EDI is set-up. Is the a big difference from Internal EDI? <br />
<br />
Which EDI translator should I use?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

At the network directory level you will find directories appl_from, appl_to instead of appl_comm. <br />
There are different EDI translators available in market. Gentran,Harbinger,netscape,etc. to name the few.<br />
Iam using Gentran transaltor. Thay have prebuilt maps and scripts for standard Baan EDI messages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am based in the UK and we receive customer messages (sales schedules, shipping schedules) as well as sending them (ASN's).<br />
<br />
We use ODEX as our OFTP communication software with XLATE as our translator. These pieces of software are provided by the following company;<br />
<br />
http://www.dip.co.uk <br />
<br />
The complexity of the translation depends on the exact format of the inbound and outbound message. Initially we had external help for doing translations but now tend to write them ourselves.<br />
<br />
Please PM me if you want to discuss further.<br />

We use a EDI translator called - softshare and this is almost one fourth of cost of Gentran and is very feature rich. We do EDI, XML, HTTP posting, FTP etc with this software. I found this to be very feature rich and less expensive. This software is also cabapbel of doing webservices. SO when you look fo EDI translator, look for these other thing also.<br />
We do many EDI ransactions:<br />
850m,855, 856, 810, 846,210,214,240,215<br />

<br />
We also have an internal and external EDI. Currently, we are using message 810 Invoice (IN)However, we are experiencing problems when processing the invocie. If we have a dispatch advise coming from multiple PO and an invoice based from that disapatch advise, the problem comes in the finance submodule ACP. In the session maintain purchase invoices (tfgld1110s000) under maintain transactions (tfgls1101m000) it only calculates the data coming from one PO. Since the dispatch advise is made up of several PO, how can this type of transaction be resolved?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">23rd February 2005, 01:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Jeyps,<br />
It seems Baan 810 (In) is designed to get each invoice seprately. Take a look at the mapping information and you can see that Purchase Orer number is being asked only at Header level, which made me think that it is designed for One purchase Order. Is there a way where your supplier can generate Invoice for each Purchase Order separately?<br />

<br />
You are right, the PO number is included in the header so it only process one PO. Our suppliers can generate dispatch advise coming from several PO and their invoices are based on that created dispatch advise because we have our singapore office that manages these transactions and gives us the data in a different format which I then translate to what BaaN can understand. <br />
<br />
In ordinary procedure for ACP, using the packing slip number, all POs can be grouped together for matching. I am thinking that EDI can also handle this type of transaction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">28th February 2005, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
You can always create the file in Baan format from your External EDI format.<br />
The only issue I can see from Accounting perspective is that Supplier is sending one Invoice, while you would be breaking that by order. And I am nost sure if this would cause any audit question. Technically, you can break the purchase invocie by order in External EDI translator and create 810 in Baan format.<br />

<br />
Can you please let me know the Protocol used for communication between Baan to Gentran and Vice versa?<br />
<br />
Also what is the document type used by Baan. For inbound 850 what do you transform the 850 to create a order in Baan ?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Gentran willl create a file that Baan can read it. Genetran has to create file in the format that Baan can read. So for 850 in you will have to look what is 850 format? I can help you in this, as this is something that cannot be explained in email.You can send email at avpatil@hotmail.com<br />
