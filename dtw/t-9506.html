<br />
Please fill up your Baan, DB, and OS version in your user profile<br />
<br />
I'll be talking in terms of 5.0c. Please try Print Multi Level BOM (Summarized) tibom1414m000. You can perform little customisation to make the print out sorted by warehouse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">4th April 2003, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Why don't you do a multi-level print, and an item master print - pull the two into a spreadsheet and do a vlookup across the two for the additional information.<br />
That's surely the simplest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Richard</div><div class="date">4th April 2003, 16:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We had our IT department add reports to the system that used the existing multi-level  and multi-level summarized reports and added other important information from different tables.  We had them add on hand, on order, planner, buyer, supplier, lead-time, and cost roll date.  With these fields we are able to make critical order decsision.  If we want to make a plan increase we use this file to create an excel spreadsheet with the total material needed to make a change.  They are required to reply back withing 24-48 hours approving the change.  This is a great tool.  FYI if you are on 5c you will find that you can't recieve product into inventory if every item on its bill doesn't have a cost roll date, hence we added this to the multilevel explosion so that we can find the item quickly that hasn't been rolled and get it fixed.  Some of the tools that we use in conjunction with modifying and improving existing reports are Softwares like Monarch, which is a great tool for manipulating any report that you send out as a flat (ascif) file, Crystal to write against live or data warehouse data and of course Access and Excel.  Your only limit should be the limit of what you can think to ask your IT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindar</div><div class="date">5th April 2003, 07:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies, but the summarized doesn't seem to pull in all the lower level purchase items.. it appears to be just going one level down... I may have some parameter set incorrectly, for it to reach to the 3rd, 4th and lower levels...(We're still on 3.1 because the other packages have so much customization...and we just now are starting to load BOM...)  We are really trying to move away from exel..our boss is an excell lover...but it is an extra step we are trying to avoid..Additional help will be appreciated....lindar</div></div><hr />
