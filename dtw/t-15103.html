<br />
BaaN Vc<br />
----------<br />
<br />
I am having a doubt related to MAUC valuation method.<br />
<br />
I have an item X for which the cost price is zero.<br />
<br />
The valuation method for this item I have made as MAUC in Item data by Warehouse. I purchase 20 pieces of this item at 20 USD. After purchasing I see in the session whina1512m000 &quot;Inventory Receipt transactions&quot;, that the MAUC is 20.<br />
I issue this item through a service order. I then realize that instead of issuing 5 pcs, I have issued the total 20 pcs by mistake and so i take back 15 items into the same warehouse by &quot;To warehouse&quot; transaction in Service.<br />
When I look at the MAUC now it has become zero. <br />
Why does this happen? Should it not have taken 20 as the MAUC again. I think it has taken the cost price which is zero for calculating the MAUC.<br />
<br />
Is this a standard functionality? The system behaves in the same way when I make a sales order return for the item.<br />
 <br />
If this is the standard functionality, why is it so?<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks a heap in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspect that your MAUC problem is that returns to stock via service and sales are not costed transactions.<br />
<br />
Whereas your purchase order receipt has a known cost associated with it that can be used to (re)calculate the MAUC, returns do not.  So, having issued all your stock at a MAUC of 20, the MAUC reverts to 0 because a MAUC can only exist where there is a positive stock balance.  I think that returns and stock adjustments inflate stock without changing the MAUC, because otherwise (when stock and MAUC are positive) such transactions would dilute the MAUC, and artificially depressing costs of transactions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. I too  agree with your line of thinking.<br />
<br />
I was just going through the search and found that 'Service girl' and 'Paul' also have had the same issue.<br />
<br />
Service girl:<br />
<br />
We are setting up an international subsidiary (in a separate company) with MAUC as the inventory valuation method. We were testing some scenarios and noticed that inbound activity that was not on a purchase order (such as cycle counting and return sales orders) pulled the standard cost and not the last purchase price as expected. <br />
Can any of you tell me your experiences with using MAUC as a valuation method and what I should expect? <br />
many thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul:<br />
<br />
Dear Service girl,<br />
<br />
Yes, that was what we observed in our 5.0c installation too<br />

What I am worried about Jeff is a reply by Jftello:<br />
<br />
Hi:<br />
<br />
You forgot to tell that MAUC is used in Aerospace and defense industry as well.<br />
<br />
In the other hand, I think that you have a bug in your system. The inbound activity for return orders or cycle counting inventory is pulled with the last MAUC calculated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have worked with the Aerospace and Defence software - it is a highly industry specific extension to Baan IV.  MAUC was first used there and then included as standard in 5.0.  There is no automatic assumption that it should work the same way.  <br />
<br />
Even so, taking the comment at face value, if the returns should be made at the last MAUC calculated, that is what you have experienced because when your stock goes to zero, the calculation would produce a zero value for MAUC.  I guess the message is:  don't do retuns when stock is zero!<br />
<br />

(Hi Riaz. I know you sent me private message on this issue, but let me just reply here for the benefit of everybody)<br />
<br />
Indeed, for all returns in BaanERP (at least in the heavily patched 5.0c system that we implemented) the return stock will be valued at standard price as Service girl observed before. Now it's not easy valuing return stock from accounting point of view. It's probably fine if, like in Riaz's particular case, the return is made right after the issue. But what if the return is made long after the issue, and in meantime there were already so many other issues? What value should you take in? That being told, probably the most appropriate way to value return stock if average costing is used is the latest MAUC as Jftello said.<br />
<br />
Just a little note; MAUC is only updated upon receipt of goods, such as purchase receipt, service return, etc. So what happened in your case, Riaz, was:<br />
 The purchase receipt updated the MAUC to USD 20/pcs<br />
 Issue was made at the MAUC then, at USD 20/pcs. No update was made on MAUC this time<br />
 Service return was valued at standard price USD 0/pcs. Hence, MAUC updated to USD 0/pcs<br />
<br />

<br />
The calculation method is as follows:<br />
MAUC = (old on hand * old MAUC) + (receipt quantity * receipt price) / (old on <br />
hand + inbound quantity)<br />
