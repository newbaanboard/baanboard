<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boudreau</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know how to add a flat surcharge % to a sales order?  This will be based on the total sales order before taxes, and the tax amounts must be based on the sales order total + surcharge.  We need to be able show somewhere on the acknowledgement and invoice this surcharge amount.  On the finance side we need the surcharge to go to a specific account.  Also the surcharge rate will change monthly.<br />
<br />
We have tested the following:<br />
1. Create a new cost item Surcharge and manually calculate the total and add it the sales order.  This will be very time consuming for prone to calculation errors etc.<br />
<br />
2. Create a new tax for surcharges. The amounts will automatically be calculated, but there are issues with multi-level tax structure.  It seems to works ok for surcharge only, and 1 level tax (cumulative).  With 3 levels, level 2 &amp; 3 being parallel, level one amount is not included in the sales total before 2&amp;3 are calculated.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any other ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Yes, the surcharge mapping you seek can be done in Cost Price Master data, however, you may want to look at the specific material, labour, and surcharge relation.  Some companies book surcharges to represent margin.<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />
