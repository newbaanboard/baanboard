Does anybody know how to troubleshoot printed layout of tickets? We have  a problem in the lay-out of our printed tickets wherein page nos. are incorrect but if displayed they seem to be right. Ex. Page 22 of 10 :confused:<br />
<br />
Just trying my luck here. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

The compiled version is very hard to read because your code is mixed in with the standard code, but you can find your way through.  Trace the variable lattr.pageno - that is what the system thinks is the current page.  See when it's incrementing and if you can get any clues from that.</div></div><hr />

the solution for page x of y code), then you may focus on that part of codein your report.This , assuming that there is documentation to that effect.<br />
<br />
your debug / modification will be easier if that is the case.<br />
<br />
If not, you may search by &quot;page x of y&quot; on this board and go from there.</div></div><hr />
