<br />
Rebuild Planned Incentory Transactions (tdinv0250m000)<br />
Rebuild Inventory Data (ILC) (tdilc0250m000)<br />
Rebuild Customer Order Balance (tccom2210m000)<br />
Rebuild Supplier Order Balance (tccom2220m000)<br />

All of these sessions was made to fix some errors in Baan.<br />
By example:<br />
tdinv0250m000 are designed to rebuild planned movements of stock in Baan. You must execute this session when you or you invenory planner/buyer detects some differences between the future stock and the current due to purchases, sales etc.<br />
tdilc0250m000 rebuilds the stock data in your inventory. It takes the movements from inbounds and outbounds and calculates the real stock in your inventory. You must run this session when the inventory area detects some &quot;reserved&quot; items and there nothing to be reserved<br />
tccom2210m000 rebuilds the value that you see in tccom1101m000<br />
form 6. You must run this session when there some wrong value in this field.<br />
tccom2220m000 rebuilds the value that you see in tccom2101m00 form 5. You must run this session when some wrong value is there.<br />
<br />
Usually the Baan works good and this sessions are run only when the techÂ´s of baan support tells you.<br />
In a personnal manner in my company often runs the first two of them in order to avoid the errors. Until now only few errors has been reported by this sesions.<br />
Hope this help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gary P</div><div class="date">29th December 2003, 20:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Another session to keep in mind is tdinv0251m000 which rebuilds allocations. We run all three (tdinv250, 251 and 252) in a batch job on the weekend as a precautionary measure to insure data accuracy.</div></div><hr />
