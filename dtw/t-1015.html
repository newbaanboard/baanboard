We have some manufactured items which are phantom.<br />
In the sales order lines, form2 the field Issue Status turns to Issue Components for phantom items. and there is no problem.<br />
We also send those phantom items to our distribution centers by replenishment order, but this time it doesn't work. After Maintain Rep. Orders, I run Generate Outbound Advice, and receive Shortage message.<br />
Is there anybody have experinced this problem?<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
please identify if you are having issues with BAAN IV or BAAN V and also which version within these you are using (for example b40_c4 or b50_c).<br />
<br />
The functionality between BAAN IV and BAAN V is not the same in the functional area you are addressing and by giving us the additional information members can better assist you.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

I hope Baan5 is not so problematic.<br />
Thanks for the warning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
where exactly is your problem?<br />
Baan allows you to have inventory for phantom items. Thats why a replenishment order for a phantom item does not issue the components.<br />
To make things going right you have to replenish the components in your warehouses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">volkan</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">we have some kit items (sets of mouldsl) which we transfer to the production accourding to the product the produce this week and take it back and put back to the shelf (recycle, repair or scrap). i like to define those mould sets as kit items because they have lots of components which can be valid more than one kit. so we don't follow the inventory of the kit, we follow the inventory of each component. i like to make a transaction to the head item which is fantom or non virtual /imaginary, so i can transfer all the kit with one click.<br />
but in the maintain outbound step<br />
before maintain replenishment order deliveries, it gives  shortage  of the fantom.<br />
i want it to issues the components as it is in the sales order.<br />
that's the story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">22nd February 2002, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know, this functionality isn't supported by rpl-orders. When you look at the tables you will not find any table like rpl-order-bom according to the SLS tables.<br />
<br />
The only thing you can do is to have inventory for those phantom items what, of course, may cause serious handling problem when you deal with a lot of those phantom items and components.<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />
