<br />
another EDI question :)<br />
<br />
Our setup.<br />
2 BaaN companies exchanging data with EDI.<br />
One creating PO other receiving and getting new SO.<br />
so far so good.<br />
<br />
now, when the receiving comp. changes the SO line, e.g. splits one line into 2 lines, then an ORDRSP is created with both lines.<br />
<br />
But in the original system, PO line 10 is updated but line 20 is not created. (EDI reports states new line 20, but no action)<br />
<br />
i read the BaaN EDI documentation and it seems this is not supported (also checked the source of script, no logic there in &quot;selectemty&quot; of PO&quot; !)<br />
<br />
anybody created a workaround for this ?<br />
<br />
i thought about checking the appl_to data before every import and generate the missing lines - but i hope to find a better way ....<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated,<br />

<br />
Well logically speaking, this may not be the correct way of handling this kind of a change.<br />
<br />
EDI is triggered by the buyer and any changes that need to be made should be made by the buyer (not the supplier --- in normal conditions).<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to communicate this change to the buyer (via email or telephone), so that he makes changes to the PO. This change can be automatically transferred to the supplier's SO using standard Order change message. Some advantages of this would be-<br />
<br />
1. The operation would work in a normal way without the need to make any customizations.<br />
<br />
2. Buyer can assign reason codes for the changes.<br />
<br />
3. There will be single window that will handle the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;The buyer should exercise control on the changes NOT the supplier --- this will otherwise overrule the EDI business logic!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope it helps. ;)<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />
