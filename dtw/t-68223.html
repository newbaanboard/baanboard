<br />
We are working in LN 10.3 and trying to implement the Handling Units Concept . We are doing the setup as per the Standard LN Handling Unit document code <br />
U8938H US . <br />
<br />
We had done the setup and made a Fixed Pacakage Defintion with the Base Unit as NO   and after that Box  , and after that Pallet  means 1 Box =10 NO &amp;  1 Pallet = 2 Box and defined the conversion factors as per this reqirement . <br />
<br />
After defining the Package definition it has been attached in the Item warehousing data . <br />
<br />
Then we had made the Purchase Order . At the time of Purchase receipts we run the session &quot; Generate Handling Units &quot; at the Receipt Line level   and then confirm the purchase receipts. <br />
<br />
After cinfirming the purchase receipts the inventory gets updated in the system with the Base unit ie NO.  <br />
<br />
The issue is that it is neither showing the correct handling unit tree ie with box and pallets ,  nor it is showing the inventory in Box and pallets. <br />
<br />
KIndly  provide your expert advise,  what we are missing , so that we are able to see the inventory also in Box as well as in Pallets . <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance . <br />
