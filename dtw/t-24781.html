<br />
According to the selection (warehouse or not), the annual issue is calculated from tdinv750 or tdinv760.<br />
If you run the session today from 2004/09 to 2005/08.<br />
<br />

The report is nonsense. Inventory turns is a common measurement for how well inventory is managed. It is calculated by dividing the annual inventory usage by the AVERAGE on-hand inventory. That's a good indicator for how well inventory is managed. <br />
<br />
This report in Baan calculates the turnover rate by dividing the annual usage by the CURRENT on-hand inventory. That doesn't make any sense. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">8th August 2005, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">We created a customized report that calculated the turns using a calculation supplied by our Finance department.  We also created an additional custom table to store slow-moving parameters by item group, so that we could hold analysis of what was slow-moving by different raw material item groups.  We have diverse manufactirng divisions and one set of parameters did not fit our company as a whole.</div></div><hr />
