<br />
When matching invoice with purchase orders, we get old &quot;completely matched&quot; invoice onto the list also, i have looked in table tdpur045 and found field tdpur045.stsd, which is different for those records in question.<br />
<br />
I tried to change one from &quot;matched&quot; to &quot;All approved&quot;, and it dissapeared as it should, but this is my question:<br />
<br />
Is it alright to change the status from &quot;matched&quot; to &quot;all approved&quot; ????<br />
<br />
When does field tdpur045.stsd change from &quot;Matched&quot; to &quot;ALL approved&quot;????<br />
<br />
It doesn't change anything anywhere or does it??????</div></div><hr />

You need to check the the purchase invoices for the records you have changed have been completely approved in finance.</div></div><hr />
