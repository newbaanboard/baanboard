<br />
I found some material about the Transportation module on Baan4c4 <br />
But it looks like the third party solution..not the basic module...<br />
<br />
I don't have any knowledge of it.<br />
<br />
please let me know...<br />
<br />

<br />
Our customer need some inventory control system for low material on shipyard silo.<br />
And so I have to find solutions, But I just have the knowledge of Baan ERP not the BaanIV.<br />
<br />
In many cases, BaanERP( 5.0b,5.0c) and CAPs could be the answer. but It's process industry, so I have to propose BaanIVc4 for my customer. <br />
And I found the TR Module in BaanIVc4. It looks like fit on it.<br />
<br />
So I just wondering ....TR module in BaanIVc4 is the standard of it?<br />
<br />

<br />
Why do you want to use transportation? Can't you use replenishment or DRP? Do they use a fleet?<br />
Sometimes you don't need process for a proces industry, did you check the possibilities in distribution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">windham</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 11:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Ronny<br />
<br />
Thanks for your fast reply<br />
<br />
They wanna see the status of Inventory status for the scheduling, as I said.<br />
<br />
As you know, in import process for law material, it's be located many other places, Silo, customs warehouse, and so on.....<br />
<br />
So I thinked that TR Module can cover the their requriement.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
Transportation is a standard module in Baan IV but the integration to the other modules is sometimes very poor. For example Transportation does not refer to the item data (tiitm001). A second table as to be maintained (trtcd120).<br />
<br />
We are running Transportation since almost five years now. It can be a useful tool, but you will need some time until it's working properly. <br />

<br />
Thank you for the good informations.<br />
<br />
And so, the answer of it... BaanIV + Caps Transpro, just I think.<br />
<br />
But I have never seen it.:D<br />
<br />
It's so difficult to select the solution for my customer.<br />
<br />
Anyway thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronny Terhaerdt</div><div class="date">16th May 2002, 12:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Still I think you should ask yourself what you/the customer wants. What processes does the company want to cover? As I stated before, distibution is often sufficient for a process-like environment. If you want to shift stock from one to another you might consider DRP in distribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sammeer</div><div class="date">11th April 2003, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">well just going throgh all hits  trying to bang the  target<br />
well i declare :<br />
<br />
I successfuly implemented Baan IV c4 Transportation<br />
in 2 companies  ( Both multisite) i.e its currently functional at 6 Plants <br />
<br />
One was major process Company.<br />
<br />
I found no difficulty even in mapping export &amp; import with complete Multiple supplier &amp; Currency maaping.<br />
<br />
just an example :<br />
<br />
you cant link multiple suppliers to one purchase order ( in case material supplier &amp; Transporter are diffrent as one PO one Supplier) :confused: <br />
But via Transportation it can be done at click:D <br />
there are lot such things easing the life of sales, Purchase, Finance, marketing department :cool:<br />
<br />
its wonderfull tool linkage to Distribution is good enough<br />
i think Baan should start marketing  it well<br />
so that no such hard feeling come from Baan community<br />
<br />
Hope you all will give 2nd thought to your mind set<br />
<br />

<br />
In the implementation was there a direct link from Distribution and Transportation? (I mean whether transport orders were generated from Distribution orders?) IF YES, how's the performance? With my experience Transportation module as standalone is very good and can meet 90% of the requirements, but when it is integrated with Distribution module, the performance goes for a toss.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sammeer</div><div class="date">11th April 2003, 15:00</div></div><div class="posttext">thats what i said marketing of this module lacks<br />
its working great<br />
&amp; making life easy for all of us who try to get workarounds in distribution &amp; didnt  shown courage to jump to Transportation integration.<br />
as i already giving example in my post of handling multiple supplier &amp; currency i am sure you are aware how we use to face user while giving workarounds &amp; making number of purchase orders for cost items.<br />
RPL, SLS, PUR<br />
all linkage possible even EDI option can be expored<br />
<br />

<br />
the link can be set up automatically, interactive or manual. Of course the automatic link will have the highest performance requirements.<br />
In our case (8000 salesorderlines daily) the manual link is proven the be the best way (the copy process runs in job every night up to 4 hours)<br />

In case you have a performance problem in copying sales orders to transportation, please install solution 132320 (made on 6th feb 2003) to significantly increase performance. This solution is mainly for level 2 databases, a full table scan was done as a result of a missing order by clause. Result of installing the solution was that it took less then 10% of the time to generate transportation planning.<br />
<br />
In 2002 also a fix was made to improve performance in generating visits. Please check local support or knowledge base to find solution number.<br />
<br />
Update your system to the latest weekly dumps and you will surely be suprised about the improvement of the copying process.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">14th April 2003, 13:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank's for the hint!<br />
We're currently thinking about upgrading our system. Would be great if performance is much better than it is today :cool: <br />
