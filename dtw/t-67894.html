<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">3rd July 2015, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all. I am looking for any insight ( best practices ) on how to deal with purchased items where we have one base Item name but the number and prices of suppliers can vary by country or by grade ( Premium, OEM, etc. )<br />
<br />
One suggestion was multiple item names with one per supplier. A brief mention of having 'price books by supplier' I found reference to but no details as to what that even meant or how it would work.<br />
<br />
I guess Sales people are hoping to have the option to sell product based on regional location, grade levels ( good, better, best, etc ) <br />
<br />
As anyone else dealt with this scenario before and offer suggestions ??</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you can try different lot codes for the grades and may try ICS System or MPN (Manufacture part number ) for different item names from different supplier. <br />
<br />
Another option is unit effectivity. but I think lot will be the simplest</div></div><hr />

1. Set the Matrix definition for Purchase Price with Matrix Segments as 'Buy From BP' - Suppliers.<br />
2. Set the Price books for Purchasing in Price books sesseion(tdpcg0531m000), each price book will act as a supplier price book and will contain list of item as per their defined/OEM or Individual Pricing.<br />
3. Create Price Matrices for the combination of Matrix Type as 'Purchase Price' and Matrix Definition created in step 1.<br />
4. For each combination define Purchase Attributes in session tdpcg0130s000.<br />
<br />
This will give you seperate pricing for same item with diffrent suppliers, you can customize the attributes as per your requirement.</div></div><hr />
