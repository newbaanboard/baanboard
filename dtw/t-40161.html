<br />
Our company has a centralized warehouse (with location control implemented) that is in the process of a major re-org. As part of the re-org, we will be moving several hundred parts from their current location to a new location within the same warehouse. <br />
<br />
If we do the Baan moves manually, it will probably take longer than the physical move themselves. To reduce this manual effort, the thought was to write a new session that takes in a Flat File input (part#, old location and new location) and does a mass move from the original location to the new location. <br />
<br />
Before diving in and creating new code, I thought I'd check if anyone has done something similar and is willing to share the code. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
Metbaan.</div></div><hr />

You can easily do it in many ways<br />
<br />
1. Create an ASCII file and upload in cycle count table tdilc501.<br />
2. Create a Manual DRP order and then transfer into RPL and process it all the way.<br />
<br />
In either of the approaches, not heavu coding is required.<br />
