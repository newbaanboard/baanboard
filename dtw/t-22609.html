<br />
this is a question about IVc4.<br />
<br />
I am trying to set up replenishment orders between 2 nettable warehouses via an transit warehouse.  ILC is used with locations.<br />
<br />
My problem is creating a replenishment order type.  The 'help' tells me 'release outbound' to update the delivery, but I can't get 'maintain replenishment order deliveries' to accept any input.  If I could get beyond this point, I suspect I will have similar problems with receipts and inbound.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain which order steps are required, and also in what sequence.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Henryk</div></div><hr />

<br />
As per you, you have implemented ILC, if that is the case then you need to have generate outbound/ mainatain outbound as one of the steps and then have release outbound. Other steps such as print outbound etc are optional.<br />
<br />
Hope this resolves the problem<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
so I've tried:<br />
<br />
1  generate outbound<br />
2  maintain replen order deliveries<br />
3  release outbound<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
1  generate outbound<br />
2  release outbound<br />
3  maintain replen order deliveries<br />
<br />
In both order types I get stuck at step 2.<br />
<br />
Are there some other required steps (perhaps printing of some sort)?<br />
<br />
Could anyone post a working set of steps?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">15th December 2004, 23:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Generate outbound is a Baan standard step.  Release Outbound is not a step.  You should have the steps set:<br />
Generate outbound<br />
Maintain deliveries<br />
<br />
The reason you cannot proceed is that if you created a step Release Outbound manually, this session does not update the nest order step.  If you want this as a step it must be modified to update the next step correctly in the tables.<br />
<br />
You must run Release Outbound (even though it is not a step) prior to maintain deliveries.  This is similar to the order entry steps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are not aware of the order steps (created by some other user) then best thing to do is to go to session tdrpl0511m000(display rpl staus) and execute accordingly.<br />
