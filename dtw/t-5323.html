<br />
We are on BaaN IVc and are preparing to start. (We are starting with Distribution).<br />
<br />
We must enter to BaaN initial stock values for all the items and all the lots (we are going to use ILC and LTC). And it is more than 15000 values. <br />
<br />
The problem is - how to do it in most easy way. With the help of BOI? Or is it easier to write specific script? <br />
NB - We are using PCS and customized items.<br />
<br />
What is the most common way for entering initial values?<br />
Any ideas will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanking in advance,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />

<br />
we used cycle counting orders to initialize the inventory for all our items. The data (itemcode and inventory) where imported via Exchange into table tdinv120.<br />
I'm not familiar to PCS and customized items but for standard items the procedure works very well.<br />
<br />

but... Cycle Counting Orders do not work with customized items (there is no field 'Project' in Cycle Counting Order). :(<br />
I've found one idea on baanfans.com - to make a text file (in format of tables dump) and to import it to BaaN. Can it work?<br />
<br />
Thanks once more,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">28th May 2002, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't use &quot;create table from sequential dump&quot; for importing data. <br />
It's just a big DON'T!. You will have to do updates in tables (like (pcs) item master, and you can't do that by just importing data).<br />
<br />
Use the exchange module, or a script to do it.<br />
<br />
There aren't too many tables you will have to fill, so exchange will do fine and you can do this faster than using a BOI where you have to figure out all the possible user interactions (zoomed-to-sessions and so on).<br />
<br />
Get in touch with your consultant to help you figure out the tables (should be done in a day or so, if you don't have too much specifics)<br />

<br />
I have done the migration for the intial stock value several times now by using exchange.<br />
<br />
I have done it in 3 steps:<br />
<br />
1. create the locations with the baan standard session <br />
2. import the relation item &lt;-&gt; location <br />
3. import the cycle counting orders and follow the normal    <br />
    procedure for cycle counting in Baan.<br />
    (Attention: If you have to import more than 999 records you<br />
    have to splitt your import file. It is not possible to have more<br />
    than 999 records per cycle counting order!)<br />
<br />
If you need more information I can prepare some screen shots<br />
from the import schemes.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<br />
Thank you for your replies.<br />
We are thinking... <br />
<br />
As I see the most common way is to use Cycle counting orders. Unfortunatly we can not use them - because we use customized items.<br />
<br />
Now I see the best way is just to write our own script. Am I wright?<br />
<br />
Thanks to all once more,<br />

<br />
We also are using IVc and had to bring in existing charges for projects.  However, we went live with Distribution, Manufacturing, and Finance all at the same time.<br />
<br />
It is my understanding that customized items go directly to a project when they are received - that is, they go directly into Work In Process and do not &quot;sit&quot; in inventory. <br />
<br />
We utilized the &quot;Maintain General Projects Costs&quot; session (tipcs3140m000)  in the Manufacturing module to bring in existing project inventory values from our legacy system.  This, combined with affecting a separate specified account number when we imported our general ledger, allowed us to verify that the correct amount had been applied to each project in BaaN.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this will help, but if you'd like additional detail, please contact me.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />

Manager, Finance Systems</div></div><hr />
