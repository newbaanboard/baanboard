Can anyone clear me how to set the credit limit for customers, considering only the outstanding invoices (debtors). Currently the system checks the credit limit by adding outstanding debtors balance and outstanding sales orders.<br />
 <br />
Suppose Credit limit set for a customer is 10 Lacs (in customer master)<br />
Outstanding debtors for that customer 9 Lacs<br />
Outstanding sales orders for that customer 3 Lacs<br />
After we set the blocking on a setp in order types, while entering sales orders system checks 10 lacs against 9+3 Lacs and the staus of the order becomes &quot;Blocked&quot;. We want the blocking to be done at the deleivery level and invoicing shiould be allowed till the outstanding debtors becomes 10 Lacs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phil Thomas</div><div class="date">7th January 2003, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it's in the Credit Rating Code (tcmcs0564m000) - there is a field &quot;Include Open Sales Orders in Financial Risk Calculation&quot;.<br />
I haven't tested it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">7th January 2003, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Credit limit can be set against the customer in Maintain Customer tccom1101m000 form 5 in Baan in5. I hope that u have upgraded to Baan in5 recently. <br />
<br />
Now in the Distribution Parameters go to session Maintain Sales Order Parameter (tdsls4100m000) form 2, select the option for &quot;Block if Credit limit is exceeded&quot; to &quot;NO&quot; and &quot;Signal if Credit limit is exceeded&quot; to &quot;YES&quot;. Then select the option &quot;YES&quot; for &quot;Block if Invoice is overdue&quot;. <br />
<br />
Check this step and revert back. I think your problem will be solved.<br />
