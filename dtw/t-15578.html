<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khyou99</div><div class="date">7th June 2004, 08:44</div></div><div class="posttext">In a normal situation, all the estimated hours and materials for a closed production order under a PCS project is captured in session ticst001 and ticst002. <br />
<br />
My problem is as follow. Let me give the following example for easy illustration.<br />
<br />
Production Order 100100 has a planned quantity of 10 unit and has three operations with estimated hours as follow:<br />
<br />
Op 10	- 10Hrs<br />
Op 20	- 10Hrs<br />
Op 30	- 10Hrs<br />
<br />
Make the assumption that op 10 has a quantity of 10 unit reported completed and op 20 has 5 reported complete and 5 rejected.<br />
<br />
In the above example, the filed tisfc010.prtm will stored the following value:<br />
<br />
Op 10	- 10Hrs<br />
Op 20	- 10Hrs<br />
Op 30	- 5Hrs<br />
<br />
After the production order is closed, at which table I can retrieve the information that stored in tisfc010.prtm and also the reject quantity ? Take a note that the information stored at ticst002 is based on the original planned quantity. So, the information in table ticst002 is not what I am looking for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.</div></div><hr />
