Customer wants to cut one PO resulting in one SO in Baan.  All product on SO is shipped to cutomer's distribution center but each SO Line Item has to have the address of the ultimate stock location.  These individual packages must also be labeled with the end location.  Customer wants one invoice.<br />
<br />
So, to summarize.  One Sales Order, multiple Sales Order Lines.  Everything gets shipped to DC, but all individual packages must be labeled accoring to the ship to address on the SO Line.  One Invoice.<br />
<br />
Will this work?</div></div><hr />

<br />
U want delivery address for different sales order lines as different , Delivery address for all the lines as same.<br />
<br />
We are doing it by entering delivery address for all the lines as different as in form 3 of session tdsls4102s000. As our customer invoice session is a customized session we can print all the delivery addresses alongwith the sales order lines as &amp; when the invoice is printed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the name of the session tdsls4102s000?<br />
<br />
We use a manifest system that takes the shipping information from Baan and creates a label with the correct ship to address.  This is the ship to from the order sales order header.  This is the address that we want the entire shipment to go to.  We also want the individual line items to be labeled with the ship to address from the sales order lines session.  Is this what you do?<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you'd need to configure is your invoicing method. You can find this under BAAN Common Data\Tables\Financial tables. You'd need to make one invoicing method with Collect Shipments=Yes and Collect Ship To Address=Yes, and then later connect this invoicing method you just made with this customer that is giving you the headache :)<br />
<br />
Essentially by doing so, you enable your company to bill goods sent to this customer by multiple shipments and multiple addresses using just one invoice. Voila!<br />
