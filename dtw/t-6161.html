<br />
I have entered an inventory adjustement with a reason code that has been assigned to post to no account because there is an integration setup.<br />
<br />
But..<br />
<br />
I also entered an inventory adjustement with a reason code that IS assigned to post to a specific account.<br />
<br />
What is confussing me is, how does the system know which account to debit, if reason codes only tell the system what to credit.<br />
<br />
Please help me understand.<br />
<br />
Do Integrations again play a role?<br />
Also, is it correct for me to think of the account as a credit?<br />
<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason codes are built to enable you to drive the credit account to one other than what is set up in your integration.  <br />
<br />
Regardless of whether you use a reason code or not, the system will look to your integration setup for the debit account.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
One more question if that's ok.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there a report that will produce a list of all inventory adjustments and there reason.<br />
<br />
If so how do I get to it.<br />
<br />
Thankyou.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know, there is no &quot;vanilla BaaN&quot; report that will give you what you're looking for.  The only report I know of in the Distribution Module that references the reason codes is Print Inventory on Hold.<br />
<br />
Whenever we perform inventory adjustments that utilize a reason code, we print the corresponding integration transactions.<br />
<br />
If you are driving your integrations to different accounts for the various reason codes, you could print the Warehouse Order/Inventory Adjustment integrations for those accounts.<br />
<br />

<br />
Linda is right: there is no &quot;vanilla&quot; report (at least in Baan IV) that lists or summarizes inventory adjustments by adj reason code. <br />
<br />
The Inv Adj Reason Code is a great example of how Baan responded to user requests for functionality without providing the means to audit it. Most companies that use adj reason codes heavily develop a customized report (often via SQL or third party report program) to provide the required detail.<br />
<br />
The integration scripts pull the ledger accounts from the set up in tdinv850 then override the credit account with the one specified in the adjustment reason code, if applicable. <br />
<br />
You can also override the integration setup by specifying a ledger account on form 2 of the inventory adjustment transaction. On all the versions Ive worked on, an account entered on form 2 overrides both the standard integration credit account and one specified by Adj Reason Code. <br />

<br />
I have had the same experience that Scott mentioned -  that an entry on form 2 will override both your integration setup and/or the account you have linked to the reason code you are using.  We are currently using IVc2, converting to c4 within the next few weeks. <br />
<br />
I would think that an SQL report would be fairly easy to develop; we've used SQL to create a number of reports that didn't come with the canned version of BaaN.  <br />

<br />
Report is fairly quick via either SQL or third party software. The only issue is that the adjustment reason code does not post to either inv700 or to gld410. So it really helps to decide what you want the report to accomplish before you start.<br />

<br />
We have not developed a report here - we print the integration transactions.  The credit accounts that we affect via a reason code do not normally have inventory adjustment transactions hit them.  Also, we have a one-to-one relationship between reason codes and credit accounts, so in effect we get the same data by  printing the integrations for the specific account(s) that a customized report would give us. <br />
<br />
If Jack is hitting the same ledger account with more than 1 reason code, he would probably benefit from a customized report of some type.<br />
