<br />
Do not manage to find an solution for this problem. Any suggestion to this problem is appreciate.<br />
<br />
My company want to reduce inventory in the warehouse. One reason that caused this problem is supplier delivery too early.<br />
<br />
I do not see any standard feature in BaaN IV that can stop the user from maintain receipt for Purchase Order line with planned delivery date/ confirmed delivery date, say 5 days from today date.<br />
<br />
Without any major customization, is there a way that I can implement this ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know whether &quot;Print Goods Receive Note&quot; (tdpur4410m000)  is already a step in your orderprocedure. If not just add it and print it in a job based on planned delivery date. No goods receipts can be maintained when step is not executed.</div></div><hr />

I was just about to say how BaanERP (ver 5) has built in feature for it called Release (Purchase Order) to Warehousing, but saying that wouldn't really be helpful to Teddy Bear. You, on the other hand, suggested something cool<br />
