<br />
I'd like to launch customer price lists with the specific discount schedules and currencies. Unfortunately I didn't find the appropriate session(s) so far.<br />
<br />
I'd deeply appreciate your support on this. <br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch,<br />
Rob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">21st May 2004, 23:36</div></div><div class="posttext">If you wish to create a price list that you can use for multiple customers, you must first create it using tcmcs0134m000, maintain price lists. Here you get the opportunity to link it to a currency.<br />
<br />
Next you use maintain customers to link specific customers to a certain price list.<br />
<br />
Then you create the prices by price list &amp; item in tdls0104m000.<br />
<br />
If you wish specific prices for an individual customer you would create them in tdsls0101m000.<br />
<br />
There are a few other sessions in this area as well:  for example tdsls0113m000 maintain prices by item.  Go into one of these sessions and follow the help text to see Baan's method of determining a price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kepschut</div><div class="date">27th May 2004, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! I checked this out and it works fine basically. But it's quite workintensive to insert any from our approximately 20 frequently used items per customer :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
A more efficient way (that's what I was searching for from the beginning) is to simply launch two price lists (one in USD and one in EUR) with the above mentioned items at list price . In the 2nd step these lists should be linked to a customer with the specific discounts per item. This way you don't have to enter the same information (item#) again and again..<br />
<br />
If this is not available I'll proceed 'the hard way' as indicated before.<br />
<br />
Thanks much in advance</div></div><hr />
