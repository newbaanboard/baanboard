<br />
Can anyone tell me in which table in ttaad4100  the Purchase Invoices-tdpur4404m000 Data is Stored?<br />

2.Maintain Purchase Order<br />
3.Print PO<br />
4.Display Receipts<br />
5.Change Prices/Discounts 'after Maintain Receipts'<br />

<br />
Strictly speaking the purchase invoice is not stored in a particular table.  tdpur045  is the purchase receipt table and contains a lot of the data but tdpur040 and tdpur041 contain order information.<br />
<br />
Records are created in this table for each orderline when the order is raised and when product is received. Status flags indicate progress through the cycle and predetermine the next step to be actioned in the process. The process is quite involved and difficult to follow and extreme caution needs to be exercised when looking at the table with ttaad4100 program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mila04792</div><div class="date">7th February 2005, 09:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks tjbyfield,<br />
<br />
What happened actually is in one <br />
PO:60000 for <br />
Item n the <br />
amount:is calculated wrongly?  :confused:  (funny isn't)?<br />
<br />
The amount is calculated by system . (unit price X quantity).<br />
Example:<br />
    Amount         Unit Price         Quantity<br />
    390                0.39                  3000<br />
<br />
In this case, the amount  saved in system is 39.<br />
And the Invoice X is already printed with a wrong amount.<br />
<br />
What i did was change the amount in ttaad4100 program.<br />
<br />
And I noticed that when I check the  InvoiceX, the item n is not in the invoice.In tdpur045 the invoice number is there.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
So what should I do?<br />
<br />
(2 things going in my mind)<br />
1. Make sure the Item is in the existing invoice.<br />
2. Delete the invoice in tdpur045 receipt and print a new invoice.  <br />
<br />
Anyone got any idea????(please help me !!!!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">7th February 2005, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess u jumped to ttaad4100 too fast. Be careful.<br />
<br />
As Terry put it, tdpur045 contains a lot of info for the order line.<br />
However, at different stages of purchase ( and sales, and inventory and ...)<br />
certain transactions are posted to finance tables and other tables depending on your set up.<br />
<br />
By changing the amount in just one place you will be creating more issues.<br />
<br />
The reason you may not be looking at the item on the invoice now is likely<br />
because it is already at a status past the process delivered PO and you may have to select reprint options or modify set ups.<br />
<br />
But, first and foremost identify the cause of the problem and the full impact<br />
of your solution. Seek Baan support help if available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the order is visible in 'Change price/discount after receipt' then you can change the price and reprint the 'proforma invoice' with the new price. If it is not visible here it indicates the purchase order has been matched in finance. Use table tdpur046 and find the actual invoice in Finance. Unapprove and unmatch the invoice, then go back to 'change price/discount after receipt' and proceed further. <br />
<br />
Before that you can put back whatever changes you have done in ttaad4100<br />
<br />

<br />
I check tdpur046 and could not find the invoice in Finance. What does that means?<br />
<br />
If it is not in the tdpur046, where is the error?<br />
I don't get it?<br />
<br />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srikarthy</div><div class="date">14th February 2005, 06:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mila52,<br />
<br />
Entry is made into the table tdpur046 when an order line is matched with a purchase invoice in the Finance module. The purchase invoice is keyed-in in finance manually using the invoice that the supplier sends and this is matched with the order line. This is nothing to do with the purchase invoice number which you print in Distribution. What you print in distribution is just a document that gives the information about the price and nowhere used in the finance module. If you want you can compare it with the invoice of the supplier. Can you find the order line in table tdpur046?<br />
<br />
Also please see the delivery status in table tdpur045. If it is not free, then it has been at least matched in Finance which means the order must appear in tdpur046. Also you can send me the same form in your table tdpur045.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mila04792</div><div class="date">14th February 2005, 11:56</div></div><div class="posttext">No, there is no  order line in table tdpur046?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The delivery status in table tdpur045 is free.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srikarthy</div><div class="date">15th February 2005, 00:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Then in that case you must be able to change the price unless you have run 'process delivered purchase orders'. If possible can you attach the same form in table tdpur045 as per my earlier attachment? Also what are the order steps for this order?<br />
<br />
Otherwise you can inform the AP person regarding the price discrepency. He <br />
can key-in the invoice with the new price and match the order line. The difference may go as price difference.<br />

<br />
Then I  must be able to change the price because I didn't run 'process delivered purchase orders'. <br />
<br />
I attach the table tdpur045.<br />

<br />
The idea is to change the procedure mask so that it appears in session tdpur4122m000. If sequence No: 2 is appearing in session tdpur4122m000, you can change the procedure mask for sequence 1 exactly as sequence 2. Then it will appear in session tdpur4122m000. But I think that both the lines are not appearing in tdpur4122m000. <br />
<br />
Also look at the order type. If you give me the order steps for this order( session tcmcs0142m000), the procedure mask can be found out by a simulation. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mila04792</div><div class="date">15th February 2005, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear SriKarthy,<br />
<br />
<br />
The sequence No: 2 is appearing in session tdpur4122m000, but not sequence 1.<br />
<br />
The order type is PO5 -RAW MATERIAL INVENTORISED ORDER<br />
<br />
<br />
The order steps for this order( session tcmcs0142m000) are as listed below. <br />
<br />
<br />
1.Print Purchase Orders<br />
2.Print Goods Received Notes<br />
3.Maintain Receipts<br />
5.Maintain Approvals<br />
7.Print Return Notes<br />
8.Print Purchase Invoices<br />
9.Process Delivered Purchase<br />

<br />
The approved quantity is zero as well as rejected qty zero which means you are yet to do the approval. I am surprised how you <br />
could print purchase invoice before approving. I don't know your working environment but if this is normal practice then simply put the 'procedure mask' exactly as in sequence 2 and it will appear in 'change price..' session.<br />
<br />
Else, first complete approval. Then change the procedure mask to <br />
'eeenenneynnnnnnnnnnn'. It will appear in the 'change price' session.<br />
<br />
