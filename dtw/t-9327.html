<br />
Could anyone tell me if there is a way to restrict the amendments to be made to replenishment orders once they have been processed.<br />
<br />
Our client is using C IV version and it was observed by us that items could be added or deleted to a replenishment order even after a delivery note had been prepared against the same.<br />
<br />
Thanx and Regards</div></div><hr />

Qty can be changed untill delivery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rabaan</div><div class="date">24th March 2003, 12:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx again for the reply.<br />
<br />
What  would be the effect of deleting (processing) replenishment orders, would the data be deleted from the database or only shifted to the history table so that the reports  can still be generated. <br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">24th March 2003, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Order will be in history as soon as it is entered. Like in SLS and PUR it will be romeved from the Maintain sessions when you process/delete the order. This means no lines can be added. The history will be present untill archieve</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rabaan</div><div class="date">24th March 2003, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx a lot for the prompt reply.<br />
<br />
May be we can recommend our client to start using the process/delete session for replenishment orders<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
