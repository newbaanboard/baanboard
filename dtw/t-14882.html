We would like our receivers to be able to outbound shortages the moment they are received (from RECEIPT or INPECT) but not be able to generate outbound for regular locations.<br />
Any ideas much appreciated.<br />

Using Baan 4c3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the session &quot;Maintain Outbound data&quot; you can maintain from a Specific Location not the range of location.<br />
<br />
Instead of using &quot;Generate Outbound data&quot; try to use the Session &quot;maintain Outbound data&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this will solve u r problem.<br />

What we are attempting to do is have a process whereby the receivers can generate outbound for a range of production orders that have already been outbounded to but at the time had some shortages. Once they are done receiving they would generate outbound and send anything that was previously short straight to production instead of inbounding it and then outbounding it a few minutes later.<br />
I tried setting up field level authorizations but could not get it to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can make an afs session that handles both inbound and outbound at the same time, in your script you can handle the restrictions. Besides that it will reduce time to process.<br />
