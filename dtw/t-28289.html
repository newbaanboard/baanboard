<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">2nd October 2006, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: There are around 6million records in whinh230 (Inbound advice logs) table. It is very difficult to maintain this table now. I was thinking of deleting the old records from this table (after tabing a backup).<br />
<br />
I checked the where used tables session and there are two sessions and few scripts that access this table (see the attachement, ignore the customizations). <br />
<br />
Has anyone done some analysis of this table... impact of droping the old records... etc <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

With session whinh3260m000 you can delete put-away inbound data, quite a common practice in itself. This automatically also deletes the inbound advice log. In case there are advice log records in your system that are not linked to any existing inbound line, then session whcor2230m000 will clean those up.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

Could you pl re-confirm that whinh3260m000 removes the inbound advice logs also. We use the same session to remove the inbound advices but it does not remove the records from whinh230. I'll also check the SSA knowledgebase, we are on SP16.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Pl ignore the earlier note... the session does remove the advice logs also. There are probably some old records still in whinh230 that should get cleared by the correction session. Thanks</div></div><hr />
