   I've questions regrading the annual issues used in the ABC code turnover calculation and last counting date for cycle counting. We don't have source code.<br />
<br />
1. Is the annual issue is calculated from the inventory issue history, or is there any field available which is updated during inventory issues?<br />
2. Last counting date is available both in item data, and in item by warehouse data. Which one is used during cycle count order generation?<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />
