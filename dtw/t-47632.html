Has anyone come up with a work around solution for consigned purchased items i.e. supplier consigns inventory to the business - business pays for inventory upon consumption of inventory.<br />

Cosginment has only financial implication. One way to map is bring the inventory into a warehosue where debit and credit are mapped to same ledger, so inventroy doesn't get valued in GL. And then we need to exlcude such inventory from distribution inventory report. When such inventroy is conusmed, then one can use say reduce the inventory in consigned warehouse and at the same time create a PO receipt transaction and drive accounts payable, and issue it to production order. Ofcourse, lot of all this will require system modification,but you can achieve what is required.<br />
