I am dealing with this situation:<br />
<br />
1) Some of our salesperson have a single purchase order and they are using this PO whole year (it is special case for long term contracts).<br />
2) In PO's header is Planned Delivery Date, i.e 10.Jan.2018<br />
3) When they add a new purchase order line that default value for Planned Delivery Date in line is Planned Delivery Date from header<br />
4) Problem is that this date from PO's header is in the past. They have to change this date in line manually, sometimes they forgot it etc...<br />
<br />
Is there any solution for it? For example, some parameter somewhere, that default value for Planned Delivery Date column in PO's lines will be current date if Planned Delivery Date in header is in the past?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any ideas...</div></div><hr />

You can write this in User exits this logic.<br />
