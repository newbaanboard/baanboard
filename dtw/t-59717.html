<br />
We had some very old orders(2008) which got accidentaly shipped recently.<br />
These orders were not supposed to get shipped but were somehow shipped.<br />
Is thereany way to find when they were released to warehousing and by whom?<br />
also can we know whether this was done manually or in a job<br />
<br />
We have a job for release to warehousing sesssion which has a starting range of order which is greater than the order from 2008.<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />
