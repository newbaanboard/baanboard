<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mila04792</div><div class="date">18th January 2005, 06:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys, :) <br />
<br />
How r u all?<br />
<br />
I have a question to ask u all regarding the warehouse (hate to use the word problem).<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Currently In the system for warehouse,for inventory transactions there are these transaction types(tdilc1120m000)<br />
1 Purchase order<br />
2 Sales Order<br />
3 Production Issue<br />
4 Production Receipt<br />
5 Inventory Adjustment<br />
6 Inventory Transfer<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
And in the QA module, just the maintain approval (tdpur4121m000) and print return notes (tdpur4411m000).<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
My question is how to key-in return to customer  data and incoming reject by IQA data.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me explain how the current warehouse flow works.<br />
For the incoming reject , <br />
1. Print GRN.<br />
2. Maintain Receipt <br />
3. Inventory Transactions (to QA)<br />
<br />
In QA  maintain approval, or if the items are rejected &quot; manually documentation&quot; to Warehouse.<br />
Later, in warehouse, these rejected items are replaced after some duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
**** Notice here is the problem.<br />
**** As there is no transaction made to show that the items are out and in back.<br />
****When we have the monthly inventory, of course it shows variance in the quantity<br />
**** But off course after the items are replaced the numbers are corrected again.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
(I just took in charge of Baan last year .I wonder how come they never noticed this. :cool: )<br />
<br />
So what should I do.<br />
Where do I change the procedure and how?<br />
Is it in Warehouse or QA?<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The similar things happen to return to customer for (sub-con and customer) .where is the transaction actually takes place?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.<br />
<br />
The flow here is a basic one. As we are growing and starting to do the sub-cons we need to change the current flow.So any help from you guys are going to make a big change.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">18th January 2005, 17:45</div></div><div class="posttext">For the purchasing side:<br />
When you maintain receipts it puts the full amount received into the inspect location if you have ILC and puts the total quantity on hold.  During the rejection process all items rejected automatically show as backordered.  For example:  Order 100, receive 100, accept 80 and reject 20.  The quantity coming out of inspection is 100 but the quantity going into inventory is only 80.  The line on the PO now shows a backorder of 20.  Only when this 20 comes in and is received does it go into inventory.  You do have the option to override the backorder quantity at inspection.  A nice document is the Return Goods Note which should accompany the goods back to the supplier and I think a copy should go to purchasing for their information so that they can interface with the supplier regarding the rejection.<br />
<br />
For the sales side:<br />
When a customer is given the authority to return goods a negative sales order should be created.  When the goods come in then you will do a negative inbound (if you have ILC) or simply maintain negative receipts.  I suggest that this sales order reference an inspection or MRB warehouse.  The goods can then be inspected and either scrapped or transferred to another warehouse or returned to the customer via a regular sales order line.  This should keep then an accurate record of just what is in the warehouses.<br />
<br />
Hope this makes sense and that I did understand the question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mila04792</div><div class="date">24th January 2005, 06:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Judy,<br />
<br />
<br />
That is what I was trying to explain.<br />
But the problem is in Warehouse, they only maintain receipt.<br />
And in QA they just maintain approval.(only approved qty, no reject data key-in)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I can understand this:(as you said)<br />
<br />
&quot;For example: Order 100, receive 100, accept 80 and reject 20. The quantity coming out of inspection is 100 but the quantity going into inventory is only 80. The line on the PO now shows a backorder of 20. &quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
In Our Current Flow:  if the         Order qty      : 200<br />
                             then          Receipt qty   : 100<br />
                                             Accept  qty   : 80<br />
                                             Reject qty     : 20<br />
<br />
Noticed that : the line on the PO now shows a backorder of 100 (200-100) and not 20.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
And the QA will wait for the 20 good parts to come in again to maintain the approval for 100 quantity in maintain approval. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
                    <br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
In Warehouse : Maintain Receipt they never enter any accept or reject amount.<br />
<br />
In QA : Maintain Approval they never enter any rejected amount also.<br />
           They enter the approved qty only.(if there are reject, they return to warehouse,no data key-in, wait for the good parts to come in)<br />
<br />
************I know it sounds funny, but I just took over Baan and noticed this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pls refer to attachment.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Pls correct me if I am mistaken.<br />
In form 2 maintain approval there is a field -rejected qty (equal to backorder)<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
which means:<br />
<br />
Receipt qty (warehouse-maintain receipt)= 100<br />
Approved qty (qa- maintain approval)= 80<br />
                   (qa-  backorder)         =20<br />
                   (qa -rejected)            =20<br />
Inventory in Warehouse= 80<br />
<br />
When the same parts come in again, they go straight to QA for inspection and approval.(** currently all parts must go to warehouse first)<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
So there will be no variance at the monthly inventory stating incoming reject.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
How about the PO lines?<br />
<br />
Am I right?<br />
<br />
The data after entering the rejected value in Maintain Approval will be <br />
like this <br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
pos                     160<br />
Porj                      -<br />
Item                      x <br />
Cnt                       y<br />
Ordered                200<br />
Del Date                 z<br />
Delivered               80  <br />
Back_Order           120 (100 +20)<br />
<br />
<br />
compared to the current one:<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
pos                      160<br />
Porj                       -<br />
Item                      x<br />
Cnt                       y<br />
Ordered                200<br />
Del Date                z<br />
Delivered               100<br />
Back_Order            100<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
rejected qty:-<br />
approved qty:-<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Am I right?<br />
I would like to implement this in our organization. I am quite sure that this is right.<br />
I would like to know the opion from you expert guys out there. I appreciate any idea or suggestion from you all.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">24th January 2005, 07:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Not sure if I understood your problem... but.. I did simulate to see...<br />
<br />
Ordered qty in PO = 1000 and Inspection = Yes. PO Order type supports Approval.<br />
<br />
I did receive only 800 on receipt at warehouse. This transalated to a backorder for 200 and I did saw a backorder for 200. I did Inspection then and did approve 600 and Reject 200. So, I fill both approved qty and reject qty.  At this stage, my backorder shows 400, which is perfect. Inventory on hand shows only 400, as expected. <br />
<br />
Now am not sure if you want accountability for the rejected 200 while approval. If that is the case, Baan does not store rejected inventory and the moment you reject, it is out of warehouse. <br />
<br />
How they track reject inventory which is in your own warehouse? In that case, you dont reject 200 after receipt. Receive all 800 and approve all 800. After this move the 200 reject qty by means of a warehouse transfer to a non-nettable warehouse so that Planning wont consider that item. This way, there is no backorder generated automatically. You will have to manually create another PO to receive the rejected from vendor again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gaetan_m</div><div class="date">3rd February 2005, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
In fact, the reason why some organizations are not using Maintain Approvals<br />
is because of the nature of their agreements with their suppliers. In Baan IV, the rejected stock will not show in inventory but in certain cases it will still be invoiced by the suppliers. <br />
<br />
Several organizations have agreement with their suppliers to receive their items in stock (they can be transferred to a Return warehouse) and then if they reject material, they will get a credit note for the rejected parts. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Baan IV and MK does not completly support this functionality, unless you approve material and transfer it to a non-nettable warehouse.<br />
If you can change the agreements with your suppliers to never get invoiced for rejected parts instead of issuing credit notes then, rejecting parts with Maintain Approvals will work fine for you.<br />
<br />
Also, there are not many standard reports providing information on the quantity of rejects from a supplier after Maintain Approvals, which is important for QA. Quantities rejected are in fact not visible in inventory.<br />
<br />
In Baan ERP, they added the functionality of a reject location:<br />
The purpose of a reject location in BaanERP is to enable the storage and handling of rejected goods in a warehouse. The rejected goods must be registered in the reject location of a location-controlled warehouse to allow further handling of the rejected inventory. The rejected goods are received, but are not yet paid for, and therefore they are not owned. Rejected goods are handled against the original purchase order. List items and items that are posted to inventory by component are not handled in a reject location. <br />

I'll check the flow in Purchasing first.<br />
Got idea with your suggestion. Thank you.<br />
