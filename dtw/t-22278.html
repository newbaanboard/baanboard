<br />
In BaaN IV c4, System Derives (Calculates) the Material Cost &amp; Opertion Cost. based on the Bill of Material for Item Type: Manufacturing.<br />
<br />
For Item Type: Purchase, system calculates the price entered in the Form-3 of the session &quot; Maintain Item Data(tiitm0101m000)&quot;.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">8th November 2004, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">The standard cost of a purchased item will be selected from one of the 3 fields on form 3 of Maintain Item Data.  The fields are: Purchase Price, Average Purchase Price or Latest Purchase Price.  It may also be based on the Simulated Purchase Price in Cost Accounting Master Data.  The field used is based on the Cost Price Calculation Code in Cost Accounting Master Data.  You are given 4 choices for priority in selecting the cost.  Based on the priority Baan will search for the first non-zero cost and use that.  Hope this makes sense.</div></div><hr />

Please take note that the standard cost in ITM include the surcharge, if any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know I'm updating this incidence after really long time.. But no one mentioned here how does system calculate Operation Costs in Item Costings Data..<br />
<br />
Any ideas how does system calculate Standard Operation Cost in  LN..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">23rd April 2013, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">The operation cost of an item is based on its routing data.  Each operation in the routing will have a duration or rate per hour.  This defines the time taken to process one routing unit through the op.  The routing unit is usually 1, but for jobs with really short durations it can be the time taken to process a standard batch.  (The routing quantity is part of the item - production data).<br />
<br />
The operation takes place in a work centre.  The work centre in turn should be linked to an operation rate code.  The operation rate code has one or more lines, based on the cost of running the cost centre.  So there could be labour cost, machine cost and surcharges on each of these.  Each cost type is associated with a cost component and an hourly running rate.  The sum of the hourly rates is the estimated cost of running the work centre for an hour.   Given the duration and the cost per hour, the standard costing algorithm calculates the operation cost by taking all operations in the routing and summing their individual costs.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of other points;  Setup time can optionally be included or excluded from the cost calculation; and the duration in the work centre is based on the number of operators or machines (depending which is the primary resource for planning.  If the man occupation or machine occupation values on the routing operation are changed, this will seek to modify the duration.</div></div><hr />
