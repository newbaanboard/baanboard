<br />
We often receive goods after the person who enters receipts has gone home. So we have inventory sitting in our plant that MRP does not see when it runs at night between the actual receipt and the entry in Baan the next day. <br />
<br />
This is causing some problems obviously, and I wondered EDI might provide a solution. We do have some EDI on the purchasing side, but we don't currently accept any ASNs from our vendors. <br />

Thanks,<br />

And I believe MRP will ignore it. Even with ASN, one has to do the receipt entry,as all ASN does is simplify the receipt process and it lands up in tdpur400. I am not aware if ASN directly bypasses the &quot;Maintain receipt session&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand why this would cause a problem with MRP. Whether MRP sees actual stock or planned stock makes no difference, unless there are significant differences in the dates and / or the quantities.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could explain the problem in more detail?<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />

I think this is more of with the way people are using MRP, than with the way it is running. They tend to trust what is actually in inventory more than what is in planning. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />
