<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheYaz</div><div class="date">21st February 2007, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Anybody's view is welcome! We have set-up on our production floor a rack containing bins (supermarket of parts). More like floor stock but for what could be expensive items. The assembly person picks-up the bin and performs his stuff with it. If the bin is empty, a flag is raised (KANBAN visual method) and the store person regularly checks if bins need to be replaced. We have set-up a separate warehouse for this. With the Safety Stock ,we can have MRP plan the purchase of material but we are looking for is a way to have Baan automatically replenish the Whse KB2 when it is empty, something like a planned Warehouse Transfer. <br />
<br />
I know that Baan ERP 5.0c doesn't provide much on KANBAN stuff and that we should probably look at an external product to tie to Baan.<br />
<br />
We might also have to reconsider the use of Floor Stock for these items, even if they are expensive parts.<br />
<br />
Does anybody heard of a way that this can be done? Any ideas? Heard of anybody who can make this happen?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kanban replenishment is a highly subjective topic, as such approaches differ. <br />
If it interests you, we created an integrated bridge to BaaN, in which bar-codes can trigger any number of  transactions such as, DRP warehouse orders, stock transfers and so on. We have Kanban workflows for replenishment, purchasing and also Kanban production order processing. These Kanban flows are an extension to our standard bar-coded data collection and transaction processing suite for BaaN. <br />
<br />
These transactions can be combined within a single bar-code. Users simply scan a Kanban bar code and each can trigger a different transaction or multiple transactions, chained together. For example, one might maintain a PO and automatically fax or email to the vendor (in a single scan!) while another bin, when scanned, might insert a delivery schedule line etc... <br />
<br />
IÂ’ll save everyone from the long(er) winded sales pitch but if you would like to know more feel free to contact or PM me I can arrange a webinar so you can see it in action !</div></div><hr />

We will complete our requirements definition and contact when ready.<br />
