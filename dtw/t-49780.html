<br />
Does anybody know how to configure MRP Purchase to suggest orders for some item on particular weekday only, for example Tuesday?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

   Just a suggestion more than a solution as i have no idea if this will work or not. In ItemMaster enter 7 as the &quot;Order Interval&quot; (Form4, Left Bottom) and in the field &quot;First Allowed Order Date&quot; (Form4, Right Top) put a date of a particular Tuesday. As i said its a suggestion. <br />
On another note, isnt the (suggested or planned) order date depending on when the material would be required? Wouldnt that take precedence over any other setting?<br />

Thank you anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">7th April 2008, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see why you would want to do this, we have suppliers that deliver every 'Tuesday' on their regular route, it would be nice if Baan's MRP created orders with the correct day of week.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is a way in standard baan to do this.<br />
If I was given this problem, I would probably create a processing session that would update the planned order date and planned delivery date in the mrp020 table (MRP planned Purchase Orders).  Then when you confirm and transfer them into 'real' purchase orders, they would have the correct day of the week on them.<br />
<br />
I would probably write the processing session so that it 'condensed' the requirements, so if you had planned MRP purchases every day for a particular item, it would sum them together, and leave you with only one planned purchase order, with the correct day of week information on it.<br />
<br />
Typically I don't recommend manipulating the planned orders like this, but since they are going to be deleted with the next MRP run anyway, I don't think you would get into much trouble.<br />
<br />
Another option would be write a report to gather the requirements into the correct buckets, and then have a user manually create the PO's based on this report.  <br />
<br />
It depends on volume and complexity, which approach you want to take.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
