<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">18th February 2011, 22:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I am trying to use the “post to component” feature on the purchase orders lines so that we can place an assembly on the purchase order but receive the components (BOM) to inventory. Everything works fine except for how the components are posted to inventory. <br />
<br />
When the purchase order is received, the components go to the correct warehouse (as listed in the BOM) but to a blank location! (Even though the warehouse has a receiving location specified). Does anyone have experience with this? <br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.<br />
