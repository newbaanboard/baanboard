I created Warehouse Order - Transfer (Manual) and Lot selection is &quot;Any&quot;. System generated Outbound Advice and suggest the latest Lot Number. But outbound priority is FIFO. Normally system should suggest Lot Number according to FIFO method.<br />
<br />
Please find the attathed file for more detail and if you have any advice please let me know. Thank you<br />

First of all, check the item warehousing data (session whwmd4100s000) for this item.  Select the tab &quot;Issuing&quot; and check the value of the field &quot;Outbound Priority&quot;.  It should say &quot;FIFO&quot;.  If it doesn't, you can change this by making use of the session &quot;Define New Outbound System By Item&quot; (whwmd3202m000) to change the outbound priority.<br />
Also, check if the &quot;Minimal Picks&quot; option is selected in the &quot;Inventory Handling Parameters&quot;.  When selected, this option overrules FIFO and tries to generate minimal picks.<br />
<br />
Hope this solves your problem.<br />
<br />
Best regards.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the response. I have checked the setting<br />
 - &quot;Outbound Priority&quot; = FIFO<br />
 - &quot;Minimal Picks&quot; isn't selected<br />
<br />
So the problem may happen from other causes. Does anybody know?, please give me your advices.<br />
<br />
