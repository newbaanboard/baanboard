<br />
Recently we had so much problem with the MAUC calculation.  I therefore, appreciate if someone can share the detail MAUC calculation for manufactured item under the following transaction:<br />
<br />
Let say item A std cost is 84.5<br />
Latest MAUC is 88.4<br />
Onhand stock = 100<br />
<br />
calculation?<br />
1) upon production (receipt), does the actual production cost affect the MAUC calculation<br />
2) upon production manual (receipt)<br />
3) upon transfer manual (receipt)<br />
4) cycle count/adjustment order<br />
5) sales return<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">1st August 2005, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The receipt transaction is registered in the following way:<br />
<br />
1) production (receipt): against FTP<br />
2) production manual (receipt): against actual cost<br />
3) transfer manual (receipt): against issue price<br />
4) cycle count/adjustment order: against actual cost<br />
5a) linked sales return: against original issue price<br />
5b) not linked sales return: against receipt price<br />
<br />
Will MAUC be adjusted:<br />
1) yes<br />
2) no<br />
3) depends; most likely it will<br />
4) no<br />
5a) depends; if between the issue and the receipt the MAUC is unchanged: no<br />
5b) yes</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the fast response, but still have some clarification:<br />
<br />
1) production (receipt): against FTP (i thot this is against actual production cost??)<br />
2) production manual (receipt): against actual cost (is this not against FTP?)<br />
3) transfer manual (receipt): against issue price (if no transfer price, then against FTP?)<br />
4) cycle count/adjustment order: against actual cost ( not against FTP?)<br />
5a) linked sales return: against original issue price (ok)<br />
5b) not linked sales return: against receipt price (ok)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">1st August 2005, 12:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sorry. You are partly right:<br />
<br />
1) No, against FTP. Since BaanERP 5.2 it is possible to receive end items against actual costs. On the Costing tab of the Production Order (tisfc0501m000) the option &quot;Use Actual Cost Price for Receipt Posting&quot; can be selected. In BaanERP 5.0 end items are received against FTP.<br />
<br />
2) You are right. This is of course against FTP.<br />
<br />
3a) If no invoice relation is defined: issue price<br />
3b) If an invoice relation is defined: transfer price. If no transfer price can be found, I suppose a message comes up. If that is not true, then I think you are right, FTP is used.<br />
<br />
4) No, against MAUC. See SOL 107924.</div></div><hr />
