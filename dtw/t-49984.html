<br />
Please see the below scenario and kindly give advice.<br />
<br />
Now the average purchase price of standard items are updated as and when the purchase invoices are matched and approved in Finance module (based on the PUR parameter setup Link with Finance  Yes).<br />
<br />
If we change the Distribution (PUR) parameter setup Link with Finance to No, we can update the latest and average purchase price of standard items immediately after making receipt of the item and running Process Delivered Purchase Orders, right?<br />
<br />
Here, we want to know that by changing the parameter Link with Finance to &quot;No&quot;, what are the affects or impacts in Finance module. Will it (any purchase receipt) not pass an entry in finance module? When we tried changing the parameter to No in test company, integration transactions (Purchase Receipt and Result) are passed and posted in Finance. Is there any other affect in finance module or somewhere else, if we change the PUR Parameter Link with Finance to No?<br />
<br />
Well be very much grateful, if anybody can give us a clear idea regarding the above.<br />
<br />
Actually, I've posted this thread in Integration Forum, but no response so far.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot for your reply.<br />
<br />
If you dont mind, can you please look below the problem we are facing?<br />
<br />
We are getting the invoices from supplier very late. So, before the purchase invoices are getting matched and approved, received items might get consumed to projects with the old price (leaving the project costing inaccurate).<br />
<br />
Thats why we are planning to change the above parameter to No so that the average price will get updated as and when the receipts are being made and running the session PDPO.<br />
<br />
Could you please give us your valuable advice in deciding whether we have to change the said parameter to No or to keep it as Yes? If we change it to No, will it remove any other purchase link with Finance module, except the one you mentioned in your prev reply?<br />
<br />
(In fact, we are confused with the word Link with Finance)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">2nd April 2008, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I think chaging it to &quot;No&quot; affects removing the order data- in session PDPO. I don't think it affects any other thing. If you are using project then I believe u can directly use the purchase price to arrive at the true cost of project and not the standard cost. <br />

<br />
Thanks for your information. <br />
<br />
One more problem&#8230;.<br />
<br />
After changing the parameter (Link with Finance) to No in test co., it is not possible to do matching and approval process in Finance (saying that &#8220;No Link between purchase and finance&#8221;). But we need to do this step to debit Invoice to be received a/c and to credit Supplier. Is there any other way to do this?<br />
<br />
I saw your old thread regarding &#8220;Automating Payment Matching&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t mind, can you please give us the logic of that method? My email id is shanidhtc@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
Thanks once again<br />
