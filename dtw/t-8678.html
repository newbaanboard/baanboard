<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrMarco</div><div class="date">30th January 2003, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an incoming EDIFACT DELINS message from a Customer giving Purchasing Schedule information. I am trying to set up EDI in Baan 4 b2 to accept this message and create Sales Schedules from it.<br />
<br />
I have set up a relation for the customer. I am now trying to Maintain Relation Data by Network (tcedi0128m000). There is a field on this form called &quot;Network Address&quot;. This is the unique address as it appears in the incoming message and allows Baan to find this address and use the correct relation.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the network address in the incoming message is 24 characters long, but the Baan field &quot;Network Address&quot; is only 17 characters long.<br />
<br />
This incoming address should be constructed according to the Odette standard, so I can't ask the sender (the client) to shorten this address. How then can Baan cross reference the Network Address in the incoming message to the correct relation? :confused: <br />
<br />
If it is of any help, the UNB segment of the incoming message is:<br />
<br />
UNB+UNOA:1+094200005560139700001001+01010000370002+030128:0244+3700472Â’<br />
<br />
<br />
I am assuming that, in this example, the sender's network address is &quot;094200005560139700001001&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
