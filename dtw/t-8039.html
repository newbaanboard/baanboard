<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amarpreet</div><div class="date">11th December 2002, 07:08</div></div><div class="posttext">An export sales order is created with 5 different lines. While processing this sales order the following happens<br />
<br />
1. Outbound advice was generated for line no 5 (Ordered qty 3600,Delivered qty 3000, Price 10.6790 USD, Currency conversion factor is 48.2) on 23/11/2002.<br />
2. Confirm delivery done for this line. But due to some reasons this was decided that this line is not to be invoiced. So no further processing done on this sales order line.<br />
3. On same day outbound advice was generated for another line no 1 in the same sales order. (Ordered qty 3000, Delivered qty 3000, Price 11.1890 USD, Currency conversion factor if 48.2)<br />
4. Confirm deliveries done for this line. Export invoice was processed for this line no 1. <br />
5. PDSO run on 25/11/2002 &amp; transactions were posted to finance.<br />
6. On 30/11/2002 the line, which was left unprocessed in step no 2, was invoiced.<br />
7. Invoice amount for line 1 is 3000*48.2*11.1890. =  1617929. (Invoice no is S10 72000034) <br />
8. Invoice amount for line 5 is 3000*48.2*10.6790  =  1544183  (Invoice amount is S10 72000037)<br />
<br />
The problem in finance is that entries in finance are posted against invoice no S10 72000034 as 3162112 (Sum of Both lines)<br />
<br />
Also against invoice no S10 72000037 invoice amount posted is 1544183<br />
<br />
Please suggest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the status of your 'customer to be invoiced account'? <br />
<br />
Does the data in gld410 and sls 045 tally?</div></div><hr />
