<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rnayak72</div><div class="date">23rd September 2005, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">In our export sales order series, very frequently the procedure mask does not get updated and shows the same status even after execution of session.<br />
<br />
The problem steps are after &quot;Process Excise Invoice&quot;, the next step is &quot;Print Sales Invoice&quot; <br />
<br />
Many times even after processing excise invoice the order step still shows Process Excise Invoice, similarly even after Print sales invoice, the order step does not move to PDSO. Sometimes the same combination of item &amp; customer workd normally.<br />
<br />
I have to then manually change Mask thru GTM.<br />
<br />
This has been noted in RPL order steps too.<br />
<br />
However our regular sales series with same sessions works normally.<br />
<br />
Any advice ?</div></div><hr />

If the step has executed correctly then the update of the mask and status code fields (4c4 = tdsls045.pmsk and tdsls045.ssls) may have been rolled back without a warning to that effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the problem of standard baan. To overcome it you can better design an update session for updating procedure mask in tdsls045 on the basis of Invoice No (tdind015). <br />
