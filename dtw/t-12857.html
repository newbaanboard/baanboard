we have one problem in controlling the material sent for job /repair work don't have BaaN inventory.<br />
Example: sending a Computer Monitor for repair out side<br />
Since monitor is part of computer we don't have seperate inventory.At present we maintain a Register to controll the same.<br />
since the Item is under AMC and fetach no VALUE.<br />
<br />
The inventory item we use inventory transfer to subcontract warehouse and receiving from the same warehouse so that we can get the details of material sent out side and received back.<br />

We are using BaaN for  all  in distribution module.Is any workaround or standard session available for the above example to control the transaction.<br />

<br />
In BaaN IV C4 in Distribution module, there is a submodule called Central Excise/ Sub Contracting in this module Job work functionality is available.<br />
<br />
Here you can track all your Job activities including Receipts and Deliveries. 57F(2) functinality also available.<br />
<br />
Hope this functionality will serve your requirement.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is up to you, want to  maintain the Item as a separate item or send as a main item. For your case, you can send the monitor as a computer but in the system you will see computer only .<br />
<br />
I don't see any imlication in 57F(2) formalities.<br />

Reghu,<br />
<br />
u can create a seperate warehouse for repairing purpose, and transffer the material thru RPL cycle, and when material arrives, take it back to your general warehouse.<br />
