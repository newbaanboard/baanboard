<br />
We are implementing the export module.<br />
<br />
In this module we want that the invoice made from Print Sales Invoice shud have the exchange rate as the rate which was being updated in the system two days back.<br />
<br />
Since our airway bill comes to office after two days and hence needs the same to be posted in finance with this exchange rate.<br />
<br />
How can we do this?? In the print Sales Invoice Session we have the date field do the change in the date in this would help us in any way.<br />
<br />

<br />
If you have selected the Fixed Rate as Invoice Date in Maintail Sales Order (In form Nos. 2), then the Invoice date in the Print sales invoice session may bring the specific exchange rate  for the same.</div></div><hr />
