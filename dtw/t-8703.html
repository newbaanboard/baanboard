<br />
We are running Baan IV, is there any way we can bolt on the consignment stock solution from Baan V to Baan IV <br />
<br />
Original thread.<br />
Is there any way you can identify stock as supplier consignment stock. We do not want to use another warehouse; we would like to use the standard warehouses if we can. <br />
We do not have the manufacturing modules.<br />
<br />
Thanks in anticipation for your help <br />
