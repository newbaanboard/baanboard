do you know what Transport Document = Invoice in whwmd2100s000 (tab Shipments) means? What kind of Invoice should be printed, and where?<br />
<br />
Moreover, do you know a standard workaround in order to avoid Transport Documents in case of internal warehouse transfers?<br />
<br />
thanks for every reply! ;)</div></div><hr />

1) Goods can be accompanies by the Delivery Note or by an Invoice. If the goods are accompanied by an Invoice, the invoicing step should be preferably be an automatic process.<br />
<br />
Delivery Note mandatory step<br />
2) If the transport document is selected for your (ship-from) warehouse, it is a mandatory step for each order. There is a requirement for more flexibility in this area, but that is currently not present.<br />
<br />
In FP5 a workaround is possible, but that is only workable for exceptions. See SOL 242370.</div></div><hr />
