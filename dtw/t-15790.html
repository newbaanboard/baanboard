<br />
Financial Transactions <br />
Financial transactions are created when goods are shipped (Confirm Shipments) for issues. For receipt, financial transactions are created at receipt (Confirm Receipt). This is irrespective of other order steps. If the received amount is zero, financial transactions are only created if in ACP invoices must be matched against it. If you receive zero pcs for a transfer order; the amount will be zero. As it is not relevant for ACP, no financial transactions are created. If you receive a purchase order for a zero amount the Purchase/Result transaction is created for a value of zero.<br />
<br />
Stock Transactions <br />
1) generate O/A: allocation on pick/bulk level + on hand on staging location (whinr1542m000)<br />
- pick advice: decrease allocation + increase on staging (whinr1542m000)<br />
- ship: decrease on staging location (whinr1542m000) + decrease on item/warehouse level (whwmd2515m000)<br />
Note: the quantity in transit in the ship-from warehouse will increase with the shipped quantity. If will decrease after receipt.<br />
2) No receipt, no changes in stock level<br />
3) Receive partially: increase of stock level for the received quantity. In case of final receipt no further receipts are possible for a transfer (manual) order. Hence, inventory in transit is reduced with total quantity.<br />
4) Same as 3)<br />
5) Same as 3)<br />

<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
In our case we transfer the materials between warehouses with markup prices in the entity relationship.<br />
<br />
In our zero receipt and final receipt has not been marked, we are not getting in tfgld4510m000.<br />
<br />
If zero qty and final receipt made , those transactions we able to get.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
can you clarify <br />

<br />
What is the Financial Transaction you get? The first one I am thinking of is 'Shipment Variance'. A zero amount will be created if the cost component is of cost type 'Material' (or 'General').<br />
<br />
Refer to Solution 123568.</div></div><hr />
