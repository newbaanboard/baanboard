I dont see the connection between tdsls042(Specific Addresses) and tdsls051(Sales Order Line History). Did you mean tdsls041 and tdsls051 or tdsls042 and tdsls050? What are you trying to recover? Addresses or Sales Order header &amp; Line details?<br />

   Sorry. It was typo error.<br />
   Yes,I want to copy the data from tdsls051 to tdsls041.Sales order lines i want to copy from history to tdsls041 and also in tdsls045.is there other table is linked with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">11th August 2007, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I think sls051 is the only place you would find sales order line related history. <br />
To find out whats missing in Sls041 from 051 you could use the Record Type(ckor) field to give you all those orders where the lines were deleted. ckor =2 will give you this and along with lines that were updated. So i guess your statement might look like this(In MS SQL)<br />
Select * <br />
From tdsls051 <br />
Where (t_ckor = 2) and (t_orno Not In (Select t_orno From tdsls041)) and (trdt = date on which the deletion happened)<br />
 <br />
This would help in getting most of the deleted info except for few that you would have to fill up on your own. In both sls041 &amp; sls045 tables there are some fields which you wont get data from sls051. <br />
For e.g: 045: Sales Status Code(ssls), Procedure Mask(pmsk) 045 &amp; 041: Back Order Quantity(bqua) etc.. <br />
 <br />
If there are any invoiced lines amongst the deleted orders then you could even check Acr200 table...<br />
 <br />
good luck<br />
