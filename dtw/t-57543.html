<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bohdan</div><div class="date">4th January 2010, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We want to start doing cycle counting in several warehouses on a weekly basis. We do not want to do all locations. Does anybody have documentation on what actually happens when cycle counting is turned on for a location? What tables are affected? What can and can't happen during the cycle count? I have a good general understanding of doing inventory for the entire warehouse, but not doing it by specific locations. I still need to release orders to the shop floor. <br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to respond.</div></div><hr />

Basically if a location for an item will come for cycle counting depends on three factor<br />
<br />
1. Item ABC classification<br />
2. The cycle count frequency<br />
3. Last counting date and this is present in ilc101<br />
<br />
Like in our case the reqmt was that if a location is counted then all the location for that item should also be counted. For this we did a modification which updates the last counting date.<br />
<br />
Also, say if the item had no stock (means no ilc101 record), then when purchase or production receipt happens then the item location was coming on cycle count, again we updated the last counting date, so that the location will not come. <br />
