<br />
Is there a way to avoid system searching at default sales price book for specific customers? In our environment system gets the sales price from the default price book and then applies discounts based on the discount matrix. <br />
<br />
For a few specific customers we maintain a separate price book and search criteria in price matrices. If for any item the price is missing in that price book, system must show 0in the sales order. It must not bring the value from the default price book. Is it possible in ERP-LN?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Yes your requirement is very well possible in LN.<br />
<br />
Follow the below mentioned Steps:<br />
<br />
1. Define Matrix definition (tdpcg0110m000)<br />
    Here you have to select the define Type(Sale Price) attribute on the basis you want to define the criteria. As you said you want to define the separate Price List for different BP's so you have to select BP in Attribute. There are many more criteria available here.<br />
<br />
2. Define Matrix Definition (tdpcg0120m000)<br />
    Define the Field's sequencing.<br />
<br />
3. Define Price Matrix (tdpcg0130m000)<br />
    Select the Matrix Definition defined by you, and the PRICE BOOK to be used for the defined Attribute.<br />
    define the Exact Combination of Attributes on the Sales Attribute Tab.<br />
<br />
In this Similer way you can define the Discounting Matrix Also.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the information. That's what I did and there was no problem having different criteria and accordingly allocating different price books in the price matrices. But when an item was missed in the appropriate price book, default price book was referred by the system and that price was applied in sales orders. Those prices are way off the mark for these customers and users do not know until customer complains. <br />
<br />
I defined another price matrix for these customers with the lowest priority and linked the default price book(intentionally, though it is not desired) and applied zero as price factor. This way system is showing zero price in the orders if the price is picked from default price book which is the last priority for these customers. This will stop users applying wrong prices I believe.<br />
<br />

<br />
You are right, whenever system not founds any specific Price List for defined combination it will refer to the Default Price Book defined in Pricing Paramenter.<br />
<br />
You can handle your scenario by Keeping the Default Price List on ZERO Prices, if some BP didn't falls in the specified criteria, it will go to the Default one but will find only ZERO Price.<br />
<br />
And I suppose you have adopted the same method.<br />
