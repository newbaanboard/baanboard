<br />
I'm facing a big problem :<br />
I want to sale a product but my customer can buy a vanilla item or a customized one :<br />
Firstly I have to buy the vanilla product from my supplier if I don't already have it.<br />
To custom this product I have to buy a service to another supplier and send the product to this supplier to make the customization<br />
<br />
What is the best practice to do this with Baan IVc4 ?<br />
Since I have thousands products, I can't have two references per item (vanilla and customized) I would like to have one vanilla item and to be able to add a customization when needed.<br />
I can have two sale order lines like this :<br />
10 - Vanilla item<br />
20 - Customization<br />
<br />
but I can't stock the Customization since it depend on the vanilla item and how &quot;block&quot; the sale order until all lines are available ?<br />
And I have to buy the customization...<br />
<br />
Any idea ?</div></div><hr />
