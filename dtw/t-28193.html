Baan copies the delivered quantity and not the order quantity of the order line. This could be the reason.<br />

Please check the setting for &quot;Cumulate Receipts&quot; in the copy form. &quot;YES&quot; should solve your problem.<br />

What is the difference between orders which can be copied correctly and those who can't? Hard to give an advice with without knowing more details.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what does Baan say to this problem? Did you start a product inquiry (formerly know as 'case')?<br />
