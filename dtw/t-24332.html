<br />
Findings are:<br />
1: If a customized item is not appear in the project structure and also not in the project part, the field tipcs021.aoqc, after running tipcs3250m000, will become 1. Why it is so ? Why not become zero ?<br />
<br />
2: Imagine the following scenario. I have a customized item which is part of the product structure. The field tipcs021.aoqc is now equal to 5. I now set the quantity in the CBOM (tipcs022.qana) of this item to zero (accidentally or intentionally). After running  tipcs3250m000, the field tipcs021.aoqc remain unchanged. Is it an intent functionality and why?<br />
<br />
Hope someone can explain.</div></div><hr />

Baan Solution #124986 cause this.<br />

Have already fixed by Baan Solution #200491.<br />
<br />
But, both solution make the field tipcs021.aoqc to become 1 as your finding.<br />
It means Baan intent to do this. I wonder, in Baan's Concept, there would not happen for a system to recommend someone to order 0 qantity from a supplier. <br />
<br />
May be my though was wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just discovered another scenario that caused BaaN to calculate this field differently as what I expected.<br />
<br />
Imagine I have item A and the field tipcs021.aoqc was calculated correctly as 4 pieces.<br />
<br />
Now I create an item B and make item A as the child of item B. tipcs022.qana is entered as 1.<br />
<br />
I ran session tipcs3250m000. The field tipcs021.aoqc for item A is updated to 5 pieces (an increase equal to tipcs022.qana in the BOM of item B)<br />
<br />
Why this is calculated so ?  As item B is not part of the project part, why BaaN take this into consideration ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moon Lok</div><div class="date">24th June 2005, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">After thinking a long time. There have some question about your scenario.<br />
<br />
What is the usage/role of item B in your scenario as it is a BOM item in a project but not related to any project part and project structure.<br />
<br />
Of course, I also agreed that it is a defect of that session.<br />
<br />
Would like to know your answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">27th June 2005, 06:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Moon Lok,<br />
<br />
I agreed with you that item B should not in the project in normal situation.<br />
<br />
Item B is actually a dummy item in the project. Some of our projects is used to manufacture space parts. In the project parts, we have a long list of the space parts item code. We make a dummy BOM with the parent as item B and all the space parts item code maintained as the child of item B. Item A is just one of this.<br />
<br />
With this dummy BOM, all the items are linked and we can print out all the item easily with session Print Customized BOM(multilevel). This in turn help us to minotor the project easier.</div></div><hr />
