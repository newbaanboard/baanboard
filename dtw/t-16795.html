<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tgeorgiou</div><div class="date">13th October 2004, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Before the WH order the item inventory was like that:<br />
On Hand: 15.00<br />
On Order: 10.00<br />
Economic: 25.00 <br />
All other values are zero.<br />
<br />
By creating a Sales Order Manual (of type sales delivery) for 1.00  qty I get a message: Shortage has occurred and an Outbound shortage  of 1.00 qty. <br />
The Outbound order line status remains Open (I cannÂ’t go to advice and inventory transactions are not updated)<br />
<br />
Now the item inventory is:<br />
On Hand: 15.00<br />
On Order: 10.00<br />
Allocated: 1.00<br />
Economic: 24.00 <br />
All other values are zero.<br />
<br />
Could you give me a clue?<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
On hand: inventory level you actually own<br />
On order: incoming stock that hasn't yet arrived<br />
Allocated: outgoing stock that hasn't yet been shipped<br />
Economic = on hand + on order - allocated<br />

but what can produce an Allocated qty when OnHand qty is greater than ToBeSold (toBeConsumed in our case) qty???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tgeorgiou</div><div class="date">14th October 2004, 17:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Negative.<br />
Those values are from the specified warehouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smanohar</div><div class="date">22nd October 2004, 05:31</div></div><div class="posttext">When generating or creating outbound advice, the most important fields to be checked are:<br />
- The on-hand and allocated at the location level (whinr140 and whinr150 tables)<br />
- Location allocated field at the item level<br />
<br />
The system will look at the on-hand and location allocation, and does not care about (soft) allocation and on-order at the item and item/wrh level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tgeorgiou</div><div class="date">22nd October 2004, 09:15</div></div><div class="posttext">That was exactly the problem.<br />
Thank you for the reply.<br />
Those two tables had different values from item and item/wh tables.<br />
<br />
I created a pgm to correct the errors and balance all other tables according to whinr140 and 150 tables and everything fixed.<br />
<br />
Thank you again.</div></div><hr />

But, before running it in the update mode, make sure you get the approval from SSA / Baan Support.<br />
<br />
PS: whcor0200 is a like a strong sword. You can use it to take the weeds out or you would end up cutting yourself and let alone bleeding !!</div></div><hr />
