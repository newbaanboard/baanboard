<br />
This is regarding the session Approval List (tdpur2505m000) in BaanVC.<br />
<br />
I have a manager who responsible for two departments. As such, he will be responsible to approve the Purchase Requisition (PR) from two departments.<br />
 <br />
I manage to create him as approver for the first department. However, when I try to create the approval list for the second department for this manager, I got an error message “Effective Date Overlap”<br />
<br />
Other than using 2 different approver code (employee code), does anyone has a better suggestion.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is that it is not available in BaanVC either.</div></div><hr />
