<br />
I face a problem in the purchase order. When, after inserting the header of any purchse order, we inserting the line. In the Purchase order lines we inserting the Item Code, the price of that item automatically takes from the item master, if there any price variance, we rectify manually in the base.price field. But we wants to freeze this field.<br />
<br />
We wants that the purchse price pick only from item master, no one can change that price (means the curson jumps from that field to the next field).<br />
<br />
But, we wants for changing authorisation to few members for necessary changing.<br />
<br />
So, everyone request to please provide any suitable solution for this problem.<br />
<br />
Please help me.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards<br />

In Baan it is possible to give permissions by field for certain users, this can be the solution to your problem. You can avoid that certain users touch a field. In tools you have this option.</div></div><hr />

   Go to session Maintain Table Field Authorizations {ttaad4133m000} and then insert the username for whom you want to restrict the price field and choose the company number or all the companies depending on your setup. Next enter the field name &quot;tdpur041.pric&quot; in the space alloted for it and against it select authorization as &quot;Read&quot;. Save the entry &amp; click on Special menu and run &quot;Convert To Runtime Data Dictionary&quot; to commit the changes.<br />
<br />
The user will not be able to change the price thereafter in session Maintain Purchase Order Lines {tdpur4102s000}..<br />

<br />
But we wants that the price of any item can not enter manually in the PO line.<br />
<br />
As per your guideline i process the same in the system, but result is not as desired. Because, when we inserting the line the cursor is go on the BASE.PRICE field, the user easily can change the price.<br />
<br />
We wants the price of that item should be pickup from the item master (latest price).<br />
<br />
Please suggest what to be done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">15th April 2007, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Are we both referring to the same version of baan (Baan4c4)? If yes, then are we referring to the same field in purchase order lines, &quot;Price&quot; ? If the answer to both the questions are Yes...then the price field would neither be updatable nor the cursor would stop at that field after having done everything i had mentioned in my steps...<br />
<br />
If we are not talking about the same version or field, please do provide the correct details..<br />

<br />
Have you resolved the problem of blocking the updation of base.price field in the PO line session. We want to do the same in our organization.<br />
<br />
base.price is not a table field. Therefore we cann't use the ttaad4133m000 session. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
The principle of what Sukesh75 states is correct.<br />
<br />
All you need to do is determine which fields in which tables people can or cannot update.<br />
I think you need to consider locking off the item master price as well as the purchase order price, otherwise the purchase order can still be updated by changing the item master price.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you have a different parameter set?<br />
<br />
You could create a report that shows the price level. If not = &quot;item&quot;, then you know the user has modified the price.</div></div><hr />
