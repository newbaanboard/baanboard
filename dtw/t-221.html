<br />
There is a very small chance this maybe database related.  If you are using Oracle version 8.0.6.0.0, there is a known problem which results in calculations returning -ve values into tables.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jim Ritchie</div><div class="date">2nd October 2001, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">this can occur during cycle counting if you do not freeze transactions.<br />
1 When you genererate a cycle count baan stores the on hand value , lets say 10<br />
2 some issues 8 pieces for whatever reason oh now = 2<br />
<br />
3 your cycle count goes and counts 2 :- baan posts the delta 10-2=8 resulting in -6 even with neg inv not allowed.<br />
solution is to block during cycle counting.<br />
hope this helps<br />

Wts ur version we are on baan IV c4 and we have had the negative inventory problem for a long time. Though baan does not permit -ve inventory if the parameter is set to &quot;no&quot;, we have lots having -ve inventory.<br />
<br />
According to BGS this is a standard functionality problem and is being sorted out ....we have been given a huge patch to clear the same. but for already existing items we are using GTM as per instructions from Baan.<br />
<br />
Let me know how u resolved ur problem ??<br />
Can mail u the detailed procedure given to us by BGS<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">30th November 2001, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">As well as problems encountered if the warehouses are not blocked during cycle counting I have also seen negative inventory being created by replenishment order transactions trhough transit warehouses. The stock is correct in both the source and destination warehouses but seems to &quot;hang&quot; in the transit warehouse also leaving negative transactions. However in both cases tdinv0252m000 will identify and be used to clear these negatives. I have not yet had to resort to GTM to clear these.</div></div><hr />
