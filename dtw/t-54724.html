We have &quot;generate outbound advice&quot; as manual and release outbound advice + generate picking list as automatic order steps. There are 4 reports attached to 'generate picking list'. When I do the manual step 'generate outbound advice', system automatically runs the other two steps and prints a report related to 'generate picking list' session. However it always prints the second report in one company and the first report in another company which was newly created. How to make it print the second report automatically in the new company? Both the companies are in the same PVRC and there is no customization at program script level. Is there some setting at the form editor level or is there any parameter in warehousing module? Please note since the session is automatic there is no interactive pop-up to choose the prefered report. Thanks a lot.<br />
