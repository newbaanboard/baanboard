<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">24th March 2006, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">In the session tdpur1202m000 my users are experiencing a problem.  If they have a PO Inquiry with 20 lines and they proceed to copy the inquiry to a purchase order, there are times when instead of copying all 20 lines to one PO, it copies one line each to 20 new PO's.  This behavior is not consistant and we can't seem to reproduce it on demand.  We do use PCS projects as well as standard items, but that does not seem to make a difference.  In January of this year I submitted a Baan case but since we were unable to reproduce it on demand and since we were on SP13 upgrading to SP19 in February, support suggested that we wait and see if the SP upgrade fixed the issue.  It did not, so I submitted a second case.  We are again at a standstill because we cannot reproduce the problem on demand and of course everytime Baan support is watching it processes correctly.  <br />

Has anyone else had this problem.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />
