<br />
   We are implementing location control and now the shop floor control order can generate the outbound advice as we expect. However , when user report porduction oder by mistake, we need to pick material back. Could you advise me how to do it  ?<br />
<br />
   In our system , we only implement the location in receipt warehouse and WIP warehouse will not implement the location . Also in BOM, all compoent' warehouse will be maintained with WIP warehouse. <br />
  For example, if we maintain 200 shop floor order in Baan and user report this shop floor order in Baan, 200 set of material are consumed . Later on user found that they maintain shop floor order by mistake, they need to change order qty to 100. As a result, we need pick 100 set of material back.<br />
  How can we do achieve that  ?<br />
<br />
  Your support is great appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Be sure to zero out the Subsequent Delivery if you are not going to outbound more.  Go to Maintain Outbound and enter each line individually with a negative quantity.  When all return lines have been entered then you have to Release Outbound.  Outbound will not be generated automatically for negative lines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Is any feasible that outbound can generated automatically for each line individly instead of maintaining each line with negative quantity manually?</div></div><hr />
