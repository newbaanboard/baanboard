<br />
This is related to ERP LN 6.1 FP2.<br />
<br />
Please note that we have situation as follows,<br />
<br />
1)We sell various components to our dealers.<br />
2)There is this particular Customer who purchases various components from us. He has got good track record &amp; pays on time.<br />
3)But now for a particular XX component, the orders are getting booked in big lot by this particular Customer.<br />
4)Doing big business is alright, but we dont want to sell beyond limit to this particular Customer. We want to evenly distribute our product in different segment, and hence overbooking of the order by this particular Customer is hampering our plans.<br />
5)We want to set a target of 100 pieces of this XX component Sell to this Partcular Customer within a fixed timeframe say 6 months starting from 1st January 2008.<br />
6)The system should not allow to book Sales Order beyond the set target for this  Component XX for this particular Customer only, during the set time frame.<br />
7)Also the sales price got changing every month for every lot &amp; hence Sales Contract is not working out.<br />
8)Also we dont mind this Particulat Customer buying other products in big lot. But we want to restrict the sell of this Particular Component XX to this Customer.<br />
<br />
How should I set this in ERP LN system ? Its very important for our business scenario. Please help. Thank you.<br />

<br />
You can make a contract for this particular XX item for period 01.01.08 to 01.06.08 , Only you have to change price while preparing sales order from contract.(Any way you are going to put different price for different sale order for this item)<br />
Also you have to set parameter for Action on exceeding maximum quantity as HOLD or INTERACTIVE, so that system will inform you that you have reached to max quantity.<br />
<br />
Hope this will work for you.</div></div><hr />
