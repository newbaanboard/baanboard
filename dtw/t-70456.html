<br />
we have some items with the meaning of costs (e.g. costs for repair hours, costs for Transportation). These items were created some time ago as Item Type &quot;Purchased&quot; and should now be corrected to &quot;Costs&quot;.<br />
<br />
tiitm0101m000 does not allow such a change, even if there were no bookings at all. But we have bookings, indeed.<br />
<br />
So, the only way to correct would be ttaad4100.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />
<br />

Doing GTM correction is not a standard/best practice always.</div></div><hr />

I would save if you never did anything with the part then table maintenance would be okay, but with your system having it greyed out I would not recommend that - unless you can test it all the way thru in a test system.  Enough to make sure it does not cause any issues going forward.</div></div><hr />
