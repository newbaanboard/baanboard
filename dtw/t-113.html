It seems as if it is has updated the price on the last line and taken the order number for the first line of the invoice! has anyone seen this problem earlier? <br />
other related observations/ questions:<br />
1) ascii file 810.6 seems to be zero bytes all the time though it should be carrying the sales order lines?!<br />
2) tdsls480 seem to show price of only 1 line: eg there are 2 lines 1st line with amount 96 and 2nd line with amt 3. <br />
the table shows only 96!<br />
3) tdsls482 does not show any reference to the second invoice line at all!<br />
<br />
has anyone seen this happening earlier?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

If not have you also tested the standard?<br />
<br />
If you say information is missing in the table tdsls480 this means that it cannot send this info in the 810.2 file anyway. Perhaps a bug?<br />
<br />
Are you also sending invoices using ICM messages? If so is the icminv.hdr OK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason</div><div class="date">30th August 2001, 09:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not working with EDI anymore and when I did I didn't experience any problems with the 810 messages or get into the detail too much. <br />
<br />
I did find that Baan support improved considerably as far as getting good people who understand the issues. They have dedicated EDi and e-commerce people you can talk to (as long as you use X12 - they often refuse to get involved with ICM - saying it's not being developed anymore so if you want support you first have to change!). <br />
<br />
If your testing and this site doesn't come up with a quick solution I would talk to those EDI guys at Baan. Thumbs up for improvement for Baan in that department.<br />
<br />
If you use any ICM at all (say internally) and the invoices are fine it might be possible to temporarily use the ICMINV even though you use X12 855, 856 etc. for the same relation.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your testing and let us know the solution - unless someone comes up with it on the Baanboard.</div></div><hr />
