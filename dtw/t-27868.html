<br />
Good morning everybody,<br />
<br />
I have a difficult situation here...<br />
<br />
We want to use an item in many position with one code only, not to create another item.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
We have ItemX which consists of ItemA, ItemB, and ItemC<br />
<br />
the four Items can be bought.<br />
ItemX can be enter the warehouse as one unit or disassembled to its component.<br />
<br />
the four Items can be reselled and are used in service.<br />
<br />
ItemA, B and C can be used as tools in service.<br />
<br />
ItemX is being sold as bought (one unit), But in some cases, it must be disassembled to get ItemA,B and C from it.<br />
<br />
Also itemX can be assembled in our warehouse.<br />
<br />
One Other point is that we might want to transfer any Item to be a tool.<br />
<br />
any idea to solve this situation...<br />
<br />
All help appreciated</div></div><hr />

1. Create Item X as phantom and then define A,B, C its components.<br />
<br />
One can always sell Phatom or component whatever the situation demands.<br />
If you want to create Item A, B and C from X then I would create a rework order for ItemX and it would call from Item X, Item A, Item B and ItemC. Item A, B and C would have negatibe quantity. When material is issued, it would decrement the stock of Item X and increment A, B and C.<br />
<br />
You may have to do some customization, in order to make process smoother. Bit I don't see any issue, here. I guess in Baan V you may be able to better.</div></div><hr />
