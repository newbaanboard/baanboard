<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">5th November 2008, 09:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
            Earlier this week, we encountered a weird problem with one of the blocked item codes that got accidentaly issued against a production order.<br />
The scenario that led to this problem is as follows:<br />
We have a material (ItemX) that is being used to produce ProductA.<br />
Now during the course of some rectification process, ItemX was blocked from being used in all modules (Purchase, Sales, Requisition, Production Issue &amp; Process Issue) with the help of a signal code. <br />
However (as is with all man made problems) no one bothered to replace this item code in the std BOM and in due time a production order was made for ProductA.<br />
<br />
The structure for ProductA in the production order was:<br />
Item1  100nos (on hand 120)<br />
ItemX  200nos (on hand 250) &lt;blocked&gt;<br />
Itemy    60nos (on hand 100)<br />
<br />
On completion of this production order, the materials were issued using &quot;Issue Inventory&quot; option. No message popped up during this process for the blocked item but if you clicked on the position that ItemX was in, then you get a message suggesting that its blocked.<br />
<br />
Trouble:<br />
On finding some anomalies between Inventory reports and our cst001 based reports we looked into the related tables.<br />
<br />
In table ticst001, it shows 200nos of ItemX was issued <br />
(untill then, i thought system wouldn't let you issue blocked items and so finding this entry was strange but somewhat normal considering the other tables). <br />
<br />
The surprise however was in the inventory tables (tdinv). In table tdinv700 it showed 200nos of Item1 has been issued (against the production order) and the field &quot;Inventory after transaction&quot; is showing negative stock. <br />
<br />
Apart from this table, tdinv001 is now showing negative inventory for the combination of Item1 &amp; Warehouse. tdinv750 and 760 are also reflecting this issue for Item1. In all these tables, ItemX had not been touched at all.<br />
<br />
How does this happen???? <br />
We do have a restriction in place to prevent users from accessing any item in itm001 that has a signal code but there is no restriction placed on any other table. Could anyone explain how this could happen? <br />
<br />
Looking forward to your replies..<br />
