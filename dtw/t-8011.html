<br />
When I am trying to save a purchase order header I am getting a message &quot;Unable to retrieve local and reporting currency rates for currency INR, exchage rate PUR, invoice to BP SAN&quot; where INR is my reference and local currency, PUR is exchange rate type for purchase and SAN is the business partner with INR currency.<br />
<br />
The Order is in INR. Local Currency is INR, reporting currency 1 is USD and 2 is INR.<br />
<br />
The exchange rate between INR and USD is defined and currency system is dependent<br />

  Check the purchase order date &amp; time and the currency rates efective date &amp; time.The possibility is that the currency rates are maintained after rasing the purchase order header form 1 with current date &amp; time(ie the currency rate is not back dated).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the suggestion but that is not the case since the PO date is after the effective date of the currencies<br />

<br />
If you have a dependent currency system then you can enter rates from reference currency to the other currencies. <br />
With your rate type the rate should be present from transaction currency to the reference currency.<br />
<br />
However if you have more than 1 home currency, also the rates should be defined with internal rate type (the rate type which you can find on your company data (tcemm1170m000)) to the other home currencies. Maybe you can check whether those rates from reference currency to the other home currencies are defined with internal rate type.<br />
