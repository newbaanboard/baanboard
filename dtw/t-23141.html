Fatal error : Can not continue in tdsls4101s000 in DLL: otdsls401 ()[exec dll  function]<br />
<br />
Also I have some anothe messages in this sessions and all of them touch this file - dll4101.dll or tdslsdll4101.dll - I don't know exactly.<br />

I think this is problem with price but I don't know in what place.<br />

<br />
It is difficult to tell reason without actually seeing the exact setup</div></div><hr />

I am guessing that you have an incorrect version of the 401 library or maybe there is an issue with permissions.<br />
<br />
If this just started happening overnight, it could be the result of a solution install, or somebody is messing where they shouldn't be a-messing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ooo-nik</div><div class="date">16th February 2005, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your answers. As I understood I have incorrect installation. I have some bugs in system. <br />
<br />
But in this moment I have no possibility to reinstall my system  :(  . I'm looking for decision how to correct my BaanERP without new installation. I have loop in inheritance. Can I correct it or I must to do new installation?</div></div><hr />
