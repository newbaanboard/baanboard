<br />
We have several warehouse orders of type Transfer with the same warehouse from/to and with the same order type with automatic issue/receive procedures. When we run the &quot;Direct Release&quot; command the shipments are created; every single shipment has its own preliminary delivery note (ie it's not the same for all shipments). Therefore for every single shipment Ln generates a different Load...<br />
<br />
How can we set up a scenario in which we can automatically have multiple shipments on a single Load (or with single Preliminary Delivery Note)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the replies! :)</div></div><hr />
