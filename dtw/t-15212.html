does anybody faced this problem already:<br />
<br />
There is no commission calculated for orders with a total amount of zero. This leads to severe problems when reusing the order number: the status of the record in tdcms040 remains &quot;Free&quot;. Due to this status it never gets deleted by session &quot;Print and/or Delete Commissions/Rebates&quot; (tdcms0251m000). Once the ordernumber is reused the new record in tdsls040 is linked to the old record in tdcms040. The automatic link process fails (I would expect an error message like &quot;Duplicate Value in tdcms040&quot;).<br />
<br />
CMS Parameters <br />
Commission Calculation Method : Invoice<br />
Linking of Relations on : Order<br />
Link Relations to Orders : Automatically<br />
Search for Commission Based on Date: Invoice Date<br />
<br />
Any clue?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">4th May 2004, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I had similar problems with tdcms041.<br />
There were thousands of records that would never be processed into commissions (because of master data set up errors), and they had a status of 'free' in the table.<br />
<br />
I wrote a simple delete routine that cycled through tdcms041 and confirmed that no commission would ever be paid on those order lines, and then deleted the records from the table.<br />
<br />
I would recommend that you do something similar.<br />
<br />
Removing the non-commissionable entries from these tables can greatly decrease the processing time of 'calculate commissions'.<br />

<br />
actually this was what we did to fix the problem for the current order series. I was hoping that Baan has a standard solution for this problem already :( <br />
