<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Clarke</div><div class="date">9th May 2002, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">We are having an issue when transferring inventory from one logistic company to another logistic company within the same financial company.<br />
<br />
Our main objective is to transfer this inventory from one of these logistic companies to the other without any finacial impact other than decreasing the inventory in the primary company and increasing the inventory in the secondary company.  The inventroy value should transfer to the other logistic company withount anyone incurring any costs or revenue.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone out there who can help me on this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
    Stephen</div></div><hr />

<br />
(In case you are on BaanIV) you should use in this situation the inter company sales and purchase orders \based on internal EDI\ and you will have to set the Intercompany Transactions and Intercompany Processing Data in Finance. These settings will enable the system to distinguish the intercompany relations from external sales and purchases made by the logistic companies. <br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
