<br />
There is location &quot;X&quot; which shows location occupied field yes (in tdilc001), eventhough there is no inventory in the location. Baan's other standard display and print sessions are showing no inventory.<br />
<br />
But how come this field is showing yes? Is it a known baan bug?<br />
<br />
System is Baan IV C4<br />

<br />
tdilc0211m000<br />
<br />
If it is blocked for all transactions, it will not be able to even recalculate this, and that seems to be the bug part.  Unblock to recalculate this option, then reblock if needed.<br />
<br />
This was on Baan IV - not sure but probably very different in Baan V.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This session might solve the issue, but I would also like to know why this happens to few locations at times? Are there any specific conditions under which this is known to happen? This helps me in convincing the user.<br />

Sol. 72084:  location occupied not reset when the full received quantity was rejected at approval and the location becomes empty</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ran tdilc0211m000 session but it nothing is changed. Bloack for all transactions os NO but still this session is not recalculating. Any idea why this session is not doing the processing?<br />
<br />
Is there any other correction session?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes I have the same problem but I use tdilc0211m000 and it recalculates the right value of the field tdilc001.oclo<br />
<br />
Do you have installed solution 162037stnd?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">16th September 2004, 13:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for that slip.<br />
It is baan iv b4 and i think service packs are for versions above C.<br />
but this session tdilc0211m000 is not working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srinivas</div><div class="date">16th September 2004, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a look at the script.<br />
It is checking whether location is of infinite capacity and if it is &quot;yes&quot; then it is not doing anything.<br />
And since my location was set to &quot;yes&quot; for infinite capacity it is not doing anything.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me whether baan has updated/modified the way this session is working in B4?</div></div><hr />
