<br />
I would like to set up a commission/rebate  structure for business partners.<br />
<br />
The structure is, we have about four levels at each level the business partner receives a % commission. <br />
<br />
However, we would like the total commission/rebate  to be  received by the business partner at level zero and not the parents. <br />
<br />
eg  BP1000001 is the parent and gets 2%<br />
      BP1000002 is child of above and gets 5%<br />
      BP1000003 is child of above two and gets 3%<br />
and BP1000004 is the lowest level receives 10 %<br />
<br />
the way we want the set up is for BP100004 to receive 20%       (ie 2+5+3+10) and the parents acting as dummies.<br />
<br />
Is this possible on Baan and if so how ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

is there any reason that you would like to have the other business partners (the dummies) in the structure? To you have a link to Finance?<br />

<br />
The reason for the structure is so that we do not have to change rates for all business oartners when a change is require. We can just make a change at the appropriate level.<br />
<br />
We need to link the zero level business partners to finance.<br />

<br />
well I think it's possible to set up a structure you like to have. There a several possibilities to proceed. In the first step you can set the % for the dummies to zero and only the final level to 20%. Or you simply delete the calculated commission/rebates manually for those levels you don't like to pay anything.<br />
<br />
In the master data each relation can be assigned to a parent relation. That's the way you build up the structure. A similiar thing can be done with the agreements: an agreement can be declared as a child agreement. Both methods can be combined with each other. This may end in a jungle of links to calculate the commission/rebate. My advice: keep it simple! By the way, the Baan online help is not to bad in this module - really ;).<br />
<br />
If you need further informations, please let me know how the parameters are set for CMS. We are on Baan IVc4.<br />
