<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abattoir</div><div class="date">1st May 2013, 23:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Gary,<br />
I have attached the copy of logic present in code for this session....<br />
|* IMPORTANT :This session should be run only once for particular set of records<br />
|*<br />
|* LOGIC OF CORRECTION PROGRAM:<br />
|*<br />
|* Before the solution 70971 ( DF 79168 ), during Release Outbound data on<br />
|* multiple orders ( with atleast one ship complete order ), double entry has<br />
|* taken place for tdinv700 for the last line of ship complete order. After that<br />
|* customer has made cycle counting order to correct the inventory. But, the<br />
|* wrong entry in the tdinv700 table has resulted in wrong calculation during<br />
|* MPS run, because the MPS at present does not take records of type warehouse<br />
|* order.<br />
|*<br />
|* This correction program is written to correct the entries in the tdinv700<br />
|* table so that MPS gives correct result.<br />
|*<br />
|* At present the records in tdinv700 in the customer system is as follows for<br />
|* example:<br />
|*<br />
|* 	Order Type	Seq.No	Qty	Qty after Transaction<br />
|*<br />
|* 1	Sales Delivery	1	10	100133	........Correct one<br />
|* 2	Sales Delivery	2	10	100123	........Incorrect entry<br />
|* 3	WH Order	0	10	100133	........Due to cycle counting<br />
|*<br />
|* Then,the additional records that are added in tdinv700 by this correction<br />
|* program are:<br />
|*<br />
|* 1	Sales Delivery	3	-10	100133<br />
|* 2	WH Oder		4	-10	100123<br />
|*<br />
|* Record 1:	Copy of Sequence number 1 with sequence number increased by 1<br />
|*		and quantity multiplied by -1 and inventory after transaction<br />
|*		must be increase by that quantity.<br />
|* Record 2:	Copy of Sequence number 1 with sequence number increased by 2;<br />
|*		transaction = inventory adjustment; order type = warehouse order<br />
|*		and order number is determined based on first free number for<br />
|*		cycle count orders; postion number =1 and relation = empty and<br />
|*		quantity multiplied by -1 and inventory after transaction is the <br />
|*		same as sequence number 1.<br />
|*<br />
