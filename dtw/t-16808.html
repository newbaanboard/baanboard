<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">14th October 2004, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">In Baan IV, the generated edi messages have different statuses and one of them is Read by Relation. All of our messages are at status 'Sent to PC' and I was wondering if it is possible to read back the Functional Acknoweldgment sent by our parters and update this status. I read in the EDI manual for BaanERP 5.0 c about EDI message 977 but couldn't find any thing on that for Baan IV. Does any body have any information on that? Does any body have implemented it in their system? Does Baan provide standard setup for this message or we would have to create our own?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the Direct network session is used to genarate EDI messages and Semaphore file processing is used by the third party EDI transaltion software to pick those generated files then the status will be Read by Relation.<br />
<br />
The Functional Acknowledgements are being recevied by us in the RIP N READ format through emails. It is not integrated to BaaN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Flag &quot;send to PC&quot;  is use if you have a &quot;EDI Station translator&quot; to connect to the network<br />
But it's not necessary. It's possible to use the EDI and not the semaphore file<br />
<br />
The semaphore, it's use for de connection with the EDI station but not with the communication with the final relation.<br />
