<br />
Isn´t there any Mask for Purchase Order in wich i can directly place an item wich i want to order? The way Baan does is to tell the System from wich Bussinues Partner i would like to buy and then place the positions.<br />
We are searching for a solution to let´s say fast catch the needs and place them in multiple orders without directly having the knowledge of the Buisiniss Partner.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?`<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<br />
in releases like LN purchase requisitions have been introduced: The purchase requisition procedure is designed for the non-purchasing user (someone who may not know the standard procedures in purchasing). For example, engineers can order material and/or services, but they do not need to understand the entire purchasing process to do so.<br />
On a requisition, the item code and buy-from business partner codes can be blank. This difference means that the requester can make a request for a new item or make a request from a new buy-from business partner.<br />
Later the requisition can be turned into a purchase order or request for quotation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobs_liang2002</div><div class="date">15th November 2004, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe you can set the field &quot;Direct Ord. Line Entry&quot;= Yes in session &quot;tdpur4213m000:Maintain Defaults by User&quot;. <br />
<br />
The user can just goto the line entry session when maintain purchase orders.There the only thing he would do is selecting a supplier and the items he wantto buy.<br />
<br />
hope to be helpful</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smanohar</div><div class="date">16th November 2004, 23:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Starting for B5.0x and above, you have &quot;Order Input Controls&quot; where you can decide which fields you want the user to input and other fields will be defaulted automatically. In that way, they don't have to tab through fields.<br />
<br />
Check the session &quot;Purchase Order Type - Input Controls&quot; (tdpur0195m000)</div></div><hr />
