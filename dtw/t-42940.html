<br />
Please check in the table tdind017, tdsls901 after the decimal, if values are in more than 2 digit please round it off to the 2 digit and try to post the transaction.<br />
<br />
I feel that there will be a problem in tdind017 in line amount field. Please check both the table.<br />

I also check the both tables, but problem was the sales tax code.<br />
<br />
We insert the sales tax code for invoicing at 0% in all related tables, then execute the pdso, it was succussful run.<br />
