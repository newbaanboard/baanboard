<br />
I am trying to set a value in an incoming EDI sales order which will set the field tdsls401.dltp (delivery type) to 5 - Direct Delivery. i have tried entering 5 and 05 but the field is ignored, it doesn't even appear in the trace file. I don't have any examples of how enumerated fields should be recieved in an EDI file either, or that would give me a clue. <br />
<br />
I'm doing a migration of sales orders from Baan IV to LN and it would be nice to have this.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest something please. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
on a short view I think the problem is that the field tdsls401.dltp &quot;Delivery Type&quot; is not a part of the standard EDI set-up and therefore not defined in the responsible library tdslsdll4280 &quot;Receive sales orders from EDI&quot;. If the field is added to the conversion set-up it will simply ignored during the processing of the incoming EDI orders.<br />
