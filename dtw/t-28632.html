<br />
I need a little help to verify the following in standard baan.<br />
<br />
Please select a existing SO and use the copy sales order session to create a new SO by selecting the option copy all sales order lines. Now don't close the Copy Sales Order session, copy the same old sales order to another new SO but this time select the option copy only sales order header. Now close the copy session and check the second order (i.e. the one that had the option of creating only SO header). Go to SO Lines - do you see any SO Lines there. I do see one line here in my system and I know the copy SO session is highly customized here, but I don't have a company attached to Baan Standard Update VRC:eek: <br />
<br />
Appreciate your time in testing this for me. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">9th November 2006, 20:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Please note that both the new SO should be created with single launch of the Copy Sales Order session...Don't close the Copy session after copying the first SO and the SO should be copied in the same sequence. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just did a quick check with standard software: you're right, a line is added to the second sales order despite opting for only copying the header and even though I receive a message that 0 lines have been added to the new sales order. Seems like a defect in the standard software to me.<br />

I'll log an inquiry with Infor. Can't believe even after these many years and so many service packs, we still have these kind of defects.</div></div><hr />
