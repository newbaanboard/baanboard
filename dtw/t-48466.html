<br />
Has any one ACTUALLY used Alternative item. I already read the details and other thread.<br />
<br />
My situation is -[ y is alternate to x item] we hv sale order for 'x', and only at the time of delivery we will come to know...whether we can deliver x or y. I cannot tell the sales team to change y item in SO at the time of delivery. orders are in huge numbers.<br />
<br />
Precisely - &gt; I would like to know whether LN has the functionality  at the time of delivery ,can we  deliver alternate item without disturbing any order. Also I look for.. can we ignore whether the main item is there or not. Means... customer has ordered for 1 kg pack. I have 1 kg pack as well 0.5 kg pack, [ since 0.5 kg is non-moving.. i want to push 2 nos 0.5 kg against 1 kg... and my customer has no problem to receive in any size.<br />
<br />
thx<br />
