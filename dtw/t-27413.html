<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruan Snyman</div><div class="date">21st June 2006, 12:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to find out how the standard routes of the freight management module works (LN)...currently I'm setting up a route from warehouse A, to B, to C, as well as the distances between the 3 warehouses. However if I do a transfer from warehouse A to C, it asks me to specify the distance from A to C. But I don't want the carrier to go directly from A to C (thus the time selection and distance is shorter than I want it to be), rather from A via B to C. How does this work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotjens</div><div class="date">27th June 2006, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Define the standard route with addresses for A, B, and C, <br />
define the distances from A - B and B - C and <br />
indicate on the order that the specific route is to be used.<br />
If so the calculation for the total of A-B and B-C should kick in. <br />
Maybe not for you but for some other user it might be valid to be able to choose between a direct shipment from A - C and using the standard route that stops at all three. If for example there would be a rush order the direct connection between A and C might be preferable.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I do not want to indicate on the order what standard route needs to be used, because I am using the load planning function of the system. If I specify a route, it will overwrite the planning function. What the system does is that when you enter a warehouse transfer order, it checks the distance tables for a direct distance between say warehouses A &amp; C. If there is none set-up, you can not go on with the order. BUT I want to use my standard routes as set-up beforehand. As I have worked out the distances for myself, the system looks at it like follow:<br />
<br />
Standard Route A-to-B-to-C = distance from (A to B) + (B to C) = distance from (A to C)...thus the distance from A-to-C that I need to specify need to include ALL individual distances?? Agree??</div></div><hr />
