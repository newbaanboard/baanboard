<br />
A Sales Order was already printed but the status in the session &quot;Display Sales Order Lines Status&quot; (tdsls4533m000), remains ready for &quot;Print Order Acknowledgment&quot;. Hence we cannot move to the next order step.<br />
<br />
User has a printed copy (hard copy) of the affected Sales Order to evidence that the SO was indeed printed, but the SO line status was not updated to the next order step, and remained ready for &quot;Print Order Acknowledgment&quot;. By executing again the session &quot;Print Order Acknowledgment&quot; (tdsls4401m000) the Sales Order Line status was changed.<br />
<br />
How could that be? Is it possible for the sales order status of an already printed SO to change back to its previous status when something was done in the SO header or lines?<br />
<br />
Looking forward for your usual assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the answer to either of the above is Yes, then the &quot;Particular Line&quot; status will be reverted back to Print Order Acknowledgements.<br />

<br />
Did anyone add any extra lines in the sales order once the acknowledgement was printed?<br />
<br />
<br />
May be I dint understood the above statement, we always see status by Sales Order Line rather than Sales Order wise.<br />
<br />
so even if somebody would have added a new line i.e. pos. 20 keeping old line intact i.e. pos. 10, it should not affect pos. 10 at all.<br />

  Its true what you said and i never said the status was order wise..What i meant was if someone added an extra line then there would be a new entry which would show as print order acknowledgement. The thread talked nothing about how many lines were there and if all the lines were showing the same status and therefore i had to  throw in couple of scenarios. The second scenario i talked about was if someone deleted position 20(to quote your example) and entered it again as position 20 then the status would revert back to Print Order Acknowledgement...<br />
<br />
I hope this answers your confusion...<br />
