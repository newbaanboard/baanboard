As we can check for the inventory in the session Display Inventory by item in INV for Standard Items. Where can we check in the same way for customized item? ILC is not implemented.<br />

although you have not implemented ILC you may use this session. Did you try it?<br />

I came across this old posting. We do not have ILC implemented. I'm using the session tdilc1520 (Display Inventory by Customized item). It is possible to see the inventory by project by customized item. However, if you zoom to tdilc1519s000 (Display Inventory by item and location) - you cannot see the inventory by warehouse. I assume that is because we do not have ILC implemented? If we did have ILC implemented - can you please confirm that it is is possible to view inventory for customized items by warehouse?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

   It would be a bad idea to implement Location Control just to see inventory of customized item by warehouse. Location Control brings with it additional administrative headaches and certain change in the flow of data. If my understanding of a project is right, then each project is nothing but a new item with a new warehouse. Warehouse X in a standard item and in a customized items are two different entities even if they share the same name which, i guess you already know. The same is applicable to Warehouse X in Project 1 and Project 2. Baan treats it as  separate entities because of which, i presume, there is no session to see inventory of customized items by warehouse. <br />
<br />
If you still want to see the inventory of customized items by warehouse, i suggest you create something outside baan like through some reporting or query tool..<br />
