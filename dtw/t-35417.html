<br />
We are using consignmet (owned) stock in ERP LN 6.1 FP3 .<br />
I replanish own inventory in a customers warehouse with SO of type Consignment Replenishment which translates in a warehouse order of inventory transaction type Transfer. <br />
Now I am trying to reduce this inventory in Consignment (owned) warehouse, by creating a SO of type Consignment Invoicing which has as activities both Release Sales Orders to Warehousing  and Maintain Deliveries Sales Order Lines sessions which are mandatory (I tried to delete them but I cant), but I cannot execute both. either one of them is executed <br />
On SO line, Delivery type is Invoicing (not Warehouse), in Sales Order Line Status session the first activity is Release SalesOrders to Invoicing which is correct, but when I try to do this the system gives me this error: Order line cannot be relesed. Awaiting delivery!! What delivery? The line must be invoiced only!<br />
And it is very strange becouse as I understand this type of SO reduces the inventory<br />
<br />
Could anybody help me with this?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

So in the sales order line status session you should see 'release sales order to Warehousing'. Like it is defined in activities per ordertype.<br />
So if you miss the activity in the status session then it looks like corrupted data.<br />
