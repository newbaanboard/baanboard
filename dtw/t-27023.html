<br />
Can anyone provide a suggested solution to the following scenario:<br />
<br />
I have a supplier supplying two warehouses within the same logistic company which are in different time zones.  Each warehouse has its own purchase office and cuts its own purchase orders to replenish.<br />
<br />
For metric purposes the delivery date and TIME are used on the purchase order for JIT replenishment and to measure suppliers.  <br />
<br />
Warehoue A located in the US in CST time zone cuts a purchase order for part Widget and has a delivery date and TIME of 05-05-06   0700 CST.<br />
<br />
Warehouse B located in the US in EST time zone cuts a purchase order for part Widget and has a delivery date and TIME of 05-05-06    0700 EST.<br />
<br />
I expect the supplier to supply each warehouse at the correct date and time based on the time zone.<br />
<br />
I'm using EDI to send out 850's.  Currently, the 850's do not have time zone in the file out.  Let's say I do an enhancement to include the time zone on the 850 out.<br />
<br />
Baan only allows me to have 1 EDI network per EDI message supported by Business partner.  Any suggestions how I can send out 850's for the same business partner with different time zone requirements?<br />
<br />
Of course I would like to use Batch jobs to automate the network communication.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any ideas.</div></div><hr />

If order types are same, use the delivery address code.</div></div><hr />
