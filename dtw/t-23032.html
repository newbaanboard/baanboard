<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VilasoorRavi</div><div class="date">31st January 2005, 21:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We buy metal sheets in coil form.  In BaaN, storage unit for this is kg while inventory unit is metres. A standard conversion of kg per meter has been defined for each inventory item.  In one consignment many coils are received.  Though BaaN converts quantity received into inventory unit bazsed on the standard conversion, BaaN accepts the actual inventory unit for each coil(coil has been defined as a lot, as each coil has a unique number and there should be traceability from the finished product to the coil)-this could vary from the standard due to density and thickness variations within the tolerances-but the supplier measures the actual length of each coil at the time of manufacturing and mentions it in the packing of each coil, along with the weight.<br />
<br />
My question is:  If BaaN accepts the actual inventory units for a coil of a given weight, each coil being defined as a lot, does it not also keep track of the conversion rate(worked out automatically based on the input storage unit and inventory unit e.g. storage unit 1000kg=std 200 metres, actual 205 metres) for each lot and use it in accounting for issues?  Is there any parameter to be set to enable BaaN to do this, if at all BaaN can do this?<br />
<br />
Would appreciate an early reply.</div></div><hr />

It was a firm that made software exactly for the market you are mentioning, with terms like coils, sheets, tolerances, etc.<br />
Early 2000 Baan took over Proloq.<br />
We called the software Baan Dimensions. <br />
It is an extension to the Baan IV product<br />
I think you need the Baan Dimensions software.<br />
I think you can still buy it from SSA.<br />
