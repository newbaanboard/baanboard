<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChrisV</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to find pre-built conversion setups other than the standard EDI transaction sets that come default with Baan (810, 820, 850, 855, etc)?<br />
<br />
Specifically, I'm looking for an 867 Product Transfer and Resale Report.  <br />
<br />
I'm hoping I can find something to just import this setup into Baan without having to build it from scratch.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcondon</div><div class="date">20th November 2002, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">The only other EDI maps that are currently available are in the sch0/1 (supply chain) and nas0 (NA automotive supply chain)extensions. These are the 824, 830, 843, 846, 861, 862, 866. The 867 is not currently supported. <br />
<br />
Even if someone did have a conversion setup written, you will obviously require a BAAN DLL to process it. <br />
<br />
The only other thing I could suggest is that if the report is outbound, you could write a session to pull the data from BAAN and output it in an EDI format (or something similar). <br />
<br />
If the report is inbound, but not required to update anything functionally in BAAN, then simply read in the 867 report from the VAN, and set up a session / script to format it and email to the appropriate person. I have done that at several clients with strictly informational EDI messages not supported functionally by BAAN.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
