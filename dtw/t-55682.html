<br />
i.e.<br />
tdsls040.cdel - No conversion found for data 2383101 (92) in table tcedi310<br />
tdsls040.cdel - Delivery Address not found<br />
<br />
<br />
So far I have checked following things:<br />
<br />
1.	Mapping to the BAAN table field (tdsls040.cdel) and conversion with BAAN table tcedi310<br />
<br />
2.	For conversion the qualifier “92” (i.e. code for delivery addresses for the organization) must be used as qualifier 1 and “DP” must be used as qualifier 2 in tcedi501 behind the field tdsls040.cdel.<br />
<br />
What else I should check?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

You may have already found out what your issue could be, but I thought I would post a reply just in case. <br />
<br />
In Maintain Definitions and Conversion Setups for your EDI message, go to the .cdel field.  You are defining on form one what position the code is in.  However, I wonder how you filled out form 2.  For the .cdel field enter and on form 2 for that line, enter the position where the code &quot;92&quot; is.  Then enter &quot;92&quot; in the Qualifier 1 default field.  <br />
<br />
I'm not an expert with EDI, but I know we have had th issue before too.  I just thought I'd offer up this information.<br />
<br />
We are on Baan IVc4 NAS0 extersion, but I think your session looks the same as ours.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
