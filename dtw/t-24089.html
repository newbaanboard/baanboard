<br />
The first $5,000 should be taxed at 7% then 6% therafter.  <br />
<br />
We have setup the Tax code to handle this.  <br />
<br />
However, say we enter the order for a total of $7,000 and there is more than one line item.  The first line item is $3,000 the 7% is applied correctly, the second line is $3,000 - $2,000 should be taxed the 7% then the other $1,000 should be 6%.  Finally, the last line item for $1,000 should have the 6% applied.  The way it is working now is it's just applying the 7% to all lines.  <br />
<br />
If we enter one line for $7,000 then the tax is applied correctly $5,000 at 7% and the rest at 6%.<br />
<br />
How can we get the system to acknowledge that we already shipped $3,000 or whatever and once we've shipped the $5,000 on the order to switch to the 6% tax?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I don't think Baan standard tax works based on what yu want. You will need to system modifcation, but can be tricker for e.g<br />
of the first line is for $5,000 and second line is $3,000 what tax rate would you apply to second line- 6% or 7%. Once you figure out ur requirement, it may be a little bit of modification<br />
