<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We have this setup in baan4c4 supply chain I have not seen baan 5 so I don't know how different it is. <br />
<br />
on 4c4 create a sales contract then a sales schedule for the contract and if required a shipping schedule, then use automatically create planned deliveries.<br />
<br />
The generated orders can be changed in maintain planned deliveries, then released to in preperation, confirm planned deliveries and print advice. <br />
<br />
The sales orders are generated at the confirm planned deliveries stage.<br />
<br />
We now create the planned deliveries using a flat file and exchange scheme to populate the tables as the generated orders didn't always match what we were shipping to save having to  type the changes in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Also make sure you know the precedence Baan uses when generating sales orders.  I believe that if there is an open sales quotation available, Baan will take it over a sales contract for pricing.  Make sure you know the order in which Baan will search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jackred2</div><div class="date">27th February 2002, 02:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to inform you that in BaanVc SP6 the Sales Order Contract functionality has been completely turned off. I was on a project where the client required this functionality, and the team verified this with Baan support. Baan indicated that the SO contract functionality was &quot;too buggy&quot;.</div></div><hr />
