<br />
We send the Raw Material from our site to other party godown for job work and the material comes in as Finished Good. What do we have for this in BAAN IV, which complies all excise registers as well.<br />
<br />
Even only the procedure will do. Any types of documents will be a help for this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />

Ajay Bansal. :confused:</div></div><hr />

This has to be done manually with replenishment orders or inventory movements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BaanERP provides handling of subcontracting through its Manufacturing module. If you're in a trading company, making use of this feature may not be that straight forward as you have to learn the BOM, routing, cost price calculation, and shop floor control concepts<br />
<br />
In Distribution modules alone, Baan doesn't provide much automation for subcontracting, as mentioned by Martin above<br />

<br />
I am in a process company and we are not using the Manufacturing Module presently.<br />
<br />
Do you have any type of document etc. of the same so that i could learn and check if it can be done.<br />
