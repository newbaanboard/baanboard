<br />
I have an item &quot;A&quot;. I purchase this item via direct delivery everytime.<br />
In Baan when i creat a new item i have to manage a purchase price, i set the same price in the last purchase price and in the avarage purchase price to calculate the cost price.<br />
<br />
When i created this item i was in the beginning of the year .My price was 80 euros. <br />
<br />
I purchase this item several times from the beginning but with direct delivery.<br />
I repeat that i did'nt have any stock transactions.<br />
When i approve my purchase invoice the average price and the last price are maintained.But my problem the cost price doesn't change same is the pruchase has changed =&gt; WHY?<br />
<br />
1) Maybe because i didn't have any stock transactions?<br />
2) I have to create a different cost price element than &quot;STD&quot;?<br />
<br />
I don't know.<br />
<br />
Could you give me more information about this case.<br />
<br />
Now, why this a problem for me? In the purchase account in finance i have always a correction transaction to do the balance but it's not correct to evaluate the margin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />

(And then, only if your Cost Price Calculation Code uses Ap and Lp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vtamirisa</div><div class="date">15th November 2004, 23:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The std cost price won't get updated unless you re-calculate the std cost price. So if the variance is too much then it is always better to recalculate the std cost before the invoice matching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">julisb</div><div class="date">16th November 2004, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Please have also a look on your cost price calculation code what is the range of priority for purchase prices. Is the priority of latest or average price higher than the others?<br />

<br />
I think i have maybe found the problem :<br />
<br />
Today i have a component cost price first based on average price, second last purchase price, third purchase price and finally simulate purchase price.<br />
<br />
My average price doesn't change for this kind of item , because i did'nt have any stock transactions.<br />
<br />
I think i have to create a new component cost price with priority last price.<br />
<br />
I update the cost price with this new component.<br />
<br />
Finally i thank you all for your help.</div></div><hr />
