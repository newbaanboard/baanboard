<br />
Part of my company's inventory is kept in public warehouses. This proves to be a challenging aspect of our implementation.<br />
<br />
Our latest venture is to communicate with the remote warehouse through EDI.<br />
<br />
Now (as I understand the issue..but I'm not very EDI-literate), Baan does not carry the full range of EDI messages and does not allow for adding message types.<br />
Creative as always, our team came up with a solution that utilizes EDI sales orders (855, 860??) into warehouse releases.<br />
The problem, as always, with creative solutions is that it works..but not quite.<br />
<br />
The reason I submit this scenario to the good community here is that I sincerely doubt that we are the first ones dealing with this problem.<br />
Has anybody here dealt with public warehouses and came up with solutions that did not include a fax machine?<br />
<br />
I would appreciate your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">24th June 2002, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">A new set of EDI messages has to be developed in Baan to do the Warehouse EDI transactions. The number of EDI messages to be developed depends on the bussiness model. I had once developed a set (3new EDI messages 940,943 &amp; 945) of ware house EDI messages. One of my cleint has the bussiness requirement sames as yours i.e. the PO's/SO's will be raised by my clients and the receipts/Deliveries are done by Warehouse personnel. EDI trasactions are made such that at any point of time the inventories at my client system has to match up with the invetories in public warehouse. <br />
If you have questions on this, let me know. For developing the new EDI messages in Baan, the person should know the complete Baan EDI functionality apart from Baan Knowledge.</div></div><hr />
