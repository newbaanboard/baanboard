<br />
I apologize in advance if anyone has considered a similar problem. <br />
<br />
The situation is as follows: <br />
Two months ago, we created a new warehouses in session tcmcs0503m000.<br />
All materials been listed by purchase order has an incorrect value other than the value in the purchase order. (The problem is gone with the old warehouses)<br />
<br />
For a better understanding I attached a few screenshots(1,2,3).<br />
Our main problems are: <br />
1.	How flock at new quantities in the new warehouses to get the price of the purchase order and not from the old lot ?<br />
2.	Is it possible in any way, material have already been listed wrong,  happens to the correct value (the price of the purchase order) or the only thing that can be done to reverse the operations ?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for help !!<br />
<br />
Best Regard,<br />
Borislav</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Inventory Valuation is different from Purchase Order Price. It is calculated based on the Inventory Valuation Method and the Cost Components related to that Item.<br />
<br />
You can check the complete breakup for the Valuation Price in session whina1512m000 (Inventory Receipts Transaction) - &gt; Specific - &gt; Cost Details.<br />
<br />
So, if you are comparing these values they may not be same.</div></div><hr />

	Thank you for your quick reply, as always responsive.<br />
I solved the problem by changing the method of valuation with session whina1232m000.	<br />
