<br />
The session, &quot;Delete Outbound Data&quot; (tdilc4211m000) is used by many users at our organisation. Maintain Outbound data that is defined by a user is deleted by another user in this session tdilc4211m000. The run number is defined against an user but there is no check by user while deleting the outbound data that was created by another user with a different run number. Is there a way out in Baan for restricting delete outbound only by the user and related run number that had created the maintain outbound.<br />
<br />
We would like to know if there is a solution to this other than the that defined below; <br />
<br />
The possible solutions that we can think of is to keep audit to find the person deleting the maintain outbound or to restrict the user by giving different forms where the user is restricted to his run number. <br />
<br />
Please let us know.....as early as possible....<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can do this by users authorisations for run numbers</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had even thought of authorisation, but we are not able to stop only deleting outbound data if the run number belongs to another user. The option available in &quot;Maintain Table field data authorisation&quot; is &quot;Write/Read&quot;, &quot;Read&quot; and &quot;Not Authorised&quot;. But in our case we must allow the user to release outbound but only restrict for deleting. This is not possible.<br />
<br />
I hope i am clear....<br />

<br />
If you say 'Not Authorised' for run number, the user will not be able to release or delete any outbound data which is not under his run number. I feel that a user  should not be able to release outbound data which has not been generated by him So it should work</div></div><hr />
