<br />
Is there anybody who can help me?  Apparently, the error message is got because, at the time of entering partial material consumption (in inventory units) against a production order in the session Maintain Outbound, the system reduces the entire quantity of the item required (in storage units) for the production order from the storage units available in stock in the concerned warehouse.  Hence, at some point in time, the system runs out of storage units to issue while there is still stock in terms of inventory units.  This somehow leads to the error message.<br />
<br />
This error is linked to the query raised by Sukesh in the Manufacturing module.<br />

Our site as probably seen more problems with issuing inventory because of A&amp;D than I can count.  I am not an expert on these problems, but we have not seen this issue(probably because we set the storage unit to the inventory unit - and users are not allowed to change it).  The simple ones are where users enter incorrect data in one place or another.  So make sure your issuing quantity is really what it is suppose to be, outbound is correct, etc. Then if you still have the problem contact support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haripra</div><div class="date">22nd June 2006, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Ravi,<br />
Please verify the Outbound data that is present against any order for this item. If present , reallocate the outbound data in order to allow you to make this transaction.<br />

Our IT got in touch with SSA.  The problem has been solved by installing service packs 18 &amp; 19 for BaaN IV.  Could have been a bug in the software.<br />

<br />
The original past was made in 2005, in that time &quot;Baan&quot; was owned by SSA Global Technologies. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is to get in touch with the help desk. You can reach them via http://www.infor.com/support/</div></div><hr />
