<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bburdett</div><div class="date">2nd October 2001, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a 'fitting', which is made up of several purchased items from our raw material warehouse that are sent out to be machined/glued and<br />
returned as a completed finished goods item. <br />
We want to maintain/track inventory levels for both the finished goods &quot;fitting&quot; and the lower level items. I also need to make sure the inventory levels of the low level items are reduced immediately when they are shipped out to the subcontractor.<br />
<br />
Is using subcontracting items the only way to do this in order to track inventory levels and BOM costing properly? Seems very cumbersome for such a simple process???  Can anyone provide a simpler solution(s)?  Anything????  <br />
<br />
thanks in advance!! :D</div></div><hr />

Send him all material on Replenishment order. You can set DRP set up to plan RPL orders automatically. You can send him copy of sub-cont order as a intimation to start work for particular prod. order. All material can be Backflushed once operation is completed.<br />
<br />
Many advantages are there if you explore this possibility !!<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />
