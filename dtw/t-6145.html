I am having problems creating these dummy BP's. I have to link the same BP to different relations to obtain the commissions rate set at the different levels.<br />
<br />
What this does is creats a seperate BP for all levels and too many commissions invoices are created basically it gets very messy and complicated. <br />
<br />
I cannot find a way whereby commissions can be awarded at the lowest level, other than simply creating relations at the lowest level and maintaining the heiarchy outside baan. <br />
<br />
Do you have any ideas ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
as long as you don't want to pay commissions to BP whih are not on the lowest level just set up an agreement for the lowest level with a rate of 20%. In all other agreements the rate is 0%. You will get a warning during calculation that the commisson amount for BP XXXX is zero but the lowest level is calculated correctly anyway. We had a similar problem in the past and solved it like this. <br />
Are you calculating the commission for each orderline or each order? How many orders/orderlines have to be calculated each period? In our case the parameter is set to 'Order', 5000 up to 8000 orders have to be calculated every month.<br />
<br />
Don't give up! The CMS package is not too bad once you get the proper settings. Don't hesitate to contact me for further questions.<br />
