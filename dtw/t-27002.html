Hope you can give me some light on the topic of Direct Delivery<br />
<br />
What is direct delivery mean for a sales order ? <br />
In what situation we use direct delivery ? <br />
What type are involved in BaaN ?<br />
<br />
Found out from the forum know that direct delivery means delivery goods directly from supplier to customer.</div></div><hr />

That's it! In other words: a purchase order will be generated (manually, interactively, automatically) and linked to the sales order. In theory and practice the goods will never touch your warehouse. For that reason the warehouse in the salesorderline is empty and you won't find an inventory transaction for that salesorderline (tdinv150).<br />
The ordersteps Print Picking List.... (if applicable) and Maintain Deliveries will be skipped an replaced by &quot;Awaiting Direct Delivery&quot;. As soon as the &quot;phantom&quot; reciept for the purchase orderline is done the sales order can be processed completely (Print Sales Invoice..).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I come across this direct delivery when I create a sales order for an SIC item and without a PCS project. What we want to do is to manafacture the item and delivery to the customer outsidethe PCS project. As I can't maintain the warehouse, there is no allocation in the warehouse and as such I can start production.<br />
<br />
I found the solution but not sure this will help. I can maintain the field tiitm001.ddfq to a very high number (higher than the order quantity in sales order). With this, BaaN will not create the sales order as direct order.<br />
<br />
But, what does this mean ?</div></div><hr />

Teddybear,<br />
This is the appropriate way to avoid direct deliveries in general. But what you want to avoid is a PCS projekt for this sales order, correct? <br />
<br />
This is a different story. As I'm not familiar with the PCS module, I can't help you at this point, however I assume that it should be possible.<br />
