This has helped greatly to improve accuracy when producing pick note for our pickers.<br />
<br />
I now need to have the same accuracy for our store staff to ensure goods are placed in the correct section.<br />
<br />
Could anyone help regarding having the stock location printed onto the GRN's<br />
<br />
Our counterpart in Singapore already uses this but due to the fact we have only just set up our locartions it has never been a problem here in the UK.</div></div><hr />

In ERP LN, you can achieve this by using Storage Conditions.  Depending on the data setup done by using this &quot;Storage Conditions&quot; functionality, you can print the same in GRN.<br />
<br />
Please correct me if I am wrong.  And also let me know if there is any other easy and straight forward way to achieve this.  Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />
