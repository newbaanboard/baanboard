<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sasikanth</div><div class="date">3rd October 2017, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Technically, this happens when there is an Application Lock in Session &quot;Application Locks&quot; (ttadv9598m000). <br />
<br />
Which means that, there is another user probably busy with the Shipment Confirmation Process, and the Lock should get released when the user leaves the Shipments Session. However, sometimes a Lock remains and doesn't get removed due to various reasons.<br />
<br />
So, you need to open the Application Locks, and delete the lock related to Shipments Session.<br />
<br />
Hope this Helps You.</div></div><hr />
