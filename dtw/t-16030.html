<br />
Can someone guide me how to implement this functionality.<br />
<br />
I would like to have only the same user to modify their own sales order which they have created previously. Any other user cannot modify them.<br />
<br />
Eg. SO 100001 is created by abc.<br />
Only abc can change this order. Right now any person who uses session Maintain Sales Order, can change any orders.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

You would most likely have to check the order history to see who the user was that created the order and then limit the user in this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">19th July 2004, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Create different order types for every user, or create separate order series for each user. Then setup Table Data Authorizations that they can only amend tdsls040 for their own ordertype/orderseries.<br />

This would save you having to set up multiple order types - but you need to check if this will affect if any of your reports will be effected. The user could enter their initials in this field.</div></div><hr />
