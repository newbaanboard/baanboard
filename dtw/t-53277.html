<br />
We went live on 1st June, While uploading the opening balance through adjustment order, there were certain mistakes commited by us, which can be categorised in this way.<br />
<br />
1. Item not available in our old System, but was uploaded in LN <br />
<br />
2. The uploaded qty was incorrect<br />
<br />
3. The rate for item uploaded was incorrect<br />
<br />
4. The quantity as well as rate was uploaded incorrect<br />
<br />
We have already identified and categorized it all. Now the question is how to correct the quantity and rate of opening balance, because since Go live date, a lot of inventory has been received and issued for these items. Please note that we have used valuation method as MAUC, and every receipt and issue has taken place for TP Projects. No Project has been completed as of now. we want to correct the costing of the project also, which is incorrect because of quantity issued to these projects were having wrong price.<br />
Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
I think there is no option to correct the opening balance so you can go ahead with cycle counting for correction for this problem. but before cycle counting you have to complete all order, those are having active stage and you can use MAUC correction engine also(whina1231m000), for costing purpose.....<br />
I hope it will work for you.You can contact for any clarfication....<br />

Thanks,<br />
