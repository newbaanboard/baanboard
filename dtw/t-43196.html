We use the subcontracting Process. when we make the production order and completed all operation. After that if any user use the issue inventroy session (tisfc0207m000). The Bom material is also reissued.<br />
<br />
For your information, In the item master these field are yes<br />
<br />
1. Backflush material   Yes<br />
2. Backflus if Material  Yes<br />
3. Backflush Hours      Yes<br />
<br />
we are not able to findout the actual reason for how we track this situation. Also in the case of Normal production order the material is issued in a normal way.<br />
<br />
Please suggest but is the problem and how we handle this situation. Our RM store is mismatched due to double issued of RM.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

What Arvind was talking about was related to the session Report Operations Completed {tisfc0102m000}. This particular field &quot;To Do&quot; can be found in the detail part of Form1. It appears somewhat under the &quot;Toggle&quot; button...<br />
 <br />
Before all that, could you tell me what SP are you on? This looks like a bug to me. Regardless of whether backflushing is on or off, if you try and run the issue inventory twice, the materials should only get issued once...Once the &quot;Issue&quot; field becomes 0 for any material in the session Enter Material Issue for Production Orders {tisfc0101m000}, the system doesnt/shouldnt issue more of that material. If it happens, then it surely is a bug than any feature i could think of...<br />

<br />
We are on SP12, now we are going on SP21 within 3 month.<br />
<br />
1. when we make a production order, thier bom material must be show in the <br />
   ticst0101m000 session field &quot;issue&quot;, but, the material was show in the    <br />
   subsequent delivery field.<br />
<br />
2. Second, we manual insert the material in the field of &quot;issue&quot; and <br />
   subsequent delivery field shows that time is zero, then we run the Issue <br />
   inventory session (tisfc0207m000). But again subsequent delivery field  <br />
   shows same quantity.<br />
<br />
3. Now, if any production Deptt. user use session &quot;Issue inventory&quot; that <br />
    material again issued. This scenerio is shows in random production order <br />
    not in all.<br />
<br />
we are try to findout the reason for this process, but fail. You are requested to please suggest what to be done for resolving this issue. <br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">20th October 2007, 12:33</div></div><div class="posttext">With ref to your points...<br />
1. when we make a production order, thier bom material must be show in the ticst0101m000 session field &quot;issue&quot;, but, the material was show in the subsequent delivery field.<br />
This happens if anyone updates the &quot;Issue&quot; field. Depending on the figure thats put in the &quot;Issue&quot; field, the &quot;Subsequent Del&quot; field gets calculated<br />
 <br />
2. Second, we manual insert the material in the field of &quot;issue&quot; and subsequent delivery field shows that time is zero, then we run the Issue inventory session (tisfc0207m000). But again subsequent delivery field shows same quantity.<br />
Thats unusual and strange. Usually or ideally, when someone enters or changes the &quot;Issue&quot; field once a material is estimated, the &quot;Subsequent Delivery&quot; field gets calculated automatically. If i am right then the equation would be based on the following conditon<br />
Issue &lt; Estimated<br />
Subsequent Delivery = Estimated - Issue <br />
Issue &gt; Estimated<br />
Subsequent Delivery = 0<br />
 <br />
3. Now, if any production Deptt. user use session &quot;Issue inventory&quot; that material again issued. This scenerio is shows in random production order not in all.<br />
As i said earlier it looks like a bug and its further proven by the version of SP you are on. SP12 is very old and even though i am no fan of SPs, you cant just ignore them..Furthermore you could find out whats the difference among the manufactured items that gives out this unusual behaviour when compared to the items that dont have this problem..<br />

<br />
I test the production order process in the test environment, all process works in fine tune. I can't found any problem, but in the live environment the inventory is creating the problem for DOUBLE INVENTORY issue. I am not able to understand where is the problem.<br />
<br />
This problem is not item specific, it may be happend in any item.<br />
<br />
Please guide me what to be done for preventing this problem in future.<br />
<br />

Check and compare the solutions in table ttpmc201 in the tools company on both the servers. Its also advisable to look into solutions by session as well...<br />

I have observed some time, that even if you enter value in &quot;Issue&quot; field and user didn't tab from the field the &quot;Subsequent delivery&quot; is not updated. so may be a particular user is doing this. I suspect it is a bug as it is not appearing in all the productin order. Question- why are you using backflushing then? for this item don't use the backflusihing and you don't ave to this extrat step. It also seems you are in non-location control environment.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your response, I think, when all material related to subcontracting manually issued, then why we are using backflush.<br />
<br />
Now, I change in the item master of all subcontracting items and then check the output. Perhapes it may give desired results.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; regards<br />

If the process is for manual issue, then backflushing is not the way to do it. You can however issue material to any operation also. I was trying to understand the process, since you are manually updating the issue field, then what is the need for &quot;Backflushing&quot;. Also, if you issue only partial quantity then the better approach would be to use &quot;Backflushing&quot; and asjust the &quot;To Do&quot; field in the operation. In thus way you can issue material as per the your requirement and you need not go throught updating the issue field of every BOM component. One can use the backflushing, Manual issuing in a combination of way.<br />

<br />
Manual issue process is use only in the subcontracting process. In the normal Production Order process, there was no any step use manual. <br />
<br />
In the Subcontracting, the item qty is not show in the issue field, its direct goes into the Subsequent Delivery field. So, for the issuing the material, the qty filled in the issue field, and Subsequent Delivery field be zero. Then save &amp; exit from this (ticst0101m000). Start the session (tisfc0207m000) for issuing the inventory for that order.<br />
<br />
Now, we check the results after these changing in the item master.<br />
