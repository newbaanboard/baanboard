<br />
i'm trying to do a script to delete backorders in batch following some criteria, is this as simple as let tdsls041.bqua = 0 or there are more steps to follow?<br />
<br />
I have this SQL to look for backorders for specific items, i want to make another SQL that join with tiitm001 and tdsls040 to also search for tiitm001.csgs and tdsls040.odat, tdsls040.cuno and some other fields.<br />
<br />
This sql is based in the query.extension in tdsls4125m000 and the code in tdsls4418m000<br />
<br />
sugestions?<br />
<br />
	<br />
select tdsls041.*<br />
  from tdsls041<br />
 where tdsls041._index8 = { :item }<br />
   and tdsls041.bqua &lt;&gt; 0 <br />
   and tdsls041.opol &lt;&gt; tcittc.make.customized <br />
   and tdsls041.cwar = &quot;QP1&quot;<br />
order by tdsls041._index8<br />
selectdo<br />
	select tdsls045.*<br />
	  from tdsls045<br />
	 where tdsls045._index1 = { :tdsls041.orno, :tdsls041.pono }<br />
	   and (tdsls045.bqua &lt;&gt; 0 or tdsls045.srnb &lt;&gt; 0) <br />
	   and tdsls045.pono &lt;&gt; 0 <br />
	   and tdsls045.cwar = &quot;QP1&quot;	<br />
	order by tdsls045._index1 desc<br />
	as set with 1 rows<br />
	selectdo<br />
	          cant = cant + tdsls041.bqua<br />
	endselect<br />
endselect</div></div><hr />
