<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraP</div><div class="date">29th October 2009, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an item AB002, we keep consignment stock and we have some normal stock.  At the moment all stock is showing in the normal warehouse but a qty of these are actually consignment stock.<br />
<br />
They have managed to receive the consignment replenish stock order into the 'normal' warehouse instead of the consignment warehouse.<br />
<br />
Before realising they had done this, they cycle counted a quantity out of this 'normal' warehouse which in turn created a consignment invoice, at this point they stopped and realised something was wrong.<br />
<br />
I have 2 issues I need to sort out.<br />
<br />
1.  How do I move consignment inventory from one warehouse to the other without creating a consignment invoice?<br />
<br />
2.  How do I correct the adjustment they made in cycle counting orders and counteract the consignment invoice it raised?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />
<br />
