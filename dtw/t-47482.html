<br />
I understand BaaN will assign a lot during the generate outbound process. In this case, what is the logic behind BaaN when choosing which lot to delivery? Assume that all lots have enough inventory for the sales order quantity. <br />
<br />
I think of the following possibility but not very sure :<br />
<br />
Age of the lot, FIFO<br />
Partially consumed lot have higher priority<br />
Alphabetically order of the lot name</div></div><hr />
