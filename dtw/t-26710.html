We use the forwarding agent on the sales order header as an indicator of how a product should ship - which carrier to use and method - e.g. fedex overnight. However, we actually require this at the line level - as some lines of the sales order must ship using a different method. I.e. the entire order should not ship using one method. I am guessing we need a customization - adding the forwarding agent to the line level - any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />

We have integration with our shipping system for it. You can also create at Line level if required.</div></div><hr />
