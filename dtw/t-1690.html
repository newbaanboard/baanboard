<br />
I was using:<br />
<br />
if tdpur041.dqua &lt;&gt; 0 then<br />
   balance = tdpur041.bqua<br />
else<br />
   balance = tdpur041.oqua<br />
endif<br />
<br />
But....if the user receives zero (tdpur041.dqua = 0) and backorders zero (tdpur041.bqua = 0), my balance really should be zero - but I'm getting the order quantity.  <br />
<br />
This happens with muliple lines on a po and the user decides they really don't want an item - but don't remove it from the po.<br />
<br />
I could read the tdpur045's - but is there an easier way?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">12th April 2002, 23:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if they don't want to remove it from the PO and insist on making a 0 delivered, 0 back order receipt, then I think you need to read tdpur045.<br />
<br />
When tdpur041.dqua = 0 and tdpur041.bqua = 0, then I would read to see if there is a tdpur045 record with srnb &gt; 0.  It should, of course, also have dqua and bqua = 0, but it probably isn't necessary to check that.</div></div><hr />
