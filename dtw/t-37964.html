<br />
We are working with Ln 6.1 FP0<br />
<br />
We need to add a customised session as an Activity in Sales Order Type - tdsls0560m000.<br />
But whenever we try to add a new activity, the system gives us an error message -  Activity no allowed in Sales Order Type Procedure.<br />
<br />
On zooming to actvities it zzoms to session ttadv2506s000, where all the sessions are not available. Can anybody please guide me on how to add Fresh activities in Sales Order Type.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

It is because the new logic of automatic activation of activities requires additional code to be written. Makes sense really but it is a nice feature taken from us and replaced by a different nice feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">26th June 2007, 09:36</div></div><div class="posttext">A manual activity can have any name with 1 exception: the first 13 characters can not be an session code. So instead of &quot;tccom0500m000&quot; you can name it &quot;M: tccom0500m000&quot;.</div></div><hr />

This is correct. I've just tested it. Obviously, there are some drawbacks to doing this such as if a user executes the order step from the status screen then the status is moved on without the customised session having been run. This function would have to be controlled and the program script of the new session would have to be written to move the status on to the next activity once completed. <br />
<br />
Thanks for this, I thought this was impossible but I guess it's not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your input.<br />
<br />
I was able to resolve the issue thru a workaround.  Just inserted the record in tdsls060 thru GTM and then in my customised session we wrote a function to pdate the activity and procedure mask.<br />
