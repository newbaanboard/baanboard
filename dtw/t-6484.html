<br />
I wonder if anyone can point me in the right direction...<br />
<br />
I am a Baan Administrator/Developer and I have had a project request to write a module that will deal with Credit allocation for wrong invoices etc and our parts that need to be returned.  we use Baan IV c4 and I was wondering if there is a module in Baan that would deal with this? or at least some of it so that we can utilise this rather than writing a new module when one might already exist.<br />
<br />
If there is such a module or if anyone knows of or has any documentation this will be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<br />
did you evaluate the return order functionality? You will have to set up an order type with the return order falg set to yes.<br />
<br />
The rest of the procedure is pretty much like normal order handling, however with negative amounts / quantities. If you use ILC, you will have to manually maintain a (negative) outbound advice, to get the material back on stock. Printing the invoice for such an order will print a credit note.<br />
