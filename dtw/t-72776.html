<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vahdani</div><div class="date">27th February 2020, 18:37</div></div><div class="posttext">This is because your business partner/customer that you enter in the sales order is defined as a one-time business partner. In such cases the system generates a new empty address code and asks if you wish to enter the address details. There is apparantly no way to circumvent this by one time customers. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
