In Baan IV these addresses were linked to the customer, but in Baan V it seems that that link between the BP and the address is no longer there.  When entering a sales order it's a major hassle to go through the thousands of addresses trying to find the correct one.  Does anybody know a simple work-around?  Or do we have to do a customization?</div></div><hr />

<br />
An &quot;easy&quot; way to solve your problem is to define an &quot;intelligent&quot; code of address.<br />
<br />
For example, you have 9 characters for the address' code so you can define the first characters related to the coustomer and the final 2 or 3 characters as a consecutive.<br />
Example.<br />
My customer is Baan and i have 3 differents destinations, so you can do this:<br />
BAANMEX01<br />
BAANUSA02<br />
BAANNED03<br />
<br />
This only will help you to order by customer and it will be easily for you to choose the correct address.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is not the best solution but it works, in the other way you will need a customization.<br />
