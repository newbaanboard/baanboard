Is this controlled by a setting somewhere that I can unset?  <br />
<br />
We have many compaines, and while one manufactures the product and I might obtain it directly from them, I also can purchase that same lot from another distribution company that has too much (and I don't want to &quot;sell&quot; it back to the mfg company before buying it).<br />
<br />
Currently I create a second lot code XXXXXX_2, receive it with that code and then adjust down and up to get it back to the original lot.  Just hoping to avoid this.<br />

<br />
Doesn't look it it can be controlled.  It is dictated by the 'lots' table (tdltc001), where the primary (unique) index is:  project, item, container, lot.  The type of lot (purchase/production) or supplier isn't part of the index.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">28th October 2005, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your reply, but what I meant by &quot;controlled&quot; was can I turn off the check that requires a lot to be received from the same supplier.  <br />
<br />
I see where you are coming from with the supplier not being part of the index key and thus only allowing one record in the lot table for each lot, but I don't care about the supplier field at all on the lot table, I would rather treat that field as MFG, and if a middle man is used to acquire the product, I don't care.<br />
<br />
Does this make sense?</div></div><hr />

<br />
your need to buy the same charge from different suppliers is legitimate and I think this may be needed by other Baan users as well. Unfortunately this functionality is hard coded in the session script of the session and I don't think SSA is going to change this anytime soon.  Your only solution: Let your Baan-Partner customize the script!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vahdani</div><div class="date">29th October 2005, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">...another fine solution that I'm sorry to say I didn't think of.... ;)</div></div><hr />
