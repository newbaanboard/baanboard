<br />
I want to use Shipments in Warehouse Management to do this:<br />
1. I plan when to ship the product;<br />
2. Record how the product is packaged, sometimes many products will compose together;<br />
<br />
In testing the Shipments, I found it is strange, I don't know why, such as:<br />
When I new a Planned Loads/Shipments, it make the load id and shipment id, but I can't find it in Shipments(whinh4130m000) or Loads(whinh4140m000) session. When I make and Release the Outbound  Advice, the load and shipment record is create, but I can't change the record. It's there something wrong?</div></div><hr />

Other else during shipment do not automatic on the warehousing procedure step for Confirm Shipment. Then u can do a modify in terms of qty or transaction date.</div></div><hr />
