<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">2nd June 2008, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">A sales order line was entered and user overwrote the system return price and saved the line. Then user changed the Item Category from 'Standard Item' to 'Make Customized' and this caused the pricing to revert back to system generated price as per the set price/discount structure. <br />
<br />
Looking at the code, it looks like to be the standard functionality of Baan but our users are saying that before it was not like that and the prices will hold even if they changed the item category to Make Customized. <br />
<br />
We are on BaanIVc4 SP11 and was wondering if some if you guys can test this for me and let me know how your system behaves on this change. <br />
<br />
If you have any other suggestion, please do let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

   We have SP19 at our sites and this sort of behaviour happens at our end too. However, it was concluded that the change in price happened because the category change redefined the item in question and so the manually added price wouldnt be relevant anymore. <br />
<br />
This was thus seen as a standard functionality rather than a bug.<br />
