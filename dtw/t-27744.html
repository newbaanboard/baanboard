<br />
I have a strange problem here,  I have a manual transfer order, with about 10 Lines all shipped and recieved without problems except 1 line that is staged but can't be shipped.. I got an error report with message &quot;Inventory Blocked&quot;<br />
<br />
The outbound Line is not Blocked, but the inbound line has the checkbox &quot;Blocked&quot; marked...<br />
<br />
The block and Unblock options on specific menu is dimmed.<br />
<br />
I have tried all I can, no blocking for warehousing or locations exists, no application locks exists...<br />
<br />
Any ideas ??<br />
<br />
This happens with many Items, sometimes in the same order...<br />
<br />
Help Appriciated</div></div><hr />
