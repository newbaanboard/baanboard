<br />
When we purchase from a supplier with an &quot;Ex Works&quot; term of delivery we get a &quot;planned delivery date&quot; on the purchase order that we do not like.<br />
<br />
We get the date that the supplier should deliver, but if we have an overseas supplier, the supplier should have the goods ready (at his factory) weeks before that date. Baan is not taking the &quot;terms of delivery&quot;  into account (we checked this with Infor), it ignores the fact that it is &quot;Ex Works&quot; and we need time for the shipping. We would like that for &quot;Ex Works&quot; suppliers the purchase order shows the date that the supplier must have the goods ready so our transportation company can pick it up. Not that Baan prints the date that the goods must be received at our site.<br />
<br />
We are sure that there are more Baan users that use &quot;Ex Works&quot; for their purchase orders and that they found a way to handle thsi in Baan.<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />
