 We have need to use ILC modul with 2 locations in one warehouse. <br />
When I create ILC for warehouse all items that was in that warehouse systems put on receipt location.<br />
Which way I can transfer all items (about 1000 ) to location that is not receipt location.</div></div><hr />

I used session tdilc0230m000 to generate ILC in old warehouse. After generation I got two location control and receipt and all items sistems putaway on receipt locatin. After that i created one new location for that warehouse in session tdilc0110m000 and match new location to all items in the warehouse in session tdilc0130m000. Now I can make inventory transfer from receipt location to new created location in sesion tdilc1120m000 but i have to spent too much time to do it, because I have to do one by one. Can you tell me session where i can generate moving items from receipt to new defined locatin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Recently I also converted a warehouse in this manner. In order to move the stock quickly I used cycle counting orders and exchange. Firstly I loaded a file which reduced the stock in the receipt location to 0, then I loaded a file increasing the stock in the target locations to the appropriate quantity. This is fairly simple and quick to do.<br />
<br />
Also, although converting a warehouse to use location control is not too complex be aware there are several things which should also be done. The warehouse in question will now be subject to both inbounding and outbounding which will have an impact on sales and purchase. ILC parameters should be checked. Picking lists need to be checked since location information may be currently retrieved from INV ond not ILC, and these can now show different values. These are just some of the things which spring to mind :)<br />

If you need more information feel free to mail me.<br />
