<br />
We would like to implement the purchase statistics module (our environment is BaaNIVc4).<br />
<br />
The problem we encountered is that the session &quot;Update Purchase Statistics&quot; is running a very long time and it creates huge temp files. We had to kill the session after 48 hours...<br />
<br />
Do you know how we could improve the performance of this session? I received a patch from BaaN Support to improve the performance, but I'm rather sceptical that it will work...<br />
<br />
Any hints would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
<br />
Erik</div></div><hr />

<br />
The full update is usually a very long process and dependent on the data present in the system. <br />
<br />
in our case we had updated 2 yrs data and it had taken us a little more that 3 days. <br />
<br />
what was the patch that baan provided you? usually they would provide the latest updates but that may  not always do the trick.</div></div><hr />
