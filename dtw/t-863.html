<br />
We are using Baan IV c2 with Oracle Back-end.<br />
<br />
We have many RPL orders and lines for which all the steps including &quot;Process/Remove Delivered Replenishment Orders&quot; with &quot;Delete Order Data&quot; = &quot;No&quot; have been executed<br />
<br />
When we run &quot;Process/Remove Delivered Replenishment Orders&quot; with &quot;Delete&quot; option as Yes, it does not any of the above RPL Orders.<br />
<br />
We received a solution from local Baan Support Center where source code too was there. From source code, it came out that system checks whether Inbound Advice has been generated for the concerned RPL Order Line. If no advice found, it will not delete that order line.<br />
<br />
When we try to maintain Inbound Advice for the order line, it says &quot;Quantity Already Issued / Allocated&quot; and does not allow to proceed ahead.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell what is wrong in the procedure ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
