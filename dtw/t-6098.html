<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanTech</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a multi/multi setup and use internal EDIs. Direct Network Communication is set to run in job mode every night.  The job for one company shows as running since 07-26 and has since been cancelled.  I would like to process the records still showing in Display Messages to be Generated (tcedi7500m000).<br />
<br />
When running tcedi7205m000 manually the system is hanging on Generating... via tcedi7601s000.  I have killed the sessions twice, hence the two POs pending generating have been lost from tcedi7500m000 and the EDI messages will need to be re-generated.<br />
<br />
What is the simplest wasy to regenerate these messages ?  (can this be done without having to modify the header?)<br />
What would cause tcedi7601s000 to hang ?<br />
<br />
The device in tcedi7205m000 is assumed to be for printers remarks and errors.  Or am I wrong and does the device need to be ASCIF and to the path defined for DNC ?<br />
<br />
(I'm on IVc3).<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

This will help the session tcedi7601s000 from not getting hanged.<br />
<br />
The simplest way of regenerating the messages is to use session 'Restart Generated Messages' (tcedi7221m000).<br />
<br />
You are right. The device in tcedi7205m000 is assumed to be for device type to print remarks and errors.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the feedback.  I'm not able to modify the Suppress<br />
flag (tcedi020.scon) due to form expression tcedi020.mltc = tcyesno.no (Multicompany is 'Yes&quot;).<br />
<br />
Also, session tcedi7221m000 looks like it's supposed to be used for messages already generated.<br />
<br />
In my case it seems like the original message created when printing the order has been lost (from tcedi700), eventhough the second form 'Generated EDI' flag is 'Yes'.<br />
<br />
(GTM is always an option to but I would like to try to avoid this<br />
if possible).<br />
<br />
I have requested for one of our users to make a change to<br />
the order header (force change order) in an attempt<br />
to recreate the messages via print.<br />
<br />
Normally I chase after orders that have been generated but for some reason not received, so my track record in tracking controllers and DNC is somewhat limited.<br />
<br />
We have 13 companies in our PROD setup and this is the only<br />
one that seems to be giving us problems.<br />
<br />
The last update in appl_comm for this company was on 08/03<br />
and the dir is currently empty.</div></div><hr />

If there is you should remove/rename this file and re-run your generation.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

I found some of my old notes was able to get the orders over yesterday morning by removing the files in the command directory.<br />
<br />
My problem right now is that I have 860S for 3 orders that cannot<br />
be processed in the target company because the SO header<br />
cannot be found.<br />
<br />
When I initially killed the generate messages session it appears<br />
I lost the original 850S and the messages that transferred for<br />
these 3 POs were the new 860S.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to recreate the 850S message for the orders ?<br />
<br />
If not, we can always recreate the POs and cancel the originals<br />
and remove the batches pending processing.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanTech</div><div class="date">9th August 2002, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">All EDI POs are now where they should be.<br />
<br />
Missing 850S EDI orders can be regenerated by changing the Generated EDI flag in tdpur040 to 'No' (GTM) and by flipping the pmask flag for the Print PO order step from 'e' to 'y' in tdpur045 (GTM).  After doing this run tcedi7205m000.<br />
<br />
In the target company the old batch (where the header error refers to the customer PO) must also be removed via<br />
tcedi7251m000 just to ensure no one approves/processes<br />
the old 860S incoming details as the new 850S contains the latest changes.<br />
<br />
The EDI history will show both the 860S and the 850S (and the dates will be out of sequence), but this can be easily fixed.<br />
 <br />
Thanks to those who contributed. <br />
