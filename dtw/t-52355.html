<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">27th May 2008, 13:50</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the status of the order position.<br />
<br />
Is the order itself blocked.<br />
<br />
Is the stock available and not reserved.<br />
<br />
Is the warehouse of the order position identical to the available stock warehouse.<br />
<br />

If this is yes and if o/b is not present for all the lines, then release o/b cannot be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">27th May 2008, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, check the delivery date of sales order and also check if the item is also on cycle count. I saw that you maintain the boutbound and not generated it. If you are able to maintain the outbound then it cannot be customer blocking issue, or lot or location blocking issue. So it could be either of following and you have checked some of them<br />
1. Order blocked at the release outbound step<br />
2. Item on cycle count<br />
3. Application lock<br />
4. Delivery date on sales order not in the range that you may be giving in session</div></div><hr />
