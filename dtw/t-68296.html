Thanks for your answer ^^<br />
Okay that's for the case of prevention, but how if it's already converted ? <br />
is there any method to separate it ?<br />
<br />
Thank and Regards...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">26th October 2015, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">can you not delete the PO lines and enter manually? you can even delete the whole PO depending on the status. also since the PR is already converted you can delete both PR and PO and re-start the whole process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erplncons</div><div class="date">27th October 2015, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Another solution could be splitting the PO line into different schedules as per requirement and manually entering the PR number as text for each schedule line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Situation - You had entered multiple lines for same item on Purchase Requisition, after converting it to Purchase Order, it got commingled to one Line in Purchase Order. <br />
<br />
Solution<br />
<br />
You can split the Purchase Order Line by using Splitting deliveries, consequently multiple deliveries take place on one order line.<br />
<br />
Go to 'Order Line Details'(tdpur4101m200) from Purchase Order Lines(tdpur4101m000), and enter the details, single line with 10#, can be detailed to multiple lines of 6# and 4#</div></div><hr />
