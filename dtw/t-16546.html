<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">15th September 2004, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">We have situation where we generated 810S OUT (Sales Invoice) for one of our customer. The customer faced some problems while retrieving the message and therefore they are requesting to resend the message. Originally the message is generated with Printing of Sales Invoice (tdsls4404m000) but if I reprint the already printed invoice, no new message is generated.<br />
<br />
Does any body know how can I regenerate the edi message for Sales Invoice? <br />
<br />
For order acknowledgment I found the flag in table tdsls040.agen but is there a similar flag for Sales Invoices?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">18th September 2004, 00:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Use session 'Restart Generated Messages' (tcedi7221m000) to resend the 810 EDI message. This session will be found under menu Communication under Electronic Data Interchange.<br />
<br />
You should know Our reference number to restart the message.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference is that in this case the EDI message was not generated in the first printing of the invoice because an error 13 appeared in the process. <br />
So, the message can not be restarted in the session chandra refers, because it does not appear over there.<br />
<br />
Of course, if we reprint the invoice, the EDI message is not regenerated. <br />
<br />
Is there any way to tell the system to regenerate the EDI message for this specific invoice (i. e. change some flag in the invoice record and reprint the invoice) ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
But my question is the same. Is there a way to revert the process in order to be able to regenerate the EDI invoice messages?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">1st February 2008, 01:24</div></div><div class="posttext">If I want to do that, I would update the backend EDI tables using table maintenance and then create the invoice record in messages to be generated.<br />
It would be more risk in reverting back all the changes done while finalizing the invoice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll try that and post the feedback here.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inserted the referred record into tcedi701 and tcedi720 and was able to regenerate the EDI message.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
We just store Sent messages (in EDIFolder\store_sent). If something needs to be sent again, you can just pull it out (edit if necessary to extract particular lines from the text file) and push it to the external gateway to be sent again.</div></div><hr />
