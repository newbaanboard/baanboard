tdilc1513m000 shows the stock per whse, while tdilc1412m000 prints the detailed stock info per location.<br />
Please check the totals per item in tdilc101 and compare them with tdinv001. In case of delta's, most probably the totals of tdinv001 per item differ from the value in tiitm001.<br />
<br />
Plse check the board for the required correction programs (no access to baan currently, so by heart I think it must be tdinv0252m000 or tdilc0250m000)<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

Especially in the older versions of BIVc (&lt;SP 7) lot of errors were found in ILC-environment. Sometimes bits do fall in the wrong field, but nowadays it's pretty stable</div></div><hr />
