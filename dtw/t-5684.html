<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tbrault</div><div class="date">2nd July 2002, 12:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I have a question about incrementation of purchase receipt lines : <br />
When I have a reception of a purchase line (in table : tdpur041 ), the purchase receipt line (in table :  tdpur045 ) increment of 1 .<br />
In fact, if there are not remainder, I have 2 line in the table tdpur045 for one purchase line order : the first line, with the receipt number 0, have receipt qty = 0, receipt date = null... and have a statut = 3(receipt maintain). The second line with receipt number = 1, receipt qty = qty to receipt... have a statut 9 (receiption = OK).<br />
Why, the reception created a second receipt line?<br />
Help me<br />
Thomas<br />
PS : In delivery maintain, if there are not remainders, when I have a item to deliver, baan don't created a second line</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you use session: tdpur4410m000 (Print Goods Received Notes)<br />
the purchase status of the Purch. line changes into : 3 (Further no changes in the record and no records are created))<br />
After using session: tdpur4120m000 (Maintain Receipts) You'll see that a new record has been created with sequence#: 1 and several fields are changed).<br />
So if you have several partial deliveries, a new sequence nbr has been created, but the first numer (0) still has the status of: 3 but the deliveries have another status (e.g. 5 or 9).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tbrault</div><div class="date">2nd July 2002, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Then the fact that there is a new line with a sequence = 1 is normal. OK.<br />
But, can we avoid that the program created a new line when there aren't partial receipt?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is standard Baan, if you do Maintain receipts: <br />
A new seq# has been created because of keeping initial values of a purchase-order-line.<br />
(E.g. purchase price, Procedure mask and so on)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">2nd July 2002, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">This is indeed a difference to the sales order behaviour of Baan IV, where the first delivery changes sequence number #0, and does not create a sequence number #1. I guess there were just two different softwrae designers at work... If there is any other design reason behind that, please let me know, too. ;-)<br />
