   when I do some receipts of the Warehousing-Order,the items can be receipted in Warehouse-Receipts.But the items couldn't reach the Destination-Location(such as CNG ),and they stay in Receiving-Location(such as ODCRE,CNG and ODCRE are in the same Warehouse:JMODC).Why this matter happen?How can we make the goods receipt directly into the Destination-Location but not stay in the Receiving-Location?<br />
   Now we have some items stay in the Receiving-Location(ODCRE),can not reach Destination-Location(CNG) while receiving .What can we do about this matter?In this case,how items can reach Destination-Location from Receiving-Location?Pls give some suggestions,thanks very much!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The warehouse already set with location control.<br />
<br />
So you have to maintain inbound &amp; release inbound before the item can be received into the bulk location, else it will stay at the receiving location.<br />
<br />
The system will follow as below:<br />
<br />
Maintain receive - goes to receiving locaiton<br />
Maintain inbound (with inspection on) - goes to inspection location<br />
Maintain inspection - goes into bulk location<br />
<br />
Hope this will help.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also there is feature to automate this process of Inbounding. In Warehouse order type session you have a flag to select if the step is to be automated.<br />
Try it out as its very useful.<br />
<br />
Cheers..</div></div><hr />
