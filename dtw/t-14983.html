This feels like a minor problem but I just can't put a finger on in so please help.<br />
I'm trying to issue spare parts from a warehouse to a machine/workcenter so that the cost of the spare part is allocated to the appropriate workcenter as operating costs. The problem of course is that BaaN service has not been implemented at this site. I've thought of using warehouse manual production orders which allow me to issue items from a warehouse to a workcenter, but I'm unsure what the financial repercussions will be and how the isssued items are allocated in WIP. Please let me know if this is a solution and of other suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using Production (manual) WO works, and the financial integration of spare parts issue can be correctly set up as:<br />
<br />
Dr Maintenance expenses: Department XYZ<br />
Cr    Inventory: Spare Parts<br />
<br />
It shouldn't be booked against WIP in any way, but your accountants should know that<br />

<br />
I had the same problem like you in allocating the cost to the specific workcenter or machine.<br />
<br />
The way I am doing it now is using the cycle count order to issue the material and use the reason to allocate the cost to the specific machine.<br />
<br />
In this way, you have to set up many reason code (at least equal to number of machine/workcenter).<br />
<br />
Then you can setup the integration with reason code as a key, and if you put your workcenter as a dimension, so you have to set up the option by integration element.<br />
<br />
I hope this can help you.<br />
