<br />
This is primarily related to EDI. The Sales Order header table has the field tdsls040.agen - EDI Acknowledgement Generate. This field is apparently used internally by Baan and updated once the EDI Order acknowledgement is generated. I have observed that when an SO is copied this flag is also copied to the new order. Hence the system thinks that EDI acknowledgement has already been generated and does not generate it again.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug?  I believe this field should not be copied as it is very specific to the processing of that particular order. Please help me on this. <br />
Thanks,<br />
