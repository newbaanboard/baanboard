<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JosephA</div><div class="date">17th June 2004, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anybody know the DLLs to be modified for adding a new customized field for EDI from Purchase to Sales? As per BaaN support, only the case structure in DLL tdslsdll4280 needs to be modified and the field also should be added in the Conversion Set ups for 850 OUT and IN. But this is not working. It looks like the variable edi.appl.field is already set when the DLL tdslsdll4280 is called while we run the &quot;Direct Communication&quot; session. For some reason, it doesn't take the new field even though the conversion setup is done. Any idea which is the DLL that is calling tdslsdll4280.process.line.field(). We don't have source code, but we managed to get only the required libraries from BaaN.<br />

Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />
