The records pertaining to the Order and Lines are taken off from pur040, pur041 &amp; pur045 tables. The only trace of this deleted records would be found in pur050 and pur051 tables and this is just for history purpose and there is no need to take it off from here. Therefore, i dont think there is any need to do anything in GTM. To be sure, you could query or check table pur041 to see if the records of the deleted orders are there or not (just for your confirmation)...<br />
