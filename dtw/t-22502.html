The problem at hand:<br />
Given item A at cost X<br />
Item B at cost Y<br />
<br />
At time of sale, a shipment will consist of item A plus a variant of Item B.<br />
The sales price of Item B should always be $ 0.00, but the sales price of item A should be the sales price of A plus the cost of item B. <br />
<br />
s = (X + %) + Y<br />
<br />
The suggested solution is to create generic item C consisiting of A and B and let the configurator handle the pricing.<br />
I can't help but think there is a more elegant solution for the problem though.<br />
<br />
As always, your input will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe I should try my luck on the manufacturing forum?</div></div><hr />

May I know the actual goods you're trying to sell so that it might be possible to suggest a specific solution? Thanks<br />

<br />
We're taking the configurator route at this time, but I don't mind keeping the discussion alive for future reference.<br />
<br />
Item A is an electronic device, item B is software that gets loaded on item A and increases (or limits) item A's potential (and therefore value).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">12th January 2005, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">You can calculate the sales prices in a custom program and then update the same at othe order level after sales delivery and before final invoice printing in tdsls4122m000 using AFS . This can be a much feasible option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same situation is handled in my company as, both items (A and B) would be included in Sales order and Price of Item A will carry the price of both items (Price of A and B) and Item B will carry zero.  <br />
<br />
In this situation, it may not be possible to analysis Sales Vs cost for particular item, but it is possible to analyse by order.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">17th January 2005, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the problems that triggered this discussion is that we do not want the (price of the) software to show on invoices, packing slips, etc.<br />
<br />
Customers who notice that the only difference between variant 1 and variant 2 of device a is the software loaded onto it, may question the justification of the price difference.<br />
<br />
So we need to make the difference between variant 1 and variant 2 untransparant to the outside world, but at the same time maintain internal tracability of the actual BOM and routing.</div></div><hr />
