Therefore after a Shipment the Delivery Note is always printed, even if the Shipment is for a warehouse transfer. <br />
Is it possible to configure a scenario in which internal Delivery Notes (i.e. warehouse transfers) are NOT printed or printed with a different series?<br />

Thanks for every single reply! ;)</div></div><hr />

Take a look to session whinh0110m000. Perhaps you can define a new Warhousing Order Type...<br />
But I don't know how it is linked to the order type!?? :confused:</div></div><hr />

Hi litrax,<br />
thanks for your reply.<br />
I have tried to look at order type but i did not find a suitable field to insert an alternative delivery note series nr. Also on Shipment Procedure (whinh0105m00) it is not possible to define it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">14th December 2009, 12:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Cause the series is maintained in the inventory handling parameters (whinh0100m000) I don't think that you can change it dynamically dependent on your order type. You can only define a new order type in which you define a new procedure without delivery note.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes but if you enable the delivery note from a particular warehouse, this setting overrule the order type activities. In fact (as also stated on official documentation), &quot;If you specify that delivery notes must be printed for a particular warehouse (whwmd2100s000 - Shipments) then delivery notes are printed for orders requiring the issue of items from this warehouse, even though the warehousing procedure for these orders does not include delivery notes&quot;<br />
And this is regardless the order origin...</div></div><hr />
