<br />
Can i change ownership for items that aren't in compagny's warehouses ?<br />
We lends packaging to customers that are owned by one of our suppliers. We do this through a sales ordes.<br />
Normally, customer have to return it. And we have to return this package to the supplier.<br />
If not, we have to sell it to the customer. <br />
But; before this; i have to change item's ownership to &quot;compagny owned&quot;.<br />
Ownership change rule is based on time after the last transaction.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

You can try using a combination of Consigment (Not Owned) warehosue &amp; Consigment (Owned) warehouse along with handling unit setup for returnable packaging item.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, i have to avoid using handling unit in our system at this moment. it's a bit complicated and users are just starting using the system. so, i ll try to find other solution even if it would be a temporary one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are working on FP5 or FP6 version, you can use VMI Concept. That can slove your requirement with the help of &quot;Inventory Ownership Change&quot; order. There is also the provision of Time Based Ownership Change Order&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I already activated VMI concept and &quot;time based owneship change&quot; parameter. But &quot;time based owneship change&quot; did not worked. Infor told me that it is not fully functional on FP5 and i have to use FP6 instead.</div></div><hr />
