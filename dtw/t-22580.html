<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jeyps.ph</div><div class="date">10th December 2004, 02:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Invoice Data were successfully approved using tcedi7250m000 but executing processed saved messages to be received (tcedi7252m000) error occured while running the &quot;common session for incoming messages&quot; (tcedi7220s000). It finds tdpur045000 but we are expecting the receipts in a different company (co. 160). What reference does the session use that's why it looks in tdpur045000 instead of tdpur045160? Is there a data missing in our flat file for INVOIC.1, INVOIC.2, ... ? Or is there a way to correct this using the conversion setup? Hope anyone there can share their ideas... it will be appreciated greatly.</div></div><hr />

could it be a set up problem ?<br />
In which company do you run EDI ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">14th December 2004, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We had the same problem, but I don't recall eactly what it was, maybe:<br />
<br />
1: In case you have a multi-company setup: is it possible you test with invoices referencing purchase orders that do not exist in your testcompany ? It tries to find the company number from the purchase order header.<br />
2: Check that the 'default financial company' for the supplier has been set.<br />

robertvg: Yup, it searches for the Purchase Order. But that thing I could say is not a problem. I can see the data in the Dispatch Interim Table. And as for the financial company, the default was 000... I changed it to 160. And for added info, the financial company in the Purchase Order is 160.<br />
<br />
Guys, I can't think of any other reason for this error for the moment. I also tried interchanging the flat files since I made the customizations in this part. We are receiving the flat file in a different format. I am translating it to what BaaN EDI can understand. It seems I am the who can not understand the problem.  :D  :confused:  :( <br />
<br />
Well, thanks for the relpy. I am still open to accept ideas from you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">22nd December 2004, 12:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I recall why and how it was solved in our situation: we installed the ags0 Automotive localization. Before that, our EDI consultant traced the problem to library tfacpdll1250. Obviously in the ags0 version something has been solved that has not been solved in the standard version.<br />
