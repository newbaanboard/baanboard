<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">5th March 2002, 20:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible, when entering a sales order, to override the default commission relation that is established in session tdcms0119m000 (Maintain Default Relations by Customer)?<br />
<br />
We have a situation where the commissionable agent for a customer can vary between two different agents.  The same item can be sold by both agents, so we cannot take advantage of the session's ability to break down the commission by item. <br />
<br />
The only solution that we can come up with if we cannot override on an order-by-order basis is to create two separate customers in the system.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">5th March 2002, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you try the &quot;Maintain Relations by Order...&quot; choice under the &quot;Special&quot; menu on Maintain Sales Orders?  This should let you add/remove relations.  If you do this before calculating commissions on the order, it makes things easier.  (If you linked by lines rather than by order, there is a similar choice in the sales order line session).</div></div><hr />

We saw the option, but wasn't sure if it would actually override the default setup.  Sometimes when BaaN says &quot;default&quot; it really means unchangeable!   I'll give it a shot in our test environment and see if it will work.<br />

In their situaztion the external sales representive on the sales order should get the commission.<br />
<br />
So they want to make a link betweenh this field and the default commission relation.<br />
<br />
I made a question on the baan support site. The reply was that it didn't belong to the standard functionality.<br />
<br />
So for every order you have to change the default commission relation so that the right agent gets the commission</div></div><hr />

Not sure which version of BaaN you are using but I know under IVc2 there is a &quot;bug&quot; regarding the Maintain Relation by Order Line session.  Anytime you run this session from within the sales order, BaaN looks for the default relation and automatically links it - if there is one.  If you delete what is there and do NOT replace it with someone else (in otherwords leaving it &quot;blank&quot;), leave the session and then go back into it once again, it re-links it back to the default relation!  So you can never really use this session just to &quot;review&quot; what is linked to the line as it may alter what you want to be there.  This problem has been confirmed with BaaN support and there is no fix for it in BaaN IV.  If you need to review the info, better to look directly at the table itself (tdcms041m000).  <br />
We were going nuts with this trying to figure out why, after deleting relations manually from a sales order line they were reappearing!  BTW, if you manually insert a different relation from the default one, BaaN leaves it alone.  It is only when you try to leave it blank that it keeps filling in the default.<br />

<br />
Thanks so much for your response.  We too are running version 4C2, and have noticed the same problems that you stated.  There have been situations where I have tried to remove the defaulted commission, and like you stated, it reappears.  Glad to hear that it is possible to replace the default with a different relation - it should work for what we need to do.  We are going to try this in our test environment.<br />

Sometimes I think no one else uses BaaN commissions as it is very difficult to get answers on issues.  It took us over a year to finally get someone to help us (at BaaN support) with the posting of manual commissions as well as a bunch of other problems (finally got connected with Stephanie Russell and she was terrrif!) .  We did recently install a fairly new solution from BaaN as the result of our case that was open for over six months.  Don't know if you might want to consider doing same to make sure all of your objects/etc. are up to date with this module, but feel free to review solution 157003 in the BaaN Support Knowledge base to see some of the issues we were up against.  Also feel free to email me directly with any problems you run into -I'm no expert but maybe I've been thru it already and can point you in the right direction!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">19th March 2002, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Several of our clients use commissions in one way, shape, or form.  One even uses rebates:D !  However, most have found that they need to customize the functionality to get it to work.<br />
<br />
The automatic linking can be problematic.  You could try adding the display version of that session (Display Relations by Order Line - tdcms0541s000) to the zoom menu (tdsls00009017).  That way, people can look without automatically changing the data.</div></div><hr />

A warning for all those who are deleting salesorders (Baan IVc4):<br />
a salesorder with total amount = Zero and an automatic link to a relation never gets calculated (standard functionality). When you delete salesorder and salesorder history the link between order and relation will not be deleted! In case you use the order series again the new salesorder is in a way 'prelinked' to the wrong relation. The automatic link process doesn't generate an error message like 'Duplicate Value in tdcms040' or something like that.<br />
We were lucky to discover this effect just before running the final calculation for a large number of salesorders.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindan</div><div class="date">20th March 2002, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Folks  -<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of the feedback yesterday.  I agree, the entire commission package in BaaN is cumbersome at best, and it is very difficult to get good answers from BaaN Support.  We have installed several patches due to situations that have cropped up, and very few of them solved our initial problems.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the warning about the links not breaking when sales order numbers are reused.   We are going to be archiving this year, and will begin to re-use some of our order series.  We will address this problem with our consultants.  Was a case logged with BaaN Support concerning this?<br />
<br />
I will be logging a case with BaaN support concerning a new type of commission error that has reared it's ugly head - if commission is calculated on a zero-dollar line, it is creating an error stating &quot;No agreement Found&quot;, even if the setup is correct.  We have tried to manually enter the zero dollar commision and process, but the error keeps recurring.  We have been live on BaaN since 1998, and this problem just started :mad:   If any of you are experiencing the same situation, let me know and I'll keep you posted on what I hear from BaaN Support.<br />
<br />
Talk to you all soon!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">21st March 2002, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Linda,<br />
indeed, we experienced a similiar problem at the end of last year. Not the agreement was missing but an orderline was cancelled within the salesorder (record with ckor= 2 in tdsls051). Try the solutions #156917 and #157076 or simply install the latest object.<br />
It's true that it's difficult to find experienced Baan Support staff for the CMS package. At the end of 2001 we had serious new (as you also mentioned) problems during the calculation process. The only way to find the problems was to debug the session for ourselves. Once we detected the error in the code we recieved a quick solution from Baan. It took over a month until all problems were solved - actually too long if commission is part of the salary of the sales staff.<br />
<br />
In case of the unbroken links we created our own 'cleanup' session for table tdcms040. Probably a faster way than to wait for an offical solution. We were told that the complete package is going to be completly reviewed for one of the next releases.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the info concerning the patch numbers.  I will go to the website and take a look at them.  We had installed new objects in June of 2001, but it's very possible that changes have been made since then.  <br />
<br />
I attend BaaN World Users meetings in Cleveland Ohio, and I will  request that commissions be a featured topic at an upcoming meeting.  I'll keep you posted if any good information comes out of it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">21st March 2002, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">We have done a couple of things for different clients.  Like Martin, we created a clean up program.  We also modified things to allow $0 commissions.  This was motivated by a client requirement to allow pro rata (percentage) splits amongst one or more relations (e.g., relation A gets 25% of the commission and relation B get 75%).  In some cases, they want to know that a person is associated with a commission, even if that person's share is $0.  Overages (additional commission based upon the &quot;book&quot; price versus the &quot;sell&quot; price) also complicate things for some clients.<br />
<br />
I think the concept in standard Baan is OK, it just requires some tweaking (OK, sometimes you need to tweak it with a sledgehammer;) )<br />
<br />
Good luck.  I hope the patches help out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">12th April 2002, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Linda,<br />
Baan now offers an interesting solution for all those who calculate commission/rebates on cummulative sales. In session tdcms1200m000 you can select a range of year/periodtable/period to avoid calculation when periods haven't been finished yet. I did a few tests and found it working pretty good.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the info concerning the new patch.  I was hoping to be able to research and test the ones that you had mentioned earlier, but with the dreaded April 15th tax deadline fast approaching, I've been pull away from this project and have been living in tax return hell. :)   <br />
<br />
I'm hoping to put my BaaN hat back on in the near future and jump back into this.  I'll keep you posted with my findings.<br />
