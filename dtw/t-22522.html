<br />
Is there a way to only allow user who creates the orders to<br />
modify the order?<br />
Currently, all users can enter the maintain orders session and change<br />
other users' orders.<br />
<br />
Does the new version Baan5 or Baan6 have this functionality?<br />
<br />
thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

In 6.1 an approval of a purchase order is required and approval rules can be defined. It might help a bit but again it is not dealing with your need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanguyz</div><div class="date">3rd December 2004, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Please check with table tdpur051 inwhich you have a field for baan login and with this field you can work in tools management part for authorization for inserting / modifying the data.<br />
<br />
Hope this answers your query.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply but I don't understand how to do this.<br />
<br />
Since it is another table tdsls050, how am i to do it in table/data authorization. <br />
<br />
Writing in a program will be no problem but I do not have the script.<br />
But doing it in the table/data authorization way is not my cup of tea.<br />
<br />
Could you help me by guiding me.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please check at you end, hope this resolves your problem.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.<br />

<br />
I tried to test it with the data authorization but am not successful.<br />
Baanguy, can you explain what you mean.<br />
<br />
Others, if you understand, could you test it and give me a solution to this.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />
