<br />
We have a requirement as follows :<br />
Our Lot ID structure was defined as 112299999<br />
11 - week number<br />
22 - Year (2 digits)<br />
99999 - running serial number<br />
<br />
Due to the above what happens is that the Lot received in week 45 of 2008 gets the code of 450800001 and the lot of the same item received in week 23 of 2009 gets the code of 230900001.<br />
<br />
Now if you see the following are the lot codes available for outbound :<br />
230900001<br />
450800001<br />
<br />
When we do a Generate outbound advice for this item, the lot that gets picked first is the 230900001. Which is not correct.<br />
<br />
All our Items outbound priority is &quot;By Location&quot;. As I understand, within location it will then search by Lot numbers and the result is that the older lot remains in the system and the recent lot gets issued.<br />
<br />
In order to correct this we want to modify the Lot ID structure to :<br />
11 -  Year (2 digits)<br />
22 -  week number<br />
99999 - running serial number<br />
<br />
This way for the same example the lot numbers would be <br />
084500001 instead of 450800001  and<br />
092300001 instead of  230900001.<br />
<br />
This would solve our problem. But when I try to change the settings, the record doesn't get saved and prompts an error message &quot;position already occupied&quot;.<br />
<br />
I would like to know if any one has succesfully done this change and if so how ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chudamani</div><div class="date">29th June 2009, 05:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Changing the outbound priority is not recommended since we still want it by location but within location by Lots. Moreover the session to change the outbound priority is damn slow and cannot be completed on time unless we do it Item by item. We can't do it item by item as we have more than 50000 items in our item master. <br />
<br />
So that is why we want to change the way Lot numbers are created.</div></div><hr />
