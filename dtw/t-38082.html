My fresh installation keeps throwing the attached error message whenever i try to open or access an existing sales order line. The error message says to check the cisli240 table. Upon checking i found no record in either cisli240 or cisli245. I had followed the installation and post installation tasks but for the second time running i have missing data in these tables. I cant even make an order because it throws a message saying that the selected department(sales office) is not found in the company. Upon checking, it was found that the sales office is defined in the company and attached to the customer.<br />
 <br />
What could be wrong and how can i set things right? All the other modules seems ok except for this one. <br />
 <br />
Please let me know..<br />

Also make sure that all the tbales are created in the demo company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">26th June 2007, 14:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Maria...The enterprise unit session was blank without any units defined. After defining an Enterprise unit it allowed me to save the sales header part. The next problem came at warehouse(while entering sales order lines) when it said the enterprise unit is not defined for the warehouse selected. I checked the warehouse and found that the unit mentioned there doesnt exist in the Enterprise Unit session. How come the Demo data is soo messsed up like this?<br />
 <br />
All the tables were created as part of a post installation task and so there must be an explanation as to why some data is missing....<br />

In that CD at document describes....&quot;How to set up a company in ERP LN6.1&quot;. If so, follow this guide to set up or check company 090.<br />
<br />
Always better to start with a fresh company using this guide. You can always take over some of the standard mcs or com tables from company 090.<br />
<br />
If you are not in the possesion of this company, please let me know then I can forward it.<br />

Succes,<br />

I do have the documentation Cd. After going through most of them, i didnt quite find any thing that advocates a 090 company check or any reported errors. Are you having any of this problem with 090 co at your place?<br />
