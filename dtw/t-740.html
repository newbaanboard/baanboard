I have an automotive manufacturer client, they are using same parts coming from different suppliers with different part numbers. The alternative items is an option in Baan IVc3 is an option to record this. As much as I checked, issue to production does not consider those alternatives with sufficient inventory if the original item does not exist.<br />
Question is how those items are handled for such automotive client implementations?<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 17:42</div></div><div class="posttext">That is correct.  The move to alternate is not automatic.  There have been several customizations that have added that functionality.  It is also part of Baan V.  <br />
