<br />
There is an issue related with Purchase Return Order receipt.<br />
I've maintained &quot;-5&quot; quantity in Purchase Return Order &amp; process the order,while doing maintain receipt i found that system already picked up the Packing slip quantity as &quot;-5&quot; but as i moved to delivered quantity &quot;-5&quot; and tried to save the data system gave me message that Available Inventory is &quot;0&quot;.<br />
After this I'd checked in the system &amp; found that for the particular Item quantity on hand was &quot;5&quot;.<br />
Then what would be reason that system not allowining to enter &quot;-5&quot; in the maintain receipt.<br />
If some one already faced this kind of problem then please let me know the solution for this...<br />
I'm working on Baan4b4.<br />
Now if the order is already been preocessed with the quantity &quot;0&quot; in both delivered &amp; backorder then what would be the solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance............<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
In Baan, you should handle it through &quot;Delivery&quot; session or Outbound Session.<br />

Still an issues.....Check inventory if inventory in all other relevant tables is accurate. e.g. compare inventory in inv, ilc, ltc &amp; itm modules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanguyz</div><div class="date">14th September 2006, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I fully agree with Ksande. The inventory that is being shown to you must have been in the same warehouse but would have been in different location so you are requested to check the same to the location level and process.</div></div><hr />
