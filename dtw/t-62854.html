<br />
Good Morning,<br />
<br />
When we making a Purchase (Domestic) Order, we need to add some condition e.g. Packing &amp; Forwarding Charges, Freight Extra, Tooling Advance etc. through Customized session as a Remarks.<br />
<br />
Is there any field available in the ERP to utilize these charges direct linked in PO Header Level or PO Line Level.<br />
<br />
I try to use the additional Charges in Domestic Order, but not get the success.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rohan Kumar</div><div class="date">8th October 2012, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">The purchase order additional charges can be added to the PO header and can be apportioned to the lines through the session tdpur9137m01l, also the additional charges can be applied directly to the PO line through the session tdpur9138m01l or to the split deliveries at the time of receipt. <br />
<br />
If you do not want to add the additional charges at the time of purchase order creation and order splitting then the additional charges need to be added or defined at the time of receipt. In the session Actual Additional Charges at Receipt (tdpur9138m02l) you can define the additional charge for the split line individually.<br />
<br />
If you wish to add any remarks then it can be entered in the &quot;Reference&quot; field of the PO header and this will appear in the PO print.</div></div><hr />
