So if a partial receipt is made by warehousing the system is automatically creating a backkorder for the balance - this is parameter driven and fine.  If then we decide to cancel the back order how do we do it?  You cannot delete the PO line because there has already been some receipt against it and there is no session equivalent to tdpur4130m000.<br />

Thanks in advance:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have a partial receipt that is final, Baan wil make a backorder line in tdpur4501m200 P.O. line details. You will have a &quot;detail&quot; line and a second &quot;backorder&quot; line.There you can use the &quot;delete&quot; button and delete the back order line.<br />
<br />
It does work differently from Baan 4 of ERP LN.<br />

It isn't a session on any standard menu so I assume it has been added at some point, but it will save us a lot of time to do it this way.<br />

Thanks :)</div></div><hr />
