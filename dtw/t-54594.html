    I'm having a problem in the sales order delivery, and need help please. I created a sales order with the ship complete flag set to &quot;Yes&quot;. The sales order has three positions. Position #s 10, and 30 are cost items for freight exxpenses, and pos. # 20 is for manufactured sales item. The physical item in pos. # 20 is lot controlled item by lot. So, I maintained outbound and released for posi. # 20, When I enter in the maintain delivery session to change confirm flag to yes for posi. # 20, and to complete delivery for the remaining positions, the system doesn't allow, and gives message &quot;Order must be delievred completely&quot;.How to deliver all the items, and any adise on this issue please.<br />
Thanks in advance for the help.<br />

<br />
As you are using Cost Items in your SO, u can't perform the outbound process on these two items, you hav to use Maintain Delivery process for the issuance of these cost Item.<br />
