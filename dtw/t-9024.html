<br />
We are running BAAN IV version B40c.58 and my question is:<br />
<br />
Is there any way of changing the Quantity Ordered on a sales order after the orders status has reached &quot;Deleting Lines&quot;.<br />
We have a Sales order showing a qty of 1 still owing, but it was shipped on another order and the backorder was not maintained on the original order.<br />
<br />
any takers??<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once first shipment is made, order quantity can't be changed anymore. If you shipped partially, then after every partial shipment, the sales rep should decide whether the back order should still be delivered or not. The sales rep may or may not need to consult with the customer regarding this matter. If the back order is to be sent, then the sales rep confirm the back order quantity to be sent. Otherwise, the sales rep set the back order quantity to 0 and practically close that line.<br />
<br />
Hence, in your case, you can't decrease the order quantity, but you can change the back order quantity to 0.<br />

<br />
unfortunately in this case we can't delete the backorder as the actual sales order has gone all the way through to invoicing and when we try to maintain backorder there are no more references to the sales order.<br />

Is there any error message when you try to delete it?<br />

<br />
tdsls045 will indicate the status of all lines (pono's).  Partial shipments are shown in dqua field - any balance is shown in bqua. It is this value that is used by 'Confirm backorder' to generate another line with the desired oqua quantity or the back order can be deleted in which case there will be no outstanding oqua value for the order line generated.<br />
<br />
If you wish to ship some additional quantity against this order it should be possible to add another (new) line to the order<br />
