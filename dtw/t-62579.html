<br />
When I create a PO line that link to a Contract, the field ‘Called Quantity’ in session Purchase Contract Results (tdpur3513m000) is increased by the quantity of the PO line.<br />
<br />
With the same action, I am expecting to see a new record in session Turnover History by Purchase Contract (tdpur3535m000) showing the PO number. I did not see this happen. A record will be inserted into this session only after the receipt has been created. Even with this, the field ‘Called Quantity’ is still zero. <br />
<br />
Can someone help to explain this ? I am on BaanVc5.<br />
<br />
Thank in advance.</div></div><hr />
