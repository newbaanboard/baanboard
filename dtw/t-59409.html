<br />
In case of Purchase receipts, the Activity maintained in the WH order type is Receipts , Inbound Advice and Put away. But for a particular Receipt which is already confirmed now, i checked the activity in the INbound order lines and its showing only Receipts (Missing the other 2 ). When i tried to do put away , it says already doen for this order. <br />
<br />
Now due to this effect, my qty is remianing in the Receipt location and i cant now move it to the BULK location.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone let me know whats the reason behind this ? Also please give me a suggestion on how to move this quantity to a Bulk location. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
These activities are created at the time of releasing the PO to warehouse module and will be applicable only to those items in which you have defined the item as location controlled in the warehousing data. Also the warehouse must have locations.<br />
<br />
In your case may be the item is not defined as location controlled so the activities did not get created. Since the receipt is already confirmed you cannot update the activities as &quot;applicable&quot; now. Try running the session whwmd6290m000 with the item code and location code in which you want to update the inventory, first in the simulate mode and update if the quantities are matching.<br />

Thanks for the reply. I checked with the simulate mode in the session whwmd6290m000. It gave the appropriate quantities in the locations. If i run this on update mode, will this affect any other tables / process apart from changing the inventories in the Receiving location and Bulk location? <br />

Thx</div></div><hr />

One more query on the same issue. Both my warehouse and item are location controlled. So why have my activities changed automatically for the Inbound lines ?<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will update only the inventory related tables. No problem in updating.<br />
<br />
Regarding the second query, sometimes the data does not get updated properly. After releasing the PO to warehouse, if warehouse is changed from a location controlled to non- location controlled or vice-versa, the activities are over written in warehouse order. In your case may be this has not happened.<br />
