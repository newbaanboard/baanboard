<br />
Even in BaanERP 5.0c, such report, unfortunately, are not readily available built in. You'd have to perform customisation to get one<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmlim77</div><div class="date">12th June 2003, 05:44</div></div><div class="posttext">my company is using customize Open PO in Baan. However, becareful before you start for to customize the session for print this report. Think about what you are require, such as by buyer or by PO or .... Because my company have 2 session ( by buyer and by supplier) for print this report. Unfortunately, not useful for user because they looking for by order number.<br />
<br />
End up, we are using Oracle report writer to write for it. Why don't you use report writer? Better format option. Example, table format (no repeating header) is easier for export in excel file or Crosstab format with XY view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
backorders should be included in 4403 - with the backorder quantity of course. That's the main reason why it's worth customizing this particular report: all necessary features are included (and standard Baan :cool: ) and need not to be reinvented.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

I think a simple query on tdinv150 Planned Inventory Transactions should solve your problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">18th June 2003, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't believe that tdinv150 will give you Cost Items. So if the requirement is for an overall open PO report, not just inventory items, you will still have to work through the PUR tables.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">19th June 2003, 03:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Scott's advice is good. <br />
<br />
As a general principle: if you want purchase details then the purchase tables are the best use. Similarly inventory/ilc tables for inventory; sales tables for sales; etc etc...  <br />
<br />
In many situations it may also  be necessary/useful to also use additional tables from other modules to get the complete story. <br />
<br />
One of the great vitues of baan is its underlying data structure. <br />
