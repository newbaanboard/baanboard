I send to a customer an item but I don't really sell it to him, the customer can use this item for a limited period of time (usually 1 year) without paying anything (so the item is still mine). At the end of this time the customer decides what he wants to do. He can buy this item (and so he has to pay, I send to him the invoice, and so the customer becomes the owner of the item) or he can give me the item back (and so the ownership never changes all along the time).<br />
Moreover I want to track:<br />
- Which are the items in this situation;<br />
- Which are the customers in this situation;<br />
- How long it has passed for each &quot;temporary expedition&quot;.<br />
I have installed the italian localization.<br />
I saw that there is the opportunity to define a warehouse as (consignement) or (consignement.own): is this the case to use it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not knowing the exact item, I think the best way to model this is simply creating one normal warehouse (that's set to be ignored by EP) for each such customer. Transfer the stock there when sending the item to customer for trial. When he/she wants to buy it, make an SO for it specifying the customer warehouse as source for shipment. If he/she doesn't want it, simply transfer it back<br />
<br />
Using consignment will also work, but it's just more complicated. You have to create consignment replenishment SO when sending the item for trial by customer. Then when the customer decides to buy it, you'll have to make consignment invoicing SO. IF the customer doesn't want it however, you'll have to make a return consignment replenishment SO. Using consignment features, however, will give you the following benefits:<br />
 You can't send the item to wrong warehouse, since each consignment warehouse has business partner attached to it<br />
 The documents are produced properly, i.e. on sending the item for trial only packing slip is produced (no invoice), while on customer actually buying only invoice is produced (no packing slip)<br />

I've already implemented the menagement you suggested to me but using only 1 warehouse with location (one for each customer and each location has the same code as the BP). I'd like to known how Baan V can solve this case.<br />
Can you give me further information or some documentation about?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion, that's already a good and simple design. But you can give consignment features a try if you think the benefits are worth the extra effort. The material on consignment is already part of standard BaanERP training material package<br />
