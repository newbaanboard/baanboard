<br />
I am testing the Inventory Valuation against an Item with quantities which is linked to a new Business Partner which is also set as Internal BP (GMLF01)<br />
<br />
I ran an outbound process w/o problems and for a specific TEST item I want to have the inventory valuation against the itme and the Buy-From BP which happened to be also the internal BP<br />
<br />
However, in the valuation report output there is no mention of the Buy-From BP at all only the ITEM quantity in stock and the totla valuation cost<br />
<br />
I checked on some of the options such as &quot;Print Buy-from BP Details&quot; and the Include Inventory Ownership &quot;Consigned&quot;but the BP does not come up<br />
<br />
I would like the BP be reported in the inventory valuation report.<br />
<br />
That BP also INTERNAL BP is also activated as Buy-From BP.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help<br />
<br />
Best regards <br />
<br />
