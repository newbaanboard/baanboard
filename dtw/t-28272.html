What will be the way out if I want to purchase from this supplier in different currency.<br />
<br />
Using multiple supplier code is not prefer.<br />

Any suggestion are appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. You could define price lists in other currencies and choose on of them when placing the order. (This is manual ==&gt; don't forget to do it at order entry)</div></div><hr />

The only issue would be that the currency would have to be changed manually in the second form of the Maintain Purchase Order session before the items are included. <br />

<br />
I do understand that BaaN will automatically convert the price (fr. ITM or tdpur032) to the price in the PO. However, we do not want the price to be influenced by the currency rate fluctuation . That why we hope we can have pricing in different currency.<br />
<br />
I though of using tdpur0104m000. I can define different price list for different currency. But then, how can I assign multiple price list to a supplier ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">2nd October 2006, 07:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
  You can create as many pricelist as you want but when you raise a purchase order, you can attach only one of them to the order just in the same fashion as having one single currency for an order. So if you need to include different pricelist for a supplier, you might as well create that many purchase orders.<br />
If you have currency rates defined then regardless of which currency your pricelist is in, it uses the latest conversion rates defined in the currency rates table when it writes to the financial tables..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">7th October 2006, 00:32</div></div><div class="posttext">In either case (two suppliers vs. two price lists) there is a manual intervention required, either the user has to manually enter the supplier or the price list. I would go for manually selection of the price list in purchase orders. I believe that there should be some calculation done before deciding as in what currency the order should be released and hence the user should be well aware and the chances of incorrect price list being picked up is very remote. Having multiple supplier with different currencies will complicate the life of finance users.<br />
