I Had a little problem regarding of maintain approval.<br />
I'm using ILC Implemented. Usually when receiving item with inspection = yes and haven't approved yet. The item is in default inspection location with quantity blocked = quantity received. And if approval is made for those receipt, the received quantity moved from inspection to receipt quantity so that we can inbound it to real location.<br />
<br />
Lately, even after getting approval, the quantity is still in inspection location at blocked quantity, even though i already follow the order steps. Is there any way to fix this? or is there any step that i missed? Please help, and thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

And my inventory got transfer from INSP location to RECEIPT location.<br />
But can anybody throw some light on this, in which conditions, after Maitaining Approavls, the item gets block, and why?<br />
Because this is the not case for each and every items, so want to understand th reason of blocking and not getting tranfer of inventory to Receipt location.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walchan_risti</div><div class="date">14th May 2009, 10:05</div></div><div class="posttext">well, the reason for blocking is because that item must be inspect before move to receipt location. why even after inspected (of course with some quantity approved), the item not move, maybe because ILC module is implemented.<br />
<br />
in my company, i've got two company code, one using ILC (Location Control) implemented, and the another is using INV (Inventory Control) implemented. when using INV implemented, after maintain approval, the inventory moved from blocked to on hand. So i think  that problem only occur when you implemented ILC<br />
