This concerns the output of the MRP generation procedure. All planned MRP purchase orders are automatically planned against the supplier on the item master, has anyone enhanced baan to plan orders in a certain ratio for one purchased item over a number of suppliers for example. I think the term used by our buyers/procurers is &quot;dual-sourcing&quot; or &quot;co-sourcing&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vavs123</div><div class="date">4th September 2002, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you using supply chian functionality?  If you are you can have two contracts for the same item with a percentage going to each.  If the suppier priority is equal on both contracts the quantity percentage will determine how much of the requirement goes to each supplier.  I have not tried it when the supplier priority is unequal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">5th September 2002, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply vavs123, can you tell me a little more, such as:<br />
<br />
Are the planned MRP purchase orders already allocated to the various suppliers as indicated in the contract or are the suppliers only allocated when those orders are confirmed and transfered to the PUR module?<br />
<br />
When can you come down here and implement? :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baaner</div><div class="date">11th September 2002, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
In the contracts contained in PSC (Purchase supply chain module) you can establish different percentage (pe 60-40) for each supplier. This works fine (it doesn´t have to be the same percentage). <br />
<br />
In the case this module is implemented the MRP does not create planned MRP purchase orders, but planned MRP purchase schedules. Each schedule is created with the quantity and the frequency, as well as the reception calendar established in the SCH contract.<br />
<br />
The allocation is made just as if you were working with &quot;normal&quot; planned purchase orders, you can see it in either timrp010 or tdinv700, both tables are updated.<br />
<br />
hope it helps...<br />

You don't happen to have any literature for PSC do you :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baaner</div><div class="date">11th September 2002, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I do, the typical module description. I have also a more detailed documentation, but I´m afraid it´s in spanish :-(... if you want it, just tell.<br />

<br />
Thanks, you're being a great help:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baaner</div><div class="date">12th September 2002, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hope it helps... its a little old (I was young and all that...), but the functionality hasn´t changed that much, so it will give you an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">12th September 2002, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Baaner, a quick question - has the PSC functionality been incorporated into standard baan at any version, the reason I'm asking is that we're about to migrate to B40_c4 from B40_b2 and I'm curious if PSC hasn't become part of c4. I can report back that our buyers/procurers are very interested in what they've read.<br />
<br />
Once again thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baaner</div><div class="date">12th September 2002, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, my fault for not giving the whole explantion... The Supply Chain module in Baan is an extension. This means it does not come with the standard application, but it´s a whole new VRC. If you are interested in the functionality think about including it before the migration, because the c4 installation has to include this new modules... The best you can do is ask your reseller (if you have one) about prices of the extension and so on.<br />
<br />
If you have any more questions, just tell.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">12th September 2002, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">In IVc4 it is in the extensions SCC,SCH1,NAS and AGS.  It was standard in 5 until they disabled it in one of the service pack as they were having problems getting it to work properly, don't know if they have fixed it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baaner</div><div class="date">12th September 2002, 12:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I donn´t think it´s ready yet... at least a couple of months ago it wasn´t. About the extensions, for supply chain only SCH1 is mandatory (and for my experience this is usually the one implemented). I only know about 4 or 5 installations of  Supply Chain Controlling (SCC), though in Germany it´s quite usual to implement... and about NASCAR and AGS, I have to say I´ve never implemented it or seen it working...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rupertb</div><div class="date">13th September 2002, 09:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help so far, I've just been informed that PSC won't work with the advanced planning module/finite scheduling - can anyone confirm that?<br />
