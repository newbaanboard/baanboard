<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TebbyTan</div><div class="date">16th February 2008, 12:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Already confirm but just that seem like-<br />
<br />
Order qty Item A = 100<br />
Order qty Item B = 100<br />
Warehouse receipt = Item A 50 &amp; confirmed<br />
Warehouse receipt = Item B 100 &amp; cofirmed<br />
<br />
However, in Purchase Order we can only print Item B for the Purchase Invoice. Item A can only print when another 50 has received &amp; confirm.<br />
<br />
Any idea?<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the balance stock will have to confirm in the back order.<br />
<br />
So thanks to all of you, my problem at least now solved with the final receipts.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to automatically confirm your back order, the final receipts box must be ticked regardless of the quantity received.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, as you say, the back order must be maintained before anything else can be done with the line.</div></div><hr />
