<br />
I did a receipt for the PO line with a cost item. Instead of receiving 5 pc, I received all the 100 pc that is ordered with this PO line. The receipt has been confirmed.<br />
<br />
Anyone can advise how can I reverse this transaction.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I suppose the return order you mentioned is a normal purchase order but with a negative order quantity.<br />
<br />
Is that also mean finance need to create dummy invoice and credit note for this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">12th July 2007, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you are right. This will be a normal purchase order. However, i would recommend the creation of a new order type whch can be set up as return order within the order type creation session. You can select the bare minimum steps like, printing the order, maintain receipts and print invoice in it. When you create the return purchase order, select this return order type. Once the order is received..go ahead with the printing of invoices and processing it just like a normal purchase order..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">john1998</div><div class="date">28th July 2007, 00:03</div></div><div class="posttext">In Receipts (whinh3520m000) you can highlight the incorrect entry and try clicking on Specific \ Correction \ Correct Receipt Line (whinh3121s000).  You can then correct the quantity.    <br />
<br />
Receipt Corrections are new functionality in 5.2 and LN<br />
<br />
If A/P has matched an invoice to the PO or processed delivered purchase orders has been run then this functionality will be disabled and you'll have to do a return purchase order.</div></div><hr />
