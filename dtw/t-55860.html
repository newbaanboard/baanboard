<br />
I am trying to come up with a report that shows a comparison of purchase order line item quantity/ amount, the quantity received/ amount to date and financial invoiced quantity/ amount to date.<br />
<br />
I am unable to find table that is related to all these three quantities. <br />
<br />
Any ideas? Thank you.<br />

Print Variance Analysis (tfacp1460m000) may be the closest but that will only include PO lines that have had receipts and doesn't include the PO line qty.<br />
<br />
I also don't think there is one table that has all of that detail but you can see it in the PO Lines session (tdpur4100m900) by viewing the information in the Order Lines, Receipts and Payables Receipts tabs, so it should be possible to build a report that consolidates the quantities and amounts from the tables as used in tdpur4100m900. Check to see if you can build your report from the following tables:<br />
<br />
 tdpur401 (Purchase Order Lines)<br />
 tdpur406 (Purchase Actual Receipts)<br />
 tdpur430 (Purchase Payable Receipts for Orders and Schedules)<br />
<br />
If you need any detail from the PO header to tidy up the report, add tdpur400 to the list.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alternately, you may be able to use the history tables:<br />
<br />
 tdpur451 (Purchase Order Lines History)<br />
 tdpur456 (Purchase Actual Receipts History)<br />
 tdpur460 (Purchase Payables Receipts History)<br />
