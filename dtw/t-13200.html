<br />
there was a purchase order, after Maintain Receipts<br />
<br />
for which the Generate Inbound was not generating the inbound.<br />
<br />
for the same order, under same run number when I did maintain inbound data, it went through.<br />
<br />
why it happens, any idea. Because I dont know how many more order lines left with this problem.<br />
<br />
thanks to throw some light<br />

Just want to make sure it is in the correct forum.  Second you may want to make sure you have the latest object for this session.  Do you have the code where you could put it in debug mode?  I have not seen a case where maintain works when generate did not work - unless of course the user did not fill out all of the appropriate fields.  Did you try the generate by hand?<br />

<br />
sorry it is not an AFS session.<br />
<br />
It is the standard Generate Inbound  Advice (tdilc4203m000) which is not generating the inbound.<br />
<br />
the same is ok when I Maintain Inbound Data (tdilc4103m000) for the same order, lines.<br />
<br />
Same info used in both the places like run number, order number etcc.  Location not blocked, supplier no problem, order no problem. Anyway how it is then allowing me to Maintain Inbound Data. Thanks for any clues.<br />

Just some more possibilities of the problem.<br />
1) Have you setup storage capacities for the locations. And some warning/blocking for exceeding capacities?<br />
2) Is the purchase order with inspection? Becuase I remember if inspectino is there, then order type should be changed from &quot;Purchase Order&quot; to &quot;Inventory Transfer&quot;.<br />
