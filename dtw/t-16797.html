<br />
I&#8217;m suffering with inventory table gaps. Somehow for some itens inventory values into the following tables tdinv001, tdilc101 and tiitm001 are not the same.<br />
I&#8217;ve found out 3 causes of these differences:<br />
 - Reception not completed (1, 2, 3&#8230;. Packages miss) <br />
 - Item transfer not completed (1, 2, 3&#8230;. Packages miss)<br />
 - Scrap management &#8211; specific session developed here<br />
<br />
People noticed that at cycle counting procedure. After that we adopted tdinv0252m000 at daily JOB to show every case of problem.<br />
<br />
But my problem is the following: We cannot force people issue Cycle Counting orders to fix it. Otherwise we&#8217;ll lose manpower to fix this BUG and assure inventory level.<br />
 <br />
What is the best procedure to fix this problem? <br />
I know that tdinv0252m000 considers tdilc101 to fix inventory value, is this always correct?<br />
How we can avoid a cycle counting order to fix inventory tables? <br />
Once a problem take place we&#8217;ll not have stock on hand the sum of receipt &#8211; sum of production +/- sum of inventory adjustments. <br />
<br />
Thank you ! :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just one more question: <br />
Applying those sessions it is really not necessary an inventory check? <br />
It means open a cycle counting order....<br />
<br />
Best regards, Gus</div></div><hr />

<br />
Background information about few sessions:<br />
<br />
tdinv0250m000 - To correct on-order and allocation at the item/wrh level and at item level. It is safe to run this session, assuming nobody is in the system.<br />
<br />
Note: You can use tdcor0250m000 in case if you want to know which order has updated the on-order / allocated wrongly. If you see a pattern, then you should patch the session which is causing the problem, so that you can avoid running the tdinv0250m000 or tdcor0250m000 in the future. Please note that tdcor0250m000 will be slower than tdinv0250m000, as we don't have index based on item.<br />
<br />
tdilc0250m000 - To correct on-order, allocation and blocking at the location level. It is safe to run this session, assuming nobody is in the system.<br />
<br />
tdinv0252m000 - It is Ok to run the session in non-update mode. It is NOT OK to run the session in update mode.<br />
<br />
The reason why you cannot use tdinv0252m000 in update mode is because it will create valuation difference between finance and logistics.<br />
<br />
For eg, tdinv001 says 10 pcs and tdilc101 says 15 pcs. Most probably, finance will have value for 10 pcs, because the DLL which updates tdinv001, updates finance also. In this scenario, if you use tdinv0252m000 to update tdinv001, it will move to 15 pcs. Now, logitics will say the inventory value is $150 (assuming $10 per pcs), but finance will say $100 dollar !!<br />
<br />
As said before, use tdinv0252m000 for detection and use other modified cycle couting program, which will update tdinv001 and finance module without touching tdilc101 or you can do the other way also. <br />
<br />
PS: Normal cycle counting orders will update tdinv001, tdilc101 and finance at the same time. This is not useful when tdilc101 and tdinv001 are out of sync.</div></div><hr />
