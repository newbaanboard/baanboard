<br />
I understand this is the way the text is handled when Sales Quotations are generated from PCF.<br />
<br />
1.Create Sales Quotation Text : flag is Yes in PCF Parameter.<br />
<br />
2. Whilst changing the Options for a generic Item with  theProduct Configurator the following question will appear:&quot;Generate sales quotation text for product variant? No&quot;<br />
If you choose&quot; Yes&quot; an Option Text is generated within the Text Manager. <br />
<br />
This Text will appear in table tipcf510 with the same Text number as in the Text Manager.<br />
Next session tipcf5250s000 Generate Product Variant Structure for Sales Quotations is used again a Text is generated which is the same but with another Textnumber.<br />
<br />
This is the PCF Article Text which will be written into tipcs002.txta as an Calculation Parts Text.<br />
Also registered in tipcs0110m000 Maintain Calculation Parts, second form.<br />
<br />
With help of tttxt1400m000 Print Texts you also can find where Text used.<br />
<br />
Mind the fact that the user has a Default Text group as defined in tttxt1113m000 Maintain Default Text Group by User. <br />
<br />
Hope this info helps you.<br />
