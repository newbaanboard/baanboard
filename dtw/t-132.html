<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">3rd September 2001, 02:53</div></div><div class="posttext">(with thanks to patvdv for his quick response)<br />
<br />
I am in the process of converting data from our Legacy system to Baan 5.0b<br />
To convert our inventory I create cycle count order(line)s on the fly and load these in the appropriate lots.<br />
<br />
The problem starts when I have multiple receipts in a single lot. When this happens, the inventory valuation only accounts for the first receipt in a lot, even though all inventory levels seem to be ok.<br />
<br />
After further investigation, it appears that table (lots by warehouse) whltc105 runs out of sync with the rest of the inventory tables. Because we dealt with inventory problems before, we tried Baan's correction program ocor0200 and it did repair the inventory valuation.<br />
<br />
The Baan correction program changes the storage units to eaches btw, very undesirable in our situation.<br />
<br />
I guess my question really is...&quot;what's up with whltc105?&quot;<br />
<br />
Has anybody else struggled with this table? Why does Baan fix the symptons but not the disease? What exactly is causing the inventory tables to become corrupted?<br />
<br />
Please....do share.</div></div><hr />
