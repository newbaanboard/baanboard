<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hendrik</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 19:49</div></div><div class="posttext">IÂ´ve got one datafile with several relation in severals organizations. The question is, how detected Baan the correct organization in the datafile. In my example in each case only one organization is detected, even if this is missing in the message. <br />
What is wrong??<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">30th October 2001, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">The Organization is linked to the EDI message, vide session 'Maintain Supported EDI Messages'. Both Organisation and EDI message is linked to the Network and Relation vide session 'Maintain EDI Messages Supported by Relations'.<br />
Check for the setup of  Organizations coming in the file, in the above mentioned sessions . This is in Baan IV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prademaker</div><div class="date">28th December 2001, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally in BaaN each relation is linked to an organisation. This means setup the &quot;connection&quot; between the two using session tcedi0110m000.<br />
This is not very convenient as we wanted to allow all our customers to order through our web-shop. The orders placed have to be transfered to BaaN through the EDI module. Instead of creating a record relation/customer for each customer i've create a record with a dummy customer. In the EDI-message, in the part &quot;global overhead&quot; I'm refering to this dummy. In the orderheader however I'm using the real customer. This works great without having to worry about adding records in the table for each new customer.</div></div><hr />
