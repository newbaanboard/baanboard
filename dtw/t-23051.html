<br />
I've got a strange scenario regarding the way Baan IVc4 searches for Prices and Discounts. One of our users claims that, in the past she has set up discounts for a child customer that has been given priority over the parent discounts despite the fact that the parents' code has been entered into the field &quot;Customer for Prices/Discounts&quot; in maintain customers. <br />
<br />
She has given me historical examples of this and she appears to be correct but I can't see how it could've happened. The one possibility that I thought of was if there was, for example, a discount level 3 set up against the child but not the parent. I wondered if Baan searched each discount level by parent first and then the child. It sounds unlikely but I wondered if any of you have come across this before.<br />
<br />
Your help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />

Did you try session tdsls0510m000? This session helps a lot when &quot;debugging&quot; price and discount structures.<br />
