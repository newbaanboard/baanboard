<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryan</div><div class="date">16th July 2002, 02:28</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on Baan5.0b, and are using the purchasing module for all raw materials. Some C class items, such as labels, and nuts and bolts, we have on a visual system, and are not using MRP. We basically create a PO line for the total quantity for the month, and as we need stock, we call the vendor. This is working fine. The problem is that we are trying to measure our vendors in terms of delivery performance. We measure the purchase order line planned delivery date with the actual receipt date, so this blanket PO results in every delivery being early, because the  date on the PO is the last day of the month.<br />
<br />
This works fine with our MRP items, but with the items we put on blanket POs, it does not. We create 1 PO line for the enitre month, with the delivery date = the last day of the month, and warehousing will receive against that PO line as shipments arrive.<br />
<br />
We tried using purchase Schedules but Baan does not support this. Any ideas how we can get around having to create a PO line for each delivery and still be able to measure vendor delivery performance?</div></div><hr />

But in the purchase order line it is possible to determine a delivery schedule. Use the check box 'Split Delivery Lines'. Then the button 'Line Details' on both the overview session (tdpur4501m000) and on the detail session (tdpur4101s000) will be enabled.<br />
<br />
In this session &quot;Purchase Order Line Details&quot; (tdpur4101s200), you can enter new planned delivery dates and quantities for the detail lines.<br />
