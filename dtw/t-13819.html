<br />
I am using Baan V.c.<br />
What is the differences between Average Purchase Price and Average Purchase Price (MC) at session tdipu0101s000 - Item Purchase Data ???<br />
<br />
PLease let me know how system calculate value for AVP (MC)<br />
<br />
Our example like this :<br />
<br />
Beginning balance : 100 pcs and Purchase Price Rp. 1200 = Rp. 120.000<br />
We crate new PO : 1000 pcs and Purchase Price = 0.24 SGD = Rp. 1,250,000<br />
Conversion rate : 1 IDR = 0.000200 SGD<br />
<br />
And after we do matching and approval Purchase Invoice at AP Module, we got the results as follows :<br />
Average Purchase Price = 1,245.45 (it is correct)<br />
Average Purchase Price (MC) = 1,136.36  ( I don't understand how system calculate this value ??? )<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Rini</div></div><hr />

<br />
Average purchase price (multi currency) is the average purchase price had all your booking be in the reporting currency. Try recalculate in on paper manually based on your reporting currency (not home currency) and you'll find that it's the right number<br />
