<br />
In purchase order session there is field standard description (you can uncheck/check the field).<br />
<br />
my question is there is a way to uncheck/check this field by default during creation of PO? if so, could you please tell me the session?<br />
<br />
Thanking you in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">10th July 2012, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understand you correctly, you want to check/uncheck the field based on value of other fields during runtime? This can only be done through programming. If you just want to set a fixed default value - always checked or always unchecked - you can just set the default value of the form field.<br />

<br />
You're absolutely correct. and doing modification on functionality of this field could be the solution.<br />
<br />
I am just trying my luck that maybe somewhere there could be a standard session whereas i can define uncheck/check the field by default so that during runtime the user doesn't needs to do anything on this field.<br />
<br />
thank you and regards,</div></div><hr />
