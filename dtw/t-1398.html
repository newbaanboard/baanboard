<br />
It appears to allow a maximum of 100% percentage value and for items with cycle count quantites over that percentage, they must be approved.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a way to increase that or eliminate the approval process altogether?<br />

In the parameters you define the percentage by item class and if it turns out the counted (physical) inventory is more or less than the system inventory there may be an issue in the warehouse.<br />
It is my experience that warehousing personnel are not the most accurate people working in the company and if you would eliminate this approval step you leave the door open for people to really mess up inventory (valuation) levels.<br />
Don't forget that as soon as the cycle counting/adjustment order has been processed in whinh5201m000 an integration transaction to Finance is created. Also all sorts of updates are done in whina tables that will have an impact on Inventory Valuation.<br />
<br />
I agree that for some items you want to eliminate the approval process (for examples nuts, bolts, screws, etc.)  but in most cases a Materials Manager should investigate the discrepancies between the physical inventory and the system inventory. He is responsible for this and he should be running session whina5801m000 (Approve Cycle-Counting Variances) when appropriate.<br />
