<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">26th July 2002, 15:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are a few suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. Negative inventory adjustment with a specific reason code. Not a clean way but very easy to do.<br />
<br />
2. Create a return purchase order type. You need to create a new purchase order and return against the order. Steps specified in order type to be executed. Problem is that it is not linked to the original order in IV (Can be in V) and is difficult thus for Finance. Can use Ref A or B to specify original order number.<br />
<br />
3. Add a negative order line on the original order. This way the return order is linked to the original order and for financial purposes very clean. Steps specified in order type to be executed.<br />
<br />
Note: you can not generate inbound advice for negative qty. Move stock to receipt location and deliver via &quot;Maintain Inbound Advice&quot; if location control is switched on.</div></div><hr />
