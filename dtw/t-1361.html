We have ILC activated and I would like to block a warehouse for all transactions.<br />
Is there a simple way of doing this if the warehouse does not have locations?<br />

<br />
In the Baan application it is not possible to block complete warehouses. Neither in BaanIV, nor in the later releases. Baan only allows users to block locations, lots or stock points. <br />
<br />
The advantage for this is clear: Baan does not allow to block the default receipt and staging (=Baan 5) locations either: it must always be possible to receive and ship goods.<br />

<br />
In b50 it is possible to block an entire warehouse using session whinh6210m000 (Global (Un)block Warehouses/Zones/Locations).<br />
You need to select the checkbox for Locations, make sure this applies to all transactions, enter a reason code, the warehouse number(s) and leave the selection for locations wide open so that this applies to all locations.<br />
<br />
The original post concerned b40 so please keep this discussion clean and only reply regarding this version.<br />

<br />
I was searching for a case related to Blocking of Locations and found this one.<br />
<br />
I want to block All locations in my warehouse. However when I try to block a Receipt location using session whinh6111m000 ( Block Locations by transactions), I am getting the message &quot;Location defined as Receiving Location for Warehouse. Location cannot be blocked for inbound&quot;. I tried blocking using the session whinh6210m000, but here again i get the message &quot; No data found&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can I really block a Receipt Location? Also I am getting a similar message if I block a staging location for Outbound.<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it is possible to block a receipt or staging location. But not if this is the 'default' receipt and staging location as defined in session &quot;Warehouses&quot; (whwmd2500m000). Baan does not allow the user to stop the receiving and shipping process.<br />
<br />

This will block all transactions provided you have set the &quot;Block during Cycle Counting&quot;-Parameter in Maitain Warehousing Parameters.<br />
<br />
Delete the Cycle Counting order(s) when you're done!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't block the receipt location if it is the default receipt location for the warehouse</div></div><hr />
