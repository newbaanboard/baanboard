<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronald65</div><div class="date">18th January 2019, 13:21</div></div><div class="posttext">When we create a TPOP order for multiple items in LN10.5 we see that multiple orders are created. Because we want to pick within a TPOP order on location sequence we would like to have all the TPOP requirements for multiple items on one TPOP orders.<br />
<br />
I found out that the difference is caused by differences in delivery date but this means that if items are due at 17jan 10:02AM and another item is due at 17 jan 10:05AM it will create two different TPOP orders.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an idea how this could be done?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronald65</div><div class="date">25th January 2019, 11:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought that might be the case but the orderinterval only works with one item. If you have multiple items that have the same delivery date but a different delivery time it will create multiple TPOP orders. What I would have expected that orders on the same day are combined. And that ignores the delivery time</div></div><hr />
