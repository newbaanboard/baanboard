<br />
U sesiji tfgld4500m000 (&quot;Integration Mapping Scheme-General), I defined integration for combination: Transaction origin-Purchase, Financial transaction-Receipt, but it is not enough.<br />
 Maybe because it is not conected to some order type.<br />
<br />
Where I can link order type with Transaction origin and type?<br />

<br />
The Transaction Type on the Warehousing Order Type should be of type &quot;Receipt&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Seems like you didn't configure default order types by origin. Go to BAAN Warehousing\Inventory handling\Warehousing orders\Order types\Default order types by origin. There, fill in a receipt WH order type to order origin: purchase, transaction type: receipt.<br />
<br />
To prevent this from happening in the future, there are 2 checkpoints:<br />
 Configure all defaults order types by origin as mentioned above. The default WH order type listed here will be used when there's no other more specific WH order type for an order (PO, SO, etc.)<br />
 Specify the WH order type for every purchase order type and sales order type. The WH order type specified here will be considered by BaanERP as the more specific WH order type. Hence, the setting here will overrule the setting in first point above. What happened in your case was that you didn't specify the WH order type for the purchase order type used by this particular PO (which you wanted to release to warehousing)<br />

<br />
Your explanation was very detailed and help me to solve problem.<br />
I mised to define default order types by origin (in Baan IVc4 it was not necessary), as you supoused. In fact I did not use any warehouse order. Thank you again.<br />
