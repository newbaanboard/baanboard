<br />
There can be two ways to do that:-<br />
<br />
1. You can add the sales order line table to the Audit and check any changes made on that table. That will give you every information like user name, date etc.<br />
<br />
2. The second way is to a a UE DLL to the sales order line table. When a line is deleted, you can gather the required information in a customized table using scripts.<br />
<br />
You can choose any one of the above mentioned ways. Else, the DBA is always the right person to get the information required. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
in BaanIV you can check the field logn &quot;Login&quot; in table tdsls051 (History sales order lines) via session ttaad4500 - General table display. <br />
For deleted lines the field ckor &quot;Recory Type&quot; is filled with value 2 (deleted).<br />
<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
no need for audit and UE.<br />
<br />
The info in LN is stored in tdsls451 sales order position history<br />
<br />
tdsls451.logn =&gt; user<br />
tdsls451.ckor = tdsls.ckor.cancelation =&gt; deleted<br />
<br />
For Baan IV the info is given by juergen.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for correcting me. So, my answer can be applicable for any other places but not Sales Orders as not all the things are captured/audited by Baan.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tdsls451.logn =&gt; user<br />
tdsls451.ckor = tdsls.ckor.cancelation =&gt; deleted<br />
<br />
A little bit change to that. I tried to delete a line but, the status was &quot;Intake&quot;. The only way to track who deleted would be then, the user who did the last transaction on that line. <br />
<br />
The status tdsls451.ckor was tdsls.ckor.cancelation when the line was cancelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nolihayati isma</div><div class="date">5th July 2013, 11:15</div></div><div class="posttext">when i check in tdsls051.....i only found tdsls051.ckor = 1. but there are 2 records with different item codes for the same pono. It means user not delete the item code but update the item code.<br />
<br />
It is correct my understanding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juergen</div><div class="date">5th July 2013, 11:36</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, that's correct.<br />
Until the line is not deleted and only changed the field ckor still remains &quot;1&quot;.<br />
ckor = 2 means the line was deleted<br />
ckor = 3 means the line is invoiced and finally processed<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
Juergen</div></div><hr />
