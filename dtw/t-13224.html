<br />
there was a purchase order, after Maintain Receipts<br />
<br />
for which the Generate Inbound Advice (standard session : tdilc4203m000)was not generating the inbound.<br />
<br />
for the same order, under same run number when I did Maintain Inbound Data (standard session : tdilc4103m000), it went through.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
====<br />
For Generate and Maintain Inbound ,<br />
same info used in both the places like run number, order number etcc. Location not blocked, supplier no problem, order no problem.<br />
<br />
Why it happens, any idea. Because I dont know how many more order lines left with this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any clues.<br />
<br />
Wishes<br />
<br />
VISH</div></div><hr />

<br />
In session tdilc4203m000, are u sure all the other fields are given as blank to zzzzzz or 0 to 999999. Sometimes it so happens that we overlook some fields.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember someone telling me once that they had a non infinte capacity location. ( having a limited capacity). he was not able to generate inbound to that location but was able to maintain the inbound. <br />
<br />
The only logic that time we could come up with was that since this was a manual maintain, the system allowed to overrule. <br />
I am not sure how much would this be relevant in this situation though...</div></div><hr />
