<br />
This is on Infor ERP LN 6.1 FP7.<br />
<br />
The material ( 6 no's ) transferred to Consigment Owned warehouse for Customer against the Consignment Replenishment Sales Order. Part of the Quantity ( 1 no ) is billed to the Customer thru the Consignment Invoicing Sales Order. Remaining 5 no's Qty is still present in the Consignment  Owned Warehouse.<br />
<br />
This 5 no's Qty will not be used and hence need to return back to the main warehouse of the factory. But the Inventory Transfer is not allowed in the system because the Consignment Owned Warehouse is not allowed in the warehouse transfer order.<br />
<br />
Please note that the REturn type of Consignment Replenishment Order Type is not allowed for creation in the system.<br />
<br />
Please let me know the process to bring back those 5 no's qty from Consignment Warehouse back to my main warehouse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Step 1 <br />
<br />
Create a Sales Order with Sales Order Type as &quot;Consignment Replenishment&quot; with a negative ordered quantity about the quantity to be returned.<br />
<br />
Step 2 <br />
<br />
Approve the Sales Order.<br />
<br />
Step 3 <br />
<br />
Release the Sales Order to warehousing module. It will create a warehousing order to transfer the Consigned Owned Warehouse to the Normal warehouse.<br />
<br />
