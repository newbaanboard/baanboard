<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">N. sriram</div><div class="date">13th April 2003, 08:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
We are running baan with c4/in3/nt/sql and baan sp6<br />
<br />
My query is :<br />
<br />
While maintaining inventory transactions thro session : tdilc1120m00, the session takes multiple date fields as input<br />
<br />
Order date, planned date, transaction date and input date (in session tdilc1120s000)<br />
<br />
Out of these dates, which date is considered as the base date for inventory transaction?  i.e., I am passing a transaction of inventory transfer of 9/04/2003 on 12/04/2003 (backdated).  Here the order date is 09/04 and transaction date is 12/04(since the transaction was entered on 12/04).   When I print the inventory transactions by item (tdinv7410m000), the transaction date is considered as the base for calculation. <br />
<br />
If I would like to know my daily inventory balances, how do I keep a track, since the report considers transaction date as base for calculations.  According to this report, the inventory which should have been consumed on 09/04 is shown as consumed on 12/04.  This is creating a problem.  What's the way out?<br />
<br />
Are there any sesssions in baan, by which I can see my daily closing balance of inventory?<br />
<br />

<br />
Also I would suggest not to keep warehouse orders open as these will create problem in planning engines. We are entering order date as current date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BaanIV doesn't allow backdated INV orders (called WO in BaanERP) except for inventory adjustments. Hence, to see real time inventory transaction history, the transactions must be entered in real time, not backdated.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, you can't get end of day stock history in BaanIV or even BaanERP using built in sessions. You'd have to make a customised session for that. Please refer to Perform Inventory Valuation session's program script to find out the logic it uses to find the end of day stock of any day; you can then use this logic in your customised session<br />
