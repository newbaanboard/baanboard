I've learned the S.O. and P.O. modules but I can't figure out the Replenishment Order Control Module.  Any documentation or help would be greatly appreciated.   Specifically when do I generate Inbound and release inbound?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

May I ask a question on Replenishment as well?<br />
If so - if we create a sales order to ship from warehouse XYZbut there is no inventory for the ordered item(s) in xyz but there is inventory in warehouse ABC does a replenihment order get created automatically so that the item can ship from the warehouse in the order? Or do we have to create it manually?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">26th November 2013, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">For non nettavble warehouses you can have bill of distribution, the destination should be non-nettable while origin can be nettable. Then you can use DRP. I have developed a warehouse transfer customization that allows transfer of goods between warehouses using replenishment order in back end.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraDiehl</div><div class="date">26th March 2018, 01:14</div></div><div class="posttext">The company I work for is using Replenishment for an &quot;outside&quot; warehouse and I am not sure why they did what they did other than those that set up BaaN didn't know what they were doing.  Our users are doing the delivery of the replenishment that goes from warehouse 400 -&gt; 499 (in transit) yet the order has to 425 the outside warehouse.  That same user will right after they do all the delivery side will do the receipt so I have no clue why we have the transit warehouse and now we are finding this is a major pain now that we set up location/lot control for this company.<br />
<br />
My question where in the configuration makes the order go through the transit warehouse, I like to try a test out in my testing environment not using the transit warehouse to see if the process will be quicker and easier.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">26th March 2018, 05:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending upon the steps in replenishment order the use of transit warehouse can be avoided. Only mandatory step is maintained delivery so that will relieve the inventory from replenishing Waterhouse and add into destination warehouse same time <br />
<br />
I have done inventory movement customization around this , infact moved inventory to specific location in destination warehouse<br />
