<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tstoop</div><div class="date">15th October 2015, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been on Baan for over 10 years and have never done a physical inventory.<br />
What tools does Baan have to support a physical inventory?  Can you provide detailed information on any experiences with a physical inventory?<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Anyway I merged and moved the threads to the forum I think will get you some answers.  I am not familiar with the sessions available.  I just know we help once to do this - but I believe it was using the cycle count sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">15th October 2015, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">yes you need to use the cycle count sessions. it's not difficult to understand how it works but the baaniv interface is a little cumbersome. most companies prefer to have the inventory counts in excel file and then upload into the tables via a custom script or exchange. your choice.</div></div><hr />
