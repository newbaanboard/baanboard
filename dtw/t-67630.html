There could be various business scenarios as follows:<br />
&gt; The truck you called for loading does not have the capacity to load<br />
&gt; The goods are found damaged at the time of loading<br />
&gt; There is emergency for another customer and you want to divert those goods<br />
&gt; and many more....</div></div><hr />

This session is not for reversing a confirmed Shipment... <br />
I tried on system to reverse a Shipment as my User had entered a wrong quantity and wanted to change that. <br />
Session &quot;Remove Confirmed Shipments/Loads (whinh4250m000) &quot; only deletes the Shipment Data and doesn't show any changes in Logistics/ finance.<br />
<br />
To confirm this I logged a incident on Infor Support. See the reply that I got from inforextreme.com---<br />
The removal of shipments is just a process prior to archiving to reduce the number of records in the tables &quot;Shipments&quot; (whinh430) and &quot;Shipment Lines&quot; (whinh431) without any logistic or financial transaction behind.</div></div><hr />
