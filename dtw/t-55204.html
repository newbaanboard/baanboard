I am receiving the above error while trying to close off a production order and our finance department would like me to try and get this closed since it is our financial year end. I have looked into the steps normally folowed by the purchasing department and the receipting department. The purchase order reflects the items have been receipted and so provides the receipt number. I have looked under the session tdpur4533m000 and can see the status of the purchase order is at &quot;Deleting line...&quot;. I have used session tisfc0202m000 to see the status of the production order and it is stating that all items are delivered and reported complete. As soon as I run session ticst0201m000, even with the &quot;Override Orders with Additional Materials&quot; set to yes, the above error occurs and does not want to close. If anyone could assist me with other sessions to look at or a method to get this to close, I would greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

The only session I know to perform this operation is tfacp1130m000? Please advice the session information for the distribution module of this?<br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

You seem to be quite clued up for a newbie, just wanted to say thanks, this seems to have resolved the issue. Extremely happy Monday for me.</div></div><hr />
