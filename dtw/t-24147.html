<br />
I realized the field tdpur040.odis in the purchase order header is not editable for purchase order with PO type with Subcontracting Order equal to yes (tcmcs042.subc = tcyesno.yes).<br />
<br />
May I know why this is so. Is it an intent functionality or it is a technical constraint?<br />
<br />
How do we enter a discount for a Subcontracting Order? Please do not advise me to enter the discount at the line level as our purchase order can have a lot of lines.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Order header discount is only disabled (not defaulted from supplier data and also not editable) for cost orders.<br />
For subcontracting orders however, the order header discount is defaulted from the supplier data. As a consequence, the user must be able to change the defaulted discount as long as no delivered line is present.</div></div><hr />
