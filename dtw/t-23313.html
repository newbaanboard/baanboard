I do not see a predefined step for this type of function - any suggestions?  <br />

<br />
this can be done by programing a new session. I've done many similar stuff and I would have liked to implement this for you. But my company is seated in Germany and I'm pretty sure handling the business side is not going to be easy. My suggestion: Discuss your requirement with your Baan-Partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manojsharma</div><div class="date">4th March 2005, 11:45</div></div><div class="posttext">First you have to create a session for Confirmation of Acceptance of Order Acknowledgement.<br />
<br />
Then add this session in Maintain Order Steps (tcmcs0139m000) after this add the step in Maintain Order Type (tcmcs0142m000).<br />
<br />
Before adding step to order type, make sure pending orders for the particular order type should be deleted &amp; re-booked again after adding the step.</div></div><hr />
