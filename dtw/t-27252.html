<br />
We usually ship our goods at a box level of 3 or 6 packs. However, we would like to see the inventory in the system at a unit/piece level.-Do we have to use BOM to achieve this? <br />
-Is it also possible to consolidate different shipments into one invoice at the end of the day? This is required for individual customers.<br />
-Is it possible not to charge the customers for freight(eventhough we pay the freight ourselves since we shipped via only one Forwarding company? And how do we handle this in logistics and finance?<br />
-Is it possible to have the same Sales Order number to match the invoice number which has to be preassigned?<br />
-Is Baan Localization available for the following countries; China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan?<br />
<br />
All the above questions are for Baan ERP(5c).<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

To do this you leave the inventory unit on the base item at EA (or whatever you are using) and create two new units of measure (Maybe 3PK and 6PK).  You put whichever of these is required as the Sales Unit of Measure (in the Sales sub-entity - General Item Data.  Set up the conversion factor (tcibd0103m000) as required to show that for the desired parts that a 3PK = 3 - EA or that a 6PK = 6 -EA.</div></div><hr />
