<br />
We currently have an issue where a sales order has been created which included several cost items, the Project Structure was generated (cost part option not ticked) and the cost items were released to invoicing but not invoiced.<br />
<br />
We next added an installment and invoiced the cost items but when we now attempt to add a line to the sales order we get the error message that &quot;project code is not the same for all order lines, while invoicing by Installment is used&quot;.<br />
<br />
LN requires that when installments are used a project number is mandatory for all order lines however in our case when the generate project structure was completed the project code wasnt added for the cost items.<br />
<br />
By using GTM we have confirmed that the missing project number can be added and once complete the system will allow us to add additional lines etc. however after completing all deliveries when we attempt to close the installment so we can close the order we get another error message that the &quot;installment line cannot be inserted&quot; - this is due to the earlier GTM changes.<br />
<br />
I've attached a PDF which details each step in the process and includes screenshots - any assistance regarding this issue would be greatly appreciated?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Chris</div></div><hr />
