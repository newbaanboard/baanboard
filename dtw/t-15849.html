<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DC9781</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">What solutions are available that will allow our company to setup cubing (Maximum Carton quantities &amp; weights) for items? Is this functionality already in BAAN? I'm new to BAAN IV and just beginning to look into this area. <br />
<br />
In our existing system (PKMS), we have cubing setup which allows us to batch picktickets into Waves and then print shipping labels (UPS/FEDEX), container labels (UCC-128), and packing slips prior to picking orders.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on 3rd party solutions or BAAN IV modules that would allow us to continue printing our labels &amp; packslips prior to picking?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">2nd July 2004, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a product called RMClabelmaker that exists completely within Baan.  It allows you to create and print labels entirely within Baan without needing external applications like Loftware or Bartender.  To print labels, you only need to make a library call within the appropriate session.  Some of our clients have used this for:<br />
<br />
 Tagging subassemblies and finished goods, packing and labeling boxes of finished goods, and composing and labeling skids of boxes in production<br />
 Tracking serial numbers, creating shipping labels, and automatically &quot;delivering&quot; goods in sales<br />
 Creating receipt and cross-docking labels in receiving<br />
 Tracking cycle counting locations and items w/ labels<br />
 <br />
<br />
In addition to just printing the labels, we have -- as you probably guessed -- created or modified functionality for these customers to help Baan fit their business needs.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or would like more specific information, please email Kathy Barthelt at kbarthelt@rmcis.com  or visit our web site at http://www.rmcis.com .</div></div><hr />
