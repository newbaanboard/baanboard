Previously freeze/confirm shipments was automatic. We are changing to a manual step - activities by warehouse procedure (whinh0106m000).<br />
However, we have some sales orders already released to warehouse - but not yet outbounded.<br />
It is possible to re-release these orders so that they will pick-up the revised warehouse order activities?<br />
Or another way to do this?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
