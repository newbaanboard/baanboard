<br />
Example: Order is originally entered at $50,000 in the first qtr.  Sometime during the 2nd qtr, the price is changed to $40,000.  Now when we try to roll forward our numbers from Qtr to Qtr, we'll be off $10,000.  Backlog will not roll forward as that will now be off as well.<br />
<br />
How is your company handling this type of information?<br />
<br />
Thanks so much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">21st July 2005, 08:16</div></div><div class="posttext">As for revenue, if you look inside each SO line sequence which represents delivery, the price for that particular delivery is stored there. So, the problem that you mentioned will not surface if you use this more appropriate number. As for booking, that depends on how your management would like to view the booking made, at old price or new price<br />

Thanks for your quick response.  Great, that's the field we are currently using for revenue.<br />
<br />
As for bookings, we want to recognize the new price, but need to capture the difference between two so when we manually roll forward the numbers (Qtr to Qtr) we'll see the changes.  I just found the table tdsls451 that contains the Sales Order history - including any changes to lines.  I now just need to make sense of the data and create the report.<br />
<br />
Just as an example - the booking number for the 1st Qtr of 2005 was $300,000.  The booking for the 2nd Qtr is $400,000.  So if we manually roll forward, the YTD booking should be $700,000 - however it is $650,000.<br />
<br />
If I run the bookings for the 1st Qtr again, I'll see the number has changed to $350,000.  I would like a report that is showing what Sales Orders make up that 50,000 difference.<br />
<br />
Not sure if that makes it any clearer.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your quick response.<br />

I don't see any issue with what you are saying. If you are just doing booking and are doing boking to invocing reconcillation then your problem is very straightforward. In my opnion you can do this from tdsls041 itself. When you write a report it is always a snapshot as of that moment. So if you re-run the report you should get your picture correct. Many thing can happen - like item can be changed, order line may get deleted etc. ALl this is captured in tdsls051 table, but you will land up with same figure as if you will run your report again from tdsls041. Unless, you would like to know the reason for the change. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raman123</div><div class="date">24th July 2005, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Like some you suggested, sales order line history tables is your best bet.<br />
I created bookins report off this table based on the transaction date and ckor. You have to select where ckor &lt;= 2, since 3 is for invoicing.<br />
<br />
Every month-end we run the report for the start and end dates of the fiscal period. We get &quot;incremental&quot; report for the period.  If you run it for one sales order with open-ended dates you will get your current booking for the order which always equal the value in sls401.<br />
<br />
There is another report we created off sls401 (sls041 in baan4) to get the sales for the period. We used the convention that is ther is a &quot;non-zero &quot;delivery date falling in the fiscal period, it was a sale whether the invoice was sent or not (basic accounting).<br />
<br />
The sls401 can give current backlog (inception to date) and sales for the period. Backlog will be sls401 amount - sales amount.<br />
<br />
While these 3 reports serve different purposes, they are used for reconciliation also. Every month, accounting can check:<br />
<br />
1. they have prev month backlong<br />
2. they run the current month backlog<br />
3. they run booking for the month <br />
4. they run sales for the month.<br />
reconcile<br />
<br />
cur backlog - rev backlog = booking for the month - sales for the month.<br />
(i hope i have it right.)<br />
<br />
These reports have stood the test of time for 7 years.<br />
Let me know if you need the quesries or 4gl logic (informix).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raman123</div><div class="date">24th July 2005, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">By prev month backlog I meant inception to date backlog as of last month-end.<br />
By cur month backlog I meant inception to date backlog as of this month-end.<br />
<br />
The good thing is that even if you delete / cancel sales order line data, the booking history can provide you with the data. You can go back in time and run it for any start and end date.<br />
<br />
Even backlog report, if the date comparison is properly coded can go back in time.<br />
<br />
You can also go back in time for backlog. Say we are in july 05, for June 05, the backlog would be bookings upto june end - sales upto june end. This is easy to get due to the date stamps.</div></div><hr />
