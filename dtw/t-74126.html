<br />
does someone know if there is a documentation available to setup a consignment warehouse (not owned) in BaanIV?<br />
:confused:<br />
Thanks in advance, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbarthelt</div><div class="date">1st December 2021, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are two solutions that people have posted previously: <br />
<br />
Many clients ago I ran into this. Their solution was to have another company where they stored the consignment inventory. After they ran MRP, they ran a single customized session that checked the planned MRP orders against the inventory in that other company. If there was a match, a new planned PO would be created (from a supplier that represented the customer's consignment inventory - and set up to do internal EDI) and the existing planned PO would be reduced/removed.<br />
<br />
Then back to standard BAAN and confirm/transfer the planned PO's. A few side benefits of this were you could do it over and over for multiple customers and the standard financial reports could be run to see how much stuff you had of each of your customers.<br />
<br />
It was slick in that there was very little customization - just the one completely new session. Made it very upgradeable<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
What we have done is create another Logistical company. No GL or financial integration is<br />
setup, it’s strictly for inventory tracking. We do enter cost prices and do the cost price calculation, which then allows us to run an inventory valuation report and use it to monitor the cost.<br />
You can either adjust the inventory into the ‘Consignment’ company or use PO’s if you want to do the extra work. Then, when you’re going to use the inventory, adjust it out and create a PO in your production company to bring the inventory in and create a payable to the vendor.<br />
For customer owned inventory, we ‘sell’ it to the customer via a SO and then adjust it into the ‘Consignment’ company. When the customer wants the goods we ship it to them from the ‘Consignment’ company.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. Either way, you'd have to test it out in a test company.<br />
