<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ewesuan</div><div class="date">5th November 2004, 22:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read the EDI documentation and set up the purchasing company and selling company. Based on the multisite guidelines, there should be a sharing of table between the companies but I didnt do it. Is sharing of tables mandatory for intercompany EDI ? However, from the purchase order I managed to generate the EDI PO messages. The step which I am stuck at is how does the sales company read this message. I have run the direct network connection but the sales company is still not reading the message.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate any help</div></div><hr />

I am not sure about sharing the table. In customer master there are 2 to 3 fields that needs to setup for internal EDI. The new network has to be created for internal EDI setup and there are specific fields to be maintianed for internal EDI. This will create the common directory 'appl_comm' at the unix level for this network. If both these companies are on the same application server, the push &amp; pull of EDI files happens real time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">26th April 2012, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Table sharing is not mandatory in EDI. When a company generate message it sits in one directory and that message needs to be moved to other directory where the incoming messages can be read. All table sharing does companies has one physical table, hence in many cases it eases the maintenance and update.</div></div><hr />
