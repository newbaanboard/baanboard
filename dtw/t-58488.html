<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">25th May 2010, 16:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently in one of our companies, they decided to abandon Location Control. I don't know what they did to turn it off at this point but I do know that it seems to affect items received after the changes were made. Those items are blocked in the system.<br />
<br />
Anyone encountered this kind of problem before or suggest a path I can try to figure this out ?<br />
<br />
They did try to delete any outstanding cycle counts but that didn't seem to have any effect.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance ....</div></div><hr />

Note: first try with one item and see if it works, it touches upon all the inventory tables</div></div><hr />
