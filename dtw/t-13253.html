<br />
We have three companies, and every company has diffrent warehouse.  After we run the slow moving, we can find  the slmp in the table tiitm001 for one item, and find in the different warehouse it has different slmp for same item. Why? How can I for same company diffent warewhouse has same slmp, but for diff company, we should get diff slmp?<br />
The session tdinv6220m000?  What is the diff for Slow Moving analysis by warehouse(Yes/no)? andwhat does it affect?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

You can separate slow moving from fast moving items on 2 level:<br />
 On company level (i.e. for this company, which items are fast and which are slow moving). To do this, set Slow Moving analysis by warehouse=No<br />
 On warehouse level (i.e. for this particular warehouse, which items are fast and which are slow moving). To do this, set Slow Moving analysis by warehouse=Yes<br />

Thanks for your answer, I have doubted that if on company level it only modify the slmp in the table tiitm001.slmp(but our diff company share this table). on the warehouse level it only modify the slmp in the table tdinv001.slm(by warehouse inventory).<br />
