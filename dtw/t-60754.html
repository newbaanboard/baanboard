<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amol.123</div><div class="date">27th June 2011, 12:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created a sales order line with &quot;Indirect Settlements&quot; .Then I have maintained a advance installment line with some amount . Now i have invoiced the installment line and later found that the order needs to be cancelled. So as the advance installment line was invoiced for reverting that I have inserted onother advance installment line with same negetive amount and invoiced it.But now I have deleted the order line and added new line with cost item and zero amount.When I am trying to invoice the order line i.e. posting the invoice in CI i am getting error report with message &quot;Installment line can not be inserted&quot;............My problem of reverting the invoiced installment has been taken care by negetive installment. But now I want to close the order.......Any suggestions on this.....<br />

<br />
Have you should close off the instalment? - you did not mention if you've done this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Info:  A negative line will work fine to clear the instalment and you can add extra lines at a later stage if want to re-start instalments.</div></div><hr />

I have closed the the installment lines.One additional information is, my line item is cost item.I am not sure if we can use cost item with quantity 1 ,price and indirect installment.Please help...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penfold</div><div class="date">28th November 2011, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I can do this in C4 and as far as I know the instalment session does not consider the item just the value.<br />
<br />
I would have thought you should be able to do this as well.</div></div><hr />
