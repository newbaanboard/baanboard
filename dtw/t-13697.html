 I hope some one can help me in this , where if I made a sales order line for a phantom item having BOM <br />
and if I select in the sales order line a warehouse tdsls041.cwar different from the default warehouse of the session<br />
&quot;Maintain production BOMs&quot; tibom1110s000, then unfortunatily still the system will issue the inventory from the default warhouse tibom010.cwar<br />

<br />
sorry, but there is no solution for this problem.<br />
Did you log a case at Baan Support? Would be interesting to hear from Baan why it's not possible to change the warehouse in SLS-Bom components.<br />
<br />

In order to make the functionality work we have had to make a small customisation so that the warehouse on the sales orderline is used. Baan considered this to be an &quot;enhancement&quot; to c4 functionality and therefore were unwilling to help. It will be interesting however to see if Baan under SSA take the same view given they are opening up more possibilities in terms of additions to c4 functionality.</div></div><hr />
