<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MarkHoll</div><div class="date">14th November 2014, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I am an inexperienced Baan user and I have a problem my tech support folks do not know how to correct.<br />
<br />
I am converting Lot Items to Non Lot Items.  Most items work as expected but some do not.  I need to figure out how to deal with the ones that do not.  <br />
<br />
I do the following:<br />
Select BAAN Warehousing-&gt; Lot Control-&gt; Lots-&gt; Convert Lot Item to Non Lot Item.  Enter an Item number and click Convert.  A &quot;Converting lot item to non-lot item&quot; message displays and then a &quot;Process completed&quot; message displays.  When the &quot;Process completed&quot; message appears, the &quot;Converting lot...&quot; message should disappear but for the items that have problems, both messages display at the end of the process.  This is my first clue that there is a problem.<br />
<br />
Then do the following.  Go to BAAN Warehousing-&gt; Lot Control-&gt; Lots-&gt; Lots by Lot Selection Codes.  The item I tried to convert to a Non Lot item is in the list along with a lot number.  I select that item and click the Delete toolbar icon.  The message &quot;Received quantity should not exceed shipped quantity for a transfer order&quot; displays.  Deleting the lot fails.  How can I make these quantities equal so I can delete the lot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donnawren</div><div class="date">15th December 2014, 23:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you first making sure that you have no Inventory on hand and no demand on open orders?  All of that must be removed prior to converting - then adjust the quantities back in and redo any orders.  Actually if you have an open demand on an order, just delete the demand for that part then add it back in rather than dealing with the whole order.   Hope this helps - Donna</div></div><hr />
