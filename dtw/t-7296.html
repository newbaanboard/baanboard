   We're quite puzzled at how BaanERP 5.0c assign numbers to the Warehousing Order inbound line sequence number (whinh210.seqn). Can anybody please light up our darkened sequence number world, please ? Thanks<br />

What I'm meaning to ask everybody is actually the logic behind assignment of WO inbound line sequence number (B5c). We tried to look at the source code to find out how B5c calculates and assigns new sequence number for this but it's still quite puzzling. Thanks very much<br />

It's OK, we found out what we want. We needed to know how B5c determines what can still be received and what aren't. It turns out that B5c will allow receipt if it could find WO inbound line with sequence number multiple of 100000 (0, 100000, 200000, and so on) which is not blocked and not marked as final receipt. Just in case anyone would find this info useful.<br />
<br />
We don't know about the rest of WO inbound line sequence number assignment, but we're happy with this for the moment<br />
