<br />
I have two questions..<br />
<br />
1- How can I force inspection on warehousing orders (manual) it seems not to work.  Both the item and business partner is set for inspection and the order procedure has an approval for inspection, But all the types of manual orders ignore the inspection, I've checked the setting by making a purchase order with the same Item and BP and it works.<br />
<br />
Am i missing somthing ?? <br />
<br />
2- We have inspection costs that is differ from time to time (no standareds for it) How can we set this cost at the time of inspection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please help</div></div><hr />

I don't know about the cost that you want to capture. Maybe you have to consider to use the ODM module to do this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To charge inspection cost, maybe you can use item surcharge using receipt trigger. So everytime you're going to receive the item, you update the surcharge then receive the goods.<br />
That way the cost of that goods will be added by the surcharge.<br />
