    Can sb tell me the relationship between WH Order &amp; Shipment Order? I found no reference between the two sessions. I think for a sales order, the responding outbound order line should has relationship to shipment order.<br />
    Why?<br />

<br />
I think there is an indirect relationship from sales order to shipment. Every warehouse order (coming from sales or transfer) that gets shipped will always have a shipment id. I am not sure as I don't have baan in front of me, but try checking the shipment ID against warehouse order. Relationship should be there.<br />
<br />
Feel free to ask if you have more questions..<br />
