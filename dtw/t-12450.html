<br />
Can anyone tell me if there is any workaround to make adjustments to unwanted inventory balances in the transit warehouse which do not have a any corresponding RPL orders.<br />
<br />
We also have a lot of open RPL orders which are pending &quot;Maintain RPL receipts&quot; , these orders are outdated and closing them through  the normal procedure would mess the existing inventory balances in the destination warehouses.<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced a similar situation ? If so is there a workaround to go about the same ! <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your support ! <br />

Here is a business recommendation, you do not want to interfere with tables, as this includes both finance and logistics and (a lot of them). I know what has happened in your company, process control is lacking: Goods are tranfsered from one location to another using RPL, when the goods are received nobody controls the process by maintaining the receipt, adjuestments are made when cycle counts are done since on hand goods are higher. Hence you have the situation here. Right Ya!<br />
<br />
I suggest:<br />
1. Go ahead and do the RPL receipt<br />
2. This will clean out the in transit situation and goods in transit acount.<br />
3. Agree with finance that you are going to then to an adjustment for these receipts with a reason code. The reason code will help keep  a record for audit purpose.<br />
4. Ensure process control is in place. Kick But!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply ! We should go ahead and maintain receipts for the orders to close them completely! <br />
<br />
About ensuring whether process control is in place , well it is in place now but i am refering to the orders dated back to 2000. Nothing has been done so far about these orders .<br />
<br />
There is another small problem , even if i maintain receipts from what i see there will be some small inventory quantities remaining in  the transit warehouse without any corresponding open RPL orders.  This could be because of some table level modifications that were done earlier . How do i handle that ? I wld be greatful i f u can advice me on that too :) <br />
<br />
Thanks again for your reply<br />
