We need to keep a minimum of stock of certain items for a specific customer (X) to ensure short delivery time.<br />
In BaaN IV, setting a minimum inventory on the item level does not prevent you from accidentally snatching away all the current stock to deliver to customer Y, just before your customer X requests delivery of his reserved stock.<br />
Creating hard allocations (outbound) would destroy the FIFO system.<br />

1. One warehouse for this customer's stock<br />
2. Keep the stock in a project. (PCS)</div></div><hr />

Yes, we can set a minimum/safety inventory level for these items/customers then, but it will still destroy the FIFO system (unless you take up the ridiculous job of adding all sort of inventory transfers after each issue).<br />
What we really need is an extra sort of inventory allocation / lot selection mechanism I guess.<br />

This functionality does not exist as far as I know....:( <br />
However, perhaps you can block the location so you will be trickered with for instants a text that the stock is only available for one specific customer.....</div></div><hr />

Maybe you can use sales contracts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you explain more how you see this ?<br />
I have not so much experience with Contracts. I know we can include contracts in the planned inventory movements, and thus create the necessary demand. But can we also prevent another customer to snatch away this inventory once it is in the warehouse ?<br />

<br />
The only way to prevent sales to snatch inventory is to use PCS in my opinion. But even then they can use the inventory if they are autorised for the project.<br />
Sales contracts will create demand. By this, the chance of no inventory will decrease.</div></div><hr />
