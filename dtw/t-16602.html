<br />
This session does a lot of table changes, updates and deletes. So it could take a while before a lot controlled item is changed. Despite that it should take that long. Looking at the script of this session, I see it has indeed a lot of selects on tables, most of the selects are done on other than index1, but no order by is given for the selects. That will, for each select, result in a full table scan, and if there is a lot of data in the tables it indeed might take upto 40 min. to execute. I would suggest to log a case with your support organisation to improve the queries.<br />

Most of the queries in that session cannot be optimized because of lack on index available on project, item and container. Because of which the database has to do a full table scan.<br />
 <br />
	select	tdilc401.*<br />
	from	tdilc401 for update<br />
	where	tdilc401.cprj =	:form.cprj<br />
	and	tdilc401.item =	:form.item<br />
	and	tdilc401.cntr =	:form.cntr<br />
	and	tdilc401.clot &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;<br />
	selectdo<br />
<br />
	select	tdilc402.*<br />
	from	tdilc402 for update<br />
	where	tdilc402.cprj =	:form.cprj<br />
	and	tdilc402.item =	:form.item<br />
	and	tdilc402.cntr =	:form.cntr<br />
	and	tdilc402.clot &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;<br />
	selectdo<br />
<br />
Adding an index in the standard software is not possible.<br />
<br />
My recommendation would be to add a new index to the tdilc401 and tdilc402 tables. Make a new index, which has first three fields as project, item, container and then copy of index1.<br />
<br />
If you donÂ’t use project or many records in tdilc401/tdilc402 has project field empty, then this new index will also be useless. In such case, the best choice to the new index would be: item, cprj, cntr, koor, orno, pono, sera and serb for both the tables.<br />
<br />
Additionally, source tdltc0131 should also be changed to give hint to database to use the newly created index. <br />
<br />
