<br />
I'm using Baan 5.0c<br />
<br />
I have a request that the invoice must be created at the same moment when shipment is confirmed.<br />
<br />
It's all about creating document Invoice / Packing slip, without performing steps Release to invoicing and performing activities in central invoicing.<br />
<br />
Is there anybody who can help me on this matter</div></div><hr />

If yes, then you could retrieve the required date in cisli2200m000 and fill the date field on the form with it. Depending on your need, you can choose to fill it fixed, and disable it, or to fill it default, still allowing the user to overwrite it.<br />
<br />
If you do not have access to the script, you could still try to use the form field initial value and expression on cisli2200m000 for the date field(s) by filling it there with the shipment confirmation date. I have not tested the latter; this will only be possible if the shipment data is selected by the program already.<br />

Good luck!<br />

Actually, I need to have invoice automaticly processed at the time when I cofirm shipment. <br />
Since one Bill of lading contains up to 100 shipments that need to be shipt at the same time. our customer find it too dificult to process steps like Release to invoicing, and steps in Central Invoicing.<br />
Esspecialy since they have a shipment every 5 min.</div></div><hr />

I've not done this with shipment/invoicing, however I have done similar things by using form-buttons in the relevant sessions (for you that would be in the confirm shipment session). The easiest way is probably by using AFS, which I personally barely know anything of. The other way is to look carefully into the dll's used for invoice processing, and then calling those in the shipment session.<br />

Unfortunately, I'm aware that I'm going to need customization. I now that it can be done by API, but I just wanted to ask if there's other solution for tjis problem (without customization).</div></div><hr />
