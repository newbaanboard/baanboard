<br />
Helping out a company who threw up Baan 4c -  one of their common problems is where what text prints in Sales and Purchasing related forms that go to supplier or customers.  Been quite a long time since worked in 4  but wondering if anyone still has a spreadsheet which cross references where text  e.g.  sales items, header footer , purchase items , etc print on which forms such as bill of lading , pick lists, etc.  <br />
<br />
Do remember there where some places where maybe a limited number of the text would print , like only the first two lines of additional text, etc.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

  On all baan reports the texts are included. On some of them you might have to modify the reports to pick up the complete text if it has more than one instances(i.e more than 240 chars) in the txt010 table. You would have to concatenate in this case. <br />
<br />
I hope i understood what you were trying to say here...<br />

<br />
Let me be a little more specific.  The client wants a spread sheet that allows them to check where what text prints where for distribution applications.<br />
<br />
for example on what forms does sales order line text print- acknowledgements, pick list, packing list , bill of lading etc<br />
<br />
Do not think such a spreadsheet was orginally available from Baan but might have been developed by consultant(s) at a client site.   <br />
<br />
Certainly would appreciate anything out there even if a partial list of certain texts tht print out on certain forms.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
