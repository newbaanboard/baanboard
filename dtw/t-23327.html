<br />
there are 2 possibilities in my opinion<br />
a) create a sales order with different lines and dates according the customers purchase schedule - <br />
or - the more elegant way:<br />
b) create a sales contract for that also with the different dates according the customer schedules - and work according this<br />
<br />
hope it helps<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Option b is not possible in Baan V. A delivery schedule in sales contracts does not exist in Baan V. In SSA ERP LN 6.1 the functionality is being built into SP2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">9th March 2005, 23:10</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Supply Chain world, Purchase Schedules are for forecast and Shipping schedules are for shipments. The best way of converting purchase to sales schedules is to use Supply chain module in Baan. You can use EDI to load the schedules not touching the data or you can create Sales schedules manually. Before creating Sales schedules, the sales Contract has to be maintained for that customer, Part number and Ship To Code.</div></div><hr />

Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Based on the Baan IVc2 sch0 version<br />
There are 2 ways of loading the DELFOR and DELJIT messages.<br />
1.Loading Forecast/shipping quantites as sent by the customer in the schedules.<br />
2.Calculating the Forecast/shipping quantities based on the cumulative quantities sent by the customer.<br />
<br />
In the second case, you have set the parameters in the tdssc013 like use cumulatives to 'Yes' and then the corresponding reconcilliation and netting methods.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can anybody help me about creating a sales schedule. It's origin must be &quot;Sales Contract&quot; process like Delivery Scheme in Sales Contract.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abattoir</div><div class="date">1st May 2013, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello All,<br />
<br />
I have a business scenario and wanted to know if baan had any field/parameter in Delivery Address or Sales Contract Session that can help us in mapping this process.<br />
<br />
Scenario:Customer CUM Received = 675<br />
Internal CUM Delivered = 945<br />
Weekly Bucket Qty (Discrete) : W1 = 500<br />
                                              W2 = 150<br />
                                              W3 = 175............<br />
............................................ and so on<br />
<br />
The above all information is received via EDI Sales Schedule from Customer (SC830S).<br />
<br />
As of now , we are getting the respective weekly buckets required qty in our Sales Schedule. <br />
<br />
But we want that the immediate week W1 bucket required qty should include the difference between the Cums Delivered and Received.<br />
For Eg. <br />
W1 = 500 - (945-675) ---- Since our cums are higher than customer, we need to adjust the immediate qty<br />
W2 = 150<br />
W3 = 175...................................<br />
and so on<br />
 <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
