<br />
When i do the sales statistics, we set the parent company for customer company.<br />
In sales stattistics, i add the parent customer to sort code and select the parent customer to &quot;yes&quot; in layout code setting. <br />
but when i print the report, i can find only one word &quot;Parent Customer&quot;, but i can't get the parent customer name and the report wasn't sorted by parent customer.<br />
Why?<br />
If do i miss some setting?<br />
Who can help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">20th January 2004, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had problems with the parent customer for statistics functionality as well.<br />
My problems revolved around the sorting of customers on sales stats reports.<br />
<br />
Lets say you have 3 parents with 3 children each.<br />
Parent A0 has children A1, A2, A3<br />
Parent B0 has children B1, B2, B3<br />
Parent C0 has children C1, C2, C3<br />
<br />
When sales stats reports are printed by parent customer \ children, the sorting is<br />
<br />
Parent Customer = BLANK<br />
A0<br />
B0<br />
C0<br />
<br />
Parent Customer = A0<br />
A1<br />
A2<br />
A3<br />
<br />
Parent Customer = B0<br />
B1<br />
B2<br />
B3<br />
<br />
Parent Customer = C0<br />
C1<br />
C2<br />
C3<br />
<br />
It will not group the parent with the children, and give a total for the parent + children.<br />
<br />
Your problem could also be that you need to select print = yes to both the 'Parent Customer' and 'Customer' when printing sales statistics.<br />
<br />
TIP : When dealing with multiple currencies in sales statistics, be careful, Baan IV will not get the correct historical exchange rate, it will take the current exchange rate.<br />
