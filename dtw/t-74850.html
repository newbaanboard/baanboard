<br />
As far as I know, after the shipment lines created, there is no way to cancel it, it should be handled with return sales order.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

i see if we cancel the origin SO line it will cancel the shipment line as well.<br />
but i see the stock  still shows allocated hence i dont wanted to cancel the line.<br />
i believe its  a bug in standard or purposeful?<br />
is there a way to release the allocated stock ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garlapati</div><div class="date">17th November 2022, 22:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the solution i found if it helps anyone.<br />
<br />
1.Go to the Stockpoint details which you can find the option once you open the shipment line.<br />
2.Open the Stockpoint details and zero the quantity to ship. This will update the line with the Not Shipped <br />
3.Freeze the shipment and then confirm it. You might get a message about the packing slip being zero and<br />
4.Now, return the Not Shipped Goods so they will be moved from the stag location to the location they cam<br />
5.Make sure your warehouse transfer processed correctly. You will get a message with the transfer number<br />
<br />
Go to the sales order and cancel the backorder line if  desired.</div></div><hr />
