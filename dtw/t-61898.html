For e.g we are processing milk in one batch and getting cost 10 RS per liter and using same item other BOM with new cost like 15 RS per liter.<br />

What you can do is create item Am B and C. Item A and item B shall be phantom You can define item C as its compoent. Item A cost can be Rs 10 and item B cost can be rs 15. I think this will work, but you may have to test it out</div></div><hr />

<br />
for e.g Through milking process farm is getting RAW Milk  @ RS 10 and they transfering to Plant @ RS 15 to make yougurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikash</div><div class="date">13th February 2012, 22:24</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible, use the 'Surcharge' as 50 % on the top level item by the CPC of the raw material A. In this case it is 50 % as you are now putting 15 instead of 10. It will work...</div></div><hr />

I do not think that your expectation is reasonable since an exactly same item in your company can not have 2 different cost. If this assumtion is correct, why you will produce the higher cost, or why do you not sell the lower cost milk?</div></div><hr />
