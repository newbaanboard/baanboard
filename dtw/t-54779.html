<br />
We have a problem with session &quot;whinr1540m000&quot; when we have negative quantities : <br />
it displays positive quantities where the quantity is negative.<br />
you can see attached file.<br />
Have you faced this problem before ?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkathait</div><div class="date">16th January 2009, 05:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you check the inventory in Item Inventory session (whwmd4100m100) for this item...<br />
<br />
The on-hand inventory that is displayed in Inventory Dashboard is the items' total inventory. It seems that the warehouse filter at the top is only to filter out the items...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medtun</div><div class="date">19th January 2009, 12:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this is infor's answer : <br />
<br />
&quot; the session whinr1540m000 may never have negative entries, because it show the effective stock point.Only values &gt;= 0 are allowed. <br />
The figure in session whwmd4300m000 refers to the table whwmd215 (session whwmd2515m000). The value of the related field whwmd215.qhnd may have a negative value, but in this case the functionality of negative inventory plays a role. <br />
Negative invenory is registered in table whwmd255 (session whwmd2550m000). From the screenshots I can see that negative inventory applies for the specific item and warehouse. This should only appear temporarily.<br />
Background:<br />
1. Goods arrived in the warehouse, but were ot yet confirmed received.<br />
2. These goods shall be delivered and are immediately picked to fulfill a shipment.<br />
3. When picking and confirming the shipment the negative inventory gets generated.<br />
4. In order to balance the negative inventory a proper warehouse receipt related to the purchase order (or production order) needs to be accomplished. Otherwise the negative inventory figures will persist.<br />
In such a situation negative inventory might still show up, even if a stock point in table whinr140 (session whinr1540m000) is available. <br />
Please check whether there still are receipts to be carried out for the item.<br />
You may check on data corruption, as well, by running session whwmd6290m000, first in test mode. <br />
Please give a feedback.<br />
Thank you and kind regards &quot;</div></div><hr />
