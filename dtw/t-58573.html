<br />
I have created a warehouse with type consignment (not owned).<br />
<br />
When I transfer inventory from this warehouse to a normal warehouse using a transfer(manual) order, Baan automatically create a “Purchase Consign Payment” PO.<br />
 <br />
My question is if there any table that store the link between the transfer(manual) order and the “Purchase Consign Payment” PO<br />
<br />
I am on Baan V.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

So we used a alternative way to match the purchase and the transfer order via FIFO rule(Fist In and First Out). You can recorder the GR(Goods receive) total Qty, Issue total Qty(transfer from consigment WH to normal WH) in every month .  As you know, the report only base on the Qty, not the actually physical item movement.<br />
<br />
BTW, in Baan FP5, a new functionality has been conduct as called CCT(condition and term), using the same pO, you can record you order, receive, transfer to your warehouse and the payment information in ONE Purchase order.</div></div><hr />
