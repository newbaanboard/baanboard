<br />
Does anyone use the following message - 855S.C Acknowledgment In: Compare (S)<br />
<br />
My problem is with the report that displays the differences between Purchase Order and Order Response, the only option I can find is to print to a central printer, the problem is that the buyers (users) are located in different parts of the country. <br />
<br />
The other option is the individual prints the report using the Direct Nework Communication to their printer, unfortunatley this means that the report contains all the 855S.C messages for the entire organisation.<br />
<br />
Has anyone overcome this problem or know a way round this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is required as multiple buyers (users) use the same suppliers.<br />
<br />
The sticking point seems to be in the Maintain EDI Messages Supported by Relations - tcedi0111m000.<br />
<br />
Do you know of anyway around this problem?</div></div><hr />

I mean may be you can copy the conversion setup of 850 std as 850.&lt;buyer / supplier&gt; and so on?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">29th March 2003, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">The other way odf doing this is, ask the Buyers(users)  to use different order types based on their locations. In this way you can able to attach different networks based on the order types using Maintain EDI Messages Supported by Relations - tcedi0111m000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
askajale:  I don't think that this is a workable option, since the messages are lifted by a 3rd party EDI Translator.  On first impressions it would not be feasible to ask the EDI Translator to look for so many different files, or maintain the list of files it should be looking for as the buyer population evolves.<br />
<br />
Chandra:  Again, this would be a workable solution within a smaller organisation, but we have over 150 buyers (dispersed over many locations) and about 40 Order types.  Obviously not all the buyers use all the order types, but creating duplicate order types per buyer would still be infeasible to manage.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestions, but have you any more?  Otherwise it looks like we are looking at customisation! :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
consider printing to an ascii file, and have a unix script splitting up the file based on buyer (should of course be on the report). After splitting up the file to files per buyer you can automatically have sendmail send the contents of the file to the buyer. It involves some scripting in unix but would be better than customisation.<br />
