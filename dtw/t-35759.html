<br />
this is because the session that converts only converts to lot controlled by lot and not by unit.<br />
<br />
Please share any ideas. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, it's not possible to convert from non-lot to lot by unit in whltc1202m000 (which is the session you would use in case of existing inventory). In case the item doesn't have any inventory though you should be able to use tcibd0501m000 (general item data).<br />
<br />
If you're only planning to convert a couple of items with limited inventory you could think of bringing the inventory down to 0, change to lot-by-unit and create bring the inventory back to the original level by creating the lots.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

I notice, if there are historical transactions present, General Item data Lot field is disabled even if inventory is wrote down to zero.<br />
<br />
Am beginning to think that I should change item master from back end after <br />
bringing inventory down and then create unique lots and adjust inventory up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankadam</div><div class="date">16th May 2007, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You're partly right regarding the historical transactions. The system checks the cumulative issue of the item in tcibd100 and in case that is different from 0, then it is NOT possible to change from 'not applicable' to either 'by lot' or 'by unit'. But in that case it IS possible to change from 'by lot' to 'by unit'. So, bring the inventory down to 0, change from 'not applicable' to 'by lot' by using whltc1202m000, change from 'by lot' to 'by unit' in tcibd0501m000 and then bring the inventory back to its original value.</div></div><hr />
