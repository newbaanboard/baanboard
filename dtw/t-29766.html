We are using Baan IV C4. We are Using ILC Module. I am getting a problem in single item Locations (i.e. Multi Item Location - No). <br />
I have defined a location as Multi Item Location - No, and assigned to an item, and Kept some Inventory. To store another Item in that location i shifted Precvious item inventory to another location but still 0.00 Qty is showing in that location and allowed another item to store. But when making transactions with New Item it is not allowing to do and throwing message &quot; another item present  in the location&quot;. How to delete the item of 0.00 Qty from the location.<br />
<br />
Thanks inadvance.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
When it's just a single record which is corrupt, I should clear it out via GTM, otherwise use one of the ILC correction sessions.</div></div><hr />
