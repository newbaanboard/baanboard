<br />
I am working with Infor LN 6.1 FP3.<br />
<br />
We have a client whose business is the sale of chickens, we have a difficult problem to solve. By definition of the business the stock unit is the &quot;unit&quot; and the storage unit is the kg, the movement of inventory in stock unit, that is the basic unit of the system, is fine, but in the storage unit we have serious problems because here enters a variant that is frozen and thawed chicken obviously does not weigh the same when entering winery when it leaves the same, then we propose that the base unit is the kg, but control issues can not hold.<br />
<br />
Anyone have an idea of how to implement this without having to modify the standard to allow in both stock drive as storage unit.<br />
<br />
Thank's</div></div><hr />
