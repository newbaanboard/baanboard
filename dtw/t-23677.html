<br />
The user observed the following when running Perform Valution By Warehouse by the same range on different month.<br />
<br />
In Jan, user ran the session with input valuation date as 31/12/04.<br />
In March, user ran the session with the same input valuation date (31/12/04) and noted one of the item group having discrepancy with that of in Jan.<br />
<br />
Kindly advice if this is possible? And if yes, under what circumstances that this could change</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most likely the cause was a back dated inventory adjustment<br />

<br />
But how is that possible?  I simulated but system doesnt allow date before current date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it is possible to record inventory adjustment for certain date in the past in either BaanIV or BaanERP that you use<br />

<br />
What version are you using? If it's 5.0c, I recall a bug with the Inventory Valuation report when running retrospectively which would cause such inconsistencies. <br />
I also remember a defect causing the Actual Issue date in Outbound Order Lines to be backdated (equalling the Planned Date if I remember correctly). This would also impact valuation in the past.<br />
<br />
Check the Knowledge Base for solutions.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tauhaina</div><div class="date">14th April 2005, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.  Yes, this is 5.0c.  If you can recall, does the patch available in SP12 and above?<br />
I searched the knowledge base, and found 1 or 2 with patch solution, but<br />
the issue are slightly different.  Anyway, I can use that as a ground.</div></div><hr />

Just went over my old Baan Support cases and discovered that the inconsistencies we were getting when running Inventory Valuations were caused by the post dating of Inventory Transactions. This itself was caused by a defect fixed by solution 135414.<br />
Basically, when Initiating Inventory Issues for production orders, there is an &quot;Issue Date&quot;. This was being used as the actual issue date in Inventory Transactions by Warehouse instead of the actual outbound release date. This then changed Inventory Valuations retrospectively.<br />
<br />
Not sure which SP this solution arrived in but the problem was identified somewhere between SP 10 and 11.<br />
<br />
Test this scenario out and see if it's causing your problems.<br />

Hi, <br />
<br />
The solution is already installed in system.  Could be other reason, I guess.</div></div><hr />
