<br />
In Baan Ivc4 theres a few items that have a last inventory transaction date (tiitm001.ltdt) that lies in the future. This cant be correct.<br />
<br />
Four of these items have been received on the same date (on a purchase order). Other items on this purchase order that have been received at different dates dont have a last inventory transaction date in the future so it seems it is  related to the receipt.<br />
<br />
Does this sound familiar to anybody? What couldve caused this situation?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />

<br />
sounds very strange. I suppose you're talking about purchased items. Did you check the inventory transactions in the history table (tdinv750) for this items?<br />
<br />
Martin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankb</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose you mean tdinv700, Martin? Yep, I checked that one but the last transaction date in there is still a date in the past.<br />
<br />
The last inventory date (in tdilc101) is in the past as well.<br />
<br />
But indeed, it concerns purchased items. Lot controlled by lot, FIFO, anymous MRP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">16th July 2003, 15:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, of course it's tdinv700.<br />
I have to admit that we don't have ILC implemented in our system. So all my experience does not consider ILC issues.<br />
<br />
I tired to reproduce a similar situation in our test system - without success. All dates in future were rejected by the system (date has to be equal or less then current date).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">17th July 2003, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">For me, that clearly sounds like a bug. I would not waste too much time on it now, probably it's one of these one-time-and-never-again problems that sometimes happen with Baan. Correct the dates with ttaad4100, and write a short sql query that you can run once a week to check if that problem occurs again. Then, however, you should go into detail - I would go and have a look where that last inventory date gets filled from for lot controlled items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">18th July 2003, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a few thoughts... <br />
<br />
Does your firm have users in multiple time zones?  I sometimes see deliveries made &quot;tomorrow&quot; (because it is a NZ user shipping in his &quot;today&quot;)<br />
<br />
I seem to recall that inspection does some strange things and sets some transaction times to 23.59.59 - was this what you saw? or was it really days ahead?<br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">19th July 2003, 00:09</div></div><div class="posttext">We too have seen that the time shown on many transactions is 23:59:59.<br />
<br />
Baan date stamps inbound with the original receipt date, regardless of when it's maintained.  If you maintain inbound on the original receipt date, baan will time stamp with the correct system time.  If you maintain inbound on any day proceeding the original receipt date, baan time stamps the transaction with 23:59:59.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankb</div><div class="date">21st July 2003, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks everybody for your input.<br />
<br />
Manish is right with the 23:59-thing: that happens in inbound cases but also in some other situations where the transaction date is prior to the system date. This is programmed in the function tcmcs0016<br />
<br />
In our case it's not a time-zone-issue, the last inventory date is something like two weeks into the future.<br />
<br />
Most times the date gets filled in tcmcsdll0100 but this dll gets input from sessions like 'maintain receipts', 'maintain deliveries', 'release outbound data' etc. In these sessions it's not possible to enter transaction dates in the future.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abraka1</div><div class="date">21st July 2003, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen 23:59 time stamp long time back in Baan where no ILC is implemented. Feedback from Baan was it was generated by Baan one of the correction programs for correcting quantity changes in maintains receipts and was fixed by Baan.<br />
<br />
Please Also check was system time changed by mistake? Any inventory transactions in history for those future days?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
We had situations in the past (with ILC turned on) where transactions were able to be posted  in future periods, so long as the fiscal period in finance had a status of &quot;Open&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Needless to say, we are very careful now to ensure that only the current fiscal period status is open, and all others are closed.<br />
<br />
