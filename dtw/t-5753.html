<br />
We have an item (class A) being identified as needed to be counted when it was counted 7 weeks previous,  Class A items are setup at 12 week counting interval in tdinv0100m000.<br />
<br />
This is apparently due to the fact Baan standard functionality is set to generate cycle count orders when ever new records are created.<br />
<br />
New records are generated when:<br />
A) stock is zero and a receipt is made, or  <br />
B) stock that has been counted is moved via an inventory transfer to another warehouse.<br />
<br />
Is this correct?  Surely you should only be counting after the 12 weeks, if no stock is available at 12 weeks the system should identify the item for counting after stock is made available.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

You didn't mention that there may be a new location for the item in question.<br />
<br />
In my experience, we generally leave both boxes unchecked.</div></div><hr />
