<br />
Need help with a weird demand from management.  We have an order that should have been invoice in April (don't ask me why because i don not know).:eek: <br />
<br />
The order is at print picking list so nothing was really done about it.  Here is the catch.  I need to process this order (outbound and invoice) so that it would be in April.<br />
<br />
At the end, inventory outbound, invoices and receivables would be in April.<br />
So the date of the process is an issue<br />
<br />
Can it be done?:confused: <br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<br />
did a quick test by entering an order as of april 30, processed it and saw that my inventory transfer (outbound) was done in may.<br />
i gues i have part of my answer, if i can't cheat the date of the inventory mouvement then there going to forget it.<br />
