I am sigit from Century batteries indoensia.<br />
We have implemented BaaN Vendor Rating. But we face an obstacle for item subcont.<br />
Can anyone help me how to rate supplier if the process is subcontracting process?<br />
As we know that subcontracting process have 2 process (Purchase order for amount and Production Order for Inventory).<br />
Vendor rating can be performed only for Purchase order and the item type is purchase order.<br />
Please help me.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<br />
 I am not clear about your problem. Procedure for subcontracting item is just similar to purchase item.<br />
<br />
From Production order you will get required date of item. From subcontracing receipt you will  get receipt date . From this you can easily calculate supplier performance as below<br />
<br />
Diff of Reuired date ( from production/purchase order)  &amp; Actual receipt date <br />
<br />
&gt; 0 MEANS Delay from supplier <br />
<br />
&lt; o  Supplier has given early <br />
<br />
<br />
Also with small customized report you can achieve more.<br />
<br />

Thank you very much for yor comment.<br />
Yes, you're right about it. <br />
Actually What I mean is about quality rating.<br />
We can not fill reject quantity plus Reason code of that rejection for Subcontracting item.<br />
Do you have any idea?<br />
Thank you very much for your help.<br />
<br />

<br />
I am not clear what you want to do. But you can reject subcontracting item in mfg side.<br />
It is true you can not reject item in tdpur4120m000. But<br />
In production order session complete operation , you can reject qty . This rejection details you can record in text (in tisfc151101m000 under operation text). <br />
<br />
Also same details can be recorded in tdpur4101m000 under header text for reference or<br />
<br />
In purchase order header two text fields are there reference  &amp; B. HERE ALSO YOU CAN INPUT REJECTION CODE for reference .<br />
<br />
It is true you can not reject item in tdpur4120m000.  <br />
<br />
Also if necessary you can customize report operation complete session with additional field of reason code where you can enter rejection code.<br />
<br />

first, thank you very much for your suggestion.<br />
But, BaaN Vendor Rating will attract or capture data from receipt (whinh3520m000) for rating quality, quantity, and also delivery time.<br />
Actualy, how to make a process for subcontracting item that will be processed via that session. So the rating will be captured.<br />
<br />
According to your suggestion that inserting reason code in operation completed. That's right, but customize report will not integrate with session that has already exist (Vendor rating).<br />
Do you have any idea?<br />
If you dont mind, would you like to show me what you had implemented in your company?<br />
I really thank you for yor help.<br />
<br />
Best Reagards,<br />

Yes. At present we use vendor rating by using BaaN for objective and subjective criteria. But we can not do it for subcontracting item. We do it manually using exel.<br />
How about you, have you used this at your system (Baan)?<br />
<br />
