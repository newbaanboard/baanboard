1. Purchase price: Price at which you buy the item from your supplier. This will be used in the calculation of std cost price in case of &quot;purchase&quot; Item.<br />
<br />
2. what is average price:This is the average price that will be calculated on the basis of actual receipts based on number of units received and the price at which they have been received.<br />
<br />
3. what is material cost: Cost of all the sub components for a particular manuf.item (calculated from BOM)<br />
4.Operation cost : cost of performing all the operations linked to routing (calculated from Routing, workcenters, machines and tasks)<br />
<br />
standard cost= purchase price+ surcharges (in case of purchase item)<br />
                   = material cost + operation cost +surcharges (in case of Manuf.item)<br />
                                                                        <br />
5.In what situation the variance is posted in the finance system: If there is a difference in the actual costs and the standard costs (it could be material cost or operation cost), then that difference will be reported as the variance amount and will be posted in finance.<br />
<br />
 Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The average price is calculated based on actual purchase price in purchase currency for inventory unit. It's updated from tfacp1140s000 (Invoice approval ) or tdpur4122m000 .  Help for 'method of calulating average price' in tdpur4100m000 has good illustration . It may be helpful to u.<br />

<br />
in what situation the variance is posted in the finance system. <br />
<br />
For FTP  valued items , variance is calculated for the difference between actual price and standard price at the time of actual goods receipt (in ILC too)  and at the time of actual price change in tdpur4122m000 / tfacp1140s000 .</div></div><hr />
