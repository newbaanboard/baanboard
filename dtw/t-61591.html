<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rkr999</div><div class="date">7th December 2011, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">What has been the experience in implementing lot control for FP7 with expiry date. One of the customers requires lot expiry dates to be incorporated at the time of receipts where they want to generate a lot number based on bar  code scanning as lot number and also key in a lot expiry date at same time. they do not want to create lot before receipt as they would like to use supplier lots and avoid duplicaiton .Looks like in Fp7 there is only one file which is alphanumeric for lot and lot date and no provsion for a expiry date<br />
Is there any workaround to get expiry dates for each lot at the time of po receipt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeff Ball</div><div class="date">8th December 2011, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a bit of a crude method, but if you set up a variable lot feature for expiry date in whltc2100m000, then link that to your item in whltc2110m000, then when receiving lots of the item the expiry date can be added to the lot using whltc2120m000.</div></div><hr />
