Handling Units (whwmd5130m000)<br />
Use this session to view or maintain handling units. Note that enhanced handling unit maintenance and handling unit structure manipulation functionality is available on the Compose Handling Units (whwmd5130m100) session.<br />
To maintain a handling unit in the Compose Handling Units (whwmd5130m100) session, select the handling unit and click Compose Handling Units. As a result, the Compose Handling Units (whwmd5130m100) session opens displaying the selected handling unit and other handling units with matching warehouses, locations, and statuses. If you do not select a handling unit and start the Compose Handling Units (whwmd5130m100) session, the Compose Handling Units (whwmd5130m100) session displays the handling units whose status, warehouse, and location match those of the top handling unit from the list of handling units displayed in this session.<br />
Note<br />
On the Specific menu, options you cannot use on account of the status of the selected handling unit are disabled.<br />

Field Description <br />
Handling Unit The handling unit code that is used to uniquely identify the handling unit in SSA ERP. You can either manually define handling units in this session or in the Compose Handling Units (whwmd5130m100) session, or generate handling units in various stages of the inbound and outbound flows. If you manually define a handling unit in this session, to define the handling unit code you can enter an alphanumeric code in this field. To enable SSA ERP to generate handling units, you must use Handling Unit Mask to define handling unit codes. When a handling unit is generated, the handling unit code is generated as specified in the handling unit mask. <br />
Version The version number of the handling unit. The initial version number of version-controlled handling units is 1. After a version-controlled handling unit is split, it obtains a new version number. Handling units that are not version-controlled always have version number 0.<br />
Handling units for which splitting is enabled can be defined as version controlled in the Handling Unit Version Controlled field of the Item - Warehousing (whwmd4100s000) session. <br />
Item The item that is packed by means of the handling unit. <br />
Quantity in Storage Unit The quantity of items expressed in the storage unit. If the handling unit is a parent and one or more child handling units of the parent are destroyed after inspection, the destroyed quantity is subtracted from the parent's quantity displayed in this field.<br />
Note that if you manually create a handling unit, you cannot specify the number of items to be packed by means of the handling units. To pack items by means of a handling unit, you can use the Pack command on the Specific menu of the Compose Handling Units (whwmd5130m100) session. For further information, see Pack: to generate a handling unit for a number of items. In addition, if handling units are generated for receipts, shipments, advice, inspections, and order lines, the handling units contain the number of items specified on the shipment, receipt, and so on.<br />

 <br />
Lot The lot to which the item in the handling unit belongs.<br />
Note<br />
If you scan a handling unit's label on receipt and the handling unit is specified for the ASN or ASN line in the Shipment Notices (whinh3100m000) session, SSA ERP retrieves the lot from the ASN or ASN line. If no lot is specified on the ASN or no ASN is available for the receipt, SSA ERP retrieves the lot from the Receipt Lines (whinh3112s000) session, if specified. <br />
Inventory Date The inventory date of the handling unit.<br />
Note<br />
If you scan a handling unit's label on receipt, SSA ERP retrieves the inventory date from the Receipt Lines (whinh3112s000) session when the receipt is confirmed. <br />

Complete If this check box is selected, the structure of the handling unit has not changed since the handling unit was received in the warehouse. If the structure of the handling unit is change after receipt, this check box is automatically cleared. <br />
Splittable If this check box is selected, the handling unit can be split up into two or more handling units, for example, as a result of inbound advice to different locations. <br />
Labeled If this check box is selected,, for each packing item defined for the handling unit, a label record is created. These labels can be printed. In this way, each existing packing item is uniquely identified. For example, if the boxes on a pallet are labeled, each box obtains a label when handling units are generated for an order for milk cartons. <br />
Latest Version of Label Printed The latest version of the label that was printed for the handling unit. <br />
Rejected If this check box is selected, the handling unit is rejected. If the rejected inventory functionality is in use, rejected handling units can be allocated. In such cases, the rejected handling unit would have the Allocated status. To indicate that the allocated handling unit is rejected, this check box is selected. <br />
SSCC Standard If this check box is selected, the handling unit code meets the SSCC Standard. <br />

Created by Process If this check box is selected, the handling unit is a dummy handling unit created by a warehousing process to support the consistency of the handling unit structure for the warehousing process.<br />
For example, two boxes, handling unit A and handling unit B are picked from the stock for the same order line. In the shipment created for the order, one shipment line with two boxes is created. To provide a link between the two handling units and the shipment line, a new dummy handling unit is created, which serves as a parent for theses two boxes. This dummy handling is marked Created by Process and and this handling unit appears on the shipment line. <br />

Number of Visible Units The visible units of a handling unit are the units that you can see. For example, if the handling unit is a pallet that contains 12 boxes, the number of visible units is 12, because you can see units that are placed on a pallet. If, on the other hand, the handling unit is a container that contains three pallets, the number of visible units is one, because the only unit that you can see is the container.<br />
In this field, you can manually enter the number of visible units, but you can also use the Calculate Visible Units command to calculate this number. The results calculated by this command are inserted in this field, overwriting any manual insertions. <br />
Dimensions Fixed If this check box is selected, the dimensions of the handling unit are fixed. This means, that the dimensions of the handling unit will not change if items are added to the handling unit. <br />

<br />
One of my colleague Sudip Tola prepared a documentation and training session.<br />
<br />
Let me take it with an example where you can understand easily. Maruti is selling cars in different colors. When a dealer orders for 50 cars. he randomly says 30 in white and 10 in blue and 10 in red.<br />
<br />
However during despatches , the user finds available qty is vary from ordered coloured. <br />
<br />
Here the functionality helps in selecting the colors during deliveries. [ This is morethan lot system - do not confuse with lots].<br />
<br />
Still i do not come across - if any one uses in real scenario.<br />
<br />
