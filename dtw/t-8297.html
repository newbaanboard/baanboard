<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">savitr</div><div class="date">6th January 2003, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">i want to add additional cost automatically to PO<br />
i defined a cost set next i attached a supplier with the cost set and then cost item with cost set(Price unit?)<br />
when i transfer the order through MRP this items gets attached at the last line no in PO but the ordered QTY and price remains zero the amount appears that i defined in supplier by item Price File.<br />
I want it to calculate based on the qty/amount transferred from MRP which is different based on requirement generated by MRP.<br />
I want it to be proportionate to amount/qty.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
