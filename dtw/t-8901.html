<br />
I would be very interested in both postive and negative experiences.</div></div><hr />

That is the easy way to plan your stock level, we recommand it to the people that don't want to use a complex system planning.<br />
The only requeriment to run it correctly is that you need to have historyc data.</div></div><hr />

SIC is good tool but it's reliability depends purely on data defined while maintaining Item master &amp; you need to keep it updated with all history data.<br />
<br />
but it is advised that SIC shouldn be used for low cast fast moving raw materials which should not fell short at any moment of time.<br />

Another point about the historical data. It should have a stable pattern. <br />
