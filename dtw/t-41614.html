One pitfall is: you can not use the Direct Delivery procedure with lot priced items. (Direct Delivery =&gt; no stock in your warehouse =&gt; no lot =&gt; no lotprice).</div></div><hr />

For manufactured items , lot pricing does not work properly. Also do not use cost price surcharges . U need to define accounts for lot results  in integration setups .</div></div><hr />

I need to use cost price surcharges. And I think If I manipultate tdltc004 and do some modification to tfgld410 series table then I think I can make it work proper. We use surcharges to add things like Brokerage, Commission, Freight etc on top of it to match it to actual. I do understand that Lot result settings is required. And I think I will get lot result when doing issue transaction like Sales issue or Produciton Issue. For Sales I think the lot result can be mapped ot COGS to get the accurate COGS. We don't want to drive it tp P&amp;L. From the face of it, it seems Lot pricing would work, may be little bit of modification required. We also use Sales order for Credit and Returns as well as for Service, and these will also need to get changed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">20th September 2007, 08:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I recollect the lot pricing work properly for purchased item when u want a lot price accurate in tdltc001 and tdltc004. With lot pricing , u can technically tally ur lot valuation report with ledger balance at actual purchase cost. Surcharges probably leads inconsistency if ur  credit account for purchase receipt is ITBR / GRINYA / GIT .<br />
<br />
In lot pricing lot result is calculated at the time of goods issue / price change for goods already issued out of lot . Revaluation of FTP price probably had some bug some years ago . There may be a fix probably in ur version.<br />
<br />
When u change the lot price in table tdltc004 , do take in to account tdltc001 lot price and lot result . Further test price change (tdpur4122 / acp1140)  and issue from all sessions (including warehouse / inventory adjustment ) . If u r through will ur changes in all situations , tally ur GRINYA, tally lot valuation to stock balance in finance , integration and finance does not have any discrepency , u can use ur changes to tdltc004 and tfgld410.</div></div><hr />
