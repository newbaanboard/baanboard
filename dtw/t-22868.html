In Maintain Purchase Order lines form 1 , the field Price Level = Item File Price  .<br />
I've check other Order , all Price level is &quot;Manually Enter&quot;.<br />
<br />
The end user said tht she didn't modify the price, but the price already change to new one. and from table tdpur051, she really make the changes...<br />
but the Price level = Item File Price.<br />
<br />
So, under what circumstances that the price will change with price level = Item File Price .Thanks.</div></div><hr />

For example if the price in the item master is 1.00 when the PO was entered then the PO will show 1.00 and item master price.  Let's say that now the price in the item master is changed to 2.00.  If you go into the PO line and make any change then the new 2.00 price will be set on the PO automatically if the parameter is set to automatic recalculation of prices and discounts.  If it is set to interactive then you will get a question as to whether you want to update the price.  If you turn this parameter to No then no recalculation will be performed.  Hope this makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hpng98</div><div class="date">24th January 2005, 03:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.<br />
If my Purchase Order Parameters setting is &quot;Automatic recalculation of prices and discount='automatic' &quot;<br />
<br />
When user make the price changes from &quot;Change Prices / Discounts after 'Maintain Receipts &quot; (in item file  ='YES' )<br />
.Will the system automatic recalculate the prices if user make any changes to the PO ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

If before you maintain receipts you make changes to the PO then the price will be recalculated automatically.</div></div><hr />
