<br />
In BaanVc / BaanERP,<br />
<br />
pls any one explain me the possibilities for this environment<br />
<br />
example.<br />
we are receiving a component (code -X)during different periods and priorities of receipts and shelf life as below.<br />
<br />
1) First 10000 nos - qty - received during april 04 - having shelf life till 2007.<br />
2)second 10000 nos -qty -received during may 04- having shelf life till 2008.<br />
3) third 10000 nos- qty -received during june 04 - having shelf life till 2004.<br />
4) fourth 10000 nos-qty - received during july 04 -having shelf life till 2009<br />
5) fifth 10000 nos -qty received during aug 04 -having shelf life till 2004.<br />
<br />
<br />
according to the Shelf Life for a components, the issues &amp; transactions to be made in the system.<br />
<br />
In General Item data / warehousing data , period for shelf life and shelf life periods only available , and in the same issuing data outbound priority can be fixed as FIFO, or LIFO.<br />
<br />
How this sample situation can be taken care.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">31st May 2004, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">In general item data you specify the std shelf life. This gets added to the receipt date as inventory date. When you receive the items the inventory date is updated but you can change the inventory date to the expiry date of the specific batch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">12th June 2007, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello - I'm wondering if items that previously did not have shelf life info on them but now do can have the tdilc101.date updated to reflect that?  Currently the date is blank.  I guess I have another issue as well - isn't that date supposed to be populated with the system date that the inventory was issued to or transferred to the location?  I'm just wondering why it is blank.  I am quite certain this is the date field I should be concerned with because when I look at the report to show items by expiry date this is the field under Prod. Exp. header.<br />
<br />
Thanks - Nikkiz</div></div><hr />
