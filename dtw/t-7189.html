<br />
Do you have checked the &quot;planed inventory transactions&quot;, <br />
&quot;warehouse inventory history&quot; and &quot;location inventory history&quot; (I suppose that you use ILC)? Maybe you can find an answer there , what´s happend with the stock.</div></div><hr />

example when you have a sls order inserted before the inventory is on stock it is possible to obtain neg. invy. <br />
another way is to allocate stockpoints so the pickinglist is not able to serve your request.<br />

The &quot;stock(inventory) on hand&quot; can´t be negative, but the &quot;available stock&quot; of course yes. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bisschops</div><div class="date">16th October 2002, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Allowing negative inventory enables you to deliver goods for an order if the goods are physically available but have not yet been registered. This happens if the physical flow of goods is faster than the electronical flow. <br />
<br />
Negative inventory<br />
<br />
In such a situation, iBaan ERP can register negative inventory in the Item - Warehouse - Negative Inventory (whwmd2555m000) session. Negative inventory is intended to be only temporary. <br />
<br />
iBaan ERP only creates negative inventory if the following apply: <br />
The Negative Inventory Allowed check box in the Inventory Handling Parameters (whinh0100m000) session is selected. <br />
For a serialized item the Serials in Inventory check box in the Item - Warehousing (whwmd4100s000) session is cleared. <br />
The warehouse is not of the Consignment (not owned) type or the Consignment (owned) type. <br />
The item's allocated inventory in the warehouse or location exceeds the item's inventory on hand. <br />
Inventory on order exists for the item, warehouse, location and/or lot combination. Negative inventory cannot be more than the inventory on order. <br />
You manually create an outbound advice in the Outbound Advice (whinh4525m000) session. If you use the Generate Outbound Advice (whinh4201m000) session, iBaan ERP does not generate outbound advice that result in negative inventory. <br />
<br />
<br />
If the inventory on order is (partly) received in the warehouse (when the receipt is confirmed in the Receipts (whinh3520m000) session), iBaan ERP subtracts the received quantity from the negative inventory quantity. If the received quantity is equal to or more than the negative inventory quantity, iBaan ERP deletes the negative inventory record. <br />
<br />
so this is for baan52a</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you for your detailed explanation. Of course, if the parameter &quot;negative inventory allowed&quot; is set, you are right. <br />
<br />
But nopadon have already posted, that they haven´t set this parameter. In that case, in BaanIV shouldn´t be possible to produce negative inventorys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">17th October 2002, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
There are a few reasons why you could be getting negative inventory even though your Parameter is set to NO. The subject has been fairly well discussed in this forum and there are several threads on the subject. Search on Negative and have a look :)<br />

<br />
       We are using BaaN IV c4 with SP 9. I could find that inventory goes -ve when the allocated qty in tdilc101 is negative.<br />
<br />
       For example the allocated qty for an item &quot;x&quot; is -10 (tdilc101 )and stock is , say, 30 Nos. When I generate outbound for 35 Nos, It generated outbound for 35 Nos and shows -5 as inventory.<br />
<br />
        You can also check it at your end. For us this allocated qty goes -ve when we do reverse of Sales Invoice.<br />
