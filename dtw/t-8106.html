How does it work, that the MRP shows an order proposal for the same item but for different stocks from different suppliers.<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Order 1, Article 4711, from Supplier X for department 1<br />
Order 2, Article 4711, from Supplier Y for department 2<br />
<br />
Whereas the different departments belong to different stocks.<br />
If anybody has an idea in the Baan ERP Standard version it would be fantastic to get any help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you won't succeed without setting up a multi site environment in your Baan installation.<br />
In your case you will have several logistic and I suppose several financial companies as well. I'm not very familiar to multi logistic environments, but as far I know this is the only way to have a MRP calculation for several warehouses separately. I'm not sure whether all logistic companies are able to share the item master data table(s).<br />
Hope that helps. Good luck!<br />

Best regards,<br />
