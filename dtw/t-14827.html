<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kw_foo</div><div class="date">17th March 2004, 07:55</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the reason for the system not allow changing of the postal and delivery address of the sales order after the outbound line was generated (before it was released) ?<br />
<br />
Sometime after we have maintain the outbound data and just before we want to ship the goods to customer, we receive notification from customer to ship the goods to other address or send the invoice to other address. The system does not allow us to change both address and pop up a message &quot;Outbound lines present for position 10&quot;.<br />
<br />
It is also difficult for us to delete all the outbound, change the address and maintain the outbound again since we cannot use the generate outbound data becaseu the stock is specially make for the order.<br />
<br />
Is ther any simple work around ?<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
<br />

<br />
if Customer changed the delivery addresses to address 2 after delivery, it is not possible to change the code in specific delivery address in tdsls04101m000, whereas we can change the adresses  in the session tccom1102m000 - name field and adresses for the same code.<br />
<br />
Hope this will works.<br />

Thanks<br />
