<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scotty</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently using BaaN IV c4 with S.P.6.<br />
At the moment, the stock value of 1% of my items is different between ILC and INV. I have recently found cases where I could identify what had happened, but I don't have a clue of what generates the problem and how to solve it.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me on this subject ?<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">extuma</div><div class="date">9th January 2003, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">First I would check to ensure that the onhand quantities are in balance for all the inventory tables. If ilc101 is out of balance with inv001 for example then this could explain the difference.<br />
<br />
Here are Baan sessions (not on menus) for doing the check and corrections. I suggest you contact Baan as they can provide documentation.<br />
<br />
tdinv0250m000, Rebuild planned inventory transactions <br />
tdilc0250m000, Rebuild Inventory Data (ILC) <br />
tdinv0252m000, Check Inventory Data</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">btromp</div><div class="date">14th January 2003, 17:57</div></div><div class="posttext">There are multiple reasons why there is a difference between ilc and inv. You can look at the object otcmcsdll0100 and sfcdll0100, these are process stock dll's.<br />
To invenstigate the problem you must dive into the tables to look what has happened..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 11:02</div></div><div class="posttext">... and this requires specific help on your specific situation. There can be a lot of reasons, starting with software error via misuse of sessions, wrong procedures (especially with cycle counting), GTM etc, that can cause this. That is why I told you to log a case, in that way you can get specialized support 1 to 1 that will help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">6th February 2003, 20:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been attempting to grind this problem down with Baan's assistance.<br />
<br />
We have just loaded a further 2 solutions on top of 5 others we put on previously.<br />
<br />
These solutions resulted from work done in another user site with Baan<br />
<br />
We are now in a further &quot;review&quot; period with Baan . <br />
<br />
So in about a month's time we should know whether the problems have been improved/eradicated.<br />
<br />
I can advise the solutions but hopefully your Baan support will also inform you of them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">20th June 2003, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an update to say after further Baan solutions to clear up 2D and 4D issues. Baan may have cracked it<br />
<br />
On another point are there any rules in what sequence tdilc0250m000 and tdinv0250m000 should be run and if so the logic ?</div></div><hr />
