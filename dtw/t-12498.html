<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veyant</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 08:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I am facing a problem that one of my sales Invoice is not getting posted in finance and is appearing in no-posted integration table (tfgld416)<br />
<br />
Here is the case history:<br />
<br />
Actually, we sale to customers on fixed prices not discount and no setup is made for the discount as we have never made the dicount. Howver we have a discount ledger a/c &quot;Cash Discount&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well, one day my sales person has to give discount to a customer &quot;J001&quot;. we book freight thrua  seprate Item code &quot;CICMT00000000&quot; and it is a cost item and integration is set for this cost item.<br />
<br />
Now he had put qty as i and price as the Freight to be charged. this is usually followed for every invoice on which frieght is to be included. But in this particular case he has inputted manually 500 rs. as discount instead of discount % and amount field calculated the net amount.<br />
<br />
But when he made the PDSO, the transactions are gone into tfgld416. But when my fin guy is posting these integration transactions, he is getting error msg &quot;ledger a/c not defined&quot; in integration transaction log and is not posting the integration entry.<br />
<br />
I think as he has issued discount and system has no ledger a/c attached for discount for Sales / Sales Invoice integration. <br />
<br />
<br />
Can somebody help me in setting up the integration to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
We had some elusive errors when we first set up the system and also when the accountant responsible for the integration setup has changed (new guy needs training).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jftello</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">For discounts, you have to setup the account using session tdsls6101m000 - Maintain Invoice Analysis Accounts. Then, you need to reverse that transaction in Finance.<br />
<br />
I hope this can help you</div></div><hr />
