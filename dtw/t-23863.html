<br />
In PMC menu, sales order procedure there is a part with 1 customer but 2 different shipment.<br />
<br />
( different shipment)<br />
<br />
********different shipment ---  both shipment done at one time with allocated qty.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
Sales Order:so1 and so2<br />
Item: 2067<br />
Customer: cust1<br />
QTY IN WAREHOUSE:  100k<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
One so1 is created with qty 100k and the first shipment is done with 40k.<br />
<br />
(balance 60k). <br />
<br />
When we want to create the second sales order so2  with qty 10k the <br />
PMC menu in the warehouse does not give the balance 60k. It's giving 0 qty to maintain in SO.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
What happens actually, when the first SO is created it takes all the quantity in warehouse .<br />
<br />
Although there are balance in warehouse, it allocates the qty for the first SO<br />
but practically the second SO can be done.<br />
<br />
I think there is a setting in some session to force the sales order to be completed before the second one starts. <br />
<br />
Is it because of the order data type in tiitm0101m000  (Maintain Item Data) form 4 is set to Lot for Lot. <br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me some suggestion on this problem?<br />
Your reply is highly appreaciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day. :)</div></div><hr />

Then you can use the inventopry for shipment in another sales order.</div></div><hr />
