I have an order and I want to release it. When I try to do so, I get the Message &quot;No data within Selection&quot;.But when my colleague is doing it it works OK.It is an order I have created.  Any idea??<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

Your colleague performs on the same machine with the different Id or on different machine? <br />
Your default company and your colleague's default company is same and it is the company where the order is created?<br />
You have rights to release an order as your colleague has rights?<br />

Thanks for your reply. Well, the case is as follows:<br />
Different machine, different id, same rights.<br />
The wierd thing is that althought I cannot realese the purchase order, I can release it line by line.And if the order has 2 lines is Ok, but usually has 200 lines.And mainly we want to understand what is going on as well as solving the problem.<br />
Any idea?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you put the session in the debugger and check the query which exits as it not found any record to release the purchase order. Check precisly the where clause and other programming checks that make false to select the recrods.<br />
