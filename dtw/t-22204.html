<br />
Need to find out how to correct the costing in Baan IV for my company.<br />
<br />
Currently, we found out that our surcharges table has been wrong for some time. So the std cost is already wrong.<br />
<br />
In order to correct the stnd cost, I am suggesting this, so please confirm whether my steps is correct or not. Do we have to adjust all the quantities? Is there a faster way as we do not want to key in inventory adjustment transactions for our 12000 items.<br />
<br />
1) Adjust out all quantities<br />
2) Correct the surcharges tables<br />
3) Adjust in all quantities<br />
<br />
If I want to import the correct cost into the baan using excel and ascii file, what would be the steps?<br />
<br />
Can someone out there assist me, please.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

What you need to do is to correct the surcharges and then run a cost roll.  The changes will be made and the inventory costs will be updated automatically.  You will see an adjustment to inventory and an adjustment to what ever account you specified in the integration tables.  There should be no need to adjust inventory in and out.</div></div><hr />
