<br />
In BAAN IV c4:<br />
<br />
We change purchase price by customer and sales prices by customer in november.<br />
Problem : we have purchase orders lines and sales orders lines with wrong price. Today we have to take each PO and each Sales orders manually to set the good price. This work is too long. Could you give any solution ?<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
I have an item &quot;A&quot; and customer &quot;C1&quot;<br />
<br />
- The 15 october:<br />
   I entered a sales order to deliver in november.<br />
   The price list of item &quot;A&quot; was from 01/01/2004 to 31/12/2004 equal 1 euro<br />
   for this customer.<br />
   My sales orderline has the price 1 euro<br />
<br />
- The 25 october:<br />
   I enter a new price for this item : <br />
   - from 01/01/2004 to 31/10/2004 equal 1 euro<br />
   - from 01/11/2004 to 31/12/2004 equal 1,5 euro<br />
   I have to change the price of my sales orderline to have the good price  <br />
   manually. (But it's too long if i have a lot of salesorder)<br />
<br />
There is a session that i don't know yet who can change that automatically or i have to developp a new session.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

 You may try using the session &quot;Global update of sales prices and discounts&quot; (tdsls0201m000).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smanohar</div><div class="date">16th November 2004, 05:47</div></div><div class="posttext">When you zoom from Order Line, you can see the &quot;Recalculate the order amount&quot; (or in similar name. I don't have access to Baan system at home, hence cannot spell the exact name).<br />
<br />
But that session is available to be run manually for each order. What you can do it is create a new session which in turn will call the existing session in the background for the range of orders you want to recalculate the order amount.<br />
<br />
PS: But if your pricing in based on order date and the order date falls in the old bucket, then nothing will change.</div></div><hr />

I'll do the best to manage the new price.</div></div><hr />
