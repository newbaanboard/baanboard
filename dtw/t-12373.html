<br />
I have a Partner, that I can purchase in two currencies (for example EUR and USD).<br />
I defined the currency of the Partner in EUR, so when I made a PO for the parts in EUR everything is ok, the problem is when I want to buy parts in USD. Baan takes the currency defined in the table of Partners, so Baan makes the change in the lines of the PO from USD to EUR.<br />
<br />
I tried to defined a partner parent with the same results.<br />
The idea is to pay to the same partner in USD or EUR depend on the parts<br />
Is anybody know how can I handle this?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />
<br />
I have Baan 5c</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try to use the Price Books.<br />
You should be able to set up prices in different currencies by item  in a price book and then utilize a price matrix to make sure the right prices in the right currencies are picked up.<br />
<br />
The down side is it means a lot of set up but once done it should fix your problem.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
But when I create a manula PO, by default Baan will take the currency defined in Partners.<br />
I am using Contracts and I defined some parts in USD and others in EUR, and Baan always takes the currency of the table of Partners.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />
<br />
PS I am using Baan 5c</div></div><hr />

<br />
When PO is manually created, at first BaanERP will assume that the PO will use the currency defined as business partner's usual currency. When we deal with business partners which do transactions in several different currencies, I've seen 2 approaches:<br />
 Create separate business partner ID for each currency the business partner uses. This is not recommended as it'd be a bit harder to consolidate transactions per business partner<br />
 Use Purchase Order Input Control and, through it, only give access to absolutely necessary fields including currency. When Purchase Order Input Control is on, the clerk have to go through and check every single of those important fields before he/she can even enter a PO line (i.e. you can't save the PO and enter PO lines unless the clerk has &quot;Tab&quot; through every single important fields defined in PO Input Control). Using this has minimised PO input error in one of our clients<br />

<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
I am agree with you, we have already set those parameters, but the problem is a little bit complex.<br />
With manual orders we can solve it this way, but for orthers planned by Enterprise Planning (MRP), I can not divide the one that are for USD from the ones that are for EUR.<br />
<br />
Any more help, will be apprecite.<br />
<br />
Maybe a customization may apply, what do you think?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
