<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beluver_2k</div><div class="date">21st April 2011, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">We are making a PO approval system, meaning PO will be made by sub-buyer and Buyer who is having appropriate authority will be able to approve the PO. We have disabled the Approve choice from form of tdpur4100m900 and we have developed one session to approve using AFS. <br />
<br />
Issues is in std ERP LN system checks all the error which are related to PO header and po line related while approving the po and if all  the checks are not satisfied it gives error and po does not get approved. In this case approver has to send PO back to buyer and then modification is done and po is resent for approval.<br />
<br />
Is there a way available to check the po error while sending the po for approval?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards.</div></div><hr />
