<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindah</div><div class="date">23rd August 2001, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">We have just migrated from 4b4 to 4c4 and when generating INV Production orders in 4c it appears that Baan ignores the already on order qty., and places a new order for same amount for manufactured item. This is NOT happening on INV Purchase Orders.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any information on a problem like this. Any help or input appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
There may be problem but before arriving at conclusion please check following points.<br />
<br />
- Is there any replenishment order for manufacturing order to non-nettable warehouse?<br />
- Is there any sales order for this manufactured item?<br />
- If this item has got wrongly included in estimated material of some other item?<br />
- Is there any prod order of parent item where this item is used as child.(May be MPS or MRP)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lindah</div><div class="date">31st August 2001, 15:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your response!  I have requested information from my Inventory Control People and will advise ASAP.<br />
<br />
Also, we are on 4c4 Service Pack 7.<br />
<br />
I am hoping for as much help as possible.  Today INV planned 659 Manufactured Item Orders and 90 Purchase orders.  It makes NO sense?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inventory figures like &quot;Inv on order&quot; and &quot;allocation&quot; is sometimes wrong in Baan (and other ERP-systems). This will influence the output from different tools (MPS, MRP, SIC) you use for planning.<br />
<br />
Try to run tdinv0250m000, Rebuild Planned Inventory Transactions, but do it when there is no one in the system. <br />
This session delete all records with planned Inv transactions and rebuild them because of the orderlines in the system. <br />
This might help!<br />
