- Warehouses with or without locations<br />
This is a major issue, because if your warehouses do not have locations there is no inbound and outbound movement needed.<br />
<br />
- Use of lot control<br />
- Use of storage units<br />
- Use of storage dates<br />
The answer on these issues determine whether or not you zoom to specific ILC sessions when making inbound or outbound movement.<br />
<br />
Not that I know an answer to your questions, but I know more info is needed to answer your question ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A generate outbound advice session in your order procedure, must be re-executable. You can also maintain an outbound advice and thus bypassing the generate outbound advice.<br />
<br />
If you have warehouses without locations. What will the release outbound data do?</div></div><hr />
