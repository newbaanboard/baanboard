<br />
Hope everyone is fine. Have a query. I checked Baan Item Master file and our users have created over 200 item codes which has the status 'signal code' as<br />
either old items OR cancelled.<br />
<br />
These items are no longer in use .<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Prior to deletion ,what are the steps that i should take ?<br />
Once these codes are deleted are the history of transaction also deleted or kept in another file for future view ?<br />
Pls advice<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />
Yours in service<br />

<br />
You may not delete any itemcode as long it refers to any other table in the company. In order to delete itemcodes but keep the historical data alive, you have to archive transactions, salesorders, productions orders etc. This is usually done by the standard archiving sessions available for ever package. During this process the data are physically moved to another company.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

If it has not been used it can be deleted. If manufactured, make sure you remove the BOM &amp; Routing first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">6th October 2006, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Item deletion program des not delete an item if it's used in any transaction tables like sales , purchase , production , histories , inventory etc . The deletion program ( suppose tiitm0203m000) deletes BOM / routing on its  own if it's inventory is 0 .<br />
<br />
The item deletion program however does not check reference in other logical companies (important if ur item master is shared across companies )  and it may give u fatal error .<br />
<br />
U can use ttaad4229m000 program to check item references .</div></div><hr />
