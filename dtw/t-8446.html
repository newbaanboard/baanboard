Baan is populating many files on the outbound.  Can the package be configured to export one file and within the file define if the data is an envelope, header, or line items?<br />
<br />
Any advise on how to achive this will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume that you loaded the defaults.edi file to get all of the standard edi messages.  I think that you will find there are two different message layouts for each message type (for a PO it is 850 and 850S).  The message layouts that end in &quot;S&quot; are single file layouts that define the different lines inside the file as envelope, header, lines.  It would be in the session Maintain Messages by Relation (or something like that - my BAAN is down right now) where you would instruct BAAN to use the &quot;S&quot; message structure.<br />
<br />
I have never worked with the single file version of the messages as I have always liked the levels files for what I do.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

But I did not receive a layout for the an 850 and an 850S.  I only received a layout for the 850.<br />
<br />
Do you know if some one created the 850S?<br />

My defaults are the result of importing def4c.x12.  Do you know if you imported the defaults from this same file or perhaps you used def4c.edi?<br />
<br />
Can the package be configured to export one file for the envelope, header, and lines using the defaults from def4c.x12?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use conversion setups with 'S' extension (like 850S, 855S, etc.) to create single file for Envelope, Header and Lines. These are baan standard conversion setups and can be obtained from BaaN support site.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you have any questions.</div></div><hr />

The file that I have always used to load edi messages is called 'defaults.edi'.   As above, I normally get it off of the ftp.support.baan.com.  As to where... I have to find it every time as I forget between trips.<br />

We use Bann IV c3 and produce multiple file messages. <br />
<br />
While hacking around with the edi function I found that you could produce single file messages if you modify the filename in the Maintain Conversion Setups (Relation) session.<br />
<br />
In the Filename column change them all so they are the same i.e change all the 850.1,850.2, ...  to 850 (for that particluar message).<br />
<br />
This will produce a single file message, the file probably needs looking through to check everthing is there, but at least it is a starting point.</div></div><hr />
