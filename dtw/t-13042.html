<br />
Q.1 Are tdinv750 and 760, the only tables mainly impacted with that field ?<br />
<br />
Q.2  Is anyone aware of a problem , of changing the field . Say if its been set to &quot;4 weeks&quot; (for some time now) and we then decide that we would like to change it to &quot;Monthly&quot;. <br />
<br />
is their any possibility of corruption due to that. I tried to go in and change the field (in test system) and it allowed me to do so.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">You will need to rebuild the history if you want it to be in month periods - see notes from I case I logged below:<br />
<br />
I have checked out the functionality of tdinv0254m000 Check Item Issue and it will rebuild your data from 13 X 4 week periods to 12 monthly periods. You need to run it with Check by Warehouse set to No to rebuild table tdinv750 and then with Check by Warehouse set to Yes to rebuild data in tdinv760. One evidence will be that values no longer appear in period 13 in the tables. You can do some testing for small ranges and in non-update mode. Before running in update, I would suggest taking backups of tdinv750 and tdinv760 just in case and then run the sessions with no-one else on the system. They are likely to take some time.<br />
<br />
There have been a few Solutions for tdinv0254m000 to correct incorrect handling of certain transaction types, so please make sure that your software is up to date before running. The latest Solution is below. If you don't already have this solution please install it together with any pre-requisites. <br />
I will also point out that the help text against the parameter field could be more helpful. <br />
<br />
VERSION(S):<br />
B40_c<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
&quot;Check Item Issue&quot; (tdinv0254m000)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The production batch orders were not considered when selecting the inventory transactions by item records. This resulted in a wrong update of the item issue records.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The production batch orders are now considered when running this session. The item issue records is now updated correctly.<br />
<br />
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:<br />
None.<br />
<br />
PATH NAME IN DIAL-UP DIRECTORY/WEB SITE:<br />
Below are the supported VRC's based on the Baan standard derivation structures. It is necessary to download and patch all links contained under the VRC in the order listed. The solutions may contain standard and localized components, which require multiple ftp links.<br />
<br />
If your Current VRC is:<br />
B40_c, B40_c1, B40_c2, B40_c3, B40_c4:<br />
/ftpdownload/updates/B40_c/161297stnd<br />
**************************************************<br />
One further point I thought of yesterday evening.  The rebuild is based on the <br />
individual transation records in tdinv700.  If any archiving of tdinv700 has <br />
been carried out using tdinv7210m000, then it would not be possible to rebuild <br />
the oldest records.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pandy1909</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 12:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the update. I do believe that records have been archived. Guess that would cause a problem for older records, but that should at least set the values correctly for last few months/periods.<br />
<br />
Also if the parameter is changed without running the session, does anyone see any potential cause of problems (apart from my reports not showing correct values - which is okay as we dont use the standard item usage reports using table tdinv750 and tdinv760).<br />
<br />
As currently we are in September, I was planning to change at the end of this month, the parameter to Month and move any values in aupp(10) to aupp(9). I am aware that this will cause a problem for values for September and before, but From October onwards we would have correct values.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on the above would be helpfull.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
The history was archieved and we didn't use tdinv0754, but a specific which corrected aupp and fupp like:<br />
<br />
        set.mem(new.val,0)<br />
        new.val(1) = tdinv750.fupp(1) + tdinv750.fupp(2)*0.11<br />
        new.val(2) = tdinv750.fupp(2)*0.89 + tdinv750.fupp(3)*0.11<br />
        new.val(3) = tdinv750.fupp(3)*0.89 + tdinv750.fupp(4)*avril<br />
        new.val(4) = tdinv750.fupp(4)*avrim + tdinv750.fupp(5)*0.29<br />
        new.val(5) = tdinv750.fupp(5)*0.71 + tdinv750.fupp(6)*0.39<br />
        new.val(6) = tdinv750.fupp(6)*0.61 + tdinv750.fupp(7)*0.46<br />
        new.val(7) = tdinv750.fupp(7)*0.54 + tdinv750.fupp(8)*0.57<br />
        new.val(8) = tdinv750.fupp(8)*0.43 + tdinv750.fupp(9)*0.68<br />
        new.val(9) = tdinv750.fupp(9)*0.32 + tdinv750.fupp(10)*0.75<br />
        new.val(10) = tdinv750.fupp(10)*0.25 + tdinv750.fupp(11)*0.86<br />
        new.val(11) = tdinv750.fupp(11)*0.14 + tdinv750.fupp(12)*0.93<br />
        new.val(12) = tdinv750.fupp(12)*0.07 + tdinv750.fupp(13)<br />
        new.val(13) = 0<br />
<br />
There was no problem after this operation.<br />

<br />
not sure i understand the logic which you have used. What is  <br />
<br />
a. the basis of using the (.89 and .11) or (.71 and .39) etc to change the values of the period.<br />
<br />
b. what are the variables avril and avrim<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
