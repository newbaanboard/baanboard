I want to attach documents to any ERP LN 6.1 screen, using Attachment function, but this icon is not enabled. I already implement ODM module.<br />
What else should I set up to work with this function?<br />
It is Urgent<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

Did you populate session 'Objects', dmsys1511m000? I guess that the tools are getting the information from this table.<br />

Thanks for response!<br />
I used session dmsys2210m000 to import system data from dump files into ERP packages, so I have objects, objects families, object masks. I defined roles, roles by employee, areas, hosts, libraries, and so on. And still attachment icon is disabled.<br />
Any ideea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotjens</div><div class="date">24th August 2007, 13:07</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know one also needs to use session dmsys9512m000 to indicate whether or not the ERP Objects need this option.</div></div><hr />

And nothing changed. The icon is disabled in tdsls4100m000 both forms: current view and details, tdsls4100m900 sessions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this problem rsolved ?  If not , Which version of Ln or you working on , bcause I had a similar problem on Ln6.1 FP3 , but was able to fix it by a solution given on infor(onepoint support) - ftp site.  So you can check for the solution on the site.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it isn't. We have FP3 b61au3 and tools version 7.6 a. <br />
It is strange becouse few month ago I was able to set up ODM and attach documents to sales order and order lines. <br />
I connected to onepoint support and looked for Baan solutions with similar problems and I found solution ID220525 with connection to ftpdownload/updates/7.1_a_tt/220677tt . Is this solution you refer to? Becouse I checked in LN and we don't have this one. I tried to work in worktop ( we use BW) and attachment command is not available (we have a different situation than situation described in ID220525).<br />
<br />

Should work in my opinion.</div></div><hr />
