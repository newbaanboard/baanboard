<br />
Currently our set  up for location control is set to Yes and now we will be implementing new set of companies in Baan  in which we intend not to implement Location control. . <br />
<br />
Can you give us some points or information on  the advantages and disdavantages of  setting of Location Control to No/Yes.<br />
<br />
We are in BaanIVc4.<br />
<br />
thank you in advance.<br />

<br />
By Implementing Location Control, you can track the Inventories by Location in a particular warehouse.  If don't implement Location Control then u lose this advantage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">11th January 2005, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Location control requires more steps to process - all of the inbounding and outbounding - and the requirement to not allow negative inventory.  In general I recommend that a company that has not had the discipline of running location control or managing inventory effectively that they start out without location control, get to know Baan and then implement later if required.  If they do in fact have a big inventory issue with stuff all over then perhaps location control is the answer.  Consider also the personnel issue.  It takes more to run location control.  If this is a small company then location control may not be the best choice.  I find that every company is different.  Remember that you can always turn it on but once on you cannot turn it off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1: Possibility to store goods on locations instead of in warehouse (nothing new I guess)<br />
2: All in-and outbounds will flow via the same &quot;visual door&quot;, namely in and outbound sessions.<br />
<br />
In case of larger number of records (items/transfers/locations) this makes it possible to process movements in a more controlled way.</div></div><hr />

It really wasn't needed in the first place.<br />
<br />
How can you turn it off?<br />
<br />
Create new warehouses without location control and transfer inventory I'm assuming?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

EVen if you turn off the location control by warehouse, the outbound steps are mandatory. Though system doesn't one go back, but it can be done if done with knoweldge. These are the steps (for non Project system).<br />
<br />
1. Remove the outbound steps if present in any sales order or replenishment order. PLease adjust the open order and and the pmask of these orders.<br />
<br />
2. Make sure that the inv001 inventory tallies with tdilc101 inventory<br />
<br />
3. At this stage, the location control flag at company level can be turned off via Genral Table Maintaineance.<br />
<br />
One will loose the location history from this point onwards. The old data will remain in the table.<br />
<br />
The key here is to adjust the procedure mask of open orders.<br />

Thanks<br />
