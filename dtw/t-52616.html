<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Michael Andrus</div><div class="date">2nd June 2008, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Good morning. I'm working on a customized report that mimics certain features of the standard report whina1210m000. In a manner similar to that of whina1210m000, my report will look back in time to find the inventory on-hand at the requested date and time.<br />
<br />
This logic works fine in my report. The question is regarding rejected inventory. It is obvious to me that the main dll in whina1210m000 is handling rejected inventory by increasing or decreasing the inventory for reporting by a rejected amount. (These are in the whinr110 table.) <br />
<br />
My question is if anyone understands Baan's logic in this computation? In the dll itself, it is not at all obvious how Baan is doing the arithmetic on this. It appears to me to be inconsistent and sometimes it is added to the inventory amount reported and sometimes it is subtracted from the amount reported.</div></div><hr />
