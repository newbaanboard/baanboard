<br />
Our system implement HU for our whse.<br />
End of this month, we would like to organize a stocktake.<br />
Therefore, there are possibilities that boxes with Closed HU will available at physical.<br />
Based on my knowledge, once HU has closed, we can't open back using Cycle-Counting.<br />
<br />
So, does anyone can advice me, how i can up the stock balance using the same HU eventhough it is already closed.<br />
<br />
Thank you,.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As of the release of LN 10.4 this functionality will be supported. Unfortunately, for older FPs, you'll have to generate a new HU id or decide for a customization.</div></div><hr />
