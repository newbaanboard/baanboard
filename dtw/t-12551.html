In the session tdilc1121s000 (runs after the session tdilc1120m000)sometimes it says &quot;Inventory already taken for inspection&quot; and does not let the process to end. But there is enough inventory on hold to make the adjustment. What that &quot;inspection&quot; means? How can I get over it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

- is there any inspection -to be done- setting for the item, supplier and PO -if it is one-<br />
- quarantine reasons like a cycle counting, blocked location<br />
- check the qms params and settings for a change (faulty import,...)<br />
....<br />
on hold is inventory at inspection location or blocked transactions inv, or lot is blocked <br />
(if it is an urgency, I check my mail frequently (more freq than the forum:) at mehmet_uslu@hotmail.com, we can post the results to the forum later.)<br />
hope it helps</div></div><hr />
