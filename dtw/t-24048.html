<br />
(Baan 5c.)<br />
<br />
When the planned purchase orders(cp)  are transferred to Purchase orders control, in the Purchase order lines,the system updates the order date based on the supply lead time, which is calculated backward from delivery date (tdpur4101s000). The field is also grayed out.<br />
<br />
If we want to change the planned delivery date of the line, then it is not allowing to update it earlier than the order date.  If you try from the PO header changing the shipping date, still the system is not allowing to update the order date &amp; delivery date.<br />
<br />
Any method to change the Delivery date and order date in PO lines, when the header delivery date is changed?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

How about changing moving in the order date in PO header first before moving in the delivery date in its lines?<br />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
The order date in header is grayed out and will not be available for changing when you create order from planned orders.  Once you delete all order lines then system allows to change the order date. But the problem is normally order has morethan 8 to 10 lines. so lot of care to be taken while deleting and creating again. Moreover, to change one particular line delivery date, all the order lines are to be deleted and created, it is time consuming work.<br />
<br />
Any other method or solutions pls? <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<br />
You're right. But also please bear in mind that you can reduce such headache by only releasing planned purchase order when it's already very close to execution date. In other words, do all planning possible in Enterprise Planning first, including rescheduling in and out of planned purchase delivery<br />
