<br />
Does anyone currently use LN10.4 without Auto Connect (aka Automotive Exchange) and works specifically with Daimler/Freightliner sales and shipping schedules?<br />
<br />
We are currently experiencing issues while trying to keep our Accum's working as they had in Baan IV Supply Chain (NAS0).  I know LN doesn't contain the Supply Chain functionality.  We would just like to talk (or email) with a Infor customer if someone similar to us is on Baanboard.  <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
