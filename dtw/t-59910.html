<br />
We want to cancel a purchase order line. Release to warehousing is already done for this line. Can anyone guide, how this can be done.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Once it is cancel, it will be canceled automatically from warehouse also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Already know the way you suggested but that option is disabled. I have checked throughly and there is no receipt against that line.<br />

<br />
Fo you have any detail lines against that perticular PO Line.?<br />
If yes, cancel the detail line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it is not possible to cancel the line after the goods are received. But it is also not possible when in warehousing the inbound line is linked to a Receipt (whinh3512m000) it is not possible to cancel the line. In that case, just unlink the receipt line.</div></div><hr />
