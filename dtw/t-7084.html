<br />
I am trying to delete sales order lines which the status shows<br />
&quot;Deleting line...............&quot;  thru the session <br />
tdsls4223m000,  by entering  &quot;Delete Order data&quot; is &quot;Yes&quot; and  Date until current date.   But system does not delete any order line. Still I can see  many sales order line status (tdsls4533m000) shows &quot;Deleting line&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also I am experiencing the same problem  in Purchase order line.<br />
<br />
Please advise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">9th October 2002, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">The status - Deleting order line means that you have fully processed this order line in the Distribution Module. You have selected to delete the order line when you run the session Process Delivered Sales/Purchase Orders. The order lines will be removed from this table when it has been processed in the Finance Module. Untill then the status will be deleting order line. Once processed in the Finance module the order line will be removed by the system but the info will still be visible in the Sales/Purchase History tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">9th October 2002, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes,  from the beginning we never choose delete order data<br />
when we process delivered sales orders.  Sales order details shows from the year 1999.  None of the order pending for posting in finance until today.  Almost all the orders are processed / posted in finance. <br />
<br />
how can we remove sales order lines...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. there is no backorder quantity<br />
2. the orderhistory/balance unpaid orders is updated<br />
3. the project (if present) has to be archived<br />
4. backorder created if full quantity was put in backorder<br />
5. if all instalments invoiced<br />
6. no rpl order present for orderline <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">9th October 2002, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Also in distribution parameter session there is an option to delete sales orders by order or orderline. So if you have it set to order then if there are any outstanding lines on the order the other lines will not be removed.<br />
<br />
another possibility has anyone in the past changed order steps(causing Procedure Mask problems), or deleted invoices etc via GTM. As this seems to have happened on the system I work on sometime in the past. The first couple of 100 sales orders would not delete because of problems like these and had to use gtm to do it in the end</div></div><hr />
