Somewhere along the line we thought that someone had told us that Purchase Requisitions were added to the new version?  We can't seem to find them and perhaps it's not until BaaN V that this new functionality was added?<br />
If not available in IVc4, has anyone come up with a viable work around using existing BaaN sessions?<br />
Thanks in advance for your input!</div></div><hr />

<br />
the functionallity of the purchase requisitions is firstly added in BaanERP 5. :( <br />
<br />
I don´t know which of the functionallity is important for your business but one small workaround is to use the planned purchase orders (timrp1121m000). The responsible person insert a new entry with the item. To demarcate this one from the real planned purchase order you have to insert a special disponent manager which is not in the original mrp-process.<br />
but be careful with the material requirements planning that there will no wrong datas creating.<br />
<br />
it is an idea. I don´t know if this fit to your business and solve your problem.<br />
<br />
if you have any questions feel free to contact me.<br />
<br />
best regards.</div></div><hr />

We did not purchase the supply chain extension so looks like we're SOL for now but we may give Dirk's idea a shot.<br />
Have a great week!</div></div><hr />
