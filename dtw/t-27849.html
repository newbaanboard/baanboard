<br />
We are using internal edi between two baan companies. Company 110 creates the purchase order for which the sales order is created in company 100. It seems conversion set-up has to be maintained in EDI module for warehouses so that warehouse 'A' in purchase order of company 110 is converted into warehouse 'B' in sales order of company 100. If I don't maintain the conversion set-up, I get error. We would expect baan to default the warehouse from 'item sales data' or from somewhere wherever it is appropriate so that the sales order warehouse reflects where the item is stored. Thanks in advance.<br />

If that is the case, I can ask Baan support to provide similar functionality for Baan V. (As far as I remember, the user profile has to be updated with the warehouse from where the warehouse was picked in Baan IV and if it was empty sales orders would not be created.)<br />

Thanks,<br />

The warehouse on the sales order will not be defaulted. It depends on the ship from address from the purchase order. The link between the ship from address and the warehouse must be made in the edi setup.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the input. That is what I have done. But the problem is, in the selling company different items are sold from different warehouses.<br />
Do you know if I delete the warehouse import line in 850.in or uncheck conversion for tdsls401.cwar whether the sales order will default with a warehouse as it happens during manual entry? If there is any other suggestion please let me know. (We do not have source code and hence cannot do anything with the conversion dll.)<br />

<br />
When I deleted the conversion set-up for field tdsls401.cwar in 850.in, <br />
the warehouse defaults automatically in the sales order lines. It<br />
happens for other fields also, for example, the country field, tdsls400.ccty.<br />
