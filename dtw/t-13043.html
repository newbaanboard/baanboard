<br />
I am facng a problem where there is a diffrence between the inventory balances and the GL balance as at the end of last month(August).<br />
<br />
This difference is for the packing material account mapped by item group for all WIP integration transactions.<br />
<br />
These items are used in replenishment orders and production batches.<br />
<br />
I currently finding it difficult to identify the reasons behind the difference. <br />
<br />
I would be grategul if someone could give me some suggestions as to how i could go about tracing the root cause of this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

When completing the order it is automaticly transfered. In this particular case there where to transferes for the same inventory. This caused a difference in the inventory...<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is also the case at your end?<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply . <br />
<br />
If possible could you give me some more details on how i could detect that such a thing has ocured in the system.<br />
<br />
Do u mean to say that u can transfer material before closing the orders ? How is it done . <br />
<br />
And when u say that it is possible to transfer the material when u close the orders automatically did u mean the backflush material option.<br />
<br />
I hope this is not too much to ask for , it would be helpful if you could give me soem more information ..............as we are really unable to trace the causes for teh differences<br />
<br />
Thanks again for ur reply<br />

differences in the financial area is very hard to tricker. I usally work with queries to filter the logistic data with the financial data. So, I only gave you a possible reason, it is also possible that transactions where booked on the wrong ledger.... Result ledger instead of stock in gld106.... As you see, there is not one answer for your problem. You need to filter the data with queries and so trace the problem that you have.<br />
