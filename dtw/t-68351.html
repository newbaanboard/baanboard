<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">10th November 2015, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday, we created new item records and did cost price roll up.  The data in ticpr300 table was dated yesterday.  Then we created sales order with order date equal to yesterday.  Error message &quot;Cost Price Structure not present for this date&quot; pops up and the sales line cannot be saved.<br />
<br />
The record in ticpr300 table was copied and saved with a date equal to 11/6/2015, last Friday.  With this, the sales line can be saved.<br />
<br />
Today, we have the same issue.  All new items have to be saved with cost price roll up in ticpr300 table dated 11/6/2015 before sales line can be saved.<br />
<br />
I have checked company calendar and there are records for this week.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas of what to check?</div></div><hr />

ticpr007 does not exist in IVc4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">11th November 2015, 11:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Idea: Check References to that item in ttaad4229m000 to see there isn't another date reference somewhere. Seems unlikely as ticpr200 &quot;Cost Prices by item&quot; doesn't have a date but ticpr300 does.<br />
Has planned delivery or receipt date been backdated on tdsls040/041?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">11th November 2015, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Are they phantoms and the sales order line is set to &quot;issue components&quot;? If so you need to have a cost present for each of the components, not just the top item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">11th November 2015, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">To GaryEd - Items are purchased Items.  Phantom is set to No.<br />
<br />
To EdHubbard - I checked references to item and table, ticpr300 is the only table with date field.  Also, the planned delivery date &amp; planned receipt date are set to a future date.<br />
<br />
Thanks for replying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryEd</div><div class="date">11th November 2015, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">What shows in item data for a last cost price transaction date? Does it match what is in ticpr300?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">11th November 2015, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Order Date is equal to 11/10/2015.  Cost price roll up is 11/10/2015 and is displayed as such on item master.</div></div><hr />
