<br />
When entering sales order lines (tdsls4102s000) you can only tab from field to field on form 1 in the following order.<br />
<br />
project -&gt; item -&gt; ordered quantity -&gt; Amount.<br />
<br />
We want the tab sequence to be:-<br />
<br />
project -&gt; item -&gt;  Planned Receipt Date -&gt; Planned Delivery Date -&gt; ordered quantity -&gt; Amount<br />
<br />
Does anybody else have the functionality that I require if so how was it achieved, customisation?<br />
<br />
Using 4c4.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

you can set the tab order through the tools module , application customization / forms / maintain forms.  In your case it would be form tdsls4102s0001.  Go into Edit Form.  Once there, click the Form pull down menu and select Field Order.  You can then set the  tab order for the fields.  Don't forget to do a form 'dump' when you are finished.<br />
hope this helps<br />

Calculation and check are done after each field entry, by changing order you have strange results... so you will have to do strong test to approve your customization</div></div><hr />

<br />
your supposition is right. What you want is not possible<br />
without big (!) customisations to the script. <br />
The function to.field(xxxxx) is heavy use in the script, for <br />
example after input of the item.number. So for non generic<br />
items the field sequence is item -&gt; quantity due statements <br />
in the script.<br />
I total agree with Commandeur to be very careful with such customisations.<br />
