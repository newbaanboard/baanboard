Answer:<br />
<br />
Baan will certainly look at the extra forecast field, and should generate planned MPS orders for the extra demand.<br />
Baan will first consume the regular demand with actual customer orders, and then the extra demand.<br />
If Baan does not generate orders for your extra deman, then something is wrong in your setup or its a bug</div></div><hr />

What setup problems might there be?  I have the extra demand entered for the middle of next year.  Is Baan not going out that far to look for the demand?  My company calendars are setup properly.  I dont know what else could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baan user</div><div class="date">5th October 2005, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Within Baan you can set a time fence (this wil prevent Baan from looking further in the future then necessary). You have a time fence,a time fence multiplier and a fixed number of days which together will determine the planning horizon. Check these figures, within MPS parameters (multiplier), + whether MPS orders will only be generated within time fence, in your MPS plandata, where you can set the time fence.<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peter.Helberg</div><div class="date">6th October 2005, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">In my past ERP life (Pre Baan for many years), all MPS, MRP, Sales and Schedule related orders were put into the Rough Cut Capacity areas of the database.  Current production orders were placed in the Capacity Requirements area.  Is this not the case with Baan.  It appears MPS Rough orders are the only thing that goes into the Rough Cut Capacity tables within Baan.  Is this correct or should I actually be seing Planned and Rough MPS and MRP orders in the RCCP areas?</div></div><hr />
