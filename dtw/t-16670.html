<br />
I suggest you to generate a credit note.<br />
But I you want to modify tables:<br />
<br />
1) Delete records of tdsls049<br />
<br />
2) Modifications in tdsls045:<br />
invd ---&gt; &quot;&quot;<br />
invn ---&gt; 0<br />
ttyp ---&gt; &quot;&quot;<br />
ssls ---&gt; previous status (6)<br />
pmsk ---&gt; y (in position nÂº 6)<br />
rats ---&gt; tdsls040.rats (only if tdsls040.fcrt = invoice date)<br />
<br />
You can't do it if tdsls4223m000 has been executed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">30th September 2004, 05:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with jlalguero that credit note is the preferred method. Fiddling with table content is absolutely dangerous for beginner. Beside, jlalguero, you forgot to show how to alter the financial data related to the invoice. Without that being altered to, you'd have serious data inconsistency<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jlalguero</div><div class="date">30th September 2004, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">When you print as definitive a Sales Invoice (tdsls4404m000) the only change in financial data is the reserved tfgld018 document.<br />
<br />
I suppose that in baanguyz's situation tdsls4223m000 has been not executed so there is no change in tfgld... to do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">knfarm</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 05:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Before carry out process delivery.... there is an integration impact when doing Release Outbound. At Integration...system will have &quot;Issue&quot; status on financial transaction and system already deduct inventory on hand. There is Dr and Cr transaction for this &quot;Sales&quot; &quot;Issue&quot; as well. You need some transaction to reverse back the Dr and Cr transaction as well otherwise u may have unbalance account at month end.<br />
<br />
The proper way is using CN unless they need to use &quot;Inventory Adjustment&quot; to adjust back the inventory.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">4th October 2004, 06:08</div></div><div class="posttext">knfarm is right, jlalguero. If you can start looking from functional, instead of technical, point of view, you'll see that it's impossible that no financial implication exist on printing of sales invoice. The &quot;sales&quot; should be booked in the accounting department, right? And so is the &quot;Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS)&quot;<br />
<br />
So, during printing of sales invoice, there should be 2 financial transactions recorded:<br />
Booking of sales:<br />
   Dr Accounts Receivable<br />
   Cr    Sales<br />
Booking of Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS)<br />
   Dr Cost Of Goods Sold<br />
   Cr    Goods to be invoiced</div></div><hr />

This will keep everything in sync.</div></div><hr />
