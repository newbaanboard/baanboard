<br />
Please note the reason &amp; solution against your query what I could understand.<br />
<br />
Probable Reason: - At the time of receipt user has done ‘click’ on ‘final receipt check box’, that’s why system putting the message.<br />
<br />
Proposed solution: Open the sub session ‘whinh3121s000’ and uncheck the ‘final receipt check box’ and process the same (if system allow).<br />
                                                    Or<br />
Go to GTM whinh312 and change the value of field ‘Final Receipt” from ‘Yes’ to ‘No’</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">14th June 2010, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I would not propose to perform GTM on the final receipt flag. Once a transfer order is received final (for a partial quantity), a shipping variance is booked in the financial integrations. <br />
<br />
Opening the transfer for new receipts will result in an imbalance on the interim transit account.<br />
<br />
This is the reason why receipt correction is disabled for a transfer.</div></div><hr />

For balancing the interim transit account, you can also update the table whinh215,whinh312,tdpur401 &amp; tdpur406</div></div><hr />
