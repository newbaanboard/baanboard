<br />
Can anyone give an insight on DMS?<br />
How does it work and in what situation this concept would be applicable?<br />
<br />
Tried to read the online help but couldn't relate to business process.<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotjens</div><div class="date">9th May 2007, 10:06</div></div><div class="posttext">The concept implies that goods received from suppliers or produced in manufacturing shops move whenever possible directly to their point of consumption without physically storing them in a warehouse first. <br />
By taking into account where the parts are required before storing the goods, it is possible to reduce stock in the main warehouse and to avoid unnecessary goods handling, especially at outbound. Also response times to urgent demand, for example for spare parts, are drastically reduced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't know that doc until today :p<br />
<br />
Hotjens, if I understood your explanation correctly, DMS would be something like dynamic cross docking, only that items don't flow into warehouse and we don't need to do generate outbound and go through whs procedures?<br />
<br />
In practice, how would a storeman (suppose a storeman receive a purchase order) know which order this item must go to?<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hotjens</div><div class="date">15th May 2007, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">For that reason implementing DMS will have to be part of a total approach including some clear procedures on how to go about. For the same reason visibility is offered on what requirements, needs could be served by using arriving goods. Someone will have to make the (right) decisions.</div></div><hr />
