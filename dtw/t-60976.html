The Consignment replinshment order is made after which a receipt takes place at a certain price say 'X'. Now a sales order is made and as soon as the shipment is confirmed in the warehouse module, a consignment payment purchase order is created. Suppose, if i wish to change the price (X+10)for consignment payment order, i cn do it via sesion &quot;Change price and discount after receipt&quot; but when the price is changed an error message pops up saying &quot; Warehouse not defined for Enterprise Unit&quot;<br />
