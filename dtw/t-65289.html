Need your expert advice :) <br />

I had a similar scenario where I wanted to grant permissions to the users for some specific warehouses. I created a table with user &amp; warehouse fields. Added entries. Created a UE Dll for table whinh200(Warehouse Order). Before saving, the program checks the customized table for the user and the selected warehouse, if present do nothing if not, block the transactions.<br />
<br />
And, its working quite well without any issues. Similarly, you can create your own logic for your requirement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you can go for table field data authorization and create various authorizations for users. You can set permissions to users for the table whinh200, whinh210, whinh220 based on the warehouse field.<br />
<br />
This can be the easiest way to do if you don't have variable requirements from users.<br />
<br />
Check the attached snap. I have blocked all the transactions in the records where warehouse is P01RM.</div></div><hr />

The best you can do is to setup the data authorisations for the warehouse tables tcmcs003 and whwmd200 than use from both tables the option called 'Copy table data authorisation to childs'. That will copy the authorisations in every table that is referring to this table.<br />
<br />
However be aware that this can have side effects: these authorisations are evaluated during runtime: so it will have (a small) effect on the performance.<br />
Also it's important to test!</div></div><hr />
