<br />
<br />
I've created a new warehouse for company 200 in tcmcs0103m000.<br />
<br />
***When I insert the new record, in company field it appears 200 ( default).<br />
So i think there is only one finance company .<br />
<br />
<br />
And I did an inventory transfer to the warehouse. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The problem is now I want to do the transaction with company 888 and not 200. :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
Now I'd like to change the warehouse from company 200 to 888.<br />
(These company are from ttaad1100m000: Maintain Companies).<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
When I change the company in Menu <br />
<br />
Option &gt; Change Company ,<br />
the finance company is still 200.<br />
<br />
Can I delete the record or continue because the finance company is same?<br />
What are the effects to the finance company 200 if I create the warehouse and did the transaction in a wrong company?<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
But then when I try to delete the warehouse (company 200) its giving an error message &quot;update cancelled&quot;.(I try to delete because I did not change the company in the menu)<br />
<br />
So I try to delete the record in ttaad4100 and its giving an error message &quot;process 41: Error 605&quot;<br />
Cannot delete record, because reference exists) on tcmcs003200 in db_delete.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me some idea?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance. Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is better to create a new warehouse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not only do you have to remove the inventory transaction, but also the inventory and subsequent inventory history transactions.  As mentioned above, create a new warehouse.<br />
