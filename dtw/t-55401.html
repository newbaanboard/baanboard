<br />
We have created sales order and complete the cycle until posting of invoicing to A/R.  Unfortunately we overlooked on the wrong price input for the sales order and we decide to create sales order return for the sales order.<br />
We are succesfully created the sales order return and put back the stock into warehouse. BUT why we are unable to create invoicing for the sales order return, is it due to  the system does not create Delivery order for the receiving process done for sales order return.<br />
<br />
So how for us to reverse back transaction posted in A/R or is there anyway for us to create invoicing and post it with negetive amount to reverse the wrong amount in the A/R.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you using BaaN IV or LN 6.1 FP2 ?<br />
As you have taken back inventory in BaaN Warehouse,Can you provide more details at which stage you are unable to create invoice. What type of kind of order user has selected e.g. Return Inventory or Return Reject?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually we're using Infor ERPln 6.1 FP2, We are succesfully return the stock into warehouse but normally for normal sale invoice after we do shipment we can proceed with printing delivery order (DO) and invoicing.<br />
Type of order is return inventory, but why after we succesfully return the stock into warehouse via warehouse order, the system does not generate delivery order as normal sales order process. That's is why we can't proceed with invoicing to reverse back the sales transaction in A/R.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alifikhwan</div><div class="date">3rd April 2009, 06:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Sales order type as required<br />
1) release sales order to warehousing<br />
2) maintain deliveries sales order lines<br />
3) release sales order/schedules to invoicing<br />
4) process delivered sales order<br />
<br />
but normally after step 1 for normal sales system allow us to print the delivery order after shipment but in sales order return system consider as receipt activities and not allow for delivery order printing.<br />
<br />
please advise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. Delivery order print in case of outbond, not in case receipt as sales return order is a receipt processing.<br />
<br />
You have not still cleared at what stage, you are not able to do further processing. Please clear at what step system is giving what kind of mesage to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please check the status of your Sales Order. Is it released for the Central Invoicing, if yes check the Billing Request Addition which you are using to post this Invoice, you have to select &quot;Credit Notes&quot; option in the Billing Request Addition to post a Sales Retur Invoice.</div></div><hr />
