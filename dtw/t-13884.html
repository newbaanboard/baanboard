<br />
For a long time, I wonder why there is no Human Resource Package in BaanERP (BaanIV, BaanERP, BaanERP6), I think it is very important. <br />
<br />
Although BaanDEM is excellent, and it can achieve all audit process by combination with Authorization Mgt in Tools. But a Human Resource Mgt may provide a clear and convenient path.<br />
<br />
All are my own idea, can sb explain it?<br />
<br />
Thx in Advance<br />
         Jerry</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JerryGuo</div><div class="date">10th December 2003, 13:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen the Gemini(Baan6), which is undistributed. To my regret, I found no HR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is available on BaaN-5.2 (Reger) Version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have seen the People Package, too.<br />
From my understanding and Baan Documentation Description, It is not a Human Resourse module, but extracte all Employee related sessions from TC, TI and so on, put them togeter, and make some improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">11th December 2003, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - not sure what all you are wanting from a HR package, but we have developed a Time and Attendance add on for Baan called RMCtime.  This would be a 3rd party product.<br />
<br />
Our system tracks vacation, personal time, allows for better entry and supervisor approvals.  It has new reports for HR including:<br />
<br />
Daily Attendance<br />
Exceptions (for just about anything)<br />
Vacation<br />
Overtime<br />
<br />
The system tracks labor and attendace time separately, leaving the labor in Baan, but the attendance records are handled differently within our system, allowing for a more 'HR' view of attendance.  <br />
<br />
It has configurable options for time entry, and links with our shop floor data collection solution (optional).   It has configurable financial posting for indirect and absense time.  <br />
<br />
This also has an interface to payroll (ascii file export), creates a payroll batch that is maintainable.  It does not replace the payroll packages, such as ADP, etc.   <br />
<br />
Let me know if you are interested in more information, or post up on what you are expecting for others to understand.</div></div><hr />
