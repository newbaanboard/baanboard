<br />
We are currently on a dematerialisation of our Suppliers Invoices and would like to know the options to integrate them in the Invoicing module in ERP LN7<br />
<br />
One would be to create from the scan a *.txt or *.xml file and convert the file to an INV001.txt EDI INVOICE file or perhaps an Exchange Import ??<br />
<br />
We also have some Suppliers who are using an EDI platform, but I am searching to standard INFOR (or SSA Global) documents in which I could fin an example of an INVOIC:D:96A and its translated INV001.txt for integration.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help.<br />
<br />
Best regards from France :)<br />

EDI invoices from Supplier can be in EDIFACT or ANSI standards. The EDI translator will translate the EDI Invoices from supplier into pipe separated file/ csv which then can be processed by LN EDI function.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply<br />
<br />
Yes, I agree. I can indeed use EDI module in LN to process supplier invoices straight away via the standard BEMIS. I intend to do so with the 'big&quot; suppliers, however not all have an EDI process in place and are either sending PDF INVOICES via mail or paper.<br />
<br />
Therefore, we consulted with an OCR provider to extract the key INVOICE data (amount, VAT, Item, Qties..) and generate a export file.<br />
<br />
After that I would like to be able to use that export and integrate them via either the same standard EDI process and a BEMIS INVOIC file to be composed or via an exchange scheme. orâ€¦? <br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
