<br />
I have created one Return Purchase Order.<br />
<br />
In Purchase Order line there is 10 Qty. <br />
I returned 6 (Partial Quantity) Quantity to Supplier(Shipment done for 6 Qty).<br />
Now, I want to ship full Quantity to Supplier.<br />
I also have confirmed 4 Qty from &quot;Potential Back Order Line&quot; Session.<br />
<br />
So now my Question is,<br />
How can i transfer that pending Qty to supplier? <br />
I tried to make direct shipment from Shipment Session. But it give me an error - &quot;Ship to Business Partner not Active&quot;.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

I got little success but stuck in next process....<br />
I have released balance Qty of return order but i have stuck at &quot;Freez/Confirm&quot; process in Shipment.<br />
<br />
While doing &quot;Freez/Confirm&quot; in Shipment i faced below Error message.<br />
- &quot;Shipment LR Information is not maintained for shipment SHO008518 and position 20&quot;<br />
<br />
My Scenario.&gt;<br />
- I have 1 shipment with 2 line.<br />
- 1 line has shipped and other one is pending<br />
- LR information maintained for 1st line only. (I can't maintain LR information for second line because GDP is approved and can't be Un-approve now)<br />
<br />
How to solve the above error and how to complete the shipment process?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
