We are going to face a new challange: the inventory transfer between two nettable warehouses. We had this problem in the past already but only for a few items and production orders. This can be done manually with the help of a customized report (print inventory transactions by item AND warehouse).<br />
Now the situation is going to change and a lot of more items and production orders are affected  :eek: .<br />
All items are MRP items, SIC is not an option. We do not run ILC, and don't have any customized items.<br />
I've heard that the DRP module might be able to handle this issue. Unfortunately the documentation that I found was rather rough and doesn't answer detailed questions. Any suggestions and/or experience from somebody here in the Baanboard community?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
