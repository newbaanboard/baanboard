Has anybody else had to do this?<br />
I am thinking of creating a new session that will insert a sales order line for the surcharge item code on orders that are ready to invoice.  This will be a new order step just prior to printing the invoice.<br />
Some items require the surcharge and some will not.  We will need to have different surcharge items so that the accounting goes to the proper item dimension.  So I think I need an additional table to relate item to surcharge item and if the item is not in this table there will be no surcharge.<br />
Is there a different way to do this?  Anything come to mind in Standard Baan?<br />
