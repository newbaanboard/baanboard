<br />
Is it possible, using session tdinv3260m000, to convert multiple confirmed planned INV purchase orders to one purchase order with multiple lines?<br />
<br />
We are having situations with some suppliers, that for each week, we generate dozens of very low price items purchase orders.  This increases both our workload in PUR and Finance and also suppliers.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much in advance,</div></div><hr />

You can instead try order interval field as say 2 / 3 or 7 days. This would help you in creating orders of that interval periods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would be helpful for one single item, right? <br />
But If I wan't to get multiple items for the same supplier on the same Purchase Order there is no way around it?<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for your help,</div></div><hr />

Then create the PO yourself. :)  That is a simplified view of what we did.  We did limit the order to 25 different items and I believe we grouped by supplier and item.  It worked - of course you had to be careful running it and all the planned orders were really planned.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />
