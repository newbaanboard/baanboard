<br />
we are running BaaN without ILC. There are two warehouses, 100 and 200. 200 is used only for samples, the stock should not<br />
be considered by SIC run.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know a solution how to deal with that?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and best regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomas Nolte</div><div class="date">6th February 2004, 09:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately this does not solve the problem. Although I only<br />
select a particular warehouse (100) the stock levels for the other<br />
one (200) are considered, too.<br />
<br />
The situation is<br />
<br />
warehouse 100           0 pcs on stock<br />
warehouse 200         50 pcs on stock<br />
<br />
There is a sls demand of 10 pcs (normally for warehouse 100) but<br />
as the item is SIC planned and although the parameter for <br />
warehouse 200 is nettable = no the 50 pcs are considered and<br />
you don´t receive any purchase order proposal.<br />
<br />
In know, in the online help it is described that the parameter<br />
&quot;Nettable&quot; is not in use for SIC.<br />
<br />
Does anybody has got experience in adjusting the planning session tdinv3201m000 Generate Planned Inventory Orders <br />
accordingly.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomas Nolte</div><div class="date">6th February 2004, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We are successfully using the SIC run in dozens of subsidiary as a leading planing system. All disposition parameters, adjustments, intercompany master data updates, etc. are build on this procedure.<br />
<br />
The workload of changing these established workflows to MRP don´t justify the benefits you may receive afterwards.<br />
<br />
Thanks for other solutions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, if mrp isn't the solution, you can try this: in tdinv3201m000 set generate advice per warehouse on yes. In tdinv0101m000 set field tdinv001.uidt (use item data) to no, in that situation the economic stock is calculated using tdinv001 in stead of tiitm001 data. <br />
<br />
If that doesn't give the solution there is always the possibility to correct the advice given, by printing it and in the report recalculate the quantity and use afs to change it in the planned orders.<br />
