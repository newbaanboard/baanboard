<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdejong</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I need two evaluation expressions for our EDI conversion setup of the order-message (850).<br />
<br />
1. I want to have the first 7 positions of tdpur042.name, all spaces (if present) left out, in one field of the message. In anothet field I want the complete contenence of tdpur042.name.<br />
<br />
2. In the order-message I want the supplier's item description. This is the text that is made with session: tdpu4106m000. If I make a selection on tttxt002.kwd3 (item-code) and tttxt002.kwd4 (supplier code) I get the textnumber. But how to get the corresponding text in the message?<br />
<br />
We work with BaaN IVc4</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. To the best of my knowledge, you cannot specify substrings of any sort in the outbound conversion setups - either you output the field or you don't. Hence, no matter what evaluation expression you create, this will not work. You would need to modify the DLL slightly to create a variable that contains the substring, and then put the actual condition in the DLL to determine what gets printed - the substring or the entire string.<br />
<br />
2. The tdpur4106m000 session places text entries into the tdpur020 table. This table is not included as part of the outbound 850 (purchase order) message. So, to facilitate this, you will need to customize the DLL and the conversion setup to include this table and field (tdpur020.txta). The only other suggestion I would have is to modify the tdpur4106m000 session to also add the text to the relevant POs - tdpur040.txta/txtb or tdpur041.txta.<br />

Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
