1) How can it be issued?<br />
This will depend on how you want it to be issued. Is it a Sales Issue or a Production Issue? <br />
1a) If its the former, then you enter this item in the Sales Order along with its project and deliver it through Maintain Deliveries like any other item.. <br />
1b) If its the latter, You customize the manufactured item that this purchased item is issued to and make sure both the items belong to the same project. Once this is done, you can issue it through Enter Material Issue for Production Order session...<br />
<br />
2) How do i check stock of customized items?<br />
Use the session Print Customized Item Data {tipcs2421m000} where in you select all the projects that needs to be monitored and choose the second print option &quot;Customized Items(Inventories)&quot; on pressing the Continue button. The report may need a bit of tinkering with as it will only print one project per page and if left as it is then it will output a lot of pages..<br />
<br />
I hope this is what you are looking for...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">13th January 2007, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Anurag, you didnt mention that you were using Location control. In any case, you have to issue this item through the Outbound Movement menu in Distribution and with the help of either Maintain Outbound Data {tdilc4101m000} OR Generate Outbound Advice {tdilc4201m000} followed by Release Outbound Data {tdilc4202m000}. The first one is a manual way of planning the issues and gives you control as to how much you can issue and selecting lot numbers(if applicable) while the second one plans whatever is estimated...The last session, i.e Release Outbound Data, will issue the quantity that has been planned through either of the first two sessions.<br />
<br />
sk<br />
<br />
P.S: As you might already know, Maintain Outbound Data and Generate Outbound Advice, doesnt effectively issue the quantity mentioned in session Enter Material Issue for Production Orders. It only plans the issues. The quantity is effectively reduced from stock only after running session Release Outbound Data...</div></div><hr />
