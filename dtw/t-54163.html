<br />
<br />
Are you printing labels from Baan ?<br />
<br />
Are you using the dedicated baan sessions ?<br />
<br />
Do you think it is reliable ?<br />
<br />
if not, can you say what is the product you are using ?<br />
<br />
are you satisfied of it ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

There is a session in wh that is used to print label.<br />
I got no bar code printer and not tested to print it as bar code.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for a more complete bar code solution, you might try BridgeLogix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for the answer. <br />
We dont need to use barcodes. We already tried LN labels, but there is some problems : some data cannot be found such as item description. At another hand we don't konw if it is possible to change font size, now font are too much little.<br />
<br />
Another question is if this way of working is reliable in real conditions ?<br />
<br />
I will try to get informatons about BridgeLogix.<br />
I found other software like dbbaan. Any opinion would be helpful.   <br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wuichia</div><div class="date">8th November 2008, 06:02</div></div><div class="posttext">If I'm not getting wrong, the label is a report in Ln.<br />
You can customize the report to show the item description and other information as far as your manage to link them.<br />
Since it's customizable, the font size can be changed.<br />
You should able to select different font size when you print it.<br />
<br />
So far I've not deploy this in any of my projects but believe it is reliable in real conditions base on our simulation result last time. (sorry, we didn't document it down)<br />
<br />
If you manage to get any other software such as dbbaan, welcome to forward me the information as well (wuichia@hotmail.com).<br />
