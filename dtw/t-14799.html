I have noticed that some records in table tdinv100 which existed earlier are not present now. Is deletion of records in table tdinv100 a part of normal process, i.e. as a result of some processing etc? Or they got deleted by accident?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gary P</div><div class="date">15th March 2004, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Were they transactions that were completed (status Closed)? The only normal process for deleting these records is the Archive Inventory Transactions session. Even then they would be moved to an archive company. Are you archiving? The standard Inventory Transaction session won't let the user simply delete a closed transaction (too many references etc). The only other way to delete that I'm aware of would be in GTM.<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply.<br />
THe orders that are missing were Closed.<br />
I do not knoew if some one has archived it or not. Is there a log of archive?<br />
I think deleting thru GTM would also be difficult as the references are also checked there.<br />

Good point on GTM. I forgot that. As far as a log of archiving goes I'm a functional guy, not tools so I'm not sure. When you archive (see session tdinv1201m) you select the company to which you want to archive the records. Typically this is a company set up to be used only for archived records. However, you will notice that the drop down selection will list all the companies you have set up. Assuming you have more than  one company there are two ways to search. In regular BaaN select the Options button on the main menu browser and change company. Then use the regular  session (tdinv7510m) to search for the missing transactions. You can also just go in through GTM, change the company on the header screen and go to the transactions table to see if it's empty or has records.<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gary P</div><div class="date">17th March 2004, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point Darren. Manu, check session tdinv0100m Inv Parameters, tab 1 and look at the settings near the bottom of the screen. Darren is correct, if any of these were set to No for a period of time transaction history of that particular setting would not be recorded.<br />
