<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mig28mx</div><div class="date">25th July 2006, 20:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
Our series for sales offers, is almost full.<br />
How can I re-use the oldest series numbers?<br />
Is enough to initialize the first free number to 0?<br />
Is there other implications to observe?<br />
<br />
thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Ruppert</div><div class="date">26th July 2006, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">You can set the first free number to whatever you want and Baan will use the next free number which is not in tdsls001 &quot;Sales Offers&quot; or tdsls010 &quot;Sales Offers History&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thus you need to copy unneeded data to a disk and delete them in the following tables<br />
<br />
tdsls001 Sales Offers<br />
tdsls002 Sales Offers Lines<br />
tdsls010 Sales Offers History<br />
tdsls011 Sales Offers History Lines<br />
<br />
Then these records can be reused. The only problem is that the reference in the sales order lines tdsls041.qono (sales offer) and tdsls041.qpon (sales offer line) refer to a non existing sales offer.<br />
<br />
Yours <br />

I will do that.<br />
This procedure apply also for sales orders?<br />
I mean, if I reutilize the old sales orders numbers, there will be a problem on finance, like duplicate values or somelike that?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />
