I have a problem with a purchase receipt, any income I make the receipt of data always show the goods as though I have made a reception (this is listed on the Received Qty) when I have not done so, if this is done then continue Qty I received does not match with the actual qty. But if I create new PO it can be made. (see attach file). please help me.... tahanks</div></div><hr />

hi... sushil<br />
<br />
thanks for your response, I always run session tdpur4120m000 (maintain receipt) if I receive the material. I key in the Purchase order number and choice the item and key in the packing slip Qty and receipt date, but if I went to the session  tdilc4113s000 (sub session maintain receipts) i wonder to see receipt qty that actually i never receipt the material yet (this is the system automatic display). If I continue this session, qty (storage) to be minus and I can not  continue. so I cancel this transaction and I try to create the new purchase order for the same item. The new purchase order is OK if I run the session tdpur4120m000.</div></div><hr />

Hi ... bdittmar<br />
<br />
Purchase Qty and Storage qty is not the same, I use conversion factor for the item and already check for the conversion factors and it is OK.</div></div><hr />
