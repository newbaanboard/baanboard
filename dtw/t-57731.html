We are using Baan IV C4.<br />
<br />
I would like to know in what case the Purchase Order header discount is not allowed. Is it based on certain Purchase  oreder type or items or Supplier. For some PO the field Order discount is enable and some cases cursor does not go there.<br />
<br />
I am talking about tdpur040.odis. And it is not based on supplier. In supplier default discount is entered.<br />
<br />
Any body can explain me the reason?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />

 <br />
are you sure we're talking about PO (=production orders)? For SO (=sales orders) the field tdsls040.odis has some rules depending on the order type; see tcmcs0142m000, especially the fields Cost Order and Collect Order.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">5th February 2010, 15:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Purchase Order header discount is not on the basis of Order Type in BaaN IV. All the purchase order header attibutes depends on the Supplier you selected while creating a PO in tdpur040.suno<br />
<br />
If you have entered discount value in supplier master i.e. in tccom020, it will be defaulted for that supplier when you will be creating PO, whatever is the order type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your replies. <br />
<br />
Well I got actual answer from my one friend. And the Purchase Order header discount is actually based on order type. System does not allow you enter discount if the Cost Order Field set to YES in order types.<br />
<br />
This mean discount is not allowed for sevice and cost items. <br />
<br />
The discount specified in supplier is default dscount which comes when you attach supplier to PO. This can be changed.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />
