<br />
We have a number of purchase orders on our system where the invoice has been approved manually and for whatever reason the goods have not been booked in against the order.<br />
<br />
Finance have paid the invoice but we are left with an outstanding order balance. <br />
<br />
What is the best way to deal with this order balance so that outstanding order quantities can be cleared. We are happy to receive the goods in some manner but we are just a little wary about any possible problems with Finance and GRNYI.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 10:17</div></div><div class="posttext">In PUR module you can not approve/Print the invoice if the item have not been received. This means you did a sundry invoice in the Finance module. <br />
You could:<br />
- Receive the items at 0 purchase price. This will change the ave purch price though.<br />
- Delete the lines or Order and do an Inv Adjustment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks for the input.<br />
<br />
We probably need to use both methods as we have some orders with receipts to be cleared and some without receipts which can just be deleted.<br />

<br />
Deleting purchase order lines is an option but what this means is that <br />
a. Your inventory status will not be correct and<br />
b. Finance has manually approved the invoice. Presumably expensed the amount. So your P&amp;L is also incorrectly stated to the extent you have items in stock.<br />
<br />
A better way (as suggested by Flip) is to do a cycle count of these items and the credit of this should be taken to the expenses account which was affected when Finance did the vendor invoice approval<br />
<br />
