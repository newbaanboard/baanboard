I thought tdpur045.pmsk=tdpur051.pmsk but when I see some test data it seem to be wrong.<br />

There are 2 steps for Order Type return order.<br />

<br />
Actually we are try to restoring missing receipts which are deleted during archiving. I mapped tdpur045.pmsk with tdpur051.pmsk (PO Line History).<br />
But they are not always equivalent. So it may be give wrong result. I want to know whether the Procedure Mask is stored anywhere other than PO Line History (tdpur051).<br />
<br />
From which table can I get the value of tdpur045.pmsk other than tdpur051?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you trying to retrieve from 51? I mean what values?<br />
You can get reciept date and quantity from tdinv700. Since receipt number is not available in tdpur51, the only other reason why i think you would want tdpur51 is for the invoice number and date.<br />
<br />
In anycase, you wouldnt need to link the procedure mask in this scenario..<br />

I am asking for tdpur045.pmsk only. Only from this field we came to know whether PDPO is completed or not. Since the value of tdpur045.stsc (Update Status of Actual Purchase) is dependent on procedure mask. <br />
If Purchase Delivered PO has completed, set to 'Actual Costs Updated, otherwise Free. Only from Procedure Mask we can decided whether PDPO is completed or not. (The session with the step number equal to the position of &quot;e&quot; in the procedure mask indicate session already been executed.) <br />
<br />
But the problem is that tdpur045.pmsk is not always equivalent to tdpur051.pmsk</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you are right. Is there any solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">18th April 2007, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to clarify something beforehand...The process delivered purchase order step is updated &quot;e&quot; in 45 but in 51 it remains at &quot;y&quot; contrary to what i said in my previous post..<br />
<br />
Therefore, 45 will show you the correct status of the PO from the procedure mask. The relevant info can be obtained from 51 if you select record type (ckor) = 3 and by linking the first 8 characters of the procedure mask in both the tables since only the 9th step differs..<br />
<br />
Another fact is that pur51 doesnt record the receipts untill they are invoiced..<br />

<br />
If you study the script tdpur4223 (PDPO) you can found that first it update tdpur051.pmsk with older value of tdpur045.pmsk (tdpur045.pmsk(stno.4223;1) = &quot;y&quot;) and then after it update the value of tdpur045.pmsk (tdpur045.pmsk(stno.4223;1) = &quot;e&quot;). So it is always tdpur051.pmsk&lt;&gt;tdpur045.pmsk. Now we are restoring data from tdpur051 itself  (tdpur045.pmsk=tdpur051.pmsk). Which will always incorrect. From only procedure mask we came to know whether PDPO is completed or not. Since we are not getting the correct value of Procedure Mask, we can't getting the value of Update Status of Actual Purchase (tdpur045.stsc).</div></div><hr />
