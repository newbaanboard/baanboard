<br />
I want to know the difference and importance between the two options &quot;Soft Release&quot; and &quot;Firm Release&quot; in session &quot;Order (Line) Blocking&quot; (tdsls4520m000).<br />
How Baan manages and used this, because I noticed that in table &quot;tdsls421&quot; there is a field &quot;Release Type&quot; that holds the information if the released type was Soft or Firm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
A firm release means that the order will not be checked again on occurance of the blocking reason.<br />
<br />
Soft release <br />
When an order is released with a soft release, the user can continue to work with the current order step. But if the user wants to continue with a next order step, the check on the occurance of the blocking reason is checked again.<br />
<br />
E.g. an order line is blocked during order entry and soft released. When the user tries to release the order to warehousing, it is checked again whether the order line should be blocked.</div></div><hr />
