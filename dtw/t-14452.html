Therefore we will have to use destination tax. Does anyone know about impact on existing sales order or tax calculation based on order lines ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">11th February 2004, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I will change to destination sales tax as well.<br />
The functionality is mainly in new orderline entry, or when changing orderlines: if the warehouse is changed it will check the conditions in the Destination Sales Tax to change the taxcode if necessary.<br />
For existing orders it will not do much as far as I can see, the taxcode is determined when they were entered and will not change.<br />
