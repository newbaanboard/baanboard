I am trying to determine which process is the best for paying commissions within BaanIV. I need to process payments for sales employees. Our payroll system is not integrated into Baan. What are the pros and cons of setting up employees as suppliers vs paying as employees using commissions paid to employees? In either option we would need to output the data into the payroll system.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
We have the same situation here in our company. We are using the employee/supplier method and a manual booking of the commission invoice totals into our payroll system. Without having tested the other methods precisely, I think there is no major difference as long as there is no integration into Baan Finance.<br />
Instead of the manual booking process you might consider an export of the data in table tdcms050 (and/or tdcms051 if applicable).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Best regards,<br />
