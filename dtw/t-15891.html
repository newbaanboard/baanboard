<br />
on our Baan c4.server.<br />
<br />
We are looking out for a scenario where we can change the sales price unit for a particular customer only. <br />
<br />
situation is that the customer faces issues with their authorities because they have permissions to get goods in a particular unit only. ( 10 Boxes set) <br />
but since we have this as a standard item, we have price unit at 1 box. <br />
<br />
For quantity we can do manual conversions but what about the sales price unit? Please suggest urgently....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">7th July 2004, 08:34</div></div><div class="posttext">For any particular customer I think you can use whatever sales and/or price units you need.  These need to be defined in the units conversion table so that the system can convert from one to another.  <br />
<br />
I do worry about unit such as BOX, PACK etc.  My view is that if you must have boxex/packs then they need to be specific as to quantity contained eg: bx5, pk7 etc<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">8th July 2004, 04:01</div></div><div class="posttext">we have defined all the units correctly. the units are not the problem. <br />
The problem is that we cannot have different default PRICE UNITS for different customers.<br />
<br />
For quantity, its allowed to change the units but its not the same for price. <br />
In our situation it had not been a problem, till we started exporting to this customer in asia where he had permissions for specific units only. ( though we can ship him in those units, the invoice still comes out in the units defined in item master data as we cannot change the sales price units)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">8th July 2004, 05:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure what you are asking. The Baan4c4 processing rules are as you mention.  <br />
Do you want to change the rules (fairly small modification to Order Maintenance program) or do you want to change the printing of invoice (another faily small mod) or do you want to preserve a pristine system?<br />
<br />
Depending on how significant this problem/customer is (how many items/orders) you could consider loading another item(s) with the uom's the way you want them. <br />

<br />
BaaN allows you to change the Sales Unit at the time of maintaining Sales Order, but the Sales price unit cannot be changed. You have top manually convert the price unit and then maintain.<br />
<br />
Now if you want that the Converted Sales Unit should be printed in the Invoice or on any other document, then it will need a small customisation.<br />
<br />
One more thing you can try is that change the price unit at the time of maintaining Sales Order in Item Data first and then maintain the Sales Order. Once the Sales order had been maintained, you can switch back to your original price unit. This will show every thing perfect in Sales Order as required by you, but how much it will  effect integration transaction, that you have to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertvg</div><div class="date">8th September 2004, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes the BaaN logic is hocus-pocus to me:<br />
 <br />
When you have defined multiple sales price units for an item, why is it that upon entering a Sales Contract you can manually choose the price unit, but when entering a Sales Order or a Sales Quotation it just picks the sales price unit as set in the item master ?<br />
<br />
Should be more or less a matter of copy-and-paste to have the same logic that allows manually choosing the sales price unit available in orders and quotes as well.<br />
<br />
If someone understands and/or have some suggestions please let me know, because we have run into the same issue where we want to sell items to customer B in pcs, and to customer B as per 100.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
Robert</div></div><hr />
