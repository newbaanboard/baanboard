<br />
I'm haveing a problem with generating purchase order advices from sales orders in combination with item bp data.<br />
<br />
We generate for direct delivery a purchase order advice direct from the sales order session. This generated a purchase order advice where we had choosen the supplier manual and transferred the advice into a purchase order.<br />
<br />
Now we have loaded item bp data. Since we have done this, it will automaticly generate a purchase order, what makes sence for me, so we have only data for one supplier loaded for the specific item. But we have two suppliers! I've entered a second line with the date for the second supplier, with the same priority, having in mind, that LN maybee create just an advice, so the two lines having the same 'weight', but this is wrong. It seems to me, that the first line from item bp data is just used.<br />
<br />
Is there a way, to configure LN not to generate automaticly a purchase order but a purchase order advice? We need this so we have to select between two ore even more suppliers, depending a little bit on the customers location.<br />
<br />
Would be great if somebody might have the perfect solution for us!<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />

<br />
Try this ... In the Sales Order Parameter session (tdsls0100s400), uncheck Convert Purchase Order Advice Automatically to Purchase Order.<br />
