<br />
I have few question want to ask: is related to maintain receipt.<br />
<br />
Question 1: Possible for user careless to delete the default PO line and after create back a SAME LIKE DEFAULT PO LINE in maintain receipt session?<br />
<br />
Question 2: If PO having 2 lines ( means POS 10 and POS 20 ONLY), possible in maintain receipt result is 3 lines? ( means POS 10 ,POS 20, and POS 30), POS 10 and POS 20 is default lines, POS 30 is manually created by user in maintain receipt session after pick the PO number.<br />
<br />
Question 3: why standard allow receipt Qty over than order QTY, what is this concept?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am unable to understand q1 and q2.<br />
<br />
but as  Q3 - it was an option in case if the Case qty is 24 and the PO is made by any automated PO sessions /accidentally typed qty .<br />
<br />
Then MRN has to be for the case .<br />
<br />
Baan has already released a patch for the same so as the rec.qty cannot be &gt; order qty after applying patch we use session - tdpur4320m000 for BaanIVc4.<br />
<br />
Check with INFOR for your Ver of baan.<br />

Q2- Receipts cannot be taken for a non - existing postion number , but you can have multiple sequence number for the same position number<br />
Q3 - The concept behind the why BaaN Alows more qty than the ordered qty is that the system allways indicates while taking receipts that how much you have ordered has a prevention still it allows coz when you have month end closing , quarter end closing ,half year end closing the qty received we hab=ve to close the receipt of materials . where the materiials ordered &amp; required can differentiate due to pratical rteasons<br />
Anyways this can be controlled user wise through Field autorisation</div></div><hr />
