<br />
Does anyone know how to receive an item that was previously returned using purchase return?<br />
<br />
Say I have Purchase Order# 001 with Qty received 100 pcs. Then we return some, say 20 pcs, using Purchase Order of type return because of rejected goods. This return was made some days later after inspection has been done with approved qty = 100 pcs. This &quot;late return&quot; happens because inspection was done using sampling method. The reject was discovered when the goods are about to be used in production because by then the inspection will be 100%.<br />
<br />
I was expecting the system to set backorder for PO# 001 so I can receive it again later when the supplier send the replacement goods. But it didn't.<br />
<br />
Anyone has any idea or solution for this? I am also facing the same trouble with sales return.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Hendra</div></div><hr />

BAAN doesn´t reset the status of the rejected itens to be received again.<br />
<br />
hope i could help.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind sharing, how do you make your control over these new purchase orders against the purchase returns to make sure that all purchase returns have been given new purchase orders in order to receipt the replacement.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
On return POs, you can specify the original PO/invoice from which the goods were originally received. BaanERP will then make sure that only the lots received from the original PO/invoice specified can be returned in this return PO. This is a useful feature. However, it won't change the back order of the original PO/invoice<br />
<br />
If you'd rather track it on the original PO, then don't raise a new return PO. Instead, simply add a negative order line on the original PO to return the goods. Still, this won't change the back order of the original PO lines. You still have to add yet more lines to receive replacements later on. It's probably not what you're looking for, but it's also another alternative<br />

<br />
i don´t know how you´re business processes are defined. <br />
In my company case, the users who create the purchase devolution order are in the purchase department. So they are in fact the ones who create all the purchase orders. <br />
What i instructed them to do is that when there is a need to create a devolution and the interest in the item still remains at the same time is created a new purchase order line inside the original one.<br />
This way it will be easier to keep track of the information.<br />
<br />
If you have anymore questions don´t hesitate. hope that i could help you.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for sharing. I guess we'll just have to be satisfied enough with the workarounds.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />
