<br />
If this is the case then...<br />
<br />
If in the WH the receipt line is final receipt, and the back order is implemented, you can go to the Purchase order receipts session and cancel the remaining.<br />
<br />
If the WH receipt is not final, receive it with zero amount and cancel the back order as the previous step.</div></div><hr />
