<br />
At My company we wants to create new warehouse depicting one Godown<br />
which is out of company premises. In this senreo we want some other facilities for that warehouse as<br />
<br />
1) The Raw material will be unloaded (maintain Receipt) in new warehouse <br />
    so the stock is with that warehouse.<br />
2) but the finanance / CENVAT entries should not fire at the time of receipt<br />
    in new warehouse, instead that should fire at the time of when we <br />
    transfer the material from godown to Regular store warehouse .<br />
<br />
So can anyone help us to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Umesh</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a similar process, and in Baan IV, it is not supported.  We have an ugly work-around, where we do the Baan receipt at the time the goods are received into the consignment warehouse.  We do this so that we will have visibility of the inventory in Baan.<br />
<br />
We do not match the purchase invoice until we transfer the materials from the consignment warehouse into our standard warehouse.<br />
<br />
We set up specific consignment inventory GL accounts to hold the inventory value while it is in consigment.  <br />
<br />
We considered have a customization done, that would seperate the inventory transactions from the financial transactions during the 'maintain receipt' process.  This would enable us to complete the inventory transactions when we receive the goods, but not create any financial transactions until the inventory is taken out of the consignment warehouse.<br />
<br />
I hope this response was helpful.<br />

PS, search the board for the word 'consigment' I think it has been discussed before.</div></div><hr />
