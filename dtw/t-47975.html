The easiest customized solution would be to create a planned DRP order and then conform and transfer it. It would be failry straight foward to do and doesn't require a great deal of work. Also there is a subsession to create a Planned DRP order. But I would prefer directly to create a DRP order, as it doesn't affect other tables.<br />

Thanks for the information, but I need a replenishment order in the moment that someone proccess the EDI lot.<br />
<br />
But I took the DRP idea. In &quot;Transfer Recommended Replenishment Orders&quot; trdrp0230m000 ; the last DRP step; appear how to create a Replenishment order (the stock movements included).<br />
<br />
And I must create a EDI DLL to extract the replenishment order information, one of my mates, created several of these dll the last year, I'll copy one of these.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all.<br />
