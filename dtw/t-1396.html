Sessions: tcmcs0139m000 Maintain Order Steps<br />
                tcmcs0142m000 Maintain Order Types<br />
<br />
I am attempting to create a special collect order type for Sales that would have a unique first step to prevent the invoice being included (accidentally) in the our normal Invoice run.<br />
<br />
I discovered that adding a new  step in tcmcs0139m00 and incorporating that in a new order type doesn't work....unless somebody could advise me how this can be achieved.<br />
<br />

<br />
Not completely fail-safe but it would permit you procedurally to print and post your new order type separately.</div></div><hr />

BaaN let you introduce new steps, including customized sessions, we tried it and saw steps were not updated.<br />
<br />
See solutions 10332 and 10921 in Support. If you need further information, please let me Know.<br />
<br />
P.D. Our tries were done in a test environment. Thanks God it was so. We could take back our steps.</div></div><hr />

So, only the sessions with that logic in the script are allowed in Maintain Order Steps.   Alejandro mentions that they have changed this to allow you to add other sessions...but if there is no logic, how will they be moved on?<br />
<br />
We have customized that code to allow new sessions that we created.  The sessions we created call standard logic to move them along the order steps.  <br />
<br />
As far as I know, you can't do that without a source code mod of the script you are trying to add.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried to explain that insert new stpes is not as simple as insert it in session Maintain Order Steps. (&quot;...steps were not updated).<br />
<br />
If you read those Support solutions I mentioned, you will see the problem you have when you insert new steps.<br />
<br />
So my I would like to change later subject. DO NOT DO THAT instead BE CARE, it is better.<br />
<br />
Customize order steps is not a simple job.<br />
<br />
Thank's</div></div><hr />

I suppose we could limit the user defaults somehow to prevent them from including certain a certain order series or type?<br />

Thanks, Scott2001, for the different approach.<br />

<br />
Paul,<br />
<br />
I was looking for a solution that didn't require customization and thought that your invoice &quot;run&quot; might be executed in a job. Obviously, order type could also have been used to select invoices to be printed -- the only advantage of trans type and series would be visibility in some displays and reports.<br />
<br />
The Baan documentation states fairly explicitly that although you can add additional sessions as order steps, only the pre-defined order steps/sessions will update the order status. I believe that the only predefined order steps that can precede &quot;print sales invoices&quot; for a collect type order are Print Picking Lists and Print Packing Slips. If either of these is not used in any other sales procedure, you could include it in the special collect order type, although that's probably not the best solution.<br />
<br />
It sounds like what you really need is to be able to block all orders for your special order type at the step Print Sales Invoices. <br />
<br />
How are these collect orders entered? <br />
 If orders are manually entered, can your procedures be changed so that the order entry staff manually blocks collect orders at entry? (Sales staff may be more aware of the need to review these orders before invoicing.)  If your collect orders are coming from an external source, can they be entered as EDI? I believe that you can set your EDI mapping so that EDI orders are automatically be blocked when entered.<br />
<br />
If either of these may work, you'll need to develop procedures to review and unblock the appropriate sales orders. Also, because neither the standard blocked order reports nor Unblock Sales Orders (tdsls4225m000) selects based on order type, you may want to write a short action report or inquiry showing only blocked collect orders (or only order type &quot;SCX&quot;).<br />

<br />
You have given me a good deal of information and ideas.<br />
I'll perform some testing on your suggestions.<br />
