In the company parameters TP or PCS projects must be marked as implemented and secondly the project field on item level (tcibd001) must be filled.<br />
<br />

<br />
We are not using either TP or PCS, but I can add projects in each so am assuming that the parameter is set for them.  (I'm familiar where it is set in IV, but where on the menu is it in V.)<br />
<br />
The field is not the one that is attached to the item in the session tdpur4101s000.  But is below it and labeled as Project.  It could be the same.<br />
<br />
Our purpose is not to go overboard with project just to be able to track POs by project.  We have on-going capital projects, but there would not be the staff to manage large project.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">30th March 2010, 08:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, as mentioned you have to switch on at least one of the mentioned parameters in tccom0500m000. The project field on the PO line is not just an informational field. It can only be used in combination with PCS or TP. If that is too heavy in usage for you then you can not use the project field on the PO line. <br />
<br />
However on the TP project it is possible to mark the project as Capital Project. Maybe this is something you can use in the future.<br />

I am investigating TP to see if we could make it work for us.  The company has had an ongoing capital project and have been using a Prolog.  The only interface into Baan finance that they have used is manually entering POs.  We've a few alternatives to look at including customization with an interface between the two, switch entirely to TP, or live with as-is.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
