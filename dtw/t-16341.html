I am trying for &quot;Proforma Invoice&quot; in sales order.  I have included the steps &quot;Print Proforma Invoice&quot; and &quot;link advance with proforma Invoice&quot; in sales order steps.   The sales order line staus is showing &quot;Print proforma invoice&quot; whereas when I try to print the session (tdsls4435m000), it is saying &quot;No data within selection&quot; <br />
<br />
Pls. let me know what may be the reason, any set-up is required, etc.<br />
<br />
We are using Baan IV c4.   <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would help you print a performa invoice and whenever you have to print the final invoice make this field as YES and aging print it would print a final invoice and the transactions would then be taken to finance<br />
<br />
Hope this help you.<br />

Thank you for your reply.   In my company, there is a practice to collect the advance before delivery of items and to collect the advance amount, a proforma Invoice is to submitted (sofar it is out of system).   I want to put the steps &quot;print profmora invoice&quot; and &quot;link advance with Proforma&quot; in Sales order step before &quot;maintain Delivery&quot;.   Sales order status is showing this step  whereas when it is printed, it is saying &quot;no data within selection&quot;.  I do not know what would be the reason....<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />

This may be one of the reasons for not printing.</div></div><hr />
