<br />
I'm setting up External EDI with our translation software and am having some problems with Baan's EDI semaphore files (the files it creates in the EDI command directory).<br />
<br />
I've got some flat files from our translation software and am tying to load them into Baan. What is happening is that the subsession tcedi7220s000 of Direct Network Communication hangs. <br />
<br />
The session seems to hang itself because it creates the command.fil semaphore file then won't delete it. If I go to the operating system and delete command.fil while the session is running, it finishes and loads the flat file without any errors. <br />
<br />
I've tried this with &quot;Generate Outgoing Messages before Connection&quot; in Maintain Networks set to both Yes or No, with the same results. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if something in my setup might be wrong, or what.<br />
<br />
How would this work if I had external EDI messages to generate and receive?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rob</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;semaphor&quot; - I always have to smile when I come across this term if it is not in the context of operating systems.<br />
Basically this &quot;semaphor controlled transaction&quot; only describes the following mechanism:<br />
To secure that at a given time only one of two systems exchanging files with one another may write/alter these files, the systems agree on a handshaking mode of processing.<br />
System A (Baan) may NOT access the files exchanged as long as the file &quot;command.fil&quot; exists.<br />
System B (EDI-system) may only access the data files IF &quot;command.fil&quot; exists.<br />
So the processing mode for a Baan-EDI program is as follows:<br />
Check if command.fil exists -----<br />
   Yes) The other system has control ==&gt; terminate program and try again later<br />
   No) Do your stuff, read and process or process and create a flat file ..... when done: Create file &quot;command.fil&quot; (zero byte content ... its only a signalling file ... a semaphore :-)<br />
<br />
The EDI counterpart just does the same the other way round:<br />
Check existence of command.fil:<br />
  Yeah, it is there) It's my turn, I can fetch or deliver data files ..... guess what, when I'm done, I will erase &quot;command.fil&quot;<br />
  Nope, no &quot;command.fil&quot;) my oh my ... I guess the other side is just preparing nice data for me .... will try later<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rduncan10</div><div class="date">6th February 2008, 03:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I borrowed the term semaphore from Baan's EDI documentation. <br />
<br />
I think I understand though. The logic assumes that the Baan's direct network communication and the EDI software will be running at the same time, or that the EDI software will be continuously monitoring the file system for new files. <br />
<br />
I guess I could turn that setting off for the external networks and have the two programs scheduled to run half an hour apart from each other.</div></div><hr />

1. Inbound transaction to Baan. We poll our VAN every 5 minutes or so. And it takes less than 2 minutes for our EDI software to translate the file. So I have created a job 2 min apart.EDI software creates a file and after 2 min it triggers Baan EDI job.<br />
2.For outbound transaction - I have scheduled them in jobs, after files are created in Baan directory, I move them in the directory where EDI software can read. The trigger is automatic.</div></div><hr />
