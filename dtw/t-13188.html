<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 00:04</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 2 product types for sale. 1 is manufactured, 1 is bought in and resold. We have always treated each product type quite separately - e.g. in separate sales order, finance reporting/integration etc. and wish to continue this.<br />
<br />
However, 1 customer wishes us to deliver both products from 1 of their orders without specifying the quantity of the 2nd item type.<br />
There is a relationship between the 2 - if you use 1000 of product 1 then you would use 10 of product 2.<br />
<br />
I thought of creating a new item, &quot;kit 1&quot; that goes on the sales order but there would be a BOM that causes manufacturing to make 1000 of product 1 and upon despatch to put 10 of product 2 into the box.<br />
<br />
However, how do I <br />
1.get revenue for these 2 sub-items to appear in separate GL accounts <br />
2.interrogate sales tables to create Crystal reports that can easily identify the revenue and order intake for both.<br />
<br />
I appreciate this is a Finance, Distribution and possibly Manufacturing question but any suggestions would be useful.<br />
<br />
p.s. we use customized items quite often in manufacturing.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

on the financial integration side of things you can actually cause integrations at the item level.  You can try it out in a dev. system to see what you get.<br />
Using session tdsls6102m000 Maintain Invoice Details Accounts.  Leave the first fields for Customer group, warehouse and item group blank, and enter the specific item you want to set up financial integrations for.   (There are a number of different combinations for the 'header' field combinations but, this is the most straight forward for the information you have listed. ) <br />
Then, you can break down the invoice details into material costs, operations costs, and turnover.  each break down can have different ledger accounts specified. <br />
Hope it helps,<br />

But as I am selling the main item &quot;kit 1&quot;, don't I have to create integration for that item?  Also won't just item &quot;kit 1&quot; be in my sales tables. I am interested in that for sales reports purposes.</div></div><hr />
