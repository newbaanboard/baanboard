<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aardvark</div><div class="date">13th March 2003, 11:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We use consignment (not owned) warehouses in Baan ERP 5.0b.<br />
We raise consignment replenishment purchase orders and receipt these purchase orders into the consignment (not owned) warehouse. When the inventory is going to be used, we raise a warehouse transfer order. When the outbound order line of this warehouse transfer is shipped, Baan creates a consignment payment purchase order. <br />
  Is it possible to control the purchase order number series from which the consignment payment purchase order number gets allocated? We ideally want to use a different purchase order number series for each buy-from business partner, but the only place I can find to define the purchase order number series to be used is the purchase order number series defined against the default purchase order type for consignment payment in the purchase order parameters session (tdpur0100s400). This appears to limit us to using the same purchase order number series for all consignment payment purchase orders for all buy-from business partners.<br />
Any help gratefully received.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the Consignment payment order price same as the original replenishment PO price.<br />
I am asking this because the contractual price with the supplier can be different when the material is actually consumed. We want the consignment payment order to pick up the latest price.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
