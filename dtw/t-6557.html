We have a client that is using Baan (Not sure what version)..<br />
We have written a quotation system, that the sales guys use out in the field. What we would like to do, is to transfer the data from our quotation system into baan.<br />
<br />
Firstly, is there a known method of doing this without using Baan interfaces/APIs/Baan agents?<br />
<br />
If not, is it possible to achieve this with a Baan interfaces/APIs? If so are there an examples of this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
just want to join into this topic.<br />
<br />
i am currently trying to build a session using afs for sales order maintainance.<br />
i think this also is a quite &quot;easy&quot; way to load sls orders....<br />
<br />
but i encountered some problems:<br />
<br />
anybody here who has solved issues like:<br />
- creating new lines with production / purchased items<br />
- creating line numbers different than baan standad (10,20,30)<br />
<br />
i was able to create a header and a cost line, but when inserting a non cost item the process hangs. <br />
when debugging baan standard session, i see that there seems to be a loop when baan checks the inventory and sees that there is none.<br />
<br />
thanks for your help.,<br />

does Baan not supply this as a standard BOI DLL ?<br />
<br />
Also the same question for the AFS sales order, why not just call the sales order BOI (DLL) ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Business Object Interface....basically DLL's that represent all the order taking sessions in Baan.  Also inquiry.  These DLL's can be called in a number of different ways.

Thanks for the information.<br />
I don't actually have Baan, But I need to create a Sales Order using the data from our system.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to interface with the BOI.DLL from any application?<br />
<br />
Are there any examples/sample application that do this?<br />
<br />
Most of the items that I need to create will exist in the Baan system.  But some will not, in which I would have to used the component parts, that do exist on Baan..<br />
<br />
Anybody got any Ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">you should find out what version of Baan they have.  AS not all versions will have the BOI DLL's availble to use. If they do you can call the DLL from the actual server where Baan is installed or via another server as long as it can see the Baan server.  This can be done via Cron jobs or unix scripts or even Baan C..... For calling via a java/vb program then you prob need to use openworld but could use the OLE that is supported by Baan.<br />
<br />
If the Baan version does not have the BOI's:<br />
you can use EDI, generate a DLL using the DDC generator.<br />
Have a DLL created by a vendor...<br />
<br />
I do not work for a vendor but know a good one that is cheap and of good quality....you can PM me if you want to give me a call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WHGibson</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that they have version IV c 4..<br />
<br />
If I understand you correctly, I can only invoke the DLL as long as it can see the server..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">yes <br />
<br />
You need I think service pack 8 installed on BaanIVc4 to have the standard set of DLL's.<br />
<br />
If not you can generate a DLL using a Baan tool session (only on BaanIVc and higher)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no standard ready made BOI's with baan 4 except for a few to work with DDC but you need a ddc driver to use them. The ready made BOI's only come with baan connectivity kit (used to be free but baan will not give it out anymore) or buy baan open world ($$$£££). You can write your own DLL search for stpapi on the board and it will give examples. you would probably need to write several as the customer may not be on baan so that would have to be covered along with the sales order.<br />
<br />
what about loading the quotation details to the quotation tables tdsls001,002,003,010,011 etc via exchange and use the baan session that converts quotations to real sales order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not agree with the above, the standard set of BOI's (DLL's) is packaged with one of the later service packs and includes a large number of DLL's for almost all major sessions....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunprasath</div><div class="date">13th December 2002, 06:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
 Baan has stopped supplying Baan connect Kit. <br />
But, BOIs are meant for external applications to connect to Baan. <br />
Though many of the standard BOI dlls that baan supplies, are not usable , because of the bugs, in it, we can easily develop our own BOIs and make the interface with external applications.<br />
<br />
It is reliable. The external applications can be in Java or <br />
Vb or VC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Let me also join the bandwagon<br />
<br />
I would like to diagree with the above statement. BOIs on BCK have turned out to be highly unreliable, in my experience. They r not easy to develop as once u encounter a tools buy and report to baan, they say they no longer support BCK. <br />
<br />
No doubt, it's a poor man's integration option... but  .... other options should be thought about, like OpenWorld</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunprasath</div><div class="date">13th December 2002, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Mr.Renegade, I agree that Baan is not supporting Baan Connect Kit. I do agree that there are technical difficulties while developing BOIs. But there are always workarounds to it. <br />
and with the technical expertise and with the workaround knowledge, it is possible to develop reliable BOIs. <br />
<br />
and Ultimately what we want is that a good Integration between baan and external application. no matter whether it is through BCK or Openworld.<br />
<br />
and Gibson, Try to get BCK1.3. and install them. you get lots of docs that comes along with it and also some examples. you can go through them.you will get an idea of what a BOI is and how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WHGibson</div><div class="date">13th December 2002, 12:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Where do I get the BCK 1.3 from? Baan ?<br />

Funny... Isn't it..?<br />
<br />
We have worked together on BOI. Maybe it was challenging. But BOI was unpredictable. I remember Baan was not able to solve the bug in &quot;Find&quot; for a particular session still. And I have also seen the post in BB from baan support person sometime recently. <br />
I am sure we did not get sign-off from customer for the last BOI project we deliveerd in August.<br />
<br />
If you say that just experience and acumen for workarounds helps.... let me ask u a quetion.... in what time frame can one develop BOI for a complex business process like Receipts? Have we made it work completely, foolproof? Can a baan partner commit with confidence, particularly when baan doesn't support.<br />
<br />
It was an option for Baan customers 3 years back. Now that Baan has stopped even shipping the product and support, it is not feasible for a company to commit to the customer and later get trapped by some tools bug in baan, which will not be solved by them for the purpose of BOI on BCBE to work.<br />
<br />
It is shrewd on Baan's part that they stopped support and push OW. And it is sometimes stupid for consultants to think brashly that they can march ahead without baan's support. Sometimes it is essential to have baan's support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunprasath</div><div class="date">16th December 2002, 06:51</div></div><div class="posttext">hi senthil,<br />
For your information, there is still a work around available for that particular problem, for that particular customer and thats why I said,with workarounds, BOIs will work.<br />
Experience does matter and with it we can predict the time frame and stick to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
and Gibson, you can contact your baan support for BCK1.3. If not you can ask your baan partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chandra</div><div class="date">18th December 2002, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not contradicting using BOI's / API's.<br />
<br />
But the easy way of meeting the requiremnt with minimum efforts from both applications side is using Baan Exchange or Baan EDI.<br />
<br />
If the quotation data also need to present in BaaN then as suggested by Darren Phillips earlier, use Baan Exchage to load quotation tables in baan and generate sales orders from there. For this you need to map the fields from the quotation application to the fields in Baan. Then you need create an ascii file in quotation application as defined in Baan exchange. This ascii file can be sent to the Baan server using ftp or any other means.<br />
<br />
If no quotation data is required in BaaN, then use Baan EDI to insert Sales orders. The EDI setup has to be created in baan for 850 inbound orders. For this you need not develop any new DLL's. Baan EDI calls for sales order data in a particular  EDI format which can be created from quotation application. It is just an ascii file in the predefined format.</div></div><hr />
