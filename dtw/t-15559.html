<br />
I have defined Sales order type with several manual activities prior to Release to Warehousing.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to reexecute such manual activities?</div></div><hr />

In Baan Vc I know you can set up 'Re-execute Activities by Order Type and Activity' - session tdsls0561m000, right below the Sales Order Types session in the menu.  In this session you can define at which current activity you are allowed to re-execute previous activities.</div></div><hr />

But then it is imposible to reexecute the 1st activitiy.</div></div><hr />
