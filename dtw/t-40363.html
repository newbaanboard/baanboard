  We have configed the PCF funtion, and it is successfully to create new item when PCF is firstly used.<br />
  But when we choose the Product Features like the previous configure, it shows the error report and tells me the item has been exist.<br />
  So we wish it can elect the previous item to fill the sales order line, how can we do it&#65311;<br />
 Thanks a lot for your attention!<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

On our system it will always choose the standard item over the configured one. Even if the standard item has a signal code which leaves it blocked, it gets chosen. <br />
<br />
Our work-around, to ensure we can use the configured item, is to rename the standard item to have an &quot;X&quot; character at the end uisng GTM. Loses the link to inventory history etc. but it works for the moment.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you could make your configured item code smarter - that is more unique, so it's not the same as the standard item.</div></div><hr />

 Thanks a lot for your reply.<br />
 But I have some problem about your reply, Could I think it can choose the standard item if the configures like the previous, and I need add character like '-' to distinguish them, so our system will generate a new standard item, right?<br />

I don't think it does that. It will select an existing standard if your potential configured item has the same item code.</div></div><hr />

 Thanks again.<br />
 I wish it can do it like you said: 'It will select an existing standard if your potential configured item has the same item code'.<br />
 So now I have confirmed system can select the existing standard item, but what can I do? I always get a warning report from system, it told me the existing item has generated, and don't change auto select the existing standard item.<br />
