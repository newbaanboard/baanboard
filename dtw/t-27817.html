<br />
just follow the advice of Xuanzan and it should work. But I also faced the situation that all the settings were properly set but I could not generate an outbound advice with &quot;Generate Outbound Advice&quot;. I only could manually maintain an outbound advice with whinh4525m000 &quot;Outbound Advice&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you have still problems you should check if the stock on location level is allocated by other outbound advices or if you have corrupt data. LN produces quite often mistakes in this area. In this case you have to check:<br />
<br />
Table whinr140 &quot;Item Stock by Location&quot; (can also be displayed with whinr1540m000)<br />
Check whinr140. qlal &quot;allocated&quot;<br />
<br />
Table whinr150 &quot;Item Stock by Location and Storage Unit&quot; (can only be displayed with general table session)<br />
Check if the total of all whinr150.qals &quot;allocated in storage unit&quot; for this item and location is equal to whinr140.qlal &quot;allocated in location unit&quot; (Take care for conversion factor)<br />
Check qavs &quot;available quantity in storage unit&quot; and &quot;qavl &quot;available quantity in storage unit&quot;<br />
<br />
Table whwmd215 &quot;Item Stock by warehouse&quot; (can also be displayed with whwmd2515m000 and doubleclick)<br />
Check if whwmd215. qlal &quot;allocated on location level&quot; is equal to whinr140.qlal<br />
