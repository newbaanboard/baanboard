I think you wanted to set std cost for this item based on you sales price and make the std cost less surcharge your simulated purchase price. If this is the case you need to compute your std cost accordinly and then upated the simulated purchase price against you cost price calculation code and then add the surchages and surcharge bases and then roll your std  cost for these items so that, when you cycle count these items you will get the revaluation if any and the invnetory value of these surplus items will at the rolled std cost.<br />
<br />
hope this is what you are trying to do.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amyumyun</div><div class="date">21st August 2004, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been using ILC module for awhile. I need to perform cycle counting and to this end i have to use b-object &quot;Cycle counting by Location&quot;. I am performing:<br />
1. Generate cycle counting order - tdilc5210m000<br />
2. Print cycle counting order - tdilc5410m000<br />
3. Entry cycle counting data - tdilc5110m000<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
<br />
How can i initiate sales price for each line with surplus (in tdilc5110m000)? In that way i can CORRECTLY revaluate inventory on hand after counting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amyumyun</div><div class="date">15th November 2004, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello! The problem with cycle counting and data processing is a live!<br />
After cycle counting I just want to enter both a quantity and PRICE in every single line.<br />
I execute the steps below:<br />
1. I generate cycle counting order<br />
2. I print cycle counting order<br />
3. I enter cycle counting data<br />
4. I print cycle countig check report<br />
5. Process cycle counting data<br />
<br />
On step number 3 I want to enter quantity and price (acquire price)!<br />
For example:<br />
If I have a ten numbers from item X in a warehouse before cycle counting with standart cost price 2 USD, after cycle counting i have a surplus five numbers and I want to store this surplus with price per unit 5 USD. The new cost price must to be 3 USD ((10*2+5*5)/15)=3 USD).<br />
The question is CAN I DO THAT AND HOW WITH STANDARD FUNCTIONALITY OF BAAN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smanohar</div><div class="date">16th November 2004, 05:43</div></div><div class="posttext">You cannot do it with the standard Baan functionality in B4.0c. Only in LN (and I think in B5.2a) also they introduced the possibility of entering quantity and the price during cycle counting / adjustment order. But, in your version (B4.0c4), there is no such valuation.<br />
<br />
The system will always increase the inventory at the latest standard cost price.<br />
<br />
PS: If you change your standard cost price before cycle counting, then the system will do revaluation for all the existing inventory, which you don't want.</div></div><hr />
