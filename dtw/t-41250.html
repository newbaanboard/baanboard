<br />
We want to use the additional cost set functionallity to invoice freight and other fees.<br />
It works perfectly exept for the fact that the freight is being invoiced before the goods are delivered.<br />
When we create the sales order, the additional costs are calculated.<br />
<br />
As soon as the order acknowledgement is printet, it is picked up by the release to invoicing (batch) and subsequently invoiced.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to make sure that it is invoiced at the same time as the goods delivery?<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
Eric</div></div><hr />

I am a Finance Guy but do recall that you have to look at the shipping constraints on Sales order Header as well make sure that the cost item is using the &quot;release to warehouse&quot; option.<br />
<br />

<br />
Im a finance guy too...<br />
<br />
The item data option &quot;release to warehouse&quot; did the trick. <br />
When running release to warehousing batch, the cost item get the warehousing status: Staged right away, and can be picked up at the time of delivery.<br />
<br />
Thanks Kai, I owe you one....<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
