<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sandeep_Kumar</div><div class="date">1st October 2004, 14:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all <br />
<br />
I am working on Baan IV C4 in5 with  NON ILC configuration<br />
<br />
I have a purchase order pertaining 5 lines , in tdpur4533m000 status is maintain receipt.IN PO lines = INSPECTION = NO<br />
<br />
Now I go to tdpur4120m000, enter receipt series say &quot;10&quot; and also enter &quot;packing slip number&quot;<br />
<br />
As in purchase parameters &quot;maintain receipt by receipt / order no &quot; = Order No<br />
therefore system ask for purchase order , As soon as I entered purchase order no , all the lines ( having status Maintain Receipt) will appear in the session(tdpur4120m000).<br />
<br />
Now enter packing slip Qty and receipt date and delievered Qty (= Packing slip qty) for 1st item only and save this record.(I EVEN DONOT TOUCH OTHER PO LINES).<br />
The status against 1st line in tdpur4120m00 changed to &quot;P&quot; , while against all other line is BLANK<br />
<br />
Now the problem is &quot; As per my understanding it should attach receipt number in first item only (tdpur4531m000).but here it is updating receipt no in all the records (means in all 6 lines of purchase order)  with zero packing slip QTY and Delivered Qty .<br />
Therefore MY QUESTION IS &quot;WHY IT IS UPDATING receipt no in all records??<br />
<br />
<br />
COULD ANYONE SIMULATE THIS ISSUE AT HIS/HER END and inform me the results <br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

yes i understand the situation. what you can do is just delete the lines for which you do not want to enter receipts. i dont see any other solution to this.<br />
hope this helps you.<br />

<br />
As Mr.sandy said, you have to delete the remaining Lines in Maintain Receipts.Pls kindly note that this is standard functionality in BaaN IV C4.<br />
