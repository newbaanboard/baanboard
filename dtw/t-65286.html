<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chjagge</div><div class="date">15th January 2014, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using Baan IV C4. Transaction types are configured in order types. Therefore orders using that order type will inherit the transaction type that was set there.  It was recommended to do credits we should append lines to the existing order, via tdsls4101m000, that  you wanted the credits to be applied.  However,  when you invoice those new lines, it will inherit the transaction type that was set in the order. However we want to use a different transaction type for credits.  Is there a way to force a different transaction type for the invoice that we will be doing for the credit transactions?</div></div><hr />
