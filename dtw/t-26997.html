<br />
Also is there any requirement for additional software for printing Barcodes in BaanIV b2 environment.<br />

i just realized a barcode project under BaaN 4C4 (Sun Solaris, T-Base).<br />
I use ELP from www.stethos.com .<br />
ELP modifies the PCL stream and send it to the printer.<br />
Before I used HP-Printers with Stethos - Modul, but thesoftware is easier to handle.<br />

Just for interest. <br />

<br />
we simply use printers that support barcode (brother hl series) for example, but several others do that too.<br />
All you have to do then to print barcode in a Baan report is to study the manual and write the escape sequences into Baan 'barcode drivers' (simple textfiles containing these sequences). Then you can print fields in barcode.<br />
Before we realised the simplicity of this functionality, we used other tricks to modify the data sent to the printer, but the way described above is a lot simpler and helps of course if you have to change a printer model.<br />
No additional SW is needed, just make sure that the printer is able to print the barcode you need (code 128 shouldn't be any problem though)<br />
<br />
regards<br />

What happens if you wish to print a report with barcodes to a different device than you normally do? Do you have to create a new Baan device so that you can print barcodes on that printer?  e.g. If you want to print a prod ord that has a barcode on it to 5 or 10 different printers than each one of those printers must have a Baan device that is set to the barcode driver textfile in printinf, is this correct?<br />

The whole formatting of the report changes after printing the barcode. Perhaps I have forgoten to turn the formatting off.</div></div><hr />
