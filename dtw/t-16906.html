<br />
We are facing a problem with Purchase Receipts. While doing receipts arbitrarily the session hangs and never returns. The session is killed and the same receipt tried again and it goes through without any issue at all.<br />
<br />
I have been tracing this issue for some time and most of the times the session gets stuck at an API call, but again its not all the time. I haven't seen any pattern at all that it happens for the same item or any particular order series etc. :confused: <br />
<br />
Sometimes I notice majority is for cost items. It happens for other items too. I know its too less data to suggest whats going on. In case anybody has noticed similar issues on their system do let me know.<br />

<br />
They confirmed its a defect in BaaN. Also found that somehow instead of 9 digit receipt numbers at times there are 8 digits receipts generated in our system. Its all related to the same defect.<br />
<br />
Awaiting solution.</div></div><hr />
