How did it happen? The answer to that may help finding the correct way of action<br />
 The store personnel ships qty more (or probably less) than sales order quantity. If this were the case and you would want to prevent such case from happening again, then probably you need to make changes to your current barcoding software to stop this thing from happening<br />
 The store personnel scanned the correct item, but keyed in wrong quantity in the gun. This is a bit tricky. There's gonna be packing slip and invoice involved. The only clean way to do it, in my opinion, is to make sales order with negative qty to correct the wrong shipment quantity recorded. Unless, the data from the gun is not sync online, then you can just delete the garbage data from the gun<br />
