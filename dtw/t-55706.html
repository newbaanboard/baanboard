<br />
ERPLN6.1-fp2.<br />
<br />
In which case PO data will not be inserted  in tfacp240, tfacp245 ?<br />
I have some PO's like that. But, against those PO's some receipts are already there and for a new receipt  seq problem is coming ... with referance does not exist (tfacp240). <br />
How come it is possible ( not having an entry in tfacp240)? <br />
Could some one tell the logic behind this.  Observation is all these po's are inter unit sales only. <br />
<br />

<br />
tfacp240 get updated at the time when u approves the PO &amp; tfacp245 gets updated at the time of confirming the receipt line.<br />
<br />
check the order line which you want to receive, whether those line are approved one or not.</div></div><hr />
