we are trying to figure out how to manage sales quotations and orders for our customers. What we need is to show the customer an All-Inclusive quotation, so a single row presenting the price of the item, plus the price of transportation plus other services we want to sell to customer. What we know is a single row, no frills for customer, no amounts to sum or choiches available.<br />
The difficult part for us is to still be able form a financial perspective to separate e.g. transportation service costs and revenues in LN from costs and revenues of the selled item (add transportation and services cost/revenues to the item will &quot;contaminate&quot; the margin on the item itself)<br />
Do You have any suggestion on this?<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
Andrea</div></div><hr />

You may customize the Sales Quotation printing to club all the costs / expenses, etc., basically a report customiztion and it should serve your purpose</div></div><hr />
