But  if you must have a Baan report:<br />
<br />
GO TO tdsls5501m000  Created Sales Order History by B P and Item<br />
Menu Path<br />
General Menu<br />
   Order Management<br />
      Sales Control<br />
         Sales Order History<br />
            Session  Created Sales Order History by BP and Item<br />
When in the session go to the menu bar and select:<br />
File:<br />
   Print:<br />
      Print Sales Order Line History by Sold-to BP and Item<br />
<br />
This brings up a dialog box where you can enter your desired ranges (or single value ranges) for BP; Date Range; Item or Item Range or any of the other selection options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. The session that you gave is for planned transactions.<br />
<br />
jcorwine has gave me the session that I want. But as jcorwine said that reporting in Baan is not good enough, we have to modified it to make us ease.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for your help. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nidyar</div><div class="date">21st November 2006, 06:04</div></div><div class="posttext">You may also try one more report: tdsls4412m000 which is attached in the session sales order lines.<br />
I am not sure about your scenario but if you opt for customized reprt, designing a report from sales order lines (all lines with sequence number = 0) would be easier and better than history tables. because creating, deleting and modification etc., will all be logged in it (along with the deliveries).<br />
However, this is just my idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">filipd</div><div class="date">21st November 2006, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Just another idea : you could also use the session tdsls4409m000 (Print Sales Order Lines), where you can select sold-to BP, item, sales order, ...  Start this session from the sales order lines session tdsls4501m000 by clicking the printer icon.  You can choose several reports (by item, order, ...) and at the end, there's a total line.<br />
I have attached some screenshots.<br />
<br />
Maybe this will save you some customization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">21st November 2006, 14:46</div></div><div class="posttext">All excellent suggestions about using standard baan reports and possible customizations.<br />
<br />
But - in my humble opinion I would avoid customization of the Baan reports and the consequent problems with all customizations - are they going to continue to function as desired with the implementation of the next service pack?<br />
<br />
My experience says that you are much better off investing in a good report writer (have used both Crystal and Cyber Query with great success).  You can train many users to do some of their own ad hoc report writing and can get the specific information and formatting as you want much easier than via customization of the Baan report scripts.</div></div><hr />
