<br />
recalculating price and discount in an SLS- or PUR-order does not take effect when effective date and expiry date in the reffering price table (pricelist or price by supplier and item) is changed after the initial entry of the orderline. As soon as the orderdate or quantity is changed manually, the price is calculated correctly. Is that standard functionality?<br />
<br />
I never noticed this problem until now, where lots of orderlines are affected by a later change of the effective date in a price list.<br />
<br />
Note: the referring SLS/PUR parameter is set to Automatic.<br />
<br />
Any help is highly appreciated.<br />

<br />
This is standard functionality. Changing price and discount should be part of a procedure where after changing all orders are, using a report, checked.<br />

<br />
U can try starting tdsls4810s000 giving a value in variable orno for the sales orders affected. It can re-calculate the prices.</div></div><hr />

Another trigger seems to be the price level. If a higher level is 'introduced' , supplier and item instead of item, the price is also recalculated. That's what I had in my mind when I was working on this case.<br />
