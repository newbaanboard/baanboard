1. Yes it is possible to change the receipt quantity provided you have not executed any other step after executing the session Maintain Receipts.<br />
<br />
2. Use Cost Item for the same.<br />
<br />
Hope this help you.<br />

<br />
1)recipt:<br />
you must have booked sales order or generated outbound advice for material for whom you want to change reciept.<br />
<br />
&amp; the inventory you received earlier is being allocated to corrosponding sales order or issued against some sales order<br />
<br />
so the receipt change is not possible in this case<br />

2. It is possible to change the sales price after goods has been shipped so long as there's no invoice generated yet for that shipment. However, once an invoice has been cut, its financial amount would've been passed to Finance. Hence you can't just change the invoice price. What you can do is cancel the old invoice with a sales return and make a new one (with the new price) by reissuing the goods. It's a bit tedious, but it's clean<br />
