<br />
ILC/LTC implemented.<br />
<br />
Item master &quot;lot control&quot; flag is set to &quot;by lot&quot;, and the Inventory valuation is set to Lot Price. Also the standard cost is set to ZERO dollars,<br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
<br />
The production receipt and issue for the lot control item is getting the standard cost price which is zero $s and not the lot price (set in maintain lot session). Is this how baan works?? what needs to be done to see the lot price in production issue and receipt transactions.(tfgld410)<br />
<br />
Can someone help me explain the lot control process flow.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">11th July 2002, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">There may be more qualified people than I (tools guy), but I have done some research towards cost flows with and without lot control, so let me give it a shot.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, lot control is a warehouse function. What it basically does is label a run of inventory (lot) with it's properties, price, quantity, receipt date and whatever other properties you define in lot features.<br />
<br />
This allows you to accurately monitor a variable production cost through the life cycle of an item. (there is another thread on this subject out there, and I get the impression that a lot of people are using lots somewhat creatively, which leads to all kinds of other problems). <br />
<br />
Once a production run (or purchase receipt), is put into a lot, this lot takes on (by default) the item's standard cost price, first receipt date (into the lot) and quantity.<br />
If your next production run comes out at a higher price (cost of raw materials or quantity produced), they must be received into a new lot (read: labeled differently), because the properties of that particular batch are different than the ones you used before.<br />
<br />
Once a lot price has been established, it becomes unchangable. Therefore, if you receive new inventory into an existing lot, this inventory will be valued at the lot price as it was. The actual price of the new inventory is discarded (and the difference between the two is booked somewhere in gld).<br />
<br />
Concluding, lot prices are not used anywhere in the production cycle. They don't come into play until items are received in the warehouse. If you don't run cost price calculations to accurately maintain the item's standard cost, you will obviously not be able to monitor these costs.<br />
<br />
I'll attach a cost price flow diagram that I drew up some time ago. It may not be 100% accurate (first draft), but it gives you some idea of the cost flow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The functionality of lot pricing will keep your raw materials at actual (read: lot price); however, when they are issued to a production order, they are issued at standard cost, which in your case is 0.  The difference between the lot price and the standard cost is recorded as a lot result transaction at the time of issue.  <br />
<br />
Therefore, even though you are using lot pricing, you should still establish a reasonable standard cost in order to keep the value of your work in process account(s)  more accurate and decrease the amount of costs that are being reflected in your lot variance account.<br />
