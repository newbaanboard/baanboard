Unfortunately the Transporttation package is sparsely used and documented. We had a hard time to find the proper configuration for our needs. But in the end it's worth the effort. Here is what our standard salesorder type looks like:<br />
<br />
1) Print Acknowledegement<br />
2) Copy Sales Oders to Transportation (trtoc2200m000)<br />
3) Print Picking List<br />
4) Maintain Deliveries<br />
5) Print Packing Slip<br />
6) Carry out Trips (trtop4290m000)<br />
7) Print Sales Invoice<br />
8) Process Delivered Sales Orders<br />
<br />
Unlike your company, we turned on the TR parameters from the very beginning of our projekt. This has several advantages for the integrity of the data which are involved in both packages TR and TD.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

I was testing the way you suggested. When I check the 'planning check Report ' it shows me no means of transport and no employee allocated to trip.<br />
can you please tell me how to allocate these before I can make the 'Carry out Trips' procedure.<br />
<br />
i'll be thankfull if you could write to me the sessions to be executed 1 by 1 to successfully complete the transport procedures only.<br />
<br />
Thks in advance</div></div><hr />

Assigning employees to trips is not mandatory. Carry Out Trips can be done without it, but you'll get a warning anyway.<br />
<br />
Run session trtop4100 to assign an employee to a trip.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
I could some how manange to get to 'Carryout Trips' but on executing this module on selecting the required trip (status shows free), the report shows 'no data found for report'. Can u please let me know what could be the problem and how to overcome this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">15th November 2005, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi noorulhaq,<br />
You can not carry out a trip with status 'Free'. A trip with this status is simply nothing but itself.<br />
You have to have transport orders, generate stops for those transport orders and the assign these stops to a trip. This trip automatically gets status 'Planned' instead of 'Free' as sson as the first stop has been assigned. Once the planning is confirmed, you have to modify the status to 'Firm Planned'. Only firm planned trips can be carrried out.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanguyz</div><div class="date">17th November 2005, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Are transportation parameters fulfilled??<br />
If yes then you could check that in FORM 2 of Maintain Order types (tcmcs0142m00) there is a field for order procedure and series there you can define the order procedure made in transportation and the series in which the Transportation order to be generated.<br />
<br />
The generation of transportation order would depend upon the fields of FORM 2 in SLS parameters and PUR parameters.<br />
<br />
In this case you won't need to modify your present order steps.<br />

<br />
As mentioned I followed those steps as well.<br />
The transport orders were generated and then from the Transport order Planning <br />
I executed Generate Stops and then Assign Trips to Stop <br />
<br />
The same is available under Order planning Distr-1, Distr-1, Truckload, Manual &amp; General. Is it ok if I execute from Truckload option.  The status was changed to Firm Planned<br />
<br />
Still I could not carry out the trips session. Where can I allocate the Transport ordline items to the trip. How can I overcome these. <br />
<br />
Thks in advance</div></div><hr />

It's getting tough now. Assuming that you implemented the link to the Distribution module as I mentioned in my first post, here is my educated guess what might be the problem: what is the status of the salesorder linked to the transport order? All sales orders should have the status 'Carry Out Trips'. <br />
In my experience the link between Distribution and Transportation ist the most sensitive part of the setup. Tiny little errors may lead to significant problems in the whole process. Hard to make remote diagnostics..<br />

That makes sense if you ask me. A bit of work to do, but it's a good idea to have all trips tracked.<br />
