I can think of a host of issues that come with that idea, but my main concern is that it would require a blanket PO construction.<br />
<br />
How do other companies do this? Would that not generate MRP exception messages, incorrect income statements, faulty supplyer ratings, etc.<br />
<br />
What would be alternative ways of inventory transactions from the vendor-owned warehouse?<br />
<br />
Can we monitor their inventory in BaaN so that lead times can be calculated more accurately?</div></div><hr />

The whole idea of VMI is that supplier manages the inventory. In past I have done following<br />
1. Designate Purchase Order per component.<br />
2. VMI vendor will supply in file, what component he has put along with qty and PO number<br />
3. System would create a PO line and do a maintain receipt automatically<br />
4. If the PO is exhausted (after consuming 999 lines) another Blanked PO would be issued<br />
<br />
Ofcourse there was some customization involved. In this way there is no MRP exception messages. I don't think you can use standard Baan supplier rating as it will be always delivered on the date of PO. But apart from that it handles pretty nicely. My client is using this for last 6 years.<br />

Unfortunately, VMI is not available in BaaN IVb.</div></div><hr />

We did this customization in Baan IVb to make this happen. <br />
As I mentioned this is how we handled it, but it was a customization. Some other checks that we build was<br />
1. No transfer of PO from MRP to Purchase Order.<br />
2. Cannot create a PO line for VMI item.<br />
<br />
It is not difficult to do<br />
