<br />
Working in Ln6, I have a query regarding rating calculation of Delivery Quantity rating<br />
<br />
For an Item &quot;X&quot; (say) , one PO was prepared for 1000 pcs<br />
<br />
1st receipt was made for 100 pcs ( with final flag as &quot;no&quot;)<br />
2nd receipt is made for 100 pcs ( with final flag as &quot;yes&quot;)<br />
back order was confirmed for balance 800 pcs <br />
3rd receipt is made for balance 800 pcs <br />
<br />
PDPO is executed for that order and Vendor rating is updated with FULL UPDATE option.<br />
<br />
Now in session objective rating &quot;DELIVERY Quantity rating&quot;(tdpur8106m000) , the value for delivery Quantity rating is &quot;80&quot; :mad: <br />
<br />
In Vendor rating parameter weighting method is &quot;ORDER LINE&quot; , if I change the value of this field to &quot;Piece Count &quot; or turnover&quot;, the value of the delivery rating is changed from &quot;80&quot; to &quot;82&quot;.<br />
<br />
So my queries are <br />
<br />
1) why delivery rating is calculated as 80 <br />
2) what is impact of ptr &quot;weighting method&quot; in Vendor rating paratmeters\<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance <br />
<br />
