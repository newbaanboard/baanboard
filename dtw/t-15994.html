<br />
If the Invoice is ancelled then there is a reversal entry in RG1 Only. The inventory is not reversed back in the system.<br />
But in case of Sales Return, the reversal entry is being made both for RG1 &amp; Inventory.<br />
<br />
Once the Inventory is received in System by Sales return, you can Invoice to anyone, but after Invoice cancellation, the invoice can be raised only on the customer to whom deliveries had been made.<br />
<br />
