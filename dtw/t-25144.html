<br />
We have an AFS scheme running here which activates various sessions to change Lot-Numbers for items in a certain warehouse. All has been running OK for a few weeks, I went on holiday for a week and on my return find that we are getting an error &quot;Location not found in Locations table&quot; (my translation from the German error message) EVERY time the scheme is run.<br />
<br />
I suspect that some kind of inconsistency in tables / references has somehow crept into the system - quite possibly due to direct manipulation of table data by a colleague, using GTM - but have no idea as to how to correct it. We ran a reorganize tables last night for the WH tables, but this has had no effect. <br />
<br />
Could one of the WH gurus please point me in the right direction so that we can quickly resolve this problem?<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />

<br />
An uncommon situation apparently reared its' ugly head last Friday, leading to an unexpected program flow, which we've now resolved.<br />
