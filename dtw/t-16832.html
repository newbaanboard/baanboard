<br />
I'm looking for a simple way to transfer item stock from one logistic company to the other. I know there is a standard solution for this - EDI - and that's what my company is using right now. The problem with EDI is, that my collegues don't like to handle all the necessary order steps cause it's more a sales/purchase process than a wharehouse routine. With the result that they are always late. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking in this direction: maybe DRP can be extended to work in a multi-company environment? Maybe it can be done by sharing the right tables.<br />
I have tools experience with about everything - so maybe one of you can point me in the right direction?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

What is the kind of company set up, is it multi finance multi logistic. Are they within one group company or not. Various things are to be considered before using any other method of transfer between compnaies. What is the location of the recieving company. Do u require any papers to go alongwith the material.<br />
<br />
If the logistics of the companies are at one place, u can go along with sharing of logistic tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lvdvelde</div><div class="date">29th November 2004, 14:58</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a multi logistic/multi finance setup, where all the companies are in the same group. There are several (physically separated) warehouses involved, and they are in the same company plant. Like I said, I have a procedure in mind which looks like DRP, with the same papers, steps, advices etc.</div></div><hr />
