<br />
BaaN Vc<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Let's say we have raised sales order with normal business partner.<br />
We have created the header &amp; detail.<br />
Now, we want to change the normal business partner to one time business<br />
partner.<br />
<br />
So, we deleted the order lines &amp; we go to header level to change the<br />
business partner to one- time business partner.<br />
<br />
On saving, it is giving the message &quot;invoice to B.P. can not be changed&quot;<br />
&amp; not allowing us to change to one-time business partner.<br />
But if we change from one normal business partner to another one, it is<br />
allowing us to change the business partner.<br />
<br />
What could be the reason for this? Any help would be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In B50b it is not a problem to enter one time business partner, or change a business partner into an one-time business partner.<br />
<br />
In B50c it also does not give any problem for a Purchase Order. <br />
<br />
As you can enter one on a Sales Order, but you cannot change the BP it into an one-time BP, I think you'd better create a case at SSA OnePoint Support.<br />

<br />
It's a completely legitimate question, but I'm not quite sure why you'd want to do that. The idea behind one time business partner feature is to just have one (or at maximum a few for classification sake) business partner code for all the suppliers or customers that you think you'll only interface once in a VERY long while. This then will ease the administrative burden on the purchase/sales department when recording transaction with such supplier/customer in BaanERP. The benefit from such feature diminishes when you record EVERY single supplier/customer as business partner in BaanERP, and just activate the &quot;One time business partner&quot; flag for, well, one time supplier/customer<br />

<br />
The problem is sometimes the user mistakenly puts the normal customer first and then deletes the lines and tries changing it to One time BP. The doubt is why does the message appear at all?<br />
