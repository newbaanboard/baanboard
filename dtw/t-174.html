<br />
I've been asked to set up some internal EDI in our Baan 4c4. <br />
<br />
I know nothing about EDI so I need to learn quickley. Does any body have any Baan EDI documentation they could send me or some decent web links.<br />
<br />
I've search Google for &quot;Baan EDI Documentation&quot; but I've had nothing of great value returned.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Ask your administrator for the EDI Manual in the Documentation CD.  Our documentation CD for Baan IV c4 is Documentation CD 5.  You will need to download the default file from the Baan ftp website (ftp://ftp.support.baan.com) or take the link from the Baan knowledgebase. <br />
<br />
It is not as difficult as it was in Baan IV b2.  <br />
<br />
Pay attention to relations.  The network name should be equal to the relation code in the session &quot;Maintain Relations by Network&quot;.<br />
<br />
You must define Conversion Codes for Order Types.<br />
<br />
Also, note the different &quot;semaphores&quot; used by Baan to check if messages are being generated or are being read.<br />
<br />
Enjoy,<br />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Since my original post I've got Baan to send me the relevant documentation and have managed to set up internal EDI.<br />
<br />
Just one question. What's the best way to transfer messages automatically. The Interchange Controller or a job running the Direct Network Communication? I'm sure I've either read or somebody has told me that the Interchange Controller is troublesome.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

Congratulations on you success.  I just want to know if you found the documentation helpful or you noticed some more deficiencies that need to be noted and reported to Baan.<br />
<br />
The interchange controller works fine, but you have to note that it runs a Baan session.  This means that if you're not in the server, the probability of the session being terminated depends on your network and client reliability.  I know some people who run the session in job mode off the server.  If it is done this way, it may indeed be better to run the session from a background Unix job script. Unfortunately, my Unix script writing is a little rusty so I can't help you much on this at this time.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

The documentation I thought was helpful. I found it a bit confusing when they talked about the different message types. But that's probably because I do not entirely understand the business process behind ordering. Something that will change over the next couple of weeks no doubt!<br />
<br />
The steps you need to take to set-up EDI seem to be long winded. Without the EDI document I would have been lost!<br />
<br />
With regards to the message transferral I'll probably set up a Cron job to run the Direct Network Communication on the server.<br />
