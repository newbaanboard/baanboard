<br />
Is there a paramter that would cause every line on the sales order to be generated as a separate warehouse order set?<br />
<br />
In my production environment, when I run tdsls4246m000, Release to Warehouse (Batch), all lines on the sales order are assigned the same set number.<br />
<br />
In my test environment, where I thought I had all paramters set the same, every sales order line is assigned a different set number.   My test environment does have different Baan solutions installed so this might be a setup problem or a new feature.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
By default, BaanERP groups SO line details by their planned delivery date and assign one WH order set per group. This means that if all the sales order line details have exactly the same planned delivery date, then BaanERP is going to assign them all to the same set number. This must have been what have happened in your live system. If, however, you set every sales order line details to have different planned delivery date, then BaanERP will assign different set number per SO line detail. This might have been what happened in your test system.<br />

There are some solutions which solve this problem if this is the case, but I'm not sure what they are right now.</div></div><hr />
