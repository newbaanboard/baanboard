<br />
My problem is that my company sells lifts .... now sometimes even 1 lift goes in more than 1 truck .... <br />
<br />
it is our need that we link each truck with a partial invoice... say 70% invoice along with the taxes.....<br />
<br />
and the rest 30% with its related taxes.<br />
<br />
Help me please ... it is very important..<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
