<br />
in the last week,  in the creation of order lines for a sale, after to put order units (tdsls041.oqua) I get the following message:<br />
<br />
&quot;No se encuentra el calendario actual para planificar (Adelante) para centro de trabajo en 09/10/2012&quot; con 0 unidades de tiempo de&quot; (tisfcs0003)<br />
<br />
I work with spanish language (number 5)<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what the message refers to?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much,<br />

My Spanish is rusty but the message is saying that when the system attempts to plan the order, it can't find 09/10/2012 (Oct 9, 2012) in the calendar that is linked to the planning work center. <br />
<br />
In the English language version, Message tisfcs003 is &quot;Actual calendar not found when planning (%s) for work center %s on %s with %d time units of planning time&quot;. (i.e., &quot;Actual calendar not found when planning [forward] for work center on 09/10/2012 with 0 units of planning time&quot;.)<br />
<br />
It sounds like your system is configured for ATP (available to promise). I assume that 09/10/2012 was the Planned Delivery Date on the order line (tdsls041.ddta). It probably defaulted from the order header, which in turn probably defaulted from the order entry date. <br />
<br />
Someone familiar with Baan planning (it's not my area of expertise) should be able to point you directly to the problem. In the interim, try the following:<br />
<br />
1) As Arvind suggested, check the company calendar to be sure it is defined for Oct 9 and beyond. (The company calendar is the calendar linked to the planning work center and actual plan code that are entered in the IRP parameters.)<br />
2)  Use Maintain Calendars (cprpd2104m000) to check whether the company calendar is properly defined for dates Oct 9, 2012 (current period) through a reasonable planning horizon.<br />
3) If the calendar appears to be properly defined, try changing the Planned Delivery Date on the order line. It sounds like too simple a solution, but the error message suggests that the order quantity is not available in stock and cannot be planned for same day delivery (0 units of planning time). <br />

A couple of screen captures are attached.<br />

thanks for your replay!<br />
We dont work with this calendars, but we have complete the tirou410 table until 07/10/2012 ¿?<br />
<br />
I attach several imeges with the information in the sessions you are talking.<br />
<br />

Thanks for the updated screen images. <br />
<br />
The original error message related to blocking sales order line entry and I assumed it had to do with ATP and Contstraint Planning. However, the parameter screen images that you sent suggest otherwise. So it looks like I mislead you on which calendar setup to check. <br />
<br />
I believe that Arvind was directing you to review the company calendar tirou410 which as you noted is maintained in Routing. <br />
<br />
You said that tirou410 has been maintained through Oct 7 but the original error indicated that Baan was trying to plan to a date of Oct 9. So my suggestion is that the calendar needs to be extended beyond Oct, preferably until the end of the year.<br />
<br />
If simply extending the existing calendar(s) in tirou410 does not fix the problem in sales order line entry, please attach images of the Routing Parameters and the Company Calendar in your next reply. As I said, Baan planning is not an area where I have specific expertise so hopefully someone else will contribute.<br />
<br />
For information only, the message that you received when you attempted to maintain the calendar in Constraint Planning says &quot;Recommend running session cprpd2207m000 (Rebuild Work Center Calendar)&quot;. Obviously you don't need to run that since you are not using CP.<br />

<br />
Scott, I attach the images requested...<br />
<br />
I could fill the tirou410 table until the end of the year... but I think that I´ll have the same problem the first day in 2013, isnt?<br />
