<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanqry</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on Baan IV c3 and have implemented several External EDI messages in multi-file mode.<br />
<br />
We now intend to bring in EDI orders from several sources at the same time. By several sources I mean - <br />
1. Orders from translator that are passed on to Baan periodically during the day.<br />
2. Some of our customers send us orders directly, outside of translator and they too need to get loaded into Baan asap.<br />
3. Certain credits ( Return &amp; Collect orders) our service reps issue which we convert to flat files and bring them into Baan thru EDI.<br />
4. Also, orders from field via PDA are written to a flat file to be loaded the EDI way...<br />
<br />
We use Direct Network Communication (DNC) session to bring them all in. My understanding is that we cannot have more than one instance of DNC session runnning at any time ( even with different networks), forcing us to set up sequential batch jobs for all these activities.<br />
<br />
Is my understanding wrong? If so, how can we multi-thread DNC w/o affecting performance too badly ( I am at 1 line/sec right now). I was hoping EDI Interchange controller will be the answer but that sounds like a solution more to do with frequency rather than multiplicty.<br />
<br />
I tried multiple networks/ messages ( like 850, 850PDA, 850CRD etc all for 850 and with the same library)  but with limited success..<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
