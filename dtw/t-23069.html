	I am trying to understand the functionally of ship complete flag that is available on the form 2 of  Maintain Sales Order session. <br />
<br />
	For example, say I have a sales order set to ship complete Yes and it has 3 line items out of which 2 items are in stock and 3rd items is not in stock. When I generate Outbound for this sales order, the system is not generating outbound even for those line items that in stock. It only gives a shortage report for the third item. Is this the standard functionality? It is possible through some parameters to change the outbound to generate outbound for the items that in stock?<br />
<br />
	Appreciate your help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbartelds</div><div class="date">3rd February 2005, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">This is standard functionality. If you want outbound advice for the orderlines with available stock, you can set ship complete to no, so these goods can be delivered. Theory is that if order is ship complete, stock can not be assigned to this order, since it cannot be delivered anyway and it should not block other sales orders.<br />
<br />
Same goes for ship complete on orderline. Not enough stock available: no outbound advice.<br />

Few more things to be noted.<br />
1. You can make an order line as line complete while order can be a normal order.<br />
2. Most often the defaults are carried from Customer. If customer is set for &quot;Ship Complete&quot; and order is set for Not, then if the order line is partially shipped, it results in no Back Order. This is becuase in customer master- The flag Back Order is set to &quot;No&quot; if the customer master ship complete flag is yes. <br />
