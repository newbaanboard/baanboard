<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sensoft99</div><div class="date">8th January 2005, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: I am on Baan 5c.<br />
<br />
When Baan Generates Cycle-count order, sometimes it generates multiple positions with same item in the same order sometimes with same unit and sometimes with different unit. sometimes it shows a different Stock point inventory in different position. <br />
<br />
I guess it is because of the stock point date w.r.t the FIFO setting. My question is : Practically, do people process multiple lines or process just one position with appropriate acyual inventory and delete the rest of positions?<br />
<br />
If someone has a detailed document on stock point dates, pls do send me. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegade</div><div class="date">11th January 2005, 06:37</div></div><div class="posttext">The multiple units is because the inventory is being used by some process as that unit and baan shows stock as per the unit-wise inventory it has. <br />
<br />
For example - EA and KLP. Let's say KLP = 1000 * EA<br />
<br />
So, when Baan generates 2 lines when a Forced Count is did for this item, the user can choose to negate KLP and add it to EA, if that is a requirement. Depends on what you want. If KLP is made to zero and EA beefed up, next time, when cycle count is run, you wont see KLP there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If one item is printed with different units, it is registered for this units. You can verify this data in session &quot;Inventory Structure&quot; (whinr1550m000).<br />
<br />
When an item is printed with different inventory dates, then indeed it is because the outbound method is defined as FIFO or LIFO. Then again the inventory is registered against these different inventory dates.</div></div><hr />
