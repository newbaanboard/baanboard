<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhavins</div><div class="date">31st October 2004, 11:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have an idea on a real time processing for BaaN EDI Jobs. I mean if there are plenty of EDI Jobs (for each message there are 2-5 jobs depending on various companies in Baan). And EDI definitely depends on:<br />
OUT EDI messages - Any transaction in Baan (like PO printing triggers 850 msg).<br />
IN EDI messages - Any input file to the I/P directory can be taken up for processing.<br />
<br />
Now for All EDI transactions if there are Jobs that are setup. Then I want to run all these Jobs real time. I mean is there a &quot;polling mechanism&quot; for Inbound EDI. And an automatic detection of generation of out messages in BaaN?. Or can we build anything like this ?.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea as to where to look for this information.</div></div><hr />

The EDI network communication session has to be patched first to run multiple networks at  a time.<br />
Then dedicate each network for Outbound and Inbound respectively in each companies.<br />
An external shell script/ program (based on the operating system) has to be developed that will pull and push the EDI files from the appl_to &amp; appl_from directories to your third party EDI mail box. The semaphore EDI processing files can be used to start and stop this external program.<br />
Run the EDI networks in batch as frequent as required to make it real time processing.</div></div><hr />
