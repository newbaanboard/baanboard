<br />
I was investigating Sales and Purchase Schedules in Sales and Purchase Contracts. It seems that the same is not available in Baan5c though there are buttons available in Sales and purchase contract lines. Probably some external application needs to be linked to baan5c for scheduling.<br />
<br />
Is anyone using schedules in baan 5c or have researched this functionality?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sales and purchase schedules are no longer available in BaaN V.  There is no &quot;supply chain&quot; module like in BaaN IV to activate schedules.<br />
As an alternative, we use purchase contracts.  When we enter a purchase order, it is linked to a contract and the called quantity is updated.  Whenever goods are received, the invoiced contract quantity is updated.  So, we &quot;call off&quot; against the contract.</div></div><hr />
