I am working on BaaN4 C4.<br />

<br />
If this is the case you can surpress detaillines on your report based on the status, the current status of the lines you can find in table tdpur045 ( spur ).<br />
If you report is showing just the PO and no positions this means you need to check al the posistions on the order. <br />
<br />
To surpress a detail on your report you can simply use an expression on the specific detailline line, for example &quot;tdpur045.spur &lt;&gt; 2&quot;<br />
<br />
If you need more info, just let me know<br />

In BaanERP (ie version 5), there is indeed separate step in PO processing to release the PO or have extra step to have it authorised by the big wigs. However, there's no built in feature like those in BaanIV. The next best thing would be to find whether a PO has been printed or not. If you're feeling really adventurous you can customise BaanIV to include those feature from BaanERP :)<br />

<br />
Or if youre not adventurous enough you could purchase a solution such as ours which can add approval chains to 4c, we store the date and time stamp of each of the signers which you could easily access.</div></div><hr />

   The main issue here is to flag of a certain field and use it to show the order as authorized or approved. The only two step before Maintain receipt that could help are Print Purchase Order and Print Goods Received Notes. Once you decide which of these to use, you could utilize the field pmsk(Procedure Mask) in tdpur045 table to pick up authorized or approved orders. <br />
