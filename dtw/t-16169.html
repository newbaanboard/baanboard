<br />
<br />
We have some items where the inventory unit is &quot;pcs&quot;, and due to some changes in the production of that item we want to change the inventory unit to meter.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the field inventory field in tcibd0101s000 but that field is dimmed...<br />
<br />
Now is there any way to change that field.. and if we want to do it from the GTM what is the tables to change..also if there is production orders would they be affected or only the new ones...<br />
one last question what about the stock in warehouses..<br />
<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">4th August 2004, 05:45</div></div><div class="posttext">All the questions you raise are valid.  The firm recommendation is to not change the inventory unit (tiitm001.cuni) because of the problems you have identified -- and numerous others.<br />
<br />
Had the item not had any transactions or orders raised/posted then I think you could try changing the unit. But because you have transactions the job would be really big (if you wished to preserve the integrity of the system)<br />
<br />
The cleanest way for you to accomodate the change in thinking relating to the inventory unit is to load a new item.<br />

You can the change it in GTM then but your history will be incorrect.</div></div><hr />

THANKS for your help.</div></div><hr />
