<br />
We had some stock items that were being handled under manual stores for some strange reason. In some cases one stock item say XXX exists in both manual stock and BAAN system stock. Now we need to disband the manual stock and take everything onto BAAN. The stock item XXX has an an avarage price maintained in the manual cardex system. In BAAN XXX has a system computed average price. The two average prices are different (purchased and consumed at different times) with the average price mantained for manual stock being higher (more recent purchases in an inflationary environment). <br />
<br />
Example<br />
We have 5 units of XXX at average price of $50 in BAAN and 10 units of the same item in the manual stores @$75.<br />
How can I do a take-on of the 10 units so that a new system average price is reflected. If I do a quantity take-on everything goes in at the system average price which is much lower. I am hesitant to do it via PO since I do not know what to do with the resultant creditors transactions<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas<br />
<br />

<br />
PO is the best solution because you do not have to care about average price (and cost price, if it based on AP).<br />
Create a new supplier code with special fin. supplier group (tccom020.cfsg) and new order type (define as collective orders). You can dissociate these transactions in Finance.</div></div><hr />

in that case you wrote inventory corrections should be made (to receipt new items in warehouse). Average price would remain same, maybe it would be disadvantage...</div></div><hr />
