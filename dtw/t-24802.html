<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">10th August 2005, 09:16</div></div><div class="posttext">When goods are received, the value of the inventory will increase accordingly. At receipt this is reflected in the Inventory Receipt Transactions (whina1512m000). Note: the table is whinr112.<br />
<br />
As soon as stock is issued, the inventory value will decrease. At that moment a record will be logged in whinr114. First one or more records in whinr112 are selected for which the received quantity is not yet consumed. To order in which the whinr112-records are selected depends on the inventory valuation method. E.g. in case of LIFO, the latest records will be selected first. <br />
When a new whinr114 record is inserted it is linked with 1 or more whinr112-records. In that case it is known for which order line(s) and on what date the consumption was done. This is important in case of running an inventory valuation in the past.<br />
<br />
Also the amounts which are logged at the moment of issue depend on the inventory valuation method:<br />
-	FTP: the cost price is retrieved from the CPR-module.<br />
-	MAUC: the MAUC is logged<br />
-	LOT price: the lot price is retrieved<br />
-	LIFO/FIFO: the amount of the linked whinr112-record is taken.<br />
<br />
In all cases the amount is increased by (item and/or warehouse) issue surcharges if these are defined.<br />
<br />
The whinr114-records are visible in session Inventory Receipt Transaction Consumptions (whina1514m000).</div></div><hr />
