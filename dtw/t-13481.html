<br />
We want to create sales orders with EDI. It works fine, only one problem occurs. It is necessary to import several orders with new delivery addresses. Does anybody know, whether it is possible with EDI?<br />
<br />
It's descripted in the Baan EDI documentation, but I don't understand how it should work. In BaanIV it is possible to create a single order address. In Baan5 only the addresses in the table tccom130 can be used.<br />
<br />
Any ideas??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atul Khungar</div><div class="date">4th November 2003, 23:41</div></div><div class="posttext">To make it work, you need to turn the first free number logic for Addresses... What that means is that users will not be able to create their own address numbers but the address number will be generated automatically by the system.. <br />
<br />
We faced the same problem when implementing EDI at our site .. What we ended up doing is to build a customization around EDI to get Address details..<br />
<br />
Hope that helps..</div></div><hr />
