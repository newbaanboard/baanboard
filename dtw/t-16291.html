<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Richard Sharp</div><div class="date">16th August 2004, 23:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello.  I hope all are well!<br />
<br />
I have performed many standard cost revaluations since I have been working with BaaN.  However, I am noticing that the (Last CP Trans. date) for many of my items within Maintain Item Data (tiitm0101m000), does not agree with the date that I last performed a global update of my standard costs.<br />
<br />
Upon researching one of the items that was showing an older &quot;Last CP Trans. Date&quot;, I determined that there was no on-hand inventory during the date of my last revaluation.  Therefore, the standard cost was not updated.<br />
<br />
The problem arises whith the very next unit that is placed into inventory.  It goes in at the old standard cost, which may not include any changes to the BOM and/or Route that may have taken place.  <br />
<br />
Question  :confused: Will BaaN revalue the standard cost of an item, even if there is no current on-hand quantity?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance that you may be able to offer.<br />
<br />
Have a GREAT day &amp; keep SMILIN'  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 If an item has not inventory you can roll std cost as  many times you like in a   <br />
   given day as there will be no inventory revaluation and wip revaluation.<br />
<br />
2. If an  item does have inventory and there is a price change ( change on the<br />
    item itself / one of the components  (bom)) then the system will create a   <br />
    new std cost and revalue you inventory/WIP and update the item master <br />
    with the new std cost and the day the cost was rolled.<br />
<br />
3  If an item has inventory and there is no change in the cost ( by itself/ in the bom) the system will not create any revaluation /wip and also will NOT update the std cost in the item master and last cost price calculation date.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
