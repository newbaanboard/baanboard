Thanks,<br />

   Arent there couple of production date fields that can be changed to reflect the date when the item was released to production? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RickRepsher</div><div class="date">27th August 2007, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I would think so, but I have checked the following tables...<br />
<br />
whinh200 warehouse orders<br />
whinh210 inbound order lines<br />
whinh211 inventory inspection data<br />
whinh215 inbound advice<br />
whinh230 inbound advice log<br />
whinr110 inventory transactions by item<br />
whinr112 inventory receipt transactions<br />
<br />
All of these tables contain some sort of time / date stamp, but it appears that this is what is happening.<br />
<br />
For a &quot;non-inspectable&quot; item, all of the timestamps are generated when the &quot;Goods Received Note&quot; is generated at the dock.<br />
<br />
For an &quot;inspectable&quot; item, some timestamps are generated when the &quot;Goods Received Note&quot; is generated, and the rest are generated when the item is released from inspection.<br />
<br />
In either case, I cannot find a timestamp for the &quot;storage mission&quot; event, when an item is actually &quot;released to production.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
