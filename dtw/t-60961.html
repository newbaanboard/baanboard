<br />
As an example, I have a production order that is planned to start in 2 months and the inventory has been initiated with an allocation date in 2 months time and the same for the outbound order line delivery date.  All good.l:)<br />
<br />
We decide to pull the job forward so replan it in SFC to start next week. In doing this it changes the allocation date correctly but does not update the outbound orderlne delivery date:confused:  As we run the outbound for a date range of (for example) +10 days the materials for this job will not be generaed and picked:(<br />
<br />
I can't see any easy way of updating the outbound order lines to reflect the change in planning dates.  You can't 'uninitiate'  the materials on mass, you can't delete the outbound orderlines so what should we do?<br />
<br />
Considering writing a routine to align the outbound orderline dates with the allocation dates each night - does that make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteveGrubb</div><div class="date">31st August 2011, 11:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem solved - it is controlled by a parameter in Inventory Handling Parameters. The parameter 'Correct Outbound Dates for SFC upto and including' was set to Never - setting it to Generate Outbound Advice means the outbound orderline dates change perfectly whenever you reschedule.  :)</div></div><hr />
