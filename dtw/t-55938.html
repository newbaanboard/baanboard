<br />
I would like to know if anybody has tried out successfully the implementation of EDI using Baan IVb4 / c4 ? <br />
<br />
Our requirement is to transact between two companies on the same Baan server and convert one company's PO into another company's SO without the need to key in manually, which is being done now. <br />
<br />
If anybody has done such a roll out, I would welcome views and any documentation on that.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
Yes this can be done with BaaN IV BEMIS, without using an external EDI Converter.<br />
<br />
1.) Create PO orders in company A transfer EDI message to company B.<br />
2.) Create Sales Order from EDI in Company B<br />
3.) Create Delivery Advise in company B -&gt; EDI message<br />
4.) Create Purchase Receipt in company A<br />
5.) Create Sales Invoice in company B<br />
6.) ........<br />
<br />

<br />
please check the documentation available on the Infor BEMIS side.<br />
<br />
Link: http://edi.baan.com/<br />
<br />
A good starting point is the document U7041C &quot;EDI User Guide&quot; which can be found in the download area.<br />

<br />
My requirement is to be able to convert the PO of one Baan company into the SO of another Baan company in the same server and also be able to update back the delivery dates so that the sales team can be informed well. Presently the same is happening but all data entered manually.<br />
<br />
Would like to know the problems faced, precautions, etc..<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
