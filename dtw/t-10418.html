Are there any similar companies using Baan that have integrated any U.S. regulatory software into their system?<br />
<br />
If you have written your own module, we may be interested in talking as well.<br />
<br />
Please reply to this post if you can help us.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

We added a sister table to the item master which stores chemical charastics.  We then wrote some scripts to calculate usage info based on production data.<br />
<br />
I will be happy to discuss this further if needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our fertilizer products are shipped all over the country and we have to create a process to track, control the products/shipments.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dunvince</div><div class="date">22nd August 2003, 20:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Our reporting requirements have to do with how much of a chemical we scrap or emit to atmosphere.  We do not register our FG's.<br />
<br />
We did create a separate set of packing sessions that help us better track roll data.  We have many customers with special labeling requirements.   I also created my own Generate outbound session based on the packing sessions which streamlined the whole process.  I think this might be similar to what you are trying to acomplish.</div></div><hr />
