<br />
From Baan Support's explanation, they say<br />
<br />
Everytime during a sales, standard cost price is taken up as cost of the item.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, then it is not logical.<br />
For lot item, we should be able to take the lot price as the cost.<br />
What they say is the lot result is created and the difference of lot price and std cost is the lot result. Yes, we can later pass the lot result to cost of goods sold BUT the individual gross profit of each Sales Order will be incorrect.<br />
<br />
We will not be able to get the correct gross profit of each Sales Order. How does Baan's sales statistics module handle this because in the module, we can get sales statistics for individual invoices. Don't tell me in the sales statistics module, it is giving the profit based on standard cost price even if my item is on lot pricing?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

If your delivery exists of three different lots with different prices you will find three records for the same delivery.<br />
Will be easy to calculate your searched Gross Margin from this data.<br />
