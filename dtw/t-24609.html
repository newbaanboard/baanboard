<br />
i need to verify something regarding the tax field on the sales order header and tax field on the sales order lines.<br />
<br />
I have a sales order for customer A (where customer has tax field to yes in customer master but tax code is OUT 0%), and i have a line in that sales order for item B (where tax field is at 7% in item master).<br />
<br />
When i print the invoice, i'm charging a tax of 7%.  If my customer is set to 0% tax, shouldn't the invoice also be at 0%  even if the line is getting the item tax by default?<br />
<br />

<br />
There are several different &quot;tax&quot; approaches and localisations to cater for the many different tax requirements around the world.  We use vanilla BaanIVc4 with the standard vat capability. With this version (yours sounds if it it uses the same fileds and logic) the tax field in the cistomer master is used only for default in the sales header. This field can then be changed to either yes or no and then this is used to determine whether to get the item tax code for inclusion in the sales detail record. (on one order some items may be taxable and others not depending in tax laws in the particular country)<br />
<br />
In other words it is the tax code in the sales detail record that determines whether tax is charged on a particular line item or not and at what rate. <br />
