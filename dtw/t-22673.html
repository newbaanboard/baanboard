<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bartth</div><div class="date">20th December 2004, 18:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello<br />
<br />
A worker called me recently with the following problem;<br />
He had received goods, which were put in the location 'RECEIPT'.<br />
When he wanted to transfer the goods to another location, he couldn't because the system said the goods were allready transfered.<br />
<br />
When I looked at some reports i noticed that the goods were in location RECEIPT, with inventory set to 10245 and allocated inv also set to 10245.<br />
On location 00001 exactly the same item and lot was present, with all inventories zet to 0 except the 'Expected inventory', which was set to 10245.<br />
<br />
I hope you're still with me ;)<br />
<br />
I 'solved' the matter by removing that inventory line from the database where it said that the goods were on location 00001, expected inventory.  I edited the Receipt line, and set the allocated value to 0.<br />
<br />
Doing this, the worker could continue his work and move the goods to their rightful position.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me what exactly Allocated and Expected inventory is? When are they set and how are they linked to each other?<br />
Perhaps you could shine a light no how this could have happened? The system seems to have automatically set the goods to location 00001, as expected.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Bart</div></div><hr />

When then the order is processed fully, the stocks will be cleared from expected/allocated, and assigned from/to the warehouses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bartth</div><div class="date">21st December 2004, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the user have to do something to 'complete' the order? (besides the normal 'receive goods' actions (via catch weight btw))<br />
<br />
I've had some goods 'stuck' in allocated/expected for more then 10 days.<br />
The user doesn't seem to know how this happened or how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The correct procedure would be<br />
 Receive the goods into RECEIPT through whichever order it was coming from<br />
 Create a warehousing order of type manual transfer to move the goods from RECEIPT to 00001<br />
 Send the goods out of RECEIPT (outbound procedure)<br />
 Receive the goods in 00001 (inbound procedure)<br />
Did the worker follow this procedure?<br />
