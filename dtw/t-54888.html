Sub :- BranchTransfer (Goods Transfer within branch)<br />
I am facing problem while warehouse transfer for our group companies. For warehouse transfer what we are doing , We create one sales order and do all the warehosue transaction and do the central invoicing . In the finnace we Map the warehouse transfer on the basis of Sales order series and the business partner. But the warehouse transfer account  is only creadited by basic amount , where as our client requirement is Warehouse transfer account should be creadited by both basic+tax amount .<br />
<br />
Can any body tell me how we can solve this problem.<br />
<br />

Are you using warehouse Transfer by defining Entity-Entity Relationship &amp; Proper Tax Code while booking Transfer Order Line.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your Reply on this thread. we are not using Entity relationship. We are using the normal sales and normal purchase order for stock transfer within group companies.</div></div><hr />

If so, then any specific reason for defining it like that?</div></div><hr />
