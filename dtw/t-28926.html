<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">19th December 2006, 04:11</div></div><div class="posttext">If you use MRP, BaanERP actually pegs the planned purchase order to the demand, be it production order, planned production order, sales order, and so on. Unfortunately, when releasing planned orders to execution, somehow BaanERP doesn't carry this information with it. I can't quite figure out why as so many people actually need this functionality. We ended up doing little customisation in MRP to bring this pegging information along upon releasing planned orders<br />

 Couple of ways to do this ranging from simple to not so simple. Looking at the simple way, i could think of two options. To have the production order number entered into the line item text of the purchase order (like what Darren suggested) or entering a combination of purchase order and line number on the production order text(e.g: 12345601).<br />
The not so simple way is to customize the item(s) in question and so both the purchase order line item and production order item will share the same project. I stated this as not so simple just because it involves extra steps like creating project, customizing items, project closing etc. But rest assured, it works...<br />
