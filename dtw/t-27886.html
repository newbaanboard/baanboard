We would like to replenish the material from the stock room to the production floor based on production orders and not based on WIP warehouse.<br />
<br />
Does BaaN IV provide that functionality?<br />

<br />
The replenishment of WIP warehouses, using DRP, is working perfectly for most of our WIP/Production lines.<br />
Howver in the recent past we have introduced new product lines with high mix, and many common parts accross the different products within these product lines. For the afore mentionned reason, and because these are new products, we want to get a kit on the production floor just for a given production order. We are not sure what is the best process, if there is one, to use. Any idea? Thanks. Erik</div></div><hr />

So your requirement is when the stock is issued for a production order, it is always complete. In my previous implementation we had a process in place, where system won't release the production order unless all the components are available. So. when replenishment order is released it will always have all the components for that. Will that work?This will resolve your issue of complete kit.<br />
<br />
Well, I can give you a guideline for doing a customization.<br />
1. System will try to allocate all the components to a production order. If all the materials can be allocated then it would release the production order.<br />
2. System will then create a planned RPL order and tie this to a productuion order.<br />
3. System will then transfer the planned RPL order.<br />
4. The material can subsequently transfer to the WIP warehouses.<br />
5. For the production order for which there was shortages of material, system will not create a RPL order, and may create a shortage report.<br />
<br />
We may need to think of more conditions. backflush, if by mistaje some one completes a non complete production order. This all is doable. Not a difficult thing to achieve.<br />
<br />

<br />
But I guess your other need is also to tie up which production order the kit can belong. This would call for a customization and this is how I would do it- Create a planned replenishment order for every production order, and then transfer all the planned order that belongs to same production order <br />

Upfront I want to apologize for my ignorance :o . I don't know why I never gave DRP a chance. Maybe because it's hidden in the Transportation module? Who knows..<br />
<br />
Anyway, inspired by your comments, avpatil, I implemented DRP on our test system and..  it works great :) :) :) !<br />
DRP, indeed resolves one of the last &quot;big&quot; problems we had with Baan, and it has been no great issue to implement. I have to admit that I'm really happy.. :D <br />
<br />
In this spirit: never stop exploring!<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />

I m using LN 6.1. There is no standard sessionfor transfer of raw materials from the main warehouse to Shop floor Warehouse. We have customised a simple session for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">1st September 2006, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">In case of new products with less historical data, isn't wise to just outbound materials from central whse straight into the SFC-orders?:confused: <br />
In that case you won't need DRP or RPL orders at all.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">1st September 2006, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Hutej,<br />
I am sure you are aware why they are using WIP and DRP combinations. It is nothing to do with old or new product. The material is still in centrally located in central warehouse. If I remember correctly, the original problem was how do we ensure that when the Baan recommends the issue to a production order, it ensures that all the material issued is to make a complete product, like a complete kit. This is not a standard functionality in Baan IV, however it can be developed. The use of WIP warehouse makes the Baan process coincide with physical process on the floor. Abd DRP is the only engine that helps in doing so. One can develop a custom report and with the use of Barcoding transactions, one need not go the DRP route.<br />
