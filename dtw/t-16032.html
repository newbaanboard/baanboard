<br />
BaaN IVc4<br />
----------<br />
<br />
I have a customer whose Sales orders get blocked as soon as they are created. The problem is this customer has enough credit, no invoices overdue, and his status is 'Normal Customer'. <br />
<br />
I have set the Sales parameters as Blocked for all 3 parameters viz Credit, Overdue Invoice and Customer status.<br />
<br />
I am unable to understand as to what else could be the possible reason for blocking. The problem cannot be a bug as this does not happen for all customers.<br />
In the session tdsls4225m000 'Block Sales Orders', the reason for blocking is 'Overdue Invoice'. As far as I can see, the customer does not have any overdue invoice. <br />
Where all exactly does one check to see if there are overdue invoices?<br />
I checked the aging sessions.<br />
<br />
Can you folks give me any other blocking reasons please? <br />
Has anyone faced such a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will confirm whether the customer have any overdue invoice.</div></div><hr />
