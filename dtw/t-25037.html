<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jwhite</div><div class="date">7th September 2005, 20:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know how to manage a business partner where you want to assign multiple sales price lists to a single partner to reflect different types of discounting -- these customer belong to group purchasing organizations and we have to report purchases so we've been using the price list for reporting purposes.<br />
<br />
A customer can select which group discount they want, but I'm looking for an automated way of prompting (as opposed to asking the customer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">8th September 2005, 03:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what you are getting at here.  does the net price change if a different list is selected. If you are looking for a list to pop up that would be hard but you can display price simulations.<br />
<br />
Baan has a lot of flexibility in pricing, discounting, rebates and commission , and it is possible to use different gorup customers as basis.<br />
<br />
Have you worked through the help screens?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jwhite</div><div class="date">13th September 2005, 02:43</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using the sales price list and assigning one list per customer.  When we input an order we get the pricing per that sales price list.  What we want to do is have multiple price lists per customer and then select the list when we input the order...  but we want Baan to tell us the valid lists for that customer. <br />
<br />
Our customers purchase through Group Purchasing Organizations and I must have a Letter of Participation on file in order to extend the pricing -- hence my desire to have Baan show only the valid price lists for that customer.  <br />
<br />
Right now it seems I can only assign one price list per Business Partner.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something??</div></div><hr />
