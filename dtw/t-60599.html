Could you please share your comments on the effect of Inbound Lead Time field (whinh210.iltm) on SIC? The field is maintained in 'Item Data by Warehouse' session (whwmd2510m000/ whwmd2110s000).<br />
<br />
Item Type is Purchased and the order system is SIC. We want to maintain inbound lead time by warehouse and want the system to consider this while generating PO advice for that warehouse when using SIC. But for whatever reason, system is only using the 'Supply Time (tdipu001.suti)' field value in 'Item Purchase Data' session (tdipu0101s000).<br />
<br />
Need your help to find out why its not considering inbound lead time at all (either only that or supply time plus inbound lead time will meet the requirement) while generating PO advice with SIC. Are we missing any parameter setting?<br />
<br />
Do you think SIC will not consider inbound lead time at all? Is it considered only by Enterprise Planning? Implementing EP just to get around this issue is not option for us. We are on Baan5.0c.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help on this.<br />
<br />
