<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">18th March 2008, 04:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
We are on BaaN V and we have 2 different geographical locations sharing the same logistics company. We have 2 finance companies, each for each geographical location.<br />
<br />
I have this question and hoping someone can give some advice.<br />
<br />
We created a warehouse order (transfer(manual)) for item A for 20 units. This warehouse order is to transfer item A from one warehouse to another warehouse, both of them are located at different geographical location.<br />
<br />
When doing receiving, the user at destination warehouse just receive in 15 units. The final receipt is checked. With this, no more further receipt is possible.<br />
<br />
My questions are :<br />
1) What happen to the 5 units? Are there gone missing from both warehouse ?<br />
2) In what business situation the receiving warehouse should receive less ? Can it be missing in transportation? What else?<br />
3) What is the Finance implication? I noticed there is an invoice created for -5 (negative five) unit in the SLI module.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
