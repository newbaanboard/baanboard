<br />
we work with BaaN c4 + Dimensions and we used Dimensions Cycle Counting.<br />
<br />
We detected that in the table for Cycle Counting, tdmdm220, there is a field called Reason Code (recd), which is not shown in any session. We filled it because whe though that this reason code was going to be used for the inventory corrections, but this was not the case.<br />
<br />
Does somebody know which is the purpose of this filed?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

Ad√©u</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our problem is that we already have the reason code created in the session that you mentioned and we filled the field tdmdm020.recd with that reason code, but the system didn't use it when we processed the Cycle counting. What we would like to know is how should it work/be setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For integration purposes all you can do is set up integration schemes in tdinv8150m000 in order to get financial results from the CC-proces into the correct ledger accounts.</div></div><hr />

The only way to use the reason codes is in session tdkinv1101m000 enter inventory transactiions by item.</div></div><hr />
