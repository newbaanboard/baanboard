<br />
What exactly are you trying to report or analyze? <br />
<br />
Inventory valuation report tdinv6230m000 will tell you what the system now thinks was on hand as of a specific date, based on the records in tdinv700. <br />
<br />
If inventory transactions were backdated, however, the reported qty and valuation may not be what the system actually showed as on hand on that date.<br />

Moreover table tdinv700 gives backdated inventory only at the warehouse level. To get it at location level, one has to extract from table tdilc301 (Inventory Transactions by Location (History))<br />

Your parameter &quot;Log Physical Inventory Transactions by Location&quot; would not be set to &quot;Yes&quot; in ILC parameters. IF you change that to &quot;Yes&quot;, from now on your table 'tdilc301' would be populated on every inventory transaction.<br />
To get the earlier data, maybe you have to dig out from Outbound and Inbound data tabl (tdilc401 &amp; 402), inventory adjustments (tdilc102), inventory transfers (tdilc103) and maybe some more tables for details of history of location inventory transactions.<br />
I think there should be some way of populating the tdilc301 table from rest of the tables, but I do not know.<br />
<br />

Only way out is to capture that data from other transaction tables....that too is a tedious job and would slow down the performance of the report drastically.  We did fall in the same trap some time back............ when Log Location History Parameter was somehow set to off.  <br />
<br />
Just a tip, if you are capturing every Lot moment, as well in your report,  table tdltc102 is a good source.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's suppose the receipt is made on 13/02/2004 at 14:39. Receipts are approved on 19/02/2004. <br />
<br />
Now if I want to know the time when approvals are made, table tdilc301 is populated as approcal transactions on 13/02/2004 at 23:59 with transaction type as inventory transfer.<br />
<br />
I am trying to generate a report based on receipt time and approval time to generate MIS report for average time taken for approving material in company.<br />
<br />
In case the receipts are approved on the same day, things are ok, but when the receipts are approved on next any day I am unable to get the approval time.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
