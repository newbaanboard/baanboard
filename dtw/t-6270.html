It happens when I save my form after zooming to another table for input.<br />

This sounds like you are using a string variable that is declared 'BASED' .  There are some references in the programmers guide on how to deal with BASED variables and the syntax to code with them.  Maybe a guru could narrow it down for you.<br />
hope it helps a little,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuart</div><div class="date">24th January 2013, 15:04</div></div><div class="posttext">This can be caused by inconsistencies in form definitions. The order in which the fields are sequenced do not tie up to the order in which the logical handling of the data occurs, or in one case I found - there were multiple forms attached to the session - one which had a horizontal step size of 2 - the others had a step size of 1.</div></div><hr />
