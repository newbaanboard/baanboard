<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthil</div><div class="date">8th June 2004, 14:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Our business pattern is totally seasonal, we want to use SIC for low cost items whereas the consumption pattern in peak season is huge say 100 and whereas in non peak season is 20. <br />
<br />
Ordering method : Replenish to max.inventory / Fixed order quantity.<br />
order system : SIC<br />
order interval : 30 days<br />
<br />
Could anyone suggest, wheather we can have seasonal pattern in SIC order system i.e with Maximum inventory / Fixed order quantity / Reorder point<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Re-order point logic, regardless of Baan, assumes a flat, predictable demand pattern.<br />
<br />
Work around...<br />
<br />
Try defining order quantifiers per warehouse for a certain period of demand and order parameters for the company for another period of demand.  Generate recommendations based on the appropriate order quantifiers...warehouse or company.  This wouldn't give you true seasonality based on a gradual, sloping curve but would give you a stepped curve to plan against.<br />

If you have questions, please let me know.</div></div><hr />
