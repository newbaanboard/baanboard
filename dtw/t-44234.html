<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">9th November 2007, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We just did a major conversion on our Baan database.  We went from 2 companies to 1 by merging the data through a series of SQL scripts.  Our intention was to bring over only master tables with very little transactional data.  We brought over inventory with ilc101, inv001, ltc001 based on the items we identified as active from both of the two companies.  On the day we did the conversion, inventory valuation matched almost exactly.  I think we were missing $100.  Earlier in the week someone complained that in one of our outside warehouses, there were items that never go there.  I ran tdinv0253m000 Rebuild Historical Inventory Balances on one of the items in that warehouse and it removed it.  So we scheduled to run that same session on the entire warehouse.  That was a mistake.  We did NOT bring over any data from inv700 because of the premise that we're not taking over any transactional data.  When we ran inventory valuation again for a prior date, all of the items that didn't belong in the warehouse were gone but there were other items missing as well that should have been in there.  However, if I run the valuation for today, or yesterday or even the day before, the missing items are there.  I'm thinking that when there have been no movements on an item, because we didn't bring over beginning balances for inv700, the inventory shows as 0 but as soon as something changes on the item, it exists to Baan.  I think it's a self-correcting problem except that we'll have several days of discrepancy from the day we converted until the first day that the inventory is moved.  Does anyone have any ideas?  Can we fix the missing days of valuation?  Do we need to?</div></div><hr />

From your posting it seems you updated the tables manually. I think the better approach would have been to bring it via cycle count. Then there would have been no discrepancy. Anyway, back date running of inventory doesn't give accurate result and I believe it happens due to Inspection issue in purchasing. In my environment we don't back date it. We store each days of inventory in falt file and run it as per user request.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">14th November 2007, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">There would have been too much inventory to cycle count.  We have distinct warehouses for each of the two separate companies we consolidated so based on which warehouse it was we used sql scripts to bring over the appropriate inventory.  I believe we do have the answer to the problem now however.  We ran tdinv0253m000 which built back the inventory levels on inventory that had moved since consolidation in tdinv700.  For inventory that hadn't moved, there was no tdinv700 record to update but it does update the historical inventory balance in tdinv100 and adds the date that the rebuild was run as the historical inventory date.  That will still give us a problem because our inventory did exist prior to when we ran the rebuild but we found we can re-set that date to the date of consolidation and the historical inventory valuation is now correct.</div></div><hr />
