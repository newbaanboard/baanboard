<br />
I have had a bespoke application written to convert MFGPRO format into BEMIS format in order to import Sales Schedules. I've been through the basic EDI setup steps named the BEMIS file DELINS and placed it in the appl_to directory on the server.<br />
<br />
However when running Direct Network Communication tcedi7205m000 the session isn't finding the file. I know that there will be problems with the file and as yet I haven't set up all the code conversions but I was hoping that the system might be a little more helpfull rather than doing nothing.<br />
<br />
How can I be sure that my file has the correct name and that the system can see it ?<br />
<br />
Can anyone put their finger on something obvious that I may have missed.<br />
<br />

If you are using the standard conversion set up, then the fiel name should be '830S'. If there is any wrong in the file, then this file can be maintained using session &quot;Matain Saved messages to be Received'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Maintain Networks<br />
Investigate the trace directory, and analyze the latest trace file. I would expect that the line 'missing comm.yes file' appears. If this is true you should set the indicator 'Suppress Std Comm' to 'Yes'.&quot;<br />
<br />
When I reset this flag the messages began to come into the system.<br />

Thanks for your help<br />

<br />
Are you using BaaN and Mfg/Pro both at the same time. if yes, please provide me with more details as to what functionality your  company has mapped on both the ERPs.<br />

<br />
EDI for Incoming Sales Schedules is really the only area in which we share data between Baan and Mfgpro.<br />
<br />
We are running Baan IVc3 and we receive Sales Schedules from our internal JIT plants which we treat as a normal customer. Despite the JIT plants being within our company group we do not have access directly to mfgpro and we have this data in a raw format via ftp. So there is no direct integration between the systems .<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
