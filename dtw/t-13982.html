<br />
We use TP and make rpl-deliveries, linked to those TP-projects.<br />
When the &quot;TP-customer &quot; is in a foreign country, we wish to see these 'logistic movements' in our Intrastat records (tccom710).<br />
<br />
I know Baan 'removed' the Project-integration with Intrastat<br />
(mainly because the Project is financially based and the Intrastat is logistically based), but how do we get those &quot;International RPL-deliveries&quot; in tccom710?<br />
<br />
(also logged a Case with Baan, but it seems they're out of Office or so.............)</div></div><hr />

<br />
what exactly is a TP-customer in your case? As far as I understand RPL-orders, the country code of the destination warehouse is triggering the Intrastat statistics.<br />

<br />
the Project is linked to a customer in another country.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid the primary check in 'process delivered rpl orders'(tdrpl2126) is on warehouse, and not on country. (<br />
<br />
When rpl orders are used to deliver on TP projects, no destination warehouse is filled.....so it might be a bug, but I'm not sure since I don't have the code.......<br />
<br />
rpl100: delivery from warehouse in Holland to  project X<br />
pdm600: project X has Customer C (deliveryadress D)<br />
com010: customer C - ccty = Germany<br />
com013: customer C, adress D -&gt; ccty = Germany<br />
<br />

<br />
I did a short test on my system (no projects) with a manual RPL-order and it didn't work too. Seems this is worth a &quot;20&quot; case at Baan Support. Did you got a feedback already? A solution would be interesting for us as well even if we don't have international RPL-orders at the moment.<br />
<br />

I got it working.....so no bug after all.<br />
It was a really stupid error on my account....... :o <br />
we did not have Germany set up as an EU-member..........<br />
(maybe that is also your problem ?)</div></div><hr />
