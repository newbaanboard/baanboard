<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rpura1</div><div class="date">12th March 2002, 03:15</div></div><div class="posttext">This is something that has always confused me.  The Purchase order parameter (Baan 5.0c) is set to auto confirm backorders.  Now, if we want to reduce or increase the back order quantity, how is that done?  The backorder quantity field in Purchase Order Receipts is grayed out.  If the parameter is set to not autoconfirm backorders, the quantities can be changed and then the backorder can be confirmed.<br />
<br />
We would like the auto confirm on, but need a way to reduce or increase backorder quantities.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rpura1</div><div class="date">13th March 2002, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no maintain backorder session in Baan 5.0c, only for sales orders, not purchase orders</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mfischer</div><div class="date">14th March 2002, 02:29</div></div><div class="posttext">If 5.0c is anything like 5.0b, then you have to go to the PO Lines (session tdpur4501m000), then to the PO Line Details (session tdpur4501m200).  Do this by selecting one of the lines and then use the &quot;Details&quot; option from the Selection menu.<br />
<br />
A new sequence is created for the back order quantity, which can then be modified to a different qty, delivery date, etc. or you can cancel the line.<br />
<br />
You will find that the PO Lines session will not accumuate the received back order quantities, so it is sometimes difficult to see whether the line has been completely received.  If you are expecting multiple shipments for a line (ie order qty 10, expected delivery 4 on one day and 6 on another) then you may want to look at using the Split Delivery Lines function, which allows to record the different qty/delivery dates for one PO Line.  Again, this takes you into the Details session which allows you to modify the details, and can also maintain back orders for the split lines.</div></div><hr />
