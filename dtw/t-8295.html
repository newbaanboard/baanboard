<br />
We had ILC implemented in live company, but I am crazy on understanding what would have been the case If we hadn't implemented ILC.<br />
<br />
Advantages/disadvantages in both the case. ????</div></div><hr />

<br />
For companies that are satisfied with knowing the level of stock per warehouse, then not using location control is enough. However, some companies go the distance and actually chops up their large warehouses and organises them into sections. To be able to manage stock level per section of a warehouse, then a location control is needed. With location control, BaanERP will be able to tell, for example, from which section of a warehouse a particular item should be picked or to which section it should be stored and so on.<br />

<br />
The same data is contained in ILC as is in INV, but there is extra information added:<br />
- date: you can use your storage date (date in) to determine your shelflife and to use it for inbound/outbound movement<br />
- clot: lot control is only possible when ILC is implemented (LTC is a subset of ILC in Baan IV), including lot-tracking.<br />
- stun: you can store your items in different packaging, but this is for informational use only, still the stock unit is leading for inventory levels.<br />
- loca: your warehouse can be differentiated, without or with locations (like different shelves, bins, sections etc).<br />
- cprj: customized items cannot be stored in INV warehouses, but they can be (temprarily) stored in ILC.</div></div><hr />
