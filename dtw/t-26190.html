<br />
Lot Item A<br />
<br />
(1 pcs/lot)<br />
<br />
On 01.01.06 I purchase the item A: 1 pcs * $100 (lot 1)<br />
<br />
On 01.02.06 I purchase the same item A: 1 pcs * $200 (lot 2)<br />
<br />
On 01.03.06 I want to issue the item A, but with a lot price 1: $100<br />
<br />
I don't have to use the  average purchase price, which is $150!!!<br />
<br />
How can I do that?:confused:</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much!<br />
I will try and inform you :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately BaaN calculates the average purchase price and then updates the standard cost price.<br />
<br />
When I issue the purchased item to the project the system uses the standard cost price (which actually is the APP).<br />
<br />
This is unacceptable :-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">26th January 2006, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Item issues are always at standard cost . It is the inventory which is valued at actual price . At the time of issue , lot result is generated for issued quantity , may be  u can use lot variance account to charge to the project cost . <br />
<br />
In lot price the variance is calculated  only for the consumed quantity at the time of issue or at the of time price change in finance (tfacp1140s000 / tdpur4122m000) for consumed quantity.<br />
.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asharnouby</div><div class="date">8th February 2006, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">For new items if you can define the inventory vlauation as lot price then it is possible. (Maintain item data , form I)<br />
<br />
But you will also have to maintain integrations in finance for lot variances.<br />
<br />
For existing items it is not possible to convert to new costing policy.<br />
<br />
If you need just inventory valuation and no entries in financial books, then you will have to make a report by each lot price.</div></div><hr />
