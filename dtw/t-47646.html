<br />
We are using ERP LN 6.1 FP2 and we want use &quot;Inventory Commitment&quot; for  production order so as to hard allocate the components to the production order. But if the start date of production order is greater than current date then inventory commitment is not getting generated through session <br />
whinp2200m000. Also eventhough the start date is less than current date but if the allocation date of the estimated material line is greater than current date, same problem occours.<br />
<br />
Is it related to inventory commitment date or any type of horizon or any parameter setting?<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any help on the above stated.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

in here, we set in the material item code to be direct initiate inv issue.<br />
so when prod ord is released, the system is automatically generate outbound advice. this make current stock will be booked by this prod ord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kees de Jong</div><div class="date">10th January 2011, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Inventory commitments are only created for requirements within in the supply lead time of the item ('commitment date'). When the requirement is outside this lead time, there is enough time to either buy or make the item. <br />
<br />
In FP2, using inventory commitments require the setup of lead times.<br />
<br />
In FP3, it is possible to set the &quot;Inventory Handling Parameters&quot; (whinh0100m000) option &quot;Generate Inventory Commitments based on Planned Delivery Date&quot;. With this option the inventory commitments are generated based on the planned inventory transactions, without using the commitment date.<br />
In FP5, the parameter is moved to the &quot;Inventory Planning Parameters&quot; (whinp0100m000) session.</div></div><hr />
