<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">4th September 2001, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a customer that we charge for the packaging against a specific item. We have set the packaging up as an item and attached to the relevant sales contract. However it appears that the only way we can get the packaging to appear on the sales order and then the subsequent invoice is to add it to the despatch as a seperate item via a seperate sales contract. Is there any way we can charge for this packaging without having to add it as a separate item as the customer will not let us incorporate the packaging cost in the standard item.<br />
<br />
We are running the supply chain module of Baan IV c3.<br />

Thanks<br />

I may be way off base but, You may want to look at additional costs by cost sets.  I have a 'student document' that refers to setting up additional costs using cost sets, price lists and linking them to a specific customer/item combination.  <br />
long story short,  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha :) <br />
 You need to set a series for the additional cost set in the sales order parameters session 'tdsls4100m000'.<br />
Then, create a COST type item.  Sounds like you already have this set up.  <br />
Then, create a cost set navigating into Baan Distribution/Sales Control/Sales Orders/Miscell/Additional Order Costs/Maintain Cost Sets.<br />
Then, Link the cost item to the cost set.Baan Distribution/Sales Control/Sales Orders/Miscell/Additional Order Costs/Maintain Items by Cost Set.<br />
Then, link the cost set to a customer price list!<br />
Baan Distribution/Sales Control/Sales Orders/Miscell/Additional Order Costs/Maintain Cost set by sales price list and customer.<br />
When you enter a sales order for the customer the system should prompt you to ad the cost set to the order.<br />
later,<br />

<br />
I'm not familiar with supply chain but agree with the advice above. A word of caution though, if you can use these additional costs and you are using sales contracts then the functionality is slightly limited. If you create a contract with a delivery schedule and then go to generate the sales orders you will see that there is a flag to set which will add additional cost to the orders. Baan will only add 1 line of cost to each order generated. In this way you would need to make sure that a seperate order was generated for each delivery that you wished to have cost attached to. Similarly in sales orders the same applies, I line of cost for each order. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">5th September 2001, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for that.<br />
<br />
I was looking for something a little more based around the Supply Chain delivery sessions where Supply Chain Sales Orders are generated automatically by the session tdssc2217m000 - &quot;Confirm Deliveries in Preperation&quot;.<br />
<br />
When setting up the Planned Deliveries in session tdssc0117m000 we add the delivery packaging but despite adding a sales price to this item no extra cost comes through onto the Sales Order. <br />
<br />
I would appreciate any further input.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
 Just been trying this in our test system and it seems that another way is to add the cost item to the ssc parameters session tdssc0195m000 form 7 as the packing charges cost item number.<br />
When you add this item using the special charges calculation subsession found on the special menu on the maintain  planned delivery lines screen you can add the value of packaging so I assume you can add one item to the delivery containing the packaging charge for the whole delivery. but you still end up having to add this package charge cost item to the delivery.<br />
<br />
below is help text from special charges session<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard_Data                                   Maintain Special Charges (tdssc6106s000)                            Company   :  000<br />
A new zoom subsession Maintain Special Charges (tdssc6106s000) has been<br />
 added to the choice field of the subsession Maintain Planned Delivery Lines (tdssc0118s000). This new subsession is also activated when the user  exits from the Maintain Planned Delivery Lines session and answers Yes to   the question Are any Special Charges Applicable ? Yes/No&quot;.<br />
<br />
    The special charges can be entered as the $ amounts against the predefined  Charges Types that is, Setup / Tooling / Packaging / Freight / Others, and    is stored as a new line in the Maintain Planned Deliveries Lines table  (tdssc018) The item for the special charges must exist in the SSC   Parameters table and is always a cost item. When inserting a line in the  tdssc018 table, the position numbers are generated considering the    parameter &quot;First Position Number for Additional Costs Set   (tdsls000.cspn.4)&quot; defined in the Maintain Sales Order Parameters<br />
    (tdsls4100m000) session.<br />
<br />
    The value entered for the special charges is stored in the Contract Price    field tdssc018.cpri. The user can insert the text to input the comments or   authorization codes which appeare on the invoice. Maintenance of the  Special Charges is not possible after Printing Confirmed Advice Notes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We should be able to set up a procedure based around the addition of special charges when despatching. <br />
<br />
I think the user was looking for something that automatically added chargeable packaging lines to the despatch but the prescribed solution is more than adequete.<br />
<br />
