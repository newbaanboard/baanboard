<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donnie</div><div class="date">14th July 2010, 12:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everybody. I have warehouse WRH01 with location and Item X with 100 pcs in location A and 90 pcs in location B. Both locations have outbound priority to 999. Now I want to pick 80 pcs and I generate outbound advice. Ln gives me 1 advice for 80 pcs from location B. It may be useful because I always have as free location as possible but, from the help, I understood that, in the case explained, Ln should generate 1 advice from location A (which is before than B).<br />
Is there a parameter to set up this kind of functionality or this is the standard (and so my help is wrong)?<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
<br />
The system will generate outbound advice base on the Outbound Method defined in the Items-Warehousing session. Please refer to example below.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Item X Inventory<br />
Location A = 100 pcs, Inventory Date = January 15, 2010<br />
Location B = 90 pcs, Inventory Date =  January 1, 2010 <br />
<br />
Order Qty. = 80 pcs<br />
<br />
Outbound Method and Advice that will be generated by the system             <br />
FIFO------&gt;Location B = 80 pcs<br />
LIFO------&gt;Location A = 80 pcs<br />
By Location------&gt;Location A = 40 pcs, Location B = 40 pcs<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
