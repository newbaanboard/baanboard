So only the sales orders are taken in account and not the internal deliveries.<br />
<br />
We are now facing a new problem, the China warehouse becomes much more important and the replenishment orders should be taken in account in the demand consumption (but only for this warehouse).<br />
The material is our property until it's sold to the end customer in China through a sales order entered in our BaaN system.<br />
<br />
What would be the professional way to manage this case with BaaN: main company in France, warehouse in China (not a subsidiary), material under customs until sold.<br />
<br />
Have some experience for a similar problem ?<br />
<br />
