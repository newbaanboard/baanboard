Where can we get the allocated Inventory details (Not Hard Allocated). For a particular Item, system shows me that inventory is allocated. I need to know against which Sales Order/Production Order/Warehousing Order/Service Order.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Thanks for the information. Now I can see that the Inventory is allocated against a particular service Order.<br />
Now the problem still exists, I want to release the inventory from allocation.<br />
I tried running Generate Outbount Advice but it gives message that &quot;No data found for report, no report is printed.<br />
I am getting the same message while running &quot;Release Outbound data&quot;<br />
Even I tried deleting the details by &quot;Delete Outbound data&quot; but it says no data within selection.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give some thought, what's the possible reason that Inventory is appearing in Allocation but not allowing me to release.<br />
How can we release this inventory from allocation.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ERPBAAN</div><div class="date">16th March 2010, 07:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply. I have resolved the issue. The inventory were appearing as allocated against the Service Order and release outbound was processed through &quot;Maintain Actual Service Order Costs and Revenues&quot; this resulted in to releasing of the allocated inventory.<br />
<br />
But the question arises here is, how the inventory is getting allocated automatically. It may happen for the few of the item in a particular Service Order  out of various Service orders. User doesn't have any clue at what point of time the inventory is getting allocated.<br />
We are not using planning and simply creating service order in Baan IV(Not planned service order) and issuing the inventory against it.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
