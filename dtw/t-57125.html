<br />
Most of our suppliers offer unit price and in additon, transportation cost. In purchase orders we have to write unit price and use it during the process. But in this situation we can not control changeable transportation costs. I tried &quot;cost&quot; type items. But I found out that these type of items are components of &quot;general costs&quot; and based on orders, not on items as we need.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to maintain additional transportation costs over unit purchase price? <br />
<br />
Is there anyone who has an idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Please have a look to Purchase Additional Cost Sets (tdpur0124m000).<br />

<br />
thx for reply.<br />
<br />
We have tried it with Additional Cost Sets, but it is based on the Purchase Order and not on the item, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The additional cost items are indeed per purchase order but they can be based upon the item/supplier.<br />
So whenever you order item ABC you will get additional cost. How those cost are calculated depends on how the settings are. <br />
<br />
If it still not fits then please illustrate your question with an example.<br />

The surcharges will include in your item cost.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">5th November 2009, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">It are item costs on the Cost item you define in the additional cost set. It is not included in the costs of item ABC.<br />

<br />
It is possible to add additional costs to the purchase item separately after delivery (not only change the price after delivery)?</div></div><hr />
