I am not getting good results. any suggestion?<br />
i am on IVc2. thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">11th February 2017, 04:41</div></div><div class="posttext">follow up question. how about for purchase orders? i thought that would be from pur046 (purchase invoices)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a concept of Manual Sales Invoices in your version? On LN, there is a table for manual sales invoices where the invoice is booked without the sales order.<br />
<br />
Also, the purchase invoices should be present in tfacp200 if that table exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">11th February 2017, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi bushan, thank you. They do have a concept of manual invoicing and it's not as obvious as LN because you just insert a record in Finance (as with other transactions)  (***baanIVc experts correct me if i'm wrong). so i guess i have to query acr200 - invoices in tdsls045. this could result in records in tfacr400?? or maybe i should assume that all records in tfacr400 have no sales orders?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">27th February 2017, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Look for invoice number in tdsls045.You can use tfacr200 and if the invoice is not in tdsls045, then these are without sales order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">27th February 2017, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">For Purchase order also you can use tfacp200 and compare with tdpur046. But these shall only for invoices that are matched. Also in tfacp200 there is a flag matched with order also present.</div></div><hr />
