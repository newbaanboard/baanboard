MAIN STORES IS A NETTABLE WAREHOUSE WHEREAS SPARE PARTS STORES IS NON NETTABLE.THERE WILL BE SALES ORDERS WHICH WILL HAVE PURCHASE ITEMS AND ALSO MANUFATURED ITEMS. THESE ITEMS WILL HAVE TO BE DISPATCHED FROM SPARE PARTS STORES ONLY AFTER COMPLETION OF THE PRODUCTION. WHEN WE RUN MRP, SYSTEM IS NOT GENERATING THE PLANNED PRODUCTION ORDERS.THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT SPARE PARTS STORES IS A NON NETTABLE WAREHOUSE.<br />
COULD U PLEASE SUGGEST HOW TO HANDLE THIS PROCESS ? <br />
IS THERE ANY OTHERWAY OF HANDLING THE DEMAND OF MANUFACTURED ITEMS OF A NON NETTBALE WARE HOUSE IN BAAN ?<br />

You should create a bill of distribution in order to define the replenishment rules, for the items involved, from the main warehouse, where the items are produced/purchased, to the no nettable warehouse. <br />
DRP generates the distribution orders, based on the bill of distribution and taking in account the requirements generated from the sales order lines on no-nettable warehouses, that are the input for the next running of MRP.<br />
<br />
I hope this can help you. Available for any further explanation.<br />
