<br />
I have a problem and could use some advice.<br />
<br />
We have some items that we would like to alter from normal to consumables because we have a trouble with the inventory balance on these often small items. <br />
<br />
The problem with this is that we would like to keep these items with their correct needed quantity on the material list without actually withdrawing this material from the warehouse. <br />
<br />
Can anyone come with a suggestion. My knowledge i BaaN is limited so if you can explain it in a simple way that would be very helpful. We use Baan IVc.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance   <br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
Anlund</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I backflush this material it would still be withdrawn, it will just be later when the production order is reported finished so I still have the problem with the inventory balance or?<br />
