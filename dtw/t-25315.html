<br />
I am trying to run the cost price based on the Market price in LN, but it does not seem to work out.<br />
<br />
I first entered a market price for an item X in the session whina1118m000 and then I approved it. After this I ran the Cost price for the item with option in the second form 'market price' as 'Prices based on Mower Cost or market value' and I choose the 'Last available market price' radio button.<br />
<br />
But still I am unable to get the market price that I entered as the Cost price.<br />
<br />
Also there is no proper help for the 'Market Price' session.<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in my opinion this should work. Is it possible you did not select the &quot;Actualize Standard Cost and Valuation Prices&quot; option in session ticpr2210m000?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
The actualize option was one of the first things that I checked. Still it does not update the price. My requirement is I need to update the FTP with the MAUC so that when I create a new Finished good item code, it should take the MAUC price for the BOM items and not the FTP price for the Cost price as FTP price for raw materials would not reflect the correct cost price.</div></div><hr />
