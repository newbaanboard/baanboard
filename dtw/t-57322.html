Once i generate the outbound advice then no value on the sales order line can be changed. Once the shipment line is created i can find no procedure to take delete it or revert the step. Can u tell me if there is any procedure to revert it back to a stage where the shipment line has not been created.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we can revert back the warehouse activity till the generate picking list. Once the picking list is confirmed, It means the shipment number is generated, <br />
<br />
Now , <br />
1)If only outbond is generated then you can delete the outbond line to revert the allocated inventory.<br />
2) If outbound is confirmed and picking is generated then by removing of picking you can again revert your allocated inventory.<br />
<br />
3) In case picking is confirmed and shipment is generated , In that case you can confirm the shipment with 0 quantity. System automatically revert your staged Inventory to bulk inventory.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this information is useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When your confirm shipment with zero qty, the SO does not let you change the price even then. Is there any way to change the price?<br />

<br />
The particular thread was related to quantity. <br />
<br />
For your query you can use the functionality &quot; Change Price after Shipment/Dispatch&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use the functionality &quot;Change Price after Shipment/Dispatch&quot; ONLY for the Standard Sales order and not fro Sales schedules.</div></div><hr />
