<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swatcat</div><div class="date">23rd September 2002, 10:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to define and implement supplier-wise discount in amount on the purchase order.For example on 1000 dhs of P.O the supplier wants to give me 25 dhs discount.So the P.O should show 1000-25=975 net amt. (I don't want to use the order discount available in percentage.)<br />
I have tried out using &quot;Maintain discounts for supplier&quot;.I defined ranges for amount and discount also in amount.some how it did not work.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pls check out whether u have given any discount in &quot;Maintan Prices by supplier and item&quot; and also in &quot;Maintain Discounts by Supplier and Price Group&quot;. because these two sessions are first and secont priority sequentially and checked up by the system for discount. if any discount is there then &quot; Maintian discounts by supplier&quot; will not be considered.<br />
<br />
What setting u have given in &quot;Grade by qty/amount&quot; field in session &quot;Maintain discount parameter by supplier&quot;?<br />

The exact requirement is order wise discount in amount.So i used the session tdpur0103m000.I entered supplier code,specified the amount range and the discount in amount In  &quot;Maintain discount parameter by supplier&quot;(tdpur0110s000) i have mentioned that 1.Discount by 'Order'<br />
2.Grade by 'Amount.'<br />
I created a purchase order talking the same supplier.After entering two item lines i went to zoom-recalculate purchase price and discount... But still the order amount has not changed and the discount column is empty after printing the purchase order.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have not mentioned any discount in  &quot;Maintan Prices by supplier and item&quot; and also in &quot;Maintain Discounts by Supplier and Price Group&quot;.</div></div><hr />
