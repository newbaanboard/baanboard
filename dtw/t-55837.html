We are using BaanIVb4. Location control is implemented. In one of our business processes, we generate PO for a Sales order line. Now we want the stock received against this PO to be allocateable only to this SO line. How can we do that ? Any work arounds ?<br />

As long as the outbound advice exists, the material is reserved for the specific sales order line.<br />

Thanks for yr post. This is what we are doing currently. Let me xplain the problem in a bit more in details.<br />
<br />
While creating Sales orders, if the given warehouse does not have inventory, we create a Planned purchase order for that SO line. Later we confirm and transfer that Planned PO to an actual PO. Now here, the SO line and the PO line have been linked.<br />
<br />
Now when the material is received against that PO line, the user wants the inventory to be allocated to that particular Sales order from which the PO was generated.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to do this ?<br />
<br />
Hard allocation is such a good functionality. Do you have any idea why they remove it if ILC is implemented ?<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrinceUK</div><div class="date">17th May 2009, 10:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you need to find some documentation on PCS projects.  <br />
<br />
In its simplest form, you set the standard item to &quot;To Order&quot; &quot;lot fo lot&quot;.  Create Sales order.  Run Generate Project Structure for Sales Orders.  This step creates entries for the project (ie order) data in various tables including &quot;Customised Item Data&quot;.  So you have the possibility to make the item to a unique specification for each sales order.  Then Generate PRP Planning.  This generates Planned Purchase and Production orders (which you process as you would Planned orders from MRP).  When you Confirm and Transfer the planned orders the Purchase and Production orders that result all carry the Project Reference.  When you receive goods from these orders, they do not go into standard inventory - they remain within the project, and when you ship the item the inventory is only taken from the project.  So orders for the same item for different projects are isolated from each other and from standard inventory.<br />
<br />
If you have a sales order cancellation, or you want to move inventory ordered for one project to another project, you have to take manual steps to move the inventory.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
