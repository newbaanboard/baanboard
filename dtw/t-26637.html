We have set up picking priorities, and also sequence numbers, per warehouse location. So for example location &quot;A&quot; has priority 996 and sequence 1, whereas location &quot;B&quot; has priority 998 and sequence 2.<br />
<br />
-  This suggests that, provided both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; have stock enough of a certain product, the picking list will suggest &quot;A&quot; as the location from which to take the items.<br />
-  But the problem is that in *many occasions* like the above described, Baan proposes to pick the material from &quot;B&quot;; a typical high location and far away location (that's why is low priority).<br />
<br />
Anyone able to explain what would be causing this? or if there is an alternative solution to priorities and sequences? Note: already tried &quot;bulk&quot; and &quot;picking&quot; profiles, but this is not the case, both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; should be a &quot;picking&quot; location. <br />
Many thanks!</div></div><hr />

Have you looked at your outbound priority in item warehousing data?  This could be why you are seeing a discrepancy on your pick list if you have your outbound priority by LIFO or FIFO.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your post. <br />
<br />
The issuing priority in item warehousing data is a good is a variable that could have an impact, but the point is that we have an outbound priority &quot;by location&quot; for all items. So, if am correct, it should not be the reason in this case.<br />
<br />
Other thoughts?<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
