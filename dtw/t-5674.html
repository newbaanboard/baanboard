I would like to have the same project number in the purchase order position as in the sales order position. <br />

The alternative is to make all the items used in the project customized items. This way the project code is part of the item code.</div></div><hr />

you can enter the project number in the purchase order only if the item is already a customized item. You cannot purchase a standard item with a project number (let aside cost and service items). This is the BaaN customer order decoupling point philosophy at it's best: A standard item (and that's what is dealt with by INV orders, as Flip_J mentioned correctly) may be SOLD for a particular customer (project), but it's PURCHASED anonymously.<br />
<br />
However you could try to do some customizing: When using INV in that way (from a sales order) the purchase order and sales order are linked in the tables ({tdpur041.sorn, tdpur041.spon} -&gt; tdsls041), if I remember right. So it should be easy to display(!) the project of the corresponding sales order position whereever you need it, but keep in mind that it's still an anoymous purcahse order in the end.<br />
