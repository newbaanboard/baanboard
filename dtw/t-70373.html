<br />
We are simulating Sales Schedule in LN 10.5. Here we are facing one problem regarding the &quot;Requirement Type&quot; of the Sales Schedule Line. We have created one Sales Schedule of type &quot;Material Release&quot; Which have 3 Schedule Lines. One has &quot;Requirement Type&quot; as &quot;Immediate&quot;. 2 nd one has &quot;Firm&quot; and 3 rd one is in &quot;Planned&quot;. Now we are able to release first 2 requirement lines for &quot;Warehousing&quot; but &quot;Planned&quot; Lines we can not able to Release for warehousing.<br />
<br />
Now the question is how this &quot;Planned &quot; requirement lines gets change to &quot;Firm&quot; ?<br />
<br />
Is there any session which does this activity or there is any rule which has to set up in such a way that when the Shipment date is nearer (With in FAB Period) it will automatically change to &quot;Firm&quot;?<br />
<br />
If anybody has mapped such kind of scenario please let me know.<br />
<br />
Regard,<br />

:):confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;Planned&quot; Requirement Type Schedule Lines doesn't get converted into &quot;Firm&quot; or &quot;Immediate&quot; automatically.<br />
<br />
A Sales Schedule Line with Requirement Type &quot;Planned&quot; is meant for the forecasting purposes, and apparently not for Delivery/Shipment Purpose. Which means, a supplier can make the necessary arrangements (such as Raw Material Procurement etc) for the Planned Quantities.<br />
<br />
When its time for Actual delivery, a confirmation from the Customer is required in the form of a Shipping Schedule (or) Material Release  - with Customer Requirement Type as &quot;Firm&quot; / &quot;Immediate&quot; in the Sales Release Lines Details Session.<br />
<br />
Once a new schedule revision is generated out of the Sales Release, the quantities are adjusted (executed during the Approval step), and you can go ahead to release the orders to warehousing.<br />
<br />
If you still have questions, do not hesitate to reach me out or PM me on LinkedIn.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your update. Yes for &quot;Material Release&quot; Type sales schedule we can always have a revision and according to the set up (contract/BP-Item data) we are able to have &quot;Requirement Type&quot; &quot;Firm&quot; for the new lines and during &quot;Approval&quot; we are able to adjust previous deliveries as well. This part we have tested and it is working fine.Firm lines can easily release for warehousing. <br />
<br />
But when we have  created a &quot;Shipping Schedule&quot; Type of &quot;Sales Release&quot; we are getting error to convert this into Sales schedule. It seems system is not allowing to generate new schedule or Revision of type &quot;shipping schedule&quot; when one &quot;Material Release&quot; type of sales schedule is already generated for the same item- BP. <br />
<br />
My question is for &quot;Material Release&quot; the new revision is fine but it should be always of &quot; Material Release &quot; type? or we can have &quot;Shipping Schedule&quot; as well for the Item for which we already have one &quot;Material Release&quot; type schedule. If we can have both the is there any chance that demand get doubled ? (as we can not ship &quot;planned &quot;  requirements from &quot;Material Release&quot; and on the other hand we got new demand from Shipping Schedule&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks In Advance,<br />
Sibaji</div></div><hr />

<br />
It all depends on the settings that you've done in &quot;Contract Line Logistic Data&quot; or &quot;Item-Sales-Business Partner Data&quot;.<br />
<br />
You can use both Material Release &amp; Shipping Schedule types...However, make a note that the demand will never get doubled.<br />
<br />
Please share the error message that you're getting while processing the Sales Release Line of type &quot;Shipping Schedule&quot;. <br />
<br />
Also, share your setup from Item-Sales-BP &amp; Contract Line Logistic Data, so it would be easy to analyze the situation.<br />
<br />
You can reach me out on Skype - ( sasikanth.gil ) if you want to discuss more. When we get the answer for all your questions, we can re-post the same in this thread to notify all the members.</div></div><hr />
