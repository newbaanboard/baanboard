<br />
We are using Baan IV C4, we are using EDI Setup for creating Sales Order.  Actually the job gets occasionally . Tried to analyse in various aspects but not able to track the root cause.<br />
<br />
1. Confirmed there is no parallel processing running, session (tcedi7205m000)executed manaully.<br />
2. Confirmed there is no impact from other jobs.<br />
3. Whenever this EDI job hanged, there is no Command.fil file in command directory and the job status noted as &quot;Running &quot; and there are 2 application lock for this job.<br />
4. Usually this job executes 5 mins from baan side , after that command.fil is killed through shell script and other process continues , once the job completes session comes out releasing the job.<br />
5. Job not hanged at one time OR on a particular time OR on a particular day. It hangs occasionaly.<br />
6. Some times even if there is no input file in APPL_TO directory , job get hanged.<br />
7. Same Baan and Unix setup made in development server, and tried to schedule the job with same input file as in Production Server , In development server it never hangs .<br />
8. There is no Script /Table difference between Production and Development Environment.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest what may be the root cause . How to resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I am assuming this is an Inbound EDI netwrok, since the mention of 'appl_to' folder. So the Inbound EDI network will look for clearing the command.fil file by the external process at the right time. I would recommend to check your external process throughly. Somehow your network is looking for an action in the commad directory, even if you are finding there is no 'Command.fil' file.<br />

<br />
I never seen any issue in Network OR Input Data , when the job hangs there is no command.fil.  (command.fil is removed by shell script). 90% whenever the job hangs i am able to view the Application lock for 2 EDI session and one Trace file in Trace directory with 92 bytes .  Some times i am able to view the applicaiton lock ,the header ID is noted with Process ID no,  but the Header ID description is noted as ***********, <br />
We are not able to track what will be exact issue.<br />
<br />
Same time there is no NETWORK error / Server Issue /other interface issue / Manual Intervention etc.<br />
