You should be able to customise this easily to get what you need. <br />
<br />
You need to have lot control on for the items to be recalled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have not got my point. Simply i have a Production Batch having e.g. 100 MT inventory of particular item. Out of this inventory i have dispatched this item partially to some customers by generating the outbond invoice and sales deliverires. Now, from one customer i received a complaint in that perticular item.  Now, how i can find that to whom the item of that particular production batch was supplied.<br />
<br />
pls. understand and let me know the solution.</div></div><hr />
