<br />
We are facing the problem related to the Cost of the Product. When we want to confirm the shipment line, the error message appeared &quot; cost of Good Sold can not be determined. <br />
<br />
I want to know, which table have the data of &quot;cost of Good sold&quot;. We face this type of Problem in Shipment lines and some other receipt lines. <br />
<br />
Please suggest me how can I correct this problem. The error screen shot is attached, for your reference.<br />
<br />

<br />
this could be a problem with the date of the order. If the order intake date is before the date of calculation the cost of good sold then you get this message. <br />
<br />
1. Check the date of the order<br />
2. Re-caculate the cost of good sold for this item with a date that is before the date of the order.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
I check the costing data of that item, it's costing date is prior the date of Sales order.<br />
<br />
e.g. Costing date is 13-06-2008 and order date is 16-03-2009. And this shipment is partly confirmed. ( Sales Order Qty is 1000, we shipped and invoiced 600 pcs, Now, we want  to process the balance quantity.<br />
<br />
We release and Advice, the Outbound Line. But when we confirm the shipment line. The error message occured of Cost of Good Sold.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

I am agreed with Dieter,<br />
Please check the BOM materials costing date,<br />
<br />
and also please drill down your checking criteria.... in your case check backward detail.  e.g.<br />
<br />
Item code which you are going to sell.<br />
Lot qty which you are going to sell.<br />
Production order no. from which this lot qty generated<br />
and in the same production order check the estimated material.<br />
and check the Estimated material Cost price calculation date.<br />
<br />
I am damn sure that estimated item is not as per Bill Of Material. so check estimated item and its date. than u will definitely find the exact item which have cost price calculation is after sales order date.<br />
:cool:<br />
Thanks<br />
