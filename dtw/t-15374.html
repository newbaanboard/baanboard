<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jbilas</div><div class="date">17th May 2004, 23:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Two questions:<br />
<br />
1. Is the WM module of Baan really a full warehouse management system or just a subset of such.  I get the impression that there is no facility for pick, pack, ship,etc.  A I correct?<br />
<br />
2. Are there any published API's available for Baan, especially to tie into a WMS?  If so, where can I find them.<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Here's some more:<br />
<br />
SSA is currently working on a standard interface between Baan IV (and V etc) and their aquired WM-system EXE (Exceed acquisition from Sept. 2003).<br />
<br />
Perhaps something to check.<br />

<br />
Warehouse design recommendations, based on physical and demand product characteristics, is one of the next big things in WMS.<br />
<br />
I looked into Baan/WMS combinations several years ago and was surprised to find that the choices were limited if not non-existent.</div></div><hr />
