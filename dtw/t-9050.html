<br />
I am using ivc4 and not much conversant with c3.  We generate nearly 1500-2000 purchase orders everymonth and this was the same problem we faced, since every purchase order has to be closed manually.<br />
<br />
We are running baan with sql7/nt.  I have written an utility in VB, which connects the backend tables and removes all back orders. If you are also using the same platforms like me, then I can mail u the exe file.  It's running quite well with us and we have been using it for the last 4-5 months.  <br />
<br />
Note : In case you have not recd. any qty against an order line, no backorder for that line will be maintained and also, my utility will delete the order line.  Here also, there's no harm, since the history of the purchase order is kept seperately<br />
<br />
Your query was :<br />

<br />
If you too want to do the same make sure you set the backorder qty to 0 in tdpur041 and tdpur045.<br />
<br />
Also you have to set Planned quantity field in tdinv150 to 0.<br />
<br />
Note: We have a nightly job which Rebuilds Planned inventory Transaction.<br />
