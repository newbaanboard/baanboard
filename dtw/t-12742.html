<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bertram</div><div class="date">27th August 2003, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - I have implemented external EDI a few years ago.<br />
Now we get a sister company and I have to setup internal EDI.<br />
<br />
I have made the settings in a demo purchasing company and it works fine, the file ORDEROUT was written to the file system.<br />
<br />
Afterwards I made the corresponding settings in another demo company as a sales company.<br />
<br />
My problem is now, when I start the direct network communication nothing happens.<br />
The program starts, the windows of the sub-sessions appear and close, but the file isn´t processed and no report is generated.<br />
<br />
Are there any logs where I can see what´s wrong?<br />
Or can I trace the process in any way?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you checked the Message Data, Pls check the incoming and Outgoing messages whether the outgoing message was generated  by the system or not. <br />
<br />
Internal EDI set up works, when Purchase &amp; Sales companies are on the same server.<br />
<br />

<br />
I've found the solution !<br />
It was realy simple.<br />
I had to rename the file ORDEROUT to ORDERIN, then the reading was no problem.<br />
I have an EDI-Documentation with about 260 pages, but that usefull information isn't mentioned there.</div></div><hr />
