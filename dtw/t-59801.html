<br />
I am trying to create a Purchase Order for a item, i am getting the Error &quot;Enter Price Unit Field&quot;. The Purchase Price Unit is maintained in Item Purchase data as PKT. But still its not defaulting in Purchase order for this item. <br />
<br />
History of this item is , initially the unit was PCS,  and then later changed to PKT. Now we have 2 records in Price Book for this item , 1) with PCS and 2 ) with PKT. But currently the one with PKT is valid based on effective date and expiry date. <br />
<br />
Is there any thing else which i need to do here to have the default Price Unit in Purchase order lines for this item. <br />
<br />
Thanks much for your response. <br />

Check the Purchase Unit &amp; Inventory Unit of that item, if these units are change maintain the conversion factor b/w these units &amp; Purchase Price Unit.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your response. I resolved this issue. My inventory Units are same. The issue was i had two inventory Units in the Pricebook for the same item, where both were valid on the present date. I expired my old Inventory Unit record in Price book and now its getting defaulting correctly in the Purchase order. I am not sure whether this is the right way of doing it. But it worked for me for the time being. <br />
