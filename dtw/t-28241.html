In the session tdrpl0120m000 (backorders fiatteren) I can only approve the backorders. I cannot remove them, nor can I set them to 0. (One could wonder about the use of this session!)<br />
<br />
The only way I found to clean up these backorders is to actually appove them, print the picking list and then delete them in the maintain deliveries program(tdrpl0114m000). This is quite cumbersome as procedure. Has anyone found a better way of doing this?<br />
<br />
Is there a parameter that prevents the creation of backorders in the first place?</div></div><hr />

You can set the backorder qty. to zero in tdrpl0114m000 while entering the delivered qty. The easiest and fastest way in my opinion :) .<br />
A parameter that prevents the creation of backorders is not available, sorry :( .<br />

<br />
Unfortunately the delivery is done via barcode scanners and the people wielding them don't know whether everything has been delivered. When they constituted a truckload they release the outbound (we use ILC) and print the packing list. It is then too late to modify the backorder qty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">28th September 2006, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I still agree with Martin - we support a bar coding system.  At the point of entry of the delivered quantity, this transaction should also allow the backorder quantity.  In our system, if you do not want back orders, you can fix this to 0 all the time, and backorders are not created.  Reporting can fill gaps as needed.<br />
So, look to that barcoding transaction - is it written in house?  Or 3rd party?  Either way, they should support the entry of a back order quantity at that point, and allow automatic set to 0....?<br />
Also, make sure you ALWAYS want no back orders, and if not, evaluate exactly when.  You can always modify that delivery process to set as needed...</div></div><hr />
