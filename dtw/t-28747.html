<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vineetu1</div><div class="date">23rd November 2006, 06:18</div></div><div class="posttext">In the current Business senario, we are doing Trans-shipments. Example:<br />
<br />
We have a central warehouse called CWH. We have other regional warehouses for e.g. DWH, JWH..etc all over the country.<br />
<br />
Depending on the requirement at regional warehouses, material is replineshed from central warhouse. For this we create Replineshment orders to do stock transfer. <br />
<br />
DWH warehouse does far more business as compared to JWH warehouse. Hence the quantity of goods to be replineshed is much greater (anywhere from 3 to 10 times more) than that of JWH. At the same time the total quantity required at JWH to be replineshed is quite less (not even a truck load).<br />
<br />
Hence, for such senario, the goods for JWH are first despatched to DWH (RPL Order is created from CWH warehouse to DWH warehouse). Once DWH receives it, after a span of 1-2 days they would create a stock transfer invoice and transfer the goods to JWH (Here again a RPL Order is created from DWH to JWH).<br />
<br />
The issue here is, how to track this Inventory specially meant for JWH at various stages ?<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : The goods transferred from CWH to DWH -&gt; Here the goods should be considered as in-transit for JWH and not DWH.<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : Goods received at DWH -&gt; Here the goods should not be considered as Inventory of DWH but as in-transit for JWH.<br />
<br />
Stage 3 : Goods despatched from DWH for JWH -&gt; Here the goods remain in transit for JWH.<br />
<br />
Need to know how to handle this situation in Baan.</div></div><hr />
