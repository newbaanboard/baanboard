Is there any possibility to create a sales order having a date in the future ?<br />
For example I want to create a sales order this month but having the order date for the next month (field tdsls040.odat)<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

Hi Bogdan,<br />
<br />
You can do this in LN FP3 as long as you have not added any Line Items to the Sales Order. In the Sales Order Lines (tdsls4100m900) session, select Sales Order Details (tdsls4100m000) from the toolbar and then you can change the Sales Order Date.<br />
<br />
Some people call it a Future Order.<br />

<br />
First I forgot to mention that we still use BaaN IVc4.<br />
<br />
Well I admit it is unusual, but that's the request from my managers; I can not comment it (I know all the theory about saying No but in this case it's not applicable :o )<br />
<br />
The ideea is that we have a report about the registred sales orders and a monthly limit for the sales orders amount; in case we have few sales orders more than that limit we should record them in the next month; ofcourse we can not put the client in hold so in fact the baan operation is done on actual date. Modifying the sales order date was an option ; the other is to modify the report and to put some data in orders refference fields so we can exclude those orders from reporting, but the most elegant way was to be possible to postpone the order, I guess</div></div><hr />

The planned delivery and receipt dates also have to be in the future, but you can maintain the delivery as of today.  You do get a soft warning on the delivery that the delivery date is before the order date.<br />
