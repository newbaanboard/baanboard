<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frigyesg</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Why PRP should do that? Standard components remains standard, even if the BOM is customized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milsykor</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">One of our user claims that PRP run should do this. Maybe there is customization of PRP run but the whole script tipcs5201 is too big to find out the code which changes IC Mark in customized BOM. They have installed SP12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">croezen</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 13:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Check de session tipcf5260m000 ( or tipcf5280m000 )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">croezen</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry wasn't finished ;<br />
<br />
If the standard item has the orderpolicy on order, it will create a customized item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milsykor</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">There is only customized item without order policy which was'nt derived from standard item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">croezen</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry but I am missing something here !?<br />
<br />
You have a customized item with standard items in the BOM and you wish to get customized items in the BOM ?<br />
<br />
Please define your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milsykor</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we have one manufactured item within project and there are several purchased standard items in BOM with IC mark &quot;Standard item&quot; which should be changed to &quot;Customized Item&quot; after PRP run. <br />
After PRP run some of these purchase items have IC mark Customized and some left without any change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
In standard BAAN the PRP run by itself will not create customized items in the BOM.<br />
If the Order Policy of the item is &quot;To Order&quot; the system will make the item customized as part of the BOM but this is usually done before the PRP run is executed.<br />
<br />
If in your case the PRP does create customized items you are dealing with a customization on your system.<br />
Please check the VRC of session tipcs5201m000 with ttstpsessinfo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mervcarr</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">You are probably thinking of the session &quot;Generate Project structure from sales order&quot; (tipcs2240s000) which can be reached (among other places) by taking the zoom option from the sales ordr lines. This WILL convert &quot;to order&quot; items to customised items. The is some slick functionality in the session regarding phantom items also. Read the help text though and I'm sure things will be much clearer.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milsykor</div><div class="date">21st August 2003, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">The script tipcs5201 has been customized but there is no documentation. Anyway PRP run has confusing behavior. <br />
When I try PRP run on test project with one manufactured item (phantom=Yes) Baan changes all item involved in BOM from standard to customized and net quantity (tipcs022.qana) is set to 0 !.<br />
 I dont know how to figure out what happens and solve it ASAP just because of huge script pcs5201 and related functions.<br />
If I do not define manufactured item on the project as Phantom=No nothing will happen in BOM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">21st August 2003, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, who did this customization for you?<br />
Must have been one of those typical companies: after the work was done they vanished and left no documentation behind.<br />
<br />
If I were you try to find out who in your company was involved in defining this customization, discuss the issues with this person and modify the code so it does what you want it to do.<br />
This time you should prepare proper documentation.<br />
<br />
