<br />
For instance, a buyer creates a purchase order (not a planned purchase order from EP) to fulfill a requirement for a specific sales order. There is no linkage (or pegging) within Baan to tell someone else that this purchase order is specifically intended for that sales order.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know if anyone has developed business practices to fill this information need?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">13th August 2004, 07:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Though we r on Baan IV , we had seen a demo on Baan V from Baan. And therein I remember having seen the link between purchase order and sales orders in table sales order (tdsls041) .Don't remember abt  tdpur041 (which exist in Baan IV). <br />
<br />
Workaround though inefficient one is to look in sales order lines (tdsls041) for the specific purchase order if there is no sales order field in tdpur041.</div></div><hr />

as far as I understand your question, To link a purchase order to sales order you have to, first generate purchase advice from sales control tdsls4240m000<br />
<br />
if this purchase advice is confirmed and transfered to purchase order you can see the link in purchase order lines tdpur4501m000 and from specific &quot;Link order- line data&quot;...<br />
<br />
You can see the link for individual lines not for the order because you might have transfered the purchase advice into existing purchase order.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
Note: I am using Baan 5.0c</div></div><hr />

<br />
Purchase advice is part of SIC order method, not MPS/MRP, right? Then if you want to use this method, MPS/MRP for the top level item concerned won't work<br />

<br />
I'm working on Baan LN.<br />
<br />
My issue is almost the same but from the other side.. where I can find relation between production order/purchase order or purchase order to production order (or SFC group). Can you give me the code of the table/s where the data is take from to show pegging relations? <br />
