Now we would like to stop using it.  How can we switch off the location system ?  Has anyone already performed this and what is your experience ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">7th May 2002, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no possibility to switch off ILC again one it has been implemented. The only way to do this is by writing scripts which will fill fthe INV module tables from the ILC tables. An analysis on your specific sitiation and your way of using ILC has to be done beforehand. This is a larger project in any way.<br />
<br />
Why do you want to switch it off again? Perhaps you can just switch off using ILC for the warehouses you are using? Then there will be no inbound procedure at least. (You still will have to do the outbounding, however - but with using jobs you can turn down the manual effort here too.)<br />

I have a document that starts out &quot;This document is to be used as a reference guide only ;  it is not recommended that ILC be turned off once it has been implemented unless the situation is extreme&quot;<br />
<br />
It does contain detailed instructions, but is quite old.  Maybe a good idea to try in a test system.  <br />
<br />
I only have a hard copy - if you send a fax number (thru the Baanboard email to lbencic) I will fax to you.</div></div><hr />

Or, leave the parameter set to yes, just don't create the locations before reentering the inventory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have followed this procedure in our TEST ENVIRONMENT, but only on a limit number of items and only for one warehouse using ILC.</div></div><hr />
