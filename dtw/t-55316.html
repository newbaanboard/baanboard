<br />
We have a problem with raising purchase orders for some of our materials.  We have to order large numbers of different sizes of materials on each purchase order, but these sizes can change by mm, so setting up standard items really isn’t viable.  Generic items lend themselves to this but it seems you can’t use a Generic item in Purchase Ordering in baan 5c.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else come across this issue and how did you get round it?<br />
<br />
We thought about raising a sales order to generate configured items and then use the 'Generate Purchase Order from Sales Order' to copy in to a purchase order but we are having problems getting this session working with standard items, it keeps coming up ‘Purchase order not generated’ and no further error to help us get it working, does anybody have an ideas on this?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help anybody can offer.<br />

   Though this may not be an outright solution to your problem, have you considered using Projects/Customized items options instead of using generic type items for your non-standard materials?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SandraP</div><div class="date">16th March 2009, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Ultimately that’s what I want to use customised items.<br />
<br />
I tried doing it through projects and product variants but it was too cumbersome for the end user.  I found I could create product variants but then generating the project structure had to be done individually for each item, and we could have up to 100 items per order. <br />
<br />
And then you would have to enter each one on a purchase order.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

But then the inventory is tied to the project. Is your environment is make to order. If, so project can be used. Again, instead of creating a standard item. sytem would create customized item in project. <br />
Besides, creating projects adds additonal transactions and it does make process cumbersome, esp if the user are not used. I think the other option could be to create on generic item and use lot control to keep track of differnt sizes. But you would need to see if it will make sense in other areas like planning production order etc.. But this should avoid creation of multiple items and you can attach different attribute to a lot code.<br />

<br />
I will look in to using LOT numbers, not sure it will work for us but I will test and see.<br />

Thanks,<br />
