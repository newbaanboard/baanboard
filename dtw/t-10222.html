Was wondering if anybody could help.<br />
<br />
I need to take an order from our quotation system that all the sales guys/gals use and import it into Baan.<br />
<br />
I had read that this was possible using the EDI, but was unsure what formats Baan uses and if it was at all possible.<br />
<br />
Anybody got any ideas ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Wayne</div></div><hr />

As we only did the proof of concept I can not give any advice on how to do this.<br />
<br />
For further reading, look at the BaaN document U7041C US.  This gives details on how to set EDI up and how the module creates and reads the BaaN flat files.<br />
<br />
BaaN document U7296A also gives details on how to configure EDI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please fill in your version info etc, we are using EDI to get orders from our SFA application (non BaaN) into BaaN IVc4 using X12 Sales Order Standard. We transfer 20 to 30 Sales Orders everyday using EDI.<br />
<br />
With reference to BaaN IVc4<br />
<br />
Basic idea will be to generate ASCII text file of the Orders based on EDI standards from your qoutation app, transfer if to BaaN server, run EDI to pick this file and convert to Sales Orders.<br />
<br />
Tell me if you need session sequence etc.<br />
<br />

PS : You could also explore using AFS to do the needful, search the board for more info on AFS.</div></div><hr />

The best and easiest would be using EDI. you can use any of the available conversion setups - X12, EDIFACT. We use the one for E-Enterprise, since it is very simple. <br />
In principle, you put an ASCII file in a directory, run a session and you have a sales order.<br />
just download the defaults.edi from the Baan support site and read the manual for installing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As informed you earlier, the person doing this should have the knowledge of EDI processing in BaaN to start with.<br />
<br />
The quotation data has to be mapped to Sales Orders EDI files structure. You can get a better idea on the of Sales Order EDI file structure, if you generate a Purchase Order EDI message and go through that EDI file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible to program a script (even without development tools) to read files and insert orders in Baan. This way you don't have to use the EDi module if you don't want to. (EDI is a bit complex)<br />
<br />
If you wan t to know more, then sent me an e-mail through the board.<br />
