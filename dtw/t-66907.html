<br />
Moving forward, my team will have 1 financial company with 2 logistic company.<br />
Logistic data which required by all will be share<br />
example : Business Partner, Tax , Employee Data <br />
<br />
Logistic A and Logistic B has different business concept but some item can be share if the situation is need to .<br />
Example , logistic A has out of stock for Sealant , Logistic B will loan to logistic A via warehouse transfer . Once Stock receipt at Logistic A, they will transfer to Logistic B  and vice versa.<br />
<br />
my question :<br />

<br />
