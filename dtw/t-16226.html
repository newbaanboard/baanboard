Recently sales statistics was corrupted due to interruption during system do the normal update. I have got the instruction from my consultant to run the full update to correct it. Somehow, there was an error message prompted (see attached file). Did anyone of you see this message before and how can I solve the sales statistics problem? My steps to do the full update are:<br />
1. Release all application locks.<br />
2. Posting all outstanding invoices.<br />
3. Process delivered sales orders.<br />
4. Deactivate all sort codes.<br />
5. RUN tdsst0201m000 in single user mode. Full Update=Checked, Actual Customer Data=Uncheck. Finally, press Continue.<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

Sometimes running a long-waiting session will trigger this problem.</div></div><hr />
