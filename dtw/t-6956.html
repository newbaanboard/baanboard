<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Eden</div><div class="date">1st October 2002, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an ongoing problem in that some purchase orders get stuck at the &quot;Print Goods Received Note&quot; step. No matter what we do, we can print the note, but the status of the line stays at &quot;Print GRN&quot; We have to go into the tables to change in the procedure mask. Has anyone else come across this problem? What was the solution? I have posted a case with Baan, but as usual they are very vague.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">1st October 2002, 20:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you change the steps of the order type of those purchase orders? In that case the procedure mask in tdpur041 would not be in align what the software expects, and that could produce such errors...<br />
Just a guess..<br />

No, we did not change order types. Baan gave us a patch, but we had to remove as it gave too many other errors. Who would have thought???  LOL  Still trying to work through this problem, but it is too inconsistent to narrow down the problem. Anyone else has anything, it would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Eden</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 19:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, the problem is very intermittent, so not sure how creating a new order type would identify the problem. Thanks for the thought though.<br />
