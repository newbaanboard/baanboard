<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David_Booth</div><div class="date">2nd June 2004, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Some customers require a Certificate of Conformity or Declaration of Conformance document with deliveries.   A shipment can comprise several items, of which a subset may require CoC/DoC documentation. <br />
<br />
I cannot locate a function in Baan IVc4 Distribution that prints such a document, either at the same time as a Packing Slip or as a separate session.<br />
<br />
We aren't using Baan Transportation at this time so I'm unaware if this functionality is maybe performed in there.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have experience of generating these documents from Baan?  Thanks in advance for any information.</div></div><hr />

We discussed this with many of our customers so that we got almost all of them to agree to the same text. We also have this translated into the languages relevant to our customer base.</div></div><hr />

etc. would be to make / store your own CoC in any format (scanned) and program in Baan and or third party software ( like Streamserve) to trigger<br />
the print out along with pack slips.<br />
the stored file of course needs to have unique identifier name relating to your item data ( or whatever criteria).</div></div><hr />
