Handling rejected inventory is parameter driven and if you dont want to maintain inventory for the rejected items you can remove this option. It is not possible to maintain rejected inventory but should not be reflected in Inventory on hand.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. The reason why we don't want to include the rejected inventory in the inventory on hand is because it's still factored in the economic stock. Please refer to the example below:<br />
<br />
Inventory of Item AAA<br />
On Hand = 100 pcs<br />
Blocked = 10 pcs<br />
Allocated = 50 pcs<br />
Economic Stock = 50 pcs<br />
<br />
If you see this, you might think that you still have an available inventory of 50 that you can allocate to other order. But the truth is you only have 40 left because 10 of it was rejected. The economic stock should be 40 not 50.<br />
<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply,<br />

<br />
I meant the same in my previous update. If you want to maintain rejected inventory it will always be included in inventory on hand and will reflect in economic stock. <br />
<br />
The only option to remove it from inventory on hand is to remove the parameter. But in that case you will not have the history of rejected inventory transactions whether they were returned / reaccepted / destroyed.</div></div><hr />
