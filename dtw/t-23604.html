<br />
Baan Vc<br />
<br />
Our valuation method is MAUC.<br />
<br />
By mistake the stock which was entered in the system through cycle counting was made at zero cost price.<br />
As a result the MAUC also became zero. This mistake was realized after the stock was entered and now we wish to correct the MAUC. Is there any way we can correct the MAUC?<br />
<br />
Any help would be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MAUC will be updated every time there's inbound transaction. If it's purchase receipt, then MAUC will be updated with purchase price. Otherwise, standard price will be used (which itself can be average, last purchase price, current purchase price, or simulated price; depending on how you set it)<br />
Hence, correcting MAUC is indeed hard and you'll find that sometimes you have to resort to using dummy PO to achieve this. It's not really that neat, but we have limited choice. The high data fidelity that ERP systems like BaanERP require can be good, but also tedious to correct, I guess<br />

<br />
Thanks a heap. You have indeed solved my problem in seconds.<br />
<br />
Thanks Paul. Your idea of dummy PO seems the most feasible in the absence of the session mentioned by BlueBoy.</div></div><hr />
