<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenkR</div><div class="date">23rd August 2009, 22:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
after looking on LN6.1 FP3, I found out that ERP supports communication with WMS WM4000 (or with custom WMS, session *whwmd2105m000*).<br />
After defining interface parameters, I believe that some exchange table should exists (or folder or something?). Am I right on that?<br />
<br />
Does any detailed specification on this interfaces exist and if, where can I find it?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
There is only some pre-wiring available for the WMS integration. It is assuming a BDE based integration. There is no specification on the interface because there is no official WMS integration released.<br />
  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenkR</div><div class="date">24th August 2009, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">As I can read, WM4000 can be coupled to this interface out of the box. So there should be some data available to exchange between both (LN &amp; WM4000). <br />
Are there any special exchange tables for inter-application communication or WM4000 get data directly by coupling to original document tables (purchase orders/lines, shop orders, customer orders/lines)?<br />
Best regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">24th August 2009, 09:52</div></div><div class="posttext">The prewiring is indeed based upon the WM4000 application. But the integration itself is never released, so there is nothing out of the box.<br />
Based upon the warehouse order, data is exchanged via BDE from and to the WMS application. You will need BDE subscriptions in session tlbct5500m000.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenkR</div><div class="date">24th August 2009, 10:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I am new here. What is BDE and what is used for? Where can I get additional information about it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">24th August 2009, 11:25</div></div><div class="posttext">BDEs are XML documents representing Business Objects, like a Purchase order.<br />
BDEs are developed/customized with help of the IntegrationStudio. You must be able to find more info on that product in the help or on the support site. This will give you a good starting point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenkR</div><div class="date">25th August 2009, 12:46</div></div><div class="posttext">And Integration studio is part of Infor LN? So if I understand correcty, there is also a path sending back data (received goods, produced goods) using BDEs inside integration studio?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">25th August 2009, 14:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Integration Studio is an Infor product. The BDEs you need for a WMS integration do exist. But it is not an released integration. All the parts are there but probably need some customizations for the specific WMS needs, depending on which WMS application you are deploying.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenkR</div><div class="date">26th August 2009, 08:34</div></div><div class="posttext">So if I understand correctly, Integration studio is a part of either OpenWorld or OpenSOA? After that, I further need to contact Infor representative, to get BDEs as a part of an installation (for free as a part of a LN?)?<br />
What sort of customization is needed there? Are you thinking of a plain configuration (e.g. setting default properties, enable/disable properties, etc.) or is there some *programming* work to be done?<br />
<br />
What I need is:<br />
- goods receivable (purchase orders)<br />
- transfer items between warehouses<br />
- adding produced items to ShopOrder<br />
- fulfill customer orders *picklist* (where items qty can be changed, in some special cases, also additional item can be added)<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">26th August 2009, 11:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi please contact an Infor representive for more info on Integration Studio. The BDE's are part of the LN installation (see session ttadv7500m000).<br />
<br />
Whether your needs do match standard functionality in the BDEs can only be concluded when requirements are specified on field level. If not then programming is needed.<br />
<br />
