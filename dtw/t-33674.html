<br />
As I am doing Financial Year End first time so i wants to clear some doubts<br />
<br />
1) If i wants to change the current series for Purchase order,Production Order, sales,Replenishment order through session maintain Free numbers(tcmcs0147m000) then is it necessary to close all active Purch./ production /sales / Replenishment orders for current year<br />
<br />
2) and run the PDSO- Process Delivers sales orders and PDPO- Process<br />
deliverd purchase order<br />
<br />
and pls guide if anything is missing from my side for distribution and logistics<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Umesh</div></div><hr />

  Isnt it a bit late to be closing the last fiscal year..<br />
Anyways..<br />
Tell me why would you want to change the First Free numbers for the new fiscal Year? What one would normally do is to change the Financial Document Number (Maintain Last Used Document Nos By Transaction Type Series {tfgld0114m000}) for any new fiscal year and make this change in the Maintain Transaction Types {tfgld0111m000} session(Default series field). Usually the document nos indicate which year its made for..It could change from site to site...<br />
<br />
Its only important to close all orders pertaining to last year or the year you are trying to close. Closing of the current year orders would only help in pushing your distribution and manufacturing values to finance. Wont help in closing the previous year.<br />
 <br />
From your second doubt, its clear what i said earlier(about document nos) was right. Process delivered sales orders and received purchase orders has nothing to do with First Free numbers but has a lot to do with Last used Document Nos. You should process any orders(be it sales or purchase) pertaining to the last fiscal year before you can even attempt to close the year...As far as Distribution is concerned, you should have your purchase, sales, replenishment and warehouse orders(if any) of last year processed and, if Integration is on for all, Posted to Finance. <br />
Then you make sure there are no unposted batches or any integration errors pertaining to the above transactions in Finance..<br />
This is what i could think of from a distribution point of view...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...<br />

for important information<br />
<br />
As i processed PDSO and PDPO  and still for some orders (PO/Sales) the line<br />
status is as maintain recipts, print GRN, and for Sales - maintain Deliveries<br />
so is it needs to clear or we can get that orders carry forward to next fiscal<br />
year?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">3rd April 2007, 14:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Are these lines actually(i.e physically) delivered and received? If they are and those responsible for the entries forgot to do it, then obviously you would have to deliver and receive and then invoice, process and post these entries. However, if these lines are yet to be delivered or received in real then you could either carry forward these to the next year by not doing anything on these lines or by closing the order and inserting a new order based on the back orders. <br />
All of this has to be done from a cost perspective and not from a system perspective. The system(by which i mean baan and year-closing process) doesnt care if you receive or deliver the orders that you have actually received and delivered. But from a financial point of view you would want your accounts in good shape before the auditors come in for the kill...<br />
