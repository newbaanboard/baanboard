<br />
In general Inventory on hold is also included in Inventory on hand. We have not implemented ILC. Is it possible to separate Inventory on Hold from Inv.on hand till the Maintain Approval session. <br />
<br />
Here we are facing problems with the finance team, as they say that without a finance transaction how can inventory get updated. The moment we maintain Receipt the Inv.on hand is updated. <br />
Is it possible to separate these two ie., inventory on Hand &amp; Hold, till the finance transaction like Maintain Purchase is completed. Can anyone suggest the best way of coming out of this problem.<br />
Mainly this is effecting the costing part. Please give me the answer on that line.<br />

In the session 'Locations' under Warehousing Master Data, you have to define at least one location of type 'receiving' for the warehouse that is associated with your purchase item.<br />
<br />
srkallam,<br />
<br />
Inventory on Hold is allocated but not yet committed. Therefore there is no financial (or physical) transaction by placing inventory on hold.<br />
Your problem seems mostly semantic. Look at placing inventory on hold as labeling it for a future transaction. There is no cost associated with it (yet).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I fully agree with you. But in some of the cases we don't receive the supplier invoices with the material. But the Material is accepted and consumed. Maybe after 10 days we receive the Supp.Invoice. Does this effect the Weight Average Cost(WAR) because we are accepting the delayed supplier bill.<br />
<br />
Secondly how can you get the valuation of only accepted material, when Inv.on hand includes inv.on hold.<br />

If you have the documents on the entries passed to finance while maintaining  a receipt &amp; approving the material, please forward that to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">27th August 2002, 09:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure about the vendor rating part, but it shouldn't matter when you receive an invoice, as long as you receive the goods with a bill of shipping.<br />
Wether a vendor decides to invoice you for its delivery is strictly their business. In my experience most of them do.<br />
<br />
As soon as you receive the goods in your warehouse, they will be valued against whatever valuation method you have selected.<br />
Not only does this make sense, you now own the goods, so they are valuable to you, you want them to be in the books at this time if only to collect insurance should the warhouse burn down.<br />
<br />
I believe (not sure) that there is no way to actually distinguish between on hold, and available inventory and I don't understand the requirement to do so. It is fairly easy though to do the math.<br />
If I have $500 worth of item A and I have 400 on hold and 600 available, it is obvious that the value of my on hold inventory is $200, right? ( 400/(400+600) * $500 ) or ( on hold/(total inv) * value).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sudhakar:<br />
<br />
If I understand your terminology, the inventory on Hold that you are concerned about is inventory received (delivered) against a PO line where the receipt has not yet been approved. Accepted material would be inventory that has been received and approved.<br />
<br />
If a PO line does not require inspection, the full delivered qty is approved upon receipt and there is no held inventory. So the only concern is goods that require inspection that have been received but not yet approved in Maintain Approvals.<br />
<br />
I agree totally with Francesco that the received inventory has value that should be recognized in the ledger. That is how Baan functions. The receipt in Maintain Receipts generates integration transactions: a Purchase/Receipt and (if applicable) a Purchase/Result. The Purchase/Receipt creates ledger inventory. <br />
<br />
If the line item requires inspection, then Maintain Approvals generates two additional sets of transactions. The first is a reversal of the original entries: negative amounts as Purchase/Receipt and Purchase/Result for the entire received qty. The second is a Purchase/Receipt and Purchase/Result for the approved qty. The value of the rejected qty simply disappears from the ledger after approval, regardless of what is done physically with the rejected goods.<br />
<br />
Because the Transaction Origin (Purchase), Financial Transaction (Receipt), warehouse and cost price components are the same for all of these transactions, the integrations post to the same ledger accounts and you cant identify the Accepted value or the Hold (awaiting approval) value from the ledger itself.<br />
 <br />
If the Finance team wants to identify the value of Accepted inventory included in the On Hand inventory, you will need to calculate the value of inventory on Hold (not yet approved) and subtract it from inventory on hand. You will need to write a report or query as I not aware of any standard report that gives that information.<br />
<br />
The simplest option is probably to value inventory on hold at a high level as Francesco suggests.<br />
<br />
Another option would be to work from the receipts table (tdpur045). I think that if you select receipt lines that have Delivered qty &gt; 0, Approved Qty = 0 and Rejected Qty = 0, then extend Delivered Qty by the Std Cost (also from tdpur045), you should have a reliable calculation of inventory on hold. <br />
<br />
If ILC is implemented, you could instead produce a report of inventory on hand in your various inspection locations and extend it by std cost (or Lot price if LTC and Lot Pricing is applicable).<br />
<br />
If finance says that it also needs to know what ledger accounts the held inventory posted into, the calculation will be considerably more cumbersome and beyond the scope of a simple query because it will be necessary to use the standard cost from ticpr300 and evaluate the integration mappings in tdinv850 for a Purchase/Receipt in combination with FSG, Warehouse, Item, Item Group and Cost Price Component. Frankly, I cannot think of a business requirement compelling enough to justify the effort.<br />

<br />
If you have defined a receipt and inspection location for the warehouse in question have you also specifies the receipt location in tcmcs0103m000 maintain warehouses?<br />

<br />
Please stay on topic within threads. This thread was originaly related to receipt location issues, but now has references to other inventoy issues. Please start a new thread for off topic questions. As well as helping our users search the board correctly you will be more likely to receive answers to your questions if the threads are clear and seperate.<br />
<br />
Thankyou<br />
