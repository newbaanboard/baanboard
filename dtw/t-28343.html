There is a SO Held Reason named item signal code. But how does system know which item should be blocked for this reason. <br />
First I though in Item base data session, If signal code is maintained, then a connect in established. But when I check this, I found no signal code is maintained here. So I am confused where to connect the item with blocking. <br />
Could someone help to explain it to me? Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

Thx for your kindly help.<br />
Sometimes, we want SO to be blocked becuase of credit limit or other reasons. So we have blocking reason catagores such as credit limit, general or others.Also we need to define the step as of block in SO order type. The question is how BAAN blocks SO using deffrent reasons. It means how the system knows when it needs to block SO.<br />
I think for credit limit the parameters set in BP can help system block SO. But for general catagory, if I create a reason named item signal code, It's difficult for me to understand.<br />
Could u kindly help me? Thanks a lot!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darpan</div><div class="date">9th October 2006, 17:29</div></div><div class="posttext">There is nothing like BP actually it goes and refers to the Sales Order Type , it also checks the Function tdsls0020 in which may be it checks for the customer's credit limit from table &quot;tcmcs011&quot; which it compares from table &quot;tdind017&quot; for that particular Customer<br />
(tccom010.cnpa,tccom010.buor, tccom010.buin,tccom010.crlr, tdsls040.cblc) Everything Rotates Around These figures<br />
<br />
If any one shares a source code for this Function &quot;tdsls0020&quot; u will get the exact answer for your question<br />
<br />
Hope it Helps <br />

<br />
By signal code you mean you are defining a 'Block Reason' called Item Signal and this has nothing to do with the Signal Code in item base data. Correct me if my understanding is wrong. And this item signal code you are attaching to one of the Block Reason Category. If this is correct then the answer to your query is that you attach these block reasons to various block/hold reasons in Sales Parameter session and from there the system picks the default block/hold reason and updates it in your sales order.</div></div><hr />

BTW, if I want all SO blocked, how to set the parameters?</div></div><hr />
