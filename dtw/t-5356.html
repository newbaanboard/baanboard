The records where generated with session calculate rebates for orderlines with records where no agreement is defined for. The session only deletes the records with status closed, but it can never get that status.</div></div><hr />

<br />
those records can not be deleted with standard sessions. Are you sure that no agreement was found? When no agreement is found normally the records are simply not calculated so the status remains FREE.<br />
But nothing is impossible within the CMS module in Baan. We also faced some severe problems during rebate calculation due to errors in the session. Perhaps you take a look at this thread:<br />

Sometimes it's very tricky to figure out what's going wrong during the calculation (depends on the paramter you are running). Be sure to install the latest solutions. Maybe the only solution to clear up the tables is GMT. Good luck!<br />
