<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ashishj</div><div class="date">20th November 2013, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, We have multiple supplier invoices for one PO line item. We noticed if we create multiple receipt as per supplier invoices at a time and wants to confirm all receipt one by one, Once we are confirmed first receipt ,system doesn't allow to confirm other receipts.<br />
System says &quot;final receipt of the PO is already made and can not confirm any other receipt line for this PO line item&quot;.It means, we can not create all 5 receipts at a time and go for confirm operation one by one !!!<br />
<br />
Also noticed, final receipt check come by default at each receipt line.<br />
<br />
There are some limitations as well , like we can not create one receipt for single PO line item with multiple supplier invoices.i.e. if PO line quantity is 100 and we received material partially.We have received 5 supplier invoices with each 20 quantity. I couldn't create one receipt with 5 receipt lines as per received supplier invoices so, accordingly i could have separate excise document.  <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Try this:-<br />
<br />
Create a PO with say Quantity 50. Now, Create a receipt line with 20. In the receipt line, click new And select the PO and make quantity 20. Now, again create a new line in receipt and attache the PO with quantity 10.<br />
<br />
Now, you will have 3 lines for the receipt. But, as you said, you will see a default check box for the first line.<br />
<br />
Try to confirm the receipt from Header, it will automatically check the Final check box for 3rd line. And will confirm all the receipt lines at once. This is how it works on LN. I am not sure about your version.</div></div><hr />
