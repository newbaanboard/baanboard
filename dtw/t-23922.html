<br />
Could anyone tell that Is there any correction program available to correct &quot;Inventory on hand&quot; of various tables (like tiitm001, tdinv001 etc) based on tdinv700 in Baan IV?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can run tdinv0250m000 (Rebuild Planned Inventory Transaction).<br />
<br />
I think that will solve your problem</div></div><hr />

<br />
kumaresan_r: If the number of records to be corrected are few, I would recommend that you get the stores persons in charge to do Inventory Adjustments as necessary. If you have to repair the ENTIRE Item Data (and all related tables), you will have to write your own program to do that.<br />
<br />
Take care.</div></div><hr />

tdsls0252m000 should solve your problem.<br />

<br />
I do not find this session &quot;tdsls0252m000&quot; in Baan IV. Should it be tdinv0252m000 ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 11:38</div></div><div class="posttext">You are correct, it should be tdinv0252m000. <br />
<br />
Sorry again,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kumaresan_r</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 11:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.   I simulated with this session and observed that it is correcting table tiitm001 based on tdinv001, but not based on tdinv700.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 12:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, I never looked into the source of this session. Basicly tdinv0250m000 and tdinv0252m000 are the two &quot;official&quot; sessions for error correction in the tdinv tables. They should solve all tdinv related problems. Is there a certain reason why you want a rebuild based on tdinv700?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kumaresan_r</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 13:59</div></div><div class="posttext">In our system,  frequently, there are few items showing wrong &quot;stock on hand&quot; in Item data (tiitm001) and warehouse inventory by item (tdinv001) whereas inventory transactios by items (tdinv700) are showing correct.  I am correcting table manually and feeling bore/risk.   That is the reason, I am looking for any official correction program.   Now, we are thinking to write a correction program in-house to our requirement.  If you have any other idea, pls. share.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">3rd May 2005, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;official&quot; sessions were not able solve your problem? This is rather surprising to me. In our environment we are facing this problem once or twice a year. This is acceptable for us, as we have @ 500000 records in tdinv700 every month. The sessions I mentioned do solve the problem completely.<br />
<br />
What exactly does &quot;frequently&quot; in your case mean? Once a day, week or month. Any clue what might be the reason for this?<br />
I wouldn't feel comfortable with a manual table correction either, but frankly is an inhouse correction program much better? I don't think so - basicly it's the same only a little more sophisticated.<br />
