<br />
Because it is a legal requirement we sometimes need to issue packing slips for material that will not require an invoice. Example: Moving our own Tool from one location to an off-site warehouse.<br />
<br />
We are using hand-written forms for this but we would like to have an exact packing slip form from Baan (maybe by using a cost item with text). <br />
<br />
The requirement is that it doesn't end up with an invoice.<br />
Is this possible our we have to develop our own thing?<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you mean picking list? That will not solve our problem as we will have open sales orders. If not can you please tell me the session number you're mentioning?</div></div><hr />

But the inventory still remains with the company.<br />
In such a case you can use Replenishment orders and print a RPL packing slip. <br />
<br />
The other alternative is to have a zero value sales order to a one time customer and follow the normal sales cycle in which you can print the packing slip. Even though you invoice it will be of zero value and have no impact on your AR.</div></div><hr />
