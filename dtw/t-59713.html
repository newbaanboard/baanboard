We're working (start to work) in ERP-ln (service pack 3)<br />
We use different warehouses and send shipments from those different warehouses into one truck to one customer ordered as one sales order. We would like print one pickingslip.<br />
My knowledge is that as soon as goods are picked and put on the staging location, as shipment is created (and a packingslip). Since we use differnt warehouses (and different picklists and staging locations), different shipments are created. How can I combine those different shipments into one and generate one packingslip...</div></div><hr />
