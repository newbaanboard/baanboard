<br />
This is the error we receive when we try to enter an order from a customer belonging to country A and the delivery address is in country B.<br />
<br />
Is this Baan functionality?  If so, what is the work-around for this type of situation?<br />
<br />
We are in Baan4C2 (in mid upgrade to Baan4C4).<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input!</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you need more than one delivery adress per sales order?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">30th July 2002, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that I'm aware of.  All of the sales orders our order processing department showed me had the same delivery address.  It just happened to be a different country than that of the sales order's customer's address.<br />
<br />
For example, we have an American customer located in the state of Kentucky, that we sell to.  The quote was entered to that customer.  When we copy that quotation into a sales order and put a delivery address code for a Mexican address, the error pops up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in case of only delivery adress per order, you should use the delivery adress in the header, then there is no problem ( ... in BaanIVc4, I don't know for c2). The field is on the first form of the header, and has priority to the country field on the second form. <br />
<br />
Bye, Juli</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">31st July 2002, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">You are not allowed to change the delivery country of an order after you entered positions. The reason is that Baan stores the delivery country of the order also in the positions. You cannot see that data field in &quot;Maintain order positions&quot;, but it's there. That field has to match with the order country all the time. You are not allowed to have a single order to be delivered into two different countries, because of the way Baan handles the VAT during invoicing.<br />
<br />
The only way of changing the country (either by delivery adress or by country field) is by deleting the positions, changing the country in the order and re-entering the positions. However, this is only possible as long as there is no delivery made for the order.<br />
