don't know Baan IV, but on 5.0c there's a field Standard description on PO-lines (tdpur401.sdsc). When this field is not checked then only the PO-Line-Text is printed. Maybe there's a similar field in Baan IV.<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
 Thanks for ur suggestion...<br />
I did checked the table tdpur041 (PO Lines). There is a field of standard descriptrion where the value is Yes..<br />
Now the problem is the printed purchase invoice did allocate space to print the description but nothing displayed out...<br />
If i change the standard description from Yes to No, then the allocate space will be deleted and followed by other info..<br />
<br />
Pls advise....<br />
Your idea and suggestion is very much appreciated...<br />
Thanks<br />
