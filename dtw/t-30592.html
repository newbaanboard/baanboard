<br />
Anyone can help?<br />

&quot;Activate Warehousing Orders (whinh2203m000)<br />
Use this session to activate warehousing orders with the Planned status. To activate orders, select a range of planned warehousing orders by means of the fields in the Selection Range group box and click Activate. To inactivate orders, select a range of planned warehousing orders by means of the fields in the Selection Range group box and click Deactivate.&quot; There is an online manual topic on the Planned status. Just a tiny part: &quot;The Planned status is meant for order data entry, you cannot process planned warehousing orders.&quot;<br />
So basically you have an option when you want to start working on the orders. This to avoid that while saving an orderline it would already be considered for execution while in fact you want to carry on with order lines.</div></div><hr />
