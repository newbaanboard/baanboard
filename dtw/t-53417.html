We receive orders through EDI and there are multiple orders in one 850S file. I had some questions/doubts in my mind on how the things supposed to work.<br />
<br />
If one of the order in that file fails, will all the other orders will remain unprocessed in 'Messages to Be Received' session?<br />
<br />
What I am observing is that if an order from a file kicks out, Baan still creates all other orders successfully but in the 'Messages to be Received' batch, all the orders that were successfully created are also there. Is it normal?<br />
<br />
Do you guys can point me to any documentation that explains in more detail how these things work and what is the significance of different fields (PO, Message reference number etc) in this whole processing?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Only the order that got error will be found in the 'Messages to be Received' session.<br />

<br />
No, Its not normal. As mentioned above, only error order files should be present here. If the message  reference is same for all the order files, then there is a possibility of getting saved all the files even if one order got error out.<br />

<br />
You can find the information on the EDI messages in the Baan EDI user document. The message reference should be unique for each order file. Generally the PO number will be mapped to it to make in unique.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">22nd August 2008, 19:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the replies and here is the result of my test using the attached file.<br />
<br />
The order file had five orders. One of the order (1151398E) had an error and all other were ok. Baan created all other four orders successfully but still the batch in the &quot;Messages to Be Received&quot; session had all the five orders. I fixed the error, approved and processed it. It created the kicked out order successfully and gave the reference already exist for all other orders (as they were still there in that Batch although they were created successfully first time around)<br />
<br />
My understanding was also that only the kicked out order should be there in the Batch but as Chandra mentioned, as all the orders in the file had the same message reference number, it still put all of them there. In this case my expectations were that it will not create order for any of the orders in the Batch but actually it did.<br />
<br />
If guess if we make message reference number unique for each order, it will solve this behavior.</div></div><hr />
