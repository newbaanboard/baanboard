<br />
I would like to ask some questions about session whina1210m000 Perform Inventory Valuation By Warehouse And Item. We use BaaN ERP ver. 50c.<br />
<br />
1. Any body knows what for this session actually ? I mean, what is the main purpose of this session ?<br />
<br />
2. Everytime we run this session, we often get different value from each running result. We don't know which one is the right value. Why the amount can be varied ?<br />
<br />
3. We try to compare the amount we got from running this session with amount in Trial Balance, it is different too. Why ?<br />
<br />
4. Did we make mistakes on using this session ? <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for every answers.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<br />
The main purpose of the session is to compare the logistic inv balance to finance gl value.  <br />
2. Everytime we run this session, we often get different value from each running result. We don't know which one is the right value. Why the amount can be varied ?<br />
I think you are running the session when users are working in logistic. Reason may be due to back dating transactions or you might be using moving average value as inventory valuation method. <br />
<br />
3. We try to compare the amount we got from running this session with amount in Trial Balance, it is different too. Why ?<br />
<br />
 Possible reason are <br />
1) back dated transaction in logistic 2) Integration setting might be wrong 3) You might have not have posted the integration transaction and finalized the batch<br />
<br />
The best way to compare the logistic with finance is by running this report during the midnight as a job and post and finalize all the integration(I assume that you are not using real time posting). Then run the TB in the morning.<br />
<br />
4.Did we make mistakes on using this session ? <br />
<br />
If you have resolved the points that i have mentioned in point number 3 then you might get a realistic comparision. <br />
<br />
When i was in one of the client site i fighted with BaaN to provide me a reconciliation session to do the reconciliation between logistic and finance. After a long strugle they have given a reconciliation session (I don't remember in which SP they have included), but it's a crap. If they don't know how to write the reconciliation program they should have consulted some one. <br />
<br />
If you need any help let me know</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the answers. But, i would like to ask more questions. Hope you don't mind :)<br />
<br />
1. On your answers before you wrote &quot;Integration setting&quot;. Do you mean the integration mapping scheme ?<br />
<br />
2. As we have checked, there are no back dated transactions or not finalized transactions on our system. Whenever we print the TB for a certain period, we always get the same value. But whenever we print the perform inventory valuation, we often get different values even for the same period.<br />
Do you know why ?<br />
<br />
3. How to block a back dated transaction ? Especially for sales issue, purchase receipt, sales return and purchase return ?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any answers.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Marsel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lakmisoftware</div><div class="date">8th September 2005, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Answers to ur questions<br />
<br />
1. Yes, i asked you to check the Integration mapping scheme<br />
<br />
2. I know what you are doing. example let us assume today is July 5th<br />
<br />
-- You are running the inventory valuation report today with the inventory date as end of june 30th. Then you are trying to compare it with the TB for the month end of June. It will not tally. <br />
<br />
Example, today i am receiving a material and entering the receipt date as june 30. This receipt inventory will be shown in the inventory report for the june 30th, but it will post to GL in the july month with today date. Since you have closed the june period. Then basically your GL and Logistic don't tally.<br />
<br />
-- To resolve this what i told in my earlier reply is run the inventory valuation report today midnight (July 6th) as a job and get the inventory value. Then run another job to post the integration transaction at the same time. Next day morning (july 6th) when you are in the office just compare the inventory value report and GL value. If your integration settings are correct then it should tally with minor diff. If the diff is more do this step for a couple of days and do the analysis.<br />
<br />
3. User training or if you have a source you can do a customization to allow back dated transaction or not. Similar to SAP ERP standard. I created a design and implemented it in one of the site and it works like a charm. (Please don't post reply for asking me the design)</div></div><hr />
