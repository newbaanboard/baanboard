<br />
We are facing problem while taking receipt against a subcontracted order. Stocks for some items are not getting updated . If there are four items in the order and a receipt is taken for that particular subcontractor  then it might that stock will not update for one of the item. <br />
<br />
We have checked the routing for this subcontractor also. Pl help to diagnosis the problem. <br />

If the type is &quot;Subcontracting&quot; then there wont be any stock updation. The receipt of this item will only help in completing the subcontracting task of the production order that raised this subcontracting purchase order...<br />

If you're subcontracting some other operation(s) of the production order, then receiving wouldn't increase any stock, it will just increase the WIP value of the production order<br />
