<br />
Order Types allow you to set up different scenarios regarding various sales process cycles that may exist in your corporation's standard operating procedures.  Each type must have a definition of how this cycle is to be completed.  There are 3 main sessions that must be run: Maintain Deliveries, Print Invoices and Process Delivered Sales Orders.<br />
<br />
The mandatory sessions are to allow the system to properly track inventory, bill the customer to maintain finance functions and to complete the order cycle.<br />
<br />
Frequently, companies will require the &quot;Print Picking List&quot; session as well to indicate to &quot;order picking staff&quot; the contents of the order.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

    Your explanation is crystal clear. I would also like to know if I don't include a step in my specific order type, does that mean that I will not be able to execute that particular step with that order type.<br />
    Pliz xplain if possible using purchase example.<br />

Thanking U in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Purchase Orders are similar to Sales Orders in that there are certain required steps to complete the purchasing cycle (depending on the order type).  A typical PO type may include:<br />
<br />
*Print Purchase Order<br />
*Maintain Receipts<br />
*Process Delivery Purchase Orders<br />
<br />
When each step in a PO is completed according to the &quot;Order Type&quot;, certain flags are set in the PO header.  These flags indicate which steps are &quot;allowed&quot; to be executed for the order type.  What this means is that your system has been handed a &quot;script&quot; on how to complete the order and will follow that script to the end.  As an example, if a purchase order type does not include the &quot;Print Claims&quot; step, you will not be able to print claims against a purchase order.<br />
<br />
The reasoning for this (I imagine) is that there are some things companies purchase that do not require certain steps to be completed.  For example, if you are ordering hand soap for your maintenance department, you probably do not need to print a &quot;goods received note&quot; since it is a straight-forward order of a standard supply (either it arrives or it doesn't).  If on the other hand, you are receiving components of a controlled item (such as chemicals, firearms etc...) the supplier would most likely require a &quot;goods received note&quot; so they are &quot;off the hook&quot; for any liability claims.<br />
<br />
In summary, each order type indicates a set of procedures that need to be followed for certain circumstances.  Each of these scenarios should be mapped out for the organization to create an associated PO type that will allow that scenario to be properly handled.  If a step is missing from the PO type, it will not (and in most cases cannot) be performed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 19:15</div></div><div class="posttext">There is one step in the sales order procedure and one in the purchase order procedure that you may do even if it is not in the required steps.  These are print order acknowledgement and print purchase order.  If these are in the order type then the MUST be completed.  If they are not in the order type then they MAY be printed.  In order to print these you must be sure that the field &quot;Order Line Types to Print&quot; is set to &quot;All Lines&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">2nd February 2005, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Be also aware of step maintain Approvals in case of PO:<br />
<br />
When you tend to execute Quality Control steps for groups of items, this step is required. On order line level you can decide to do or to don't.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanguyz</div><div class="date">10th February 2005, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">To the replies of all, I would like to add certain things to the same that when a material is transacted and any type of excise invoice is to be made and printed, it can be done in the system, even if these are not defined in the order steps.<br />
<br />
eg. in Purchase even if the material is rejected the rejection after inspection invoice can be printed from Process Excise Invoice - Purchase entering the necessary inputs.<br />
<br />
If anyone can put light on that, it is heghly appreciable.<br />

In purchase (B40c4) if you do not add the step &quot;goods receipt note&quot; to the order type, you CANNOT print a &quot;goods receipt note&quot; for that order.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you,<br />
