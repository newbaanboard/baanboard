<br />
I'm facing a problem where I have no clue what I could do. I want to use a kind of order increment in the sales orders. We have the problem, that some item are ordered from the customer and sold and invoiced f.e. in sqm. But the packeging is a multiplier of this (f.e. 8).<br />
<br />
What I want to do now, is create an increment that allows you only to enter a sales order with a multiple value of this increment. In the above case for ex. you could only enter 8, 16, 24 .... but not any other value. <br />
<br />
All I know is, that you could configure an order increment in the ordering data, but this only applies to pur and sfc orders, right? Is there a standard way to set this up?<br />
<br />
What we allready did, that we have an alternative unit for this with a conversion factor. This could work, but does not satisfy my customer service poeople, so they always then need to calculate manually the orderd qty on the customers fax or email into our unit. This is just to timeconsuming.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />
