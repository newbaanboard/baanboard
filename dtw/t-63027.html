My problem is like this, we are into retail and so each of our Purcahse orders would easily touch the maximum limit of 999 lines.  I am new here and new to BAAN as well and my IT colleague tells me that the only way to close a partially received PO is by deleting the back order lines one by one.  I am sure there must be an easier way to close the PO by simply modifying the status of the PO or something so that all partially received / fully open lines under that particular PO are treated as cancelled and they no longer appear as back order?<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

But this needs to be dione one by one unless you write custom program.If the practice is npot ever ot receive the back order then while maintaing the receiptone can make the backorder quantity zero. <br />
