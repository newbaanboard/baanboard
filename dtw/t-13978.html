My questions are:<br />
<br />
1 - How do I specify an individual in the approval process? After I have defined the individual in the approver list session, I can only specify this individual as an approver while creating the requisition, meaning that I cannot submit the requisition to an an individual to approve if there is a previous approver for that requisition (either individual or department) because the next approver field in the purchase-requisition approval session (tdpur2106s000) is dimmed<br />
<br />
2 - How do I grant the authority to approve a requisition to a particular user or group? It is ok to specify that a certain department is responsible for authorizing a requisition but how can I ensure that only users in this department are allowed to approve the requisition. I can allow only specific users to access the session, but how can I ensure that only perople in this department can approve the requisition when it is their turn to approve?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - You have to entry field next department first in session tdpur2106s000, then field next approver will be active.<br />
<br />
2 - To block certain user to access certain data which is not allowed, you can use table field data authorization session in Tools Module, so that one user must have one role.<br />
