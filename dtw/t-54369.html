<br />
Sometimes, whenever my user enters item code in sales order and try to save the sales order, user gets the error message &quot;Economic stock already present for the item&quot; and afterwards it does not allow to save.<br />
<br />
While checking Item data, the economic stock is not present in standard item data, but when we check Maintain Item data by container, in some of the containers it shows Inventory on hand as 100 and then Economic stock 100. We tried correcting above through GTM. We are able to correct the data through GTM for standard item but not for container. We also tried to do inventory adjustment in order to remove economic stock. But in vain. The problem still persists.<br />
<br />
Would please anybody suggest a permanent solution for such type of problem as our work is repeatedly get stuck due to above errors.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and regards...<br />
