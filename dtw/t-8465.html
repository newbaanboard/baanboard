<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsnaresh</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently, we have been noticing item lines are missing (getting deleted) from tdpur045 table. Basically, purchase order lines table (pur041) has lines but there won't be any corresponding lines in pur045 table. So when you go to display PO line status, you find find that particular PO. This is  happening randomly.<br />
<br />
We have implemented Maintain Receipts via DDC using baan standard function server. I am wondering if this FS has any bugs that deletes the tdpur045 table records randomly. <br />
<br />
Also any other reasons that it would cause this.<br />
<br />
We have not applied any patches recently. To my knowledge no NON-Baan process is doing this.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can try auditing that table, so all changes including your deletions are logged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsnaresh</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I am planning to do that (auditing). On further investigation, it seems this is happening since the day we have implemented the DDC for maintain receipts. It may be just coincidence but to me it looks more like that is the culprit. Is anyone implemented DDC for maintain receipts and having/had same problems.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
