So maintain a blank tax code for CAN and TWN with singular tax button checked. Then maintain single tax structure for the blank tax code with 0 tax rate. Then check maintaining a new sales order.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">altfplak</div><div class="date">11th October 2006, 10:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all!<br />
<br />
Since Baan V it is possible to set up a useful tax-handling via tcmcs0538m000 Tax Handling:<br />
General rule: the tax country in each SO-line/PO-line/financial transaction should be the country were your company is obliged to pay VAT; so if you are located in CN, then tax country should always be CN.<br />
You can obtain this, via setting the tax flag on invoice-to and invoice-from role obligatory to YES (tccom112.cvyn/tccom122.cvyn) and link the &quot;normal&quot; tax code in your item-purchase-/item-Sales data.<br />
For (special) import and export in other countries you need then to define the tax codes in tcmcs0538m000, and if you are located in EU countries, then you need also to define tax coes for ICTS and ICTP.<br />
<br />
In such a situation no longer a foreign tax country would apply, nor VAT code BLANK. What's more, the above described functionality limits your VAT codes to several instead of having a BLANK one for each country, were you are delivering to.<br />
<br />
Since this functionality should not have been changed in ERP LN it should work.<br />
<br />
P.S.: When you want to delete a BLANK tax-code (which was not used in any transaction!), you need first to delete the 0 % tax percentage - this was, what the error message was saying (rate exists for tax code); for a BLANK tax code the 0%  tax percentage is always created automatically!<br />

<br />
If I read the error message correctly, it says that blank tax code is not defined for tax country &quot; &quot;.  The message mentions no country code.  Check if there is a country code linked to your item/sales order line.</div></div><hr />
