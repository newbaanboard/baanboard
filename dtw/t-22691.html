<br />
Just refer to this link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=22666) for a piece of advice in case you are not experiences with the set-up of new Baan environments.<br />

<br />
Good luck!<br />

I'm confused. Just after posting you the link to the other thread, I see that YOU are the one who posted this other thread. You were adviced not to play around with it alone, and then you announced that you are contacting Baan for it. What happened from there till now? Why do you post a new thread now with a similar question? <br />
