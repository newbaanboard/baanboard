<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">4th June 2002, 11:25</div></div><div class="posttext">It is the same issue as all INV / ILC+LTC tables.<br />
<br />
From the meta point of view, the INV looks at warehouses as being black boxes. Anything happening on the detailed level of locations / lots / storage units / storage dates / project is irrelevant to INV and is not stored in the INV tables.<br />
<br />
I usually explain it with the umbrella model. Anything that is under the umbrella is not seen from the other end. Above view (INV) only sees a black spot, underneath (ILC/LTC) you can see the detailed view.<br />
<br />
In your particular case, you will need to concentrate on ilc301 as well and also inv700 for the helicopter view. Details you need, can only be seen in the ilc/ltc tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manusatsangi</div><div class="date">5th June 2002, 11:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Even if tdilc301 tables are populated with details of all location transactions, still there would be some problems.<br />
tdilc301 table does not contain the field &quot;inventory uptill now&quot; for a location, whereas in table tdinv700 it contains field &quot;inventory uptill now&quot; for the concerned warehouse.<br />
Because of non-availability of such a field in tdilc301, one cannot directly calculate the opening stock of an item in a location for a specified back dated period. <br />
For that, one has to browse all the transactions and sum up individual inventory transactions.<br />
The nature of table tdilc301 is that it's size grows at a fast rate. Hence, the query to calculate opening balance would become slower day by day. In another thread, someone had mentioned that for him a query on table tdilc301 was taking 6 hours to complete.<br />
Moreover, this also poses restriction on delete/archiving of tdilc301 records.<br />
One solution I can think of is to create another table (which would be similar to tdilc101 (Inventory Data by Location &amp; Lot) + &quot;Backup date&quot; (which will be part of the pk) and copy data from tdilc101 into this new table on a weekly basis (or as required).<br />
Now, opening balances can be calculated after running a query on this new table and tdilc301.<br />
<br />
Hope I am sounding sense :) <br />

Warm Regards<br />
