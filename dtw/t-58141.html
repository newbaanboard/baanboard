<br />
A PO contains multiple(eg: 4 receipts) receipts upon the single sequence, in 2nd and the 3rd receipts some quantities are rejected. If we raise a return PO a single line is copied with the cumulative qty of 2nd and 3rd receipts. The copied order line in return contains receipt field which takes the 4th receipt of the original PO(which is the final receipt) by default. We are unable trace the two receipts in which the qty is rejected from the return PO. We are using ERP Ln 6.1.<br />
<br />
Suggest the way to trace the rejected receipts from the return PO in which the total qty has been cumulated.<br />

<br />
To Track the Rejected Inventory during Purchase Warehouse Inspection, u need to activate the option &quot;Handle Rejected Goods&quot; in Inventory Handeling Parameter (whinh0100m000). After doing this u'll be able to track your inventory through the session Rejected Inventory (whwmd2570m000).<br />
<br />
Second thing, This inventory can only be return by using &quot;Return Reject Purchase Order&quot;.<br />
