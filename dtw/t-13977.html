Generating the cycle counting order for some warehouses performing very bad where in other warehouses it is very good<br />

I did what you told me and it is certainly had an effect<br />
but I found another problem <br />
one of the locations has been defined as fixed location <br />
even thou I don't have any items associated with this location, cycle count order is generated for all items for this particular location alone with a zero quantity<br />
this is slowing down my process <br />
<br />
do you have any suggestion to solve this <br />
Appreciate your help<br />
<br />

Solve it by not using fixed locations :(</div></div><hr />
