<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">29th May 2002, 19:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a Tools person, but we have a request from one of our users that wants to know if there is a way to do the following:<br />
<br />
Our purchasing department will enter a PO in the system and submit the PO to a supplier.  The supplier will reply back that we must order through a distributor.  The purchasing agent must then delete all lines of the PO, then they can change the supplier number (to the distributor) and re-enter the order lines.  Is there a way to simply change the supplier number?<br />
<br />
We are in Baan IVc2 (soon to be IVc4).<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help or ideas...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">29th May 2002, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Try copying the original PO to a new one, changing the supplier ID to the Distributor. Then delete the old PO.<br />
<br />
That way you are using standard Baan functionality and won't have to worry about maintaining referential integrity, accurate supplier totals, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vavs123</div><div class="date">29th May 2002, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure if the functionality exists in 4c2 but in 4c4 there is a functionality called purchase inquiries.  You can send the supplier a purchase inquiry (similar to a rfq) then convert and change as needed.  It is an extra step but you don't use as many po numbers and you can do this for the suppliers who are sending you to distributors. <br />
<br />
Hope this is helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scott2001</div><div class="date">29th May 2002, 23:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought about suggesting purchase inquiries because that would also let you change the supplier before finalizing the PO. (Purchase Inquiries are available in IVc2.)<br />
<br />
However, Purchase Inquiries are best suited to a bidding process(request for quotes, evaluate responses, award PO). If this situation is not a part of a bidding process (or if it arises after the bidding process is complete), you may just be adding an artificial layer of Baan procedures to your activities. Still worth looking at the functionality, though. <br />
