got a problem that i cannot explain what the system did.<br />
An order was invoiced with a quantity of 28 and a price of 998.9 but the amount invoiced is 99890<br />
<br />
a quantity of 100 was ordered, a back order of 72 was generated when they did the maintain deliveries (since they delivered 28).<br />
Looks like the system took the quantity ordered instead of delivered.<br />
<br />
did anybody saw that in their system?<br />
i have no clue on how it did this, tried a few scenarios but was never able to reproduce the error.<br />
<br />
any ideas?<br />
<br />
PB</div></div><hr />
