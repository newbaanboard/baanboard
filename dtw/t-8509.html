I have a question about the default location when moving items from one warehouse to another.  The &quot;to&quot; warehouse being location controlled.    I would assume that it would place the inventory in the Receiving location.<br />
<br />
But when I leave the &quot;to&quot; location blank (on the order) and select a warehouse order type that has no receiving activities (only maintain &amp; release outbound), the goods are placed in another location in the &quot;to whse&quot;.  I have no idea how Baan selects the location, but it is not the receiving location.<br />
<br />
Is there somewhere in Baan I can set this up?  I checked the warehouse and location sessions, but didn't see anything.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance, mike</div></div><hr />

What version are you using?</div></div><hr />

This means Baan in your case will put the stock in the highest priority location for the item.  The higest being fixed location by item I think. You can set inbound priority by location but this is not by item. You can use storage conditions as well.</div></div><hr />

There is currently no data set up in Dock Locations by Whse, Item &amp; Partner (whwmd2120m000) or  Fixed Locations by Item (whwmd3502m000).  But I can use those sessions to set the inbound priority.<br />
<br />
My guess is that since there was no inbound priority set up, Baan decided to put the inventory in the first Bulk/Receiving Location alphabetically.</div></div><hr />

Can someone confirm this for this installation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hexagenia</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 21:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Reldif is correct.  <br />
<br />
It has been a while but I believe if not specified elsewhere, Baan will put the inventory in the first Bulk/Receiving Location alphabetically.</div></div><hr />
