<br />
In Baan IV DRP, we have DRP Period type set to &quot;Day&quot; in DRP Periods. Now in session trdrp0101m000 - Maintain Sales Forecast by Warehouse and Item when we insert a period, it automatically displays end and start date of that period. In our case as the period type is day it is the same date.<br />
<br />
My question is, how it is translating a period number (day in our case) to its end and start date? Is there a table where you define this relation or there is a dll or function which has this logic? How does it calculate the start and end of period which could be a date, day or week.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we are missing the program script of this session and cant' fingure out how it is doing that. Any help in this regard will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
