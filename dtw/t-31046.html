<br />
we just found a strange thing in Baan 5c standard:<br />
<br />
We just change one field in purchase order line, let's say tdpur401.rdta and save that. If we now check tdpur351 (purchase order lines history) we found there an additional record. <br />
But why did Baan add a record in the history of contracts, if nothing is changed concerning a contract? I think tdpur401.rdta has nothing to with the purchase contract, so that the changeing of that field shouldn't result in a new record in tdpur351.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know, what the sense for that behaviour is?</div></div><hr />
