Can i proceed like that ?<br />

- Product Type: Decorative<br />

What do you think of that kind of organization ?<br />

<br />
I am not clear about the quantum of your items. But if they are many and very only due to colour, you may also try with unit effectivity. Its a good Concept.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
For us the problem concern the packaging material.<br />
<br />
What do you think of this option to manage the packaging ?<br />
<br />
Sometimes for one BOM we have 5 different packaging material.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I would have to say that is a very good structure, you have used exactly the same fileds we have, so I can't say anything different, can I?<br />
<br />
Seriously, Product Type will be Manufactured or Purchased - within those Product Types you need your Item Groups (ie a Purchased or Manufactured Item Group) the others are fine<br />
<br />
The most value comes from the Item Group Defaults, which save huge amounts of time (and improves accuracy) when setting up new items</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David Eagar</div><div class="date">13th November 2007, 22:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I think with this structure you will not be getting the most out of Item Groups. Instead of having 1 Manufactured Item Group, you should have one each for <br />
- Decorative <br />
- Functional<br />
- Desk Lamp<br />
<br />
If you have a combination of Manufactured &amp; Purchased, you will need an Item Group for each, ie<br />
<br />
- Decorative (M) and - Decorative (P)</div></div><hr />

I would use the Product Class field for these, thus within the Item Group &quot;Functional&quot; each item can be assigned the appropriate Product Class</div></div><hr />

<br />
To summarized.<br />
<br />
Could you tell me what do you advice to input for my company, in the <br />
<br />
Grouping Data:<br />
<br />
Product Type:<br />
<br />
Product Class:<br />
<br />
Product Line:<br />
<br />
Manufacturer:<br />
<br />
Selection code:<br />
<br />
Commodity Code:<br />
<br />
Thanks for your great help !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Navin Tenani</div><div class="date">16th November 2007, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Certainly u can always use Item Grouping Data. But you can also use Item Classification (GRT) and classify your products in such a way that they are always easy to search.<br />
<br />
Basically I am referring to your Item Codification Schema..<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Navin Tenani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flysurfing</div><div class="date">17th November 2007, 08:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Navin for your answer.<br />
<br />
May i know what do you refer by GRT ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Navin Tenani</div><div class="date">17th November 2007, 10:29</div></div><div class="posttext">In Manufacturing there is a module called Product Classification. You can define your item codification scheme there in terms of Families and features and then generate item codes from that schema...<br />
<br />
Its a very good functionality of Baan, but used by very few.<br />
<br />
You can try it out. <br />
Also whats your Name...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">David Eagar</div><div class="date">17th November 2007, 11:19</div></div><div class="posttext">The Families (and especially Family Planning) could be much improved by being able to construct Families of Item groups, rather than item by item:<br />
It does have some very good features however</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flysurfing</div><div class="date">20th November 2007, 07:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks David, Navin.<br />
<br />
We will try as well the GRT !<br />
