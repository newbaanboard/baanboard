<br />
we are on Baan IVc4 and are using PUR-contracts.<br />
The setup should be done very carefully because some things as general parameters and settings in the contracts itself can not be changed after they had been used once.<br />
The greatest disadvantage we experienced is that the Effective and Expiry Date of Special Contracts can not be modified once a purchase order is linked to the contract.<br />
<br />

<br />
Can U please explain what does expiry date do in purchase contract. <br />
<br />
Can we receive the material against a purchase order even if it is expired as per purchase contract expiry date linked to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the order date in your PUR-order should match the range between effective- and expiry date of the contract. If not, no contract is linked to the orderline. Be careful when recalculating price and discounts for the PUR-order when the expiry date is reached. This may unlink the contract from the orderline.<br />
<br />
As a kind of workaround (when the expiry date is reached), you can &quot;backdate&quot; the order date of the PUR-order(line) to access the expired contract. This is not very convinient to my opinion.<br />
<br />
Once the contract is linked to an orderline, you can recieve items against the contract, even if it's expired.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Martin</div></div><hr />
