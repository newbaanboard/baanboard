<br />
We want to use the direct delivery. Does anybody have a documentation for this topic?<br />
<br />
We created the order type for direct delivery purchase orders. When trying to create an order type for Direct Delivery Sales, the direct delivery field can not be accessed? It can't be changed to &quot;Yes&quot;.  Why? <br />
<br />
What are the steps needed for setting Direct Delivery? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please advise...THANK YOU :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
it`s a long time ago I worked with direct delivery feature in BaanIV.<br />
But if I remember correctly the setup is as follows:<br />
<br />
In the order types the field direct delivery is only available for the order type &quot;Purchase&quot;, so you only have to create a purchase order type for the direct delivery.<br />
In the sales order parameters (session tdsls4100m000) you have to maintain the field &quot;Purchase order type for direct deliveries&quot; (read the help for that field).<br />
In the item master (Form 3: Sales data) there is a field called &quot;Direct delivery from quantity&quot;. If the order quantity is greater than or equal to this quantity the field &quot;Direct delivery&quot; in the sales order line is set to &quot;Yes&quot; when creating orders.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Supplier field on the Item Data will have to be specified as well in order to generate the purchase order from sales order, correct? <br />
<br />
What if we have multiple suppliers for the same item, how would that work when generating purchase order from sales orders? <br />
<br />
Is there a way to select a supplier when generating PO from sales order? <br />
<br />
Also, what the benefit of Maintain Alternative Supplier by Item will have in this case?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">6th June 2008, 21:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Generation of PO from sales order is a two step process. System first creates a planned INV purchase order and then from it creates the purchase order. You can control the setting in Sales order parameter. If you have multiple vendors, system won't create PO to all of them, but to the one that is maintained in item master. You can change the supplier in Planned INV before it gets transferred. You can build a logic and customize this. <br />
