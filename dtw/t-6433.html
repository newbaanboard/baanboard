<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juancarlos</div><div class="date">28th August 2002, 09:28</div></div><div class="posttext">This must be a bug, but in our pretty new Baan Vc install, we notice that when address code 'A' is modified, for business partner 'X' , Baan actually changes the address A detail in previous pick lists, pack slips and invoices - <br />
<br />
This is sheer madness. I have a case with Baan, but this can't be right. I can see for lines that haven't been played yet, but not historical documents like invoices or packing slips. <br />
<br />
Anyone else see this?</div></div><hr />

If you need another address for the customer, define a new one.<br />
<br />
The way it works now is for changing minor typo's. Nothing wrong with changing them in history too. If you change the entire address, that new address is right and the old is wrong or the other way around. If you add a second address which you want to use in the future, you will be able to do so.<br />
<br />
At least that is the way I do with my address book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">juancarlos</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 08:48</div></div><div class="posttext">that this is the case. Crazy that Vc allows modification to previously printed, controlled documents like invoices - insane. Baan IV didn't do that. <br />
<br />
What a mess that is from an accounting control standpoint -</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to correct you, but Baan IV behaved exactly the same. The Adress is is master data and is only linked to an order. The only exeptions are order specific adresses. <br />
<br />
The behaviour you expect would require the software to copy the actual adress data each time it produces a new document. That would create a huge amount of redundant data and is therefore avoided in any transaction system like Baan.<br />
<br />
The &quot;issue&quot; you describe happens for example also with item texts. If you change the item text, you will change it on all previous invoices that used that item. The same happens when you change the descriptions of delivery terms, payment terms, whatever. If your order references some master data (and adresses are master data), changes in that master data will appear on all already printed documents.<br />
<br />
So, from your controlling point of view, reprinting a Baan document number like an invoice is not &quot;document safe&quot;. But that is not indended, too. Reprinting is a functionality for documents scrabled by the printer, or for information of employees and things like that. If you need a document save archiving functionality, you have to either archive the paper or use a (third party) document management system, that stores the image of the printout, and not the relational data.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ehartman</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason the address changes for the existing orders is because the address is only linked to the order. The address information is not stored on the order itself! So, if you change any address, the new address information will be used on any report for any order that is linked to that address code. This is just something the end-user needs to be aware of. It is strongly recommended to create a new address rather than changing an address.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FransG</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe Baan should consider to add a timestamp or effective date within the address table. For instance if a business partner moves to a new address one can add a new instance for that particular address instead of creating a new address. While querying the address table a reference date must be passed to get the correct address. So, for historical data one will find (still) the previous address while for the current date the actual address will be returned.<br />
<br />
This might be a problem for already released products but maybe Baan can add this as a requirement for there future releases. <br />
Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">29th August 2002, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, it would be nice... needs a lot of reengineering though. Drop it as a prio 50 case into the Baan Support System.</div></div><hr />
