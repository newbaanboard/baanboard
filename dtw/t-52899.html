<br />
Before preparing the Excise Invoice, we must do one job i.e. SALES INVOICE FINACE INTEGRATION. Our user take more time for this process, because if Sales Orders has 40 Lines. In this situation we select single lines and go to specific and run Sales Invoice Financial Integration. Our user prepare approx. 100 Invoices, each invoices has average 35 lines.<br />
<br />
You are requested to please provide any workaround for this that one sales order can we integrated at once. We saved lot of time for this process.<br />
<br />
Basically this process is used for Localisation data updation in the Excise Invoice.<br />
<br />
I am waiting for your +ve response. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
We are using ERP LN6.1 SP0<br />
