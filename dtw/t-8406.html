When it is run for a specific project, it runs very well.  This only occurs in one company.  It runs well in all other companies (of equal size and on the same server/database).  Anyone else come across this?<br />

<br />
If i take a look into the tdinv0250m000, there is nothing where you can give an input on the form.<br />
What do you mean by &quot;for a spec. proj.&quot;?<br />
What's the last solution, you imported for this session?<br />
I asked this because i want to run it this weekend, since a long time ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">14th January 2003, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say: check your data consitency, this session does do a lot with a lot of data (lot of reading some modifying). If there is a table lock on one of it's tables, it seems to go freezing, but actually starts retrying on locks. Also: the whole session will be one transaction. Take care that your transaction log (if RDBMS is used) is big enough to hold the entire transaction. Check your database spaces. If tbase is used, maybe parameters are to be changed for running this session. If the transaction fails, then the whole transaction is retried (up to setting of MAX_RETRY which is max 10). But if transaction keeps failing on different places, then it may well be that MAX_RETRY will be recounted for every other place where it occurs. (Run with -- -set MAX_RETRY=1).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">14th January 2003, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Omeluuk.  I'll give that a try.  However, I ran this same session in a test company (which was a copy of our production company (same server, save database) that is experiencing the problem) and it worked well. <br />
<br />
Djie-En, I have the latest solution installed (160987) but the project selection was added quite a while ago (SP6 or earlier).  It isn't in the form however... you have to go through the Special menu in the session.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Eden</div><div class="date">3rd February 2003, 23:45</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a similar problem over Xmas. It seems that when running the rebuild session, it looks at every project (archived or not) As well we found that because the system did not delete customized item data it took excessively long. Ours ran for 6 days before we got a fix from BaaN. I believe that there is a patch available now for the archive issue.<br />
