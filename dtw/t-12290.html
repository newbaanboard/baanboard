<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flip_J</div><div class="date">23rd July 2003, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
When entering a sales order header I receive the warning &quot;Date does not fall with the availability of the Calendar XXX&quot;<br />
There is only one calendar<br />
Exact time is selected<br />
I have set the capacity to 100%.<br />
Day has 24hrs available. 00:00 to 24:00<br />
Calendar is from 2002 to 2004. Sales order date is in year 2003<br />
Calendar has been updated<br />
<br />
Calendar is linked to the addres of the company and the Business Partner. <br />
Time zone should have no effect because there is 24hrs available a day for 7 days a week.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?????<br />
Thank you in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wizard</div><div class="date">23rd July 2003, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">We had the same problem.<br />
<br />
Baan suggested us to solve it adding, for each day of the calendar, a line with an empty availability type. (see file attached)<br />
This is also written somewhere in the help, but I am sorry I can not  find it again.<br />
<br />
They said us it is a &quot;feature&quot; of Baan and they will not change it.<br />
<br />
Ciao</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as you check the box &quot;'Blank' Availablity Type Used' in session tcccp0110s000 (Calendar Codes) in the &lt;Structure&gt; tab you will start seeing this kind of problems. Not only in tdsls but also in Service when creating service orders.<br />
The only way to resolve is to set up a blank availability type as suggested by BAAN Support (undocumented feature).<br />

I concluded that Blank availability is used for date calculations in various orders whiile other type of availibilities can be used for capacity calculations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vicky_09</div><div class="date">26th August 2003, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to use the blank avalibility type in your calander to overcome this. besides adding a blank line in the calander lines dont forget to check the Use Blank Availibility type in the Maintain calander session.</div></div><hr />
