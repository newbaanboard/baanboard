<br />
During creation of Sales order it is possible to generate load if you define Route or Carrier. That way you can create 1 load per shipment.<br />
<br />
Since they have 15-20 shipments per load, adding other Shipments to a load can be a lot of work, esspecialy since they have a lot of loads during the day.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to generate 1 load with several shipments?<br />
