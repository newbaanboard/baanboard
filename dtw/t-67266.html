Since stock is present in the location, I am not able to change this through Maintain Locations (whwmd3500m000).  Will there be any adverse effect if I change the location type to Pick through GTM.  Any other ideas....<br />

As per standard, System allows you to change from Bulk to Pick or Pick to Bulk, irrespective of stock present in that location. <br />
<br />
If you are not getting the option means there could be some other reason. for this change GTM correction is not required.</div></div><hr />

System does show only Pick and Bulk options in the screen, however when I try to change it, it gives a message &quot;Inventory is not Zero&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we have temporarily moved the stock and changed the type from Bulk to Pick.</div></div><hr />
