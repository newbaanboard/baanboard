Suggested field value (which was system generated value) was deleted in whinh200 and Inbound was successfully 'Put Away'.<br />
But just a Quick one- i checked other 'Warehouse Transfer (Manual) Orders also and they had the value present in this filed but they did not pose issue while doing 'inbound' then why a few particular orders only ?<br />
can you please suggest, is it a system bug ?<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends on the ship-to data of your transfer order and the extend to which KBs are installed. Given the message you received, you do miss at least KB 1843196. (And maybe KB 1857915). <br />
<br />
GL Account are only allowed for manual orders. <br />
<br />
For transfer manual orders, it is (initially) only allowed to have an GL code when no stock movement takes place. Example:<br />
- the ship-to warehouse should have been a WIP warehouse. <br />
- item transfer into a floor stock item.<br />
<br />
With later KBs also transfers to normal warehouses may often have a GL Account. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Kees</div></div><hr />
