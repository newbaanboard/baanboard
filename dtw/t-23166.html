After MRP run (Baan V), planned required date is not coming proper. It is shifting by one/two days. Planned start date and planned fininshed dates are coming OKay. <br />
In some case planned receipt date is same as planned fininsh date. However in some cases it is increased by one day and in some cases by two days. <br />
There is no safety time / inbond advice time defined for any item neithe in item supplier information not at item purchase data level.<br />
The calander defined is for five working days.<br />
<br />
Kinldy advice what could be teh reason of drifting of planned required date.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
BaanERP's MRP is quite accurate in this matter in our implementations. Since you set up 5 days work week calendar, did the planned requirement date fall on weekend? That'd have made BaanERP to shift the delivery time of the planned PO to Friday immediately before the weekend, hence the difference of 1 (planned requirement date on Sat) or 2 (planned requirement date on Sun) days<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcorwine</div><div class="date">16th February 2005, 22:26</div></div><div class="posttext">INBOUND / OUTBOUND LEAD TIMES are set in Item Data by Warehouse - whwmd2510m000.<br />
So you would not see them in the Item Supplier Data nor the Item Purchase Data.  For example, if the Inbound Lead time is set @ 2 days, the finish date of the planned purchase order is set 2 days ahead of required date.</div></div><hr />
