<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">abhivyakti</div><div class="date">3rd December 2002, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to get the lot numbers of the items against the transaction, Inventory transfer. For this we are refering table tdilc103 but only getting few records in the report.<br />
<br />
We checked in the session Enter Inventory Transactions (tdilc1120m000) all inventory transfer enteries are there in the seesion (in the table tdinv100). But when I press the continue button available on the form1, open the sub session Maintain Inventory Transfers by lot and location 'tdilc1122s000' is blank for those records which we are not getting on the report.<br />
<br />
Is there any criteria for storing the record in the table tdilc103. Means, as long as the lot is not consumed totaly, only till the record exists in this session or what....<br />
<br />
And can you please make available any functional manual for understanding the flow of item by lot and location.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayant Keskar</div><div class="date">4th December 2002, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not very clear about the proble. Which report session are you using to show inventory transactions by lot and location?  tdilc3410 should meet all your requirements? or is your problem that all the records are not present in ilc301 fro some of the transactions? If so there should be a difference in inv and ilc (since you say that all the records are present in inv100. If there is a difference between ilc and inv you can check thru session tdinv0252 but take care to see that the 'Adjust' button is set to 'No'<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />

<br />
Can you tell me what exactly the session tdinv0252 do??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
tdinv0252 compares stocks in ilc101 with stocks in 1) itm001 , 2) inv001 and 3) ltc001 and prints out three difference reports.<br />
<br />
The session assumes that ilc101 stock is correct and if the field 'Adjust Yes/ No' is set to Yes then it changes the stock in these three tables to match with the ilc101 stock. This is not a desirable situation becuase financial entries are generated on the basis of inv tables and if these stocks are adjusted without a corresponding financiala entry there will be difference in the stock value per Distributon and stock value per finance<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayant Keskar</div><div class="date">10th December 2002, 11:35</div></div><div class="posttext">There are certain sessions which should not be directly available to normal users. So these would not be available on normal browser. <br />
<br />
You will come to know of such sessions through experience, or you can browse throgh session lists for a module when you face a problem. e.g. there are a lot of correcetion session in each module.<br />

<br />
As a basic, to check whether an inventory transaction actually takes place or not, pls refer to tdinv700. This applies to ILC and non ILC settings. If it's not there, then the transaction never happened or, as in your case, might not have been recorded completely.<br />
<br />
You are seeing none in tdilc1122s000 because the transfer has not been recorded completely. After specifying the item, source WH, target WH, and qty to transfer in tdilc1120m000, the user should have recorded what lot are to be transferred and how much in tdilc1122s000. Even if the item were not lot controlled, this last step must still be performed by specifying empty lot number. This last step was not performed. Because of this, the transfer doesn't appear in tdilc103, tdinv700, and other related &quot;inventory transaction history&quot; tables<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply!<br />
<br />
Specifying following for the reference:<br />
1. ILC is implemented.<br />
2. Items are Lot controlled.<br />
3. Transaction exists in the tdinv700 but not in tdilc103 and          <br />
    tcilc301.<br />
4. This problem is occuring in many records.<br />
<br />
You said that 'last step was not performed.' :confused: Then how come the transaction has taken place.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any idea...........<br />
