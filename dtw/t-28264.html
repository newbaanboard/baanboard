   Did the item you changed the outbound priority of had any transaction booked against it or even a small representation in any of the history tables? If so then i am sure you didnt change the O.P. in the normal manner because the item master table doesnt allow you to change it(based on what i found from my own company, be it ilc implemented or not). If you did use the GTM then i guesss thats a different story and the end results are unpredictable.<br />
<br />
There is a clause in the help section of O.P. field which goes like this..<br />
Note:<br />
 FIFO/LIFO is possible by using the inventory date without recording separate lots.<br />
<br />
So let me know how you did it...<br />
<br />
sk<br />
<br />
P.S: Are there any stock against this manufactured item (On Hand)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just make simulation for this cause want to know how is effect if outbound priority change from FIFO to LIFO in item data.<br />
Cause in my company for sales sometimes using method LIFO for Finish Goods with expire date before 1 year, but usually we use FIFO for outbound priority this just case.<br />
if this can't do from system Baan, can you suggest me how to know if Finish Goods is will be expire ???<br />
<br />
that Finish Goods is have inventory on hand.<br />
<br />
thank you.<br />

 As long as this manufactured item has quantity in either onhand, onorder and allocated, you cant change the outbound priority.<br />
<br />
If you need to know which all items are about to expire, you can write a simple stored procedure which picks up items that are about to expire(you could provide the time frame) and automize it to run on a daily basis by attaching it to a sql job and let it mail the results to you. <br />
<br />
I hope iam understanding your requirements correctly...<br />

Yup..i missed that one out..<br />
Once the outbound priority of the items changed, what happens to the stock already on hand at the time of changing? Do they follow the old outbound priority or the new one? <br />
