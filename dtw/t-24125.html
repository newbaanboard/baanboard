 I am using BAAN 5<br />
<br />
I want to add an extra cost for items that already were received in warehouse [because due to delay in knowing all the extra costs related to the freight costs these costs are known after receiving the items in the warehouse]<br />
<br />
NB I want to add it from the distribution module and not the finance module because I want this extra cost to appear in the inventory valuation of the items<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

Please ask your finance consultant in your implementation team to explain to your client that such is not the way perpetual inventory valuation works. Assigning actual monthly extra costs to inventory value is possible in periodical inventory valuation, but not in perpetual. What you can do in perpetual valuation is assign a standard extra cost to the items, but not the actual monthly one<br />

from where in the system can I  revaluate my inventory?</div></div><hr />

Well, that's not actually what I meant. If you really wanna do it that way, it's possible. But it really makes job for accounting department of your client too tedious in BaanERP. They might even go to say that it's useless to use BaanERP's financial accounting module. If your client is not ready to migrate from periodical to perpetual inventory valuation method, then the implementation of financial accounting module will be sort of useless. Their job will not be easier using BaanERP. Moving from periodic to perpetual inventory valuation need change in the way they think about inventory value. Please assess their readiness in this regards too. Explain to them the advantages and disadvantages of perpetual inventory valuation as opposed to periodic one<br />

<br />
You can't use Change Prices/Discounts After Receipt session in here, you don't want to change the prices or discounts, which will lead to change the invoice, and give mistaken data when using the statistics.<br />

Ask your financial consultant if it is okey to book this costs and close it at the end of the year to the COGS account, this would give you correct COGS but not the inventory valuation you need.</div></div><hr />
