<br />
There is a Finish Good(FGS) item in the system which does not have a cost price value ! :eek: <br />
<br />
So, it is prompting an error message when we want to do a transaction.(Inventory Transfer from the main warehouse).The error message is   <br />
Cost Price not present for this date.<br />
<br />
*******Can anyone explain to me how the cost price is captured into the system (Maintain Item Data -tiitm0101m000) for FGS?<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I noticed that the BOM (Bill Of Material) effects the Standard Cost Price and Material Cost but there are items without BOM in the system but never prompt this message. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance guys!!! Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

If you get this message when trying to do a inventory transfer, you must have inventory on the item, without costprice? Lately some bugs have been introduced (and solved) in calculating cost price; in some situations it was possible that the old cost price was deleted (on recalculating) without the item data actually being updated. Also there were situations that a cost price in item data was set to zero.<br />
<br />
I would advice to install the latest solutions for cost price calculation and evaluate what data in cost price part might be wrong (also think about incorrect revaluations in integration and finance).<br />

<br />
BOM will effect standard price,if there is no BOM for this item,you still<br />
need to calculate cost price for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">manojsharma</div><div class="date">7th March 2005, 08:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The system gives error Cost price not present for this date  in 2 condition<br />
<br />
1. Cost price of the item not present<br />
<br />
    For this run ticpr2210m000 (Calculate cost price).<br />
<br />
2. Cost price date is greater than the transaction date<br />
 <br />
    For Example, if you have a item X of cost price date 07.03.2005. If this item is used in a sales order dated 03.03.2005 then the system gives error Cost price not present for this date</div></div><hr />

Check the parameter for the number of years to retain the costprice history in ticpr0100m000. We faced a similar problem with an item with no cost price change over the years. All of a sudden the item fell off the time frame maintained in the parameters (5 years).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
