Whilst for example tiitm0501m000 shows an inventory of 14 for an item, I can see only 2 in tdltc0505m000.<br />
The last number seem to be the correct one, but I cannot correct them via tdilc1120m000, because there is also only the inventory of 2. <br />
Tdilc0250m000 does not change anything.<br />
These differences occurred after warehouse cycle counting.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Thanks, I didn't know this session before.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
tdinv0252m000 would do that. but please be careful when running this session . it checks data in the following order<br />
<br />
Lot<br />
ilc<br />
inv <br />
itm<br />
<br />
so if your lot / ilc inventory records are wrong, then all the inv and itm records will get updated with wrong inventory. <br />
Also please run it after logging out all the users from the system. some wrong advise on this issue caused inventory corruption for us.</div></div><hr />
