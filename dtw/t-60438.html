<br />
I'm after some ideas on how to handle the following situation.<br />
<br />
We have a customer who places an order for item A, when manufactured they pay for item A but it stays on our premises.  The customer then places orders that are delivered to sites, on these orders are item A, they put a quantity required at a zero value.<br />
<br />
The way they are handling this at the moment gives us no traceability.<br />
<br />
What we require is something that takes the qty shipped out of stock so they can manage the inventory.  But on the reporting side be able to show for that item the lump sum paid but also the qty taken without duplicating the qty.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for ideas.</div></div><hr />
