<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gupta.manish.99</div><div class="date">22nd October 2010, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a wired requirement:<br />
<br />
My project customization has a logic to select a warehouse whenever an item is entered in a sales order line, now the user wants the same logic to be applied to items at BOM level if the item is a BOM item.<br />
<br />
Now i have applied the logic whenever we save the item, but now client came up with a requirement that whenever we change the quantity and it should not update the warehouse logic and it should remain same.<br />
<br />
now i applied a condition that whenever i change the quantity it should not update the logic but it goes and update the standard logic and warehouse gets changed, when i debugged it i saw that in the standard function if the quantity is changed it deletes the BOM item form tdsls047 and again enters the that entry.<br />
<br />
Now problem here is if i comment the warehouse it will make it blank and if i apply the logic there the warehouse gets updated. I can't remove the delete the condition that deletes the line as it is the standard logic and it will impact a lot of things as that logic is called in lots of scripts.<br />
<br />
Can someone please advice a solution to this??<br />
<br />
is it feasible to make some change as it will be having lot of effect ?<br />
<br />
can temporary table can be a solution to it to store warehouse values??<br />
<br />
but even if i use temporary table i am unable to guess it's impact? Please advice??</div></div><hr />
