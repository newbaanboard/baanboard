<br />
we are currently working on a project to sell our products in the US market :D . <br />
Aimed business partners are wholesales companies. Obviously most of them have a strong EDI requirement, documented in large 'Vendor Partnership Manuals'. We are running EDI for European customers successfully for a couple of years (order, order response and invoice) but are concerned (after reading the manuals :rolleyes: ) that this knowledge doesn't help for the US market.<br />
Is there anybody who has implemented Baan EDI for the US market already? Does Baan meet the basic requirements for US EDI rules?<br />
<br />
Any help is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />

As you know from the docs, not every company has the same requirements, but generally Baan can be configured to meet them just fine.<br />
<br />
Does Europe use the EDI Standards, such as the ASN, etc?  I know US Companies have these standards, each with their own variations.<br />
<br />
I am not the EDI expert, but maybe if you pose some specific questions about your concerns someone can answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for your reply. The ASN seems to be the core message type for US EDI :) This is strange for us, because we never used it here in Europe. What do the companies do with this message? Do they adjust the orders according to the actual delivery? Or is there any other information which they do not get with the order response?<br />
