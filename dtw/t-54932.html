<br />
on the ABC analysis session tdinv6210m000. You can enter a range of items and/or range of item groups. I would like to know, how BaaN is determinating the A,B, or C value for the items selected, if you only select a range of these and not all items in inventory?<br />
<br />
&quot;A, B or C&quot; will be determided in referencd of selected Items only?<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

INV parameters, you must've specified, &quot;unto turnover boundary&quot; 99.99 for slow moving percentage &quot;4&quot;<br />
<br />
Slow moving percentage 4,<br />
4% of inventory on hand 10.05 =0.402x cost price<br />
Therefore value= .402*22320.95 = 8973.02<br />
<br />

<br />
Remaining 96% = 9.648 * 22320.95= 215352.52.<br />

<br />

<br />
Total Qty of above period X cast price in item master<br />
<br />
Sale price<br />
<br />
Perform ABC analysis based on Qty,<br />
<br />
Annual issue = 12 Month Issue<br />
<br />
Perform ABC analysis based on Cost Price<br />
<br />
Turnover = Annual Issue x Cost Price<br />
 % Total =  Turnover /Total Turnover (Item Range in report ) <br />

Cumulative Turnover=Turnover total<br />
Cumulative  % Total= % Total<br />
Cumulative % Item= total nos of Items in report outcome  as like a total No of items is 103 then % Item is 100/103=0.97  Ist Item and 2nd Item is 0.97 X 2=1.94 3rd is 0.97 X3=2.91.<br />

Hope the same is cleared.<br />

<br />
I guess my question was more on the side of the number of selected items to performing the ABC analysis.<br />
<br />
i.e <br />
<br />
If I select 5 items A,B,C,D and E to perform the ABC Analysis. After running it. I will have something like this.<br />
Item       |   ABC code<br />
E-------&gt;A<br />
C-------&gt;A<br />
A-------&gt;B<br />
B-------&gt;C<br />
D-------&gt;C<br />
<br />
But if I select 3000 items ... A,B,C,D,E........ ZZZZ I might end up having something like this:<br />
<br />
Item      | ABC Code<br />
.....-------&gt;A<br />
.....-------&gt;A<br />
.....-------&gt;B<br />
ZZZZ-----&gt;B<br />
......------&gt;C<br />
E---------&gt;C<br />
C---------&gt;C<br />
A---------&gt;C<br />
B---------&gt;C<br />
D---------&gt;C<br />
...--------&gt;C<br />
<br />
The answer I guess is yes. The ABC code is based in the number of items selected. But, new question: Why will you do a partial ABC Analysis? or two/three different set of ABC analysis for your inventory? It shoulldn't be  based on your entire inventory?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dogboy</div><div class="date">27th February 2009, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to to regenerate my ABC codes as well.  It's been a while since we've done it, and I have uncategorized items and we've revved items so they are no longer A's.  ... it's a mess.  <br />
<br />
I intend to run ABC analysis on my entire set of skus (~8000) as I believe you need to have the calculation examine all inventory at one time.  I would think you COULD run it for a set of item individually.  You might wish to do this to set up ABC classes for specific product lines or production item groups.  i.e. what is my ABC class within a subset of a larger group.  I'd assume the top level items are largely A class.  But the subassemblies underneath are B or C class.  However, there may be a need to class the subassemblies or materials for some key products as an A.  If you run out of those, you're screwed.  So you could run ABC on your subassemblies on their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dogboy</div><div class="date">27th February 2009, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having difficulty with the Calculate Demand Forecast part of the equation.  I need to reset the Expected Annual Issue through this session, however, version my Baan IV version seems to be selective about how far back in history it looks for usage.  I played with the forecast parameters to find the best combos, but I still can't get it to work.  I have insufficient demand errors all over the place.  I don't know why Baan doesn't look at no demand as being zero demand. Instead, it says there was no demand.  So it doesn't consider that as part of the demand usage.  <br />
<br />
1 large usage 4 months ago<br />
Calculate demand forecast looks back no more than 4 months.  Calculates average usage based on the 4 months.  And gives me Expected Annual Issue based on 12 times the last value for the average.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to get Baan to view those historic periods with no data as being zeroes?<br />
<br />
And, why is this not forward looking?  If I have a demand forecast for my top level items, I have a production plan to support it.  Why would you not want to base your ABC class on what you are GOING to use in the future months?????</div></div><hr />
