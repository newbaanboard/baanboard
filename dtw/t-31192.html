after creating PO &amp; generating the EDI message one first server, I have transfered the files to another Servers Network and I had run Direct Network Connection session (tcedi7205m000), although Sales Order is getting created at the other server end but one warning message is coming which is as follows ... <br />
<br />
Missing argument(s) for Format '%s %d position %d inserted'.<br />
<br />
Please suggest a solution to remove this error message.<br />
<br />

It looks like the errors mentioned are not related to EDI processing. Some system level parameters for date format, units format, etc are not maintained properly at the systems level.</div></div><hr />
