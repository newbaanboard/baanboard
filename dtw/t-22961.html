What about timrp1101m000 'Enter Sales Forecast by MRP Item'? That's the way we do it. Not manually of course, but with the help of a small AFS program.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Does MRP &quot;see&quot; these forecasts as regular sales orders?<br />
As I understand I have to manage these forecasts - update, delete, etc. Right?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

The MRP takes this forecast into consideration like a sales order. You'll find seperate 'orders' within the mrp-tables.<br />
You are right, you have to manage this table. This can be time consuming - the reason why we use AFS for this. Fortunately this table is rather 'independent', the only reference is the item table as far as I know. The MRP itself can be triggered with an effective date for the sales forecast.<br />

Will I see these forecasts in sales reports like Backlog, open orders, etc.?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

No, certainly not. Those numbers are no real orders. It's a simple forecast referring to item and date nothing else. But the impact on the MRP-items in the BOM of the forcasted items is the same. So, if your intention is to get better MRP-orders for your purchased items according to the sales forecast of the manufactured items, this works fine.<br />
If you are doubtful - simply give it a try for a couple of items instead of the whole range.<br />

This issue has been dicussed several times in this forum. Basicly it's standard Baan functionality. You may change the warehouse type in the database.. at your own risk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judy Miller</div><div class="date">25th January 2005, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Be very careful in using the MRP sales forecast.  It is not consumed by real sales orders as it is in MPS.  For example:  If you forecast 100 units in a specific period and you get orders for 100 units in the same period you will get planned MRP orders for 200 units in that period.  You can use this forecast as a future planning tool if the likelyhood of getting real orders within the forecast period is low.  Note the field in MRP that allows you to determine the start date of the forecast.</div></div><hr />
