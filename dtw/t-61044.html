<br />
We are using Baan V, I need to test something on Transfer Order and Transfer Order (Manual). For that I should be in a position to run a complete cycle. <br />
<br />
Can any body help me in this ?<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Does transfer order mean, transferring some quantity of an <br />
Item from one WHSE to another WHSE ?<br />
<br />
2. Is the below approach correct ?<br />
<br />
In whinh2500s000,<br />
<br />
Order Origin = Transfer (Manual)<br />
Order/Set = 6 / 1<br />
Transaction Type = Transfer<br />
Order Type = TRN<br />
Order Date = Cur Timestamp<br />
ShipFromData' Code = XXX<br />
ShipToData' Code = YYY<br />
<br />
Save the form<br />
<br />
Then I click outbound lines (winh2520m000) and enter a new <br />
record in (winh2520s000)<br />
<br />
There I specify the Item and Ordered Quantity and save the form<br />
<br />
I have also taken the snapshot of the inventory of my Item in <br />
both the source and destination warehouse. <br />
<br />
Is my approach correct until now ? how do I complete the transfer ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First and foremost it shud be clear what is the difference between the Transfer Order and Transfer Order Manual.<br />
<br />
Transfer Order Manual is made to transfer the material from one warehouse to another.<br />
<br />
Transfer Order is linked to a sales order (tdsls404) Maintain Sales Order Lines specfic. Make Transfer order from there.<br />
<br />
Rest  Steps are the same as told by you.<br />

<br />
Thank You so much for responding to my post. I was able to successfully do a transfer order manual from one warehouse to another and the inventory movement was reflected. <br />
<br />
I have a couple of queries, After doing the below steps<br />
<br />
In whinh2500s000,<br />
<br />
Order Origin = Transfer (Manual)<br />
Order/Set = 6 / 1<br />
Transaction Type = Transfer<br />
Order Type = TRN<br />
Order Date = Cur Timestamp<br />
ShipFromData' Code = XXX<br />
ShipToData' Code = YYY<br />
<br />
Save the form<br />
<br />
Then I click outbound lines (winh2520m000) and enter a new <br />
record in (winh2520s000)<br />
<br />
There I specify the Item and Ordered Quantity and save the form<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried...<br />
<br />
Method 1<br />
<br />
After choosing the record -&gt; Specific -&gt; Generate Advice<br />
<br />
After this the status is shown as advised, then I executed<br />
<br />
-&gt; Specific -&gt; Release Advice, now the status is shown as shipped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Method 2<br />
<br />
Executed whinh4201m000 [Generate Outbound Advice], the status changed to advised<br />
<br />
then Executed whinh4202m000 [Release Outbound Advice] and the status changed to shipped.<br />
<br />
I wonder how the status changed to shipped and the inventory movement happened without doing the Pick List step.<br />
<br />
While creating the Transfer order I have not populated the carrier, I need to know which carrier the system took for doing the shipment ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
