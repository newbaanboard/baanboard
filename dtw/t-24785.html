I have a requirement, but it seems to me that this only stops the order from being delivered. We need it to stop the order, including the planning of any materials for the order.<br />

<br />
In session tdsls0194s000(sales-order types) it is possible only to block before releasing to warehouse or before releasing to invoice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul Eden</div><div class="date">9th August 2005, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Viplov. I was aware of this session. My question was, is there a way to block the planning. This session only stops you from delivering the order. The planning engine still plans production and purchase requirements. Therefore, you could end up with an order that has been produced that you have not approved credit for yet, and may never approve. As these are all custom products (for specific customers) we do not want to produce if the order is blocked.<br />
