If there are partial receipts, you will either have to set the backorder quantity to zero (if the backorders are not yet confirmed), or enter a new receipt with quantity zero and backorder quantity zero.<br />

think that is alternative way.what &amp; where is the impact if we use PDPO session(tdpur4223m000).<br />
we cant delete order line becouse of TS/ISO audit &amp; vendor rating impact.</div></div><hr />

As far as the qty is not delivered against a PO lines it is not apperared in Back ORder and hence if this PO line is not required it has to be deleted in the PO itself.<br />
<br />
As far as your vendor rating is concerned it is based on order qty hence f the order qty should be acknowledged by the supplier if it is not acknowledge than the line can be deleted from PO but if he acknowledges and does not delivert the material than that has will be captured in Supplier reliability asessment.<br />
