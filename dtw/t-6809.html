<br />
We are doing 'cycle counting' periodicaly.<br />
<br />
But, we want for a 'random batch' of selected part do a cycle counting each week.<br />
<br />
There is any utility in BaaN 4C4 who do that ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">21st September 2002, 23:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Do I understand you correct when I read:<br />
- You want to spread your cycle counting efforts<br />
- You want to count smaller parts of your inventory at the time<br />
<br />
(Are you using the INVentory module or the Inventory Location Controle module?)<br />
<br />
You can generate your cycle count orders for a selection of warehouses / items.<br />
<br />
You also can manipulate the counting interval. I have no system at hand here, so currently I cannot help you further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">22nd September 2002, 02:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure but it sounds like Sly is asking to have a cyclecount generate randomly for a particular item so that they don't have to count every location (or warehouse, or lot, etc.) possibly to prove the Baan inventory levels are correct (kind of like a quality control check).  While I don't think that functionality is available in standard Baan, whoever is generating the cycle counts could choose an area at random and then generate a count for that area only.</div></div><hr />
