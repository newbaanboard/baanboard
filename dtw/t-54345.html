<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wuichia</div><div class="date">22nd November 2008, 07:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I create a List Item (Kit) called Handle Set (unit &quot;set&quot; which is piece type). <br />
I also create two Purchase Items (Components) call White Handle (6pcs in a Set) and Red Handle (8pcs in a Set).<br />
Our supplier only recognize the PO in Set. Upon creation of PO, the PO line consist only the List Item.<br />
<br />
During receiving using Ln, the store will receive the goods in Set.<br />
I zoom in to the BOM line, and it shows that the total quantity to receive for each components.<br />
<br />
Now I have a problem that, sometime supplier send me in Set but there are missing components.<br />
For example, purchase 3 Sets.<br />
I receive 3 Sets but one of the Set have only 6pcs of While Handle and 7pcs of Red Handle.<br />
<br />
How I should use Ln to handle scenario like this?</div></div><hr />

The goods is sold in &quot;set&quot; and it's usually packed and sent to customer in complete set or full packed.<br />
Due to production issue such as rejections, the quantity will somehow less than expected.</div></div><hr />
