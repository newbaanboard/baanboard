<br />
In case the authorisations for this user are correct in tdinv1110m000, could you be more specific as to where the user is unable to use that warehouse (in what session and doing what)?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

  You could check the session Maintain Table Data Authorizations {ttaad4134m000} and see if there are any restriction for this user for the above mentioned warehouses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skirank</div><div class="date">20th December 2006, 08:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
{ttaad4134m000} is not applicable in this implementation<br />
<br />
{tdinv1110m000} is related to inventory transaction authorisation, in the the permission has been given.<br />
<br />
I will write in detail regarding the problem :<br />
Several warehouses has been created in the session {tcmcs0103m000} in the name of W01,W02 ... So on.. under which W05 is classified as commercial warehouse.<br />
For a specific user, this warehouse {W05} itself is not visible, and this users is facing problems in doing transactions like Sales order, Purchase order etc.. which has been created by other users with this warehouse.<br />
<br />
Can you pls help me out.<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">20th December 2006, 12:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Maintain User Authorizations for Inventory Transactions {tdinv1110m000} has nothing to do with limiting warehouse access. This session is used to control which all types of transaction a user can use in the session Enter Inventory Transactions by Item {tdinv1101m000}. It wont limit access to Table Data which in your case is a warehouse. <br />
<br />
Please clarify the statement where you say that the &quot;user cannot do transactions like Sales order, Purchase order etc..&quot;. Do you mean the transactions in session tdinv1101m000 or the transaction in Sales Module, Purchase Module etc.?? Do you get any error message when you type this warehouse in any transaction where there is a field to enter the Warehouse?<br />
<br />
Either way, the reason why i asked you to check the session Maintain Table Data Authorizations {ttaad4134m000} was because if i were to limit a person from using a particular warehouse in tables belonging to Purchase(tdpur041, tdpur045), Sales(tdsls041, tdsls045), Production(tisfc001,ticst001, ticst010) or even Inventory(tdinv100) then this is where it would be set up. After this, the user wont be able to see any transaction with this warehouse or even make one. <br />
<br />
Coming back to your Commercial Warehouse. For academic purpose, when you say Commercial Warehouse, do you mean it as a term that is used in your business logic or is it a Baan term because i couldnt find this term in help section of Baan or in Maintain Warehouse session. Are you using a localised version of Baan4c4 which has this concept? <br />

Thanks sukesh for the indepth study.. really speaking i have tried out all those.. and one more thing is {ttaad4134m000} is not implemented, so all the users have all the permissions.<br />
Yes I am using BaaN IV c4, This commercial warehouse is our business concept only. One of the warehouse code is W05 which has been created, only this warehouse is having problem in getting accessed only for a particular user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">23rd December 2006, 07:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats odd!! <br />
In any case, are all these users sharing the same menu in Maintain User Data {ttaad2100m000}? <br />
1a) If the answer is Yes, then run session Copy Authorizations Between Users {ttaad2240m000} where in you copy the authorizations from a user where the warehouse is visible. Follow this with session Convert User Data to Runtime Data Dictionary {ttaad4200m000} and check if it helps.<br />
1b) If the answer is no, then change his menu structure to the same as the others who can access this warehouse and then try step (1a). <br />
2) Do check, when the user opens the session Enter Inventory Transactions By Item {tdinv1101m000}, if the session number is the same as the session number of the others who opens this session. Could it be that this session is customized somehow?<br />
3) Try deleting the user and creating it again and try step (1a).<br />
