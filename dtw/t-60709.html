<br />
I am facing a strange problem while linking a contract with Sales order line.<br />
Session tdsls4102s000 is allowing linking SO line with contract perfectly but it doesn't calculating the discount that is given while creating the contract for that item.<br />
<br />
I have tried all possible scenarios but unable to get the discount.<br />
Quick reply would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Please find attached the screenshot of the session for more clear picture of the problem.</div></div><hr />
