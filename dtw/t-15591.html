<br />
We are working on Baan IV c4 is3, here earlier the purchase order series in Purchase Order ptr was &quot;No series&quot; due to which the purchase orders were generated in consecutive numbers ( like 1,2,3,...123)<br />
<br />
Now company has decided to change ptr to TWO digit and we have also defined various new two digit purchase order series in tcmcs0147m000.<br />
<br />
But now when we try to maintain a new purchase order , as soon as a series like 10 is entered in order header , duplicate record error is prompted by the system.<br />
   <br />
I understand that the reason for duplicate record is availablity of purchase order number 10 in the system.<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest how can I maintain a purchase order with number like 100001 ( for purchase order series 10) <br />
<br />
Regards<br />

Learner :(</div></div><hr />

The only way to get past the problem would be to remove the order 10 by archiving the order.</div></div><hr />
