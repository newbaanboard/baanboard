We are in Baan IVc4. <br />
<br />
A lot can be created during maintain receipt (purchased item) by calling the sub session - maintain lot.<br />
<br />
The Inventory date will be defaulted automatically, but user are able to change it, or even search the old lot data and change the inventory date. <br />
<br />
Is there anyway that we can control the user can only accept the defaulted date and not allow to make any changes on it? <br />
<br />
We tried to change the form to set the date to &quot;Display only&quot;, but it prompt message when we trying to save the record &quot;Date must be filled&quot;.<br />
<br />
Only authorised personnel are allow to make the changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can either use Table Field Authorization or you can add a UE DLL to block any changes to that field.<br />
<br />
I would have gone with the 1st option.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the quick reply.<br />
<br />
Forgot to mention, we need to allow the user doing maintain receipt to be able to &quot;Create&quot; new lot record, accept the default inventory date, but not allow to change the date after creation.<br />
<br />
I tried to set the table field authroisation as &quot;Read&quot; or &quot;Not Authorised&quot; - yes it will not allow to make changes to old records, but it also do not allow the user to save the new record - prompt message &quot;date must be filled&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can this be done through authorisation setup?</div></div><hr />

<br />
AFAIK, it's not possible with Standard Authorization. You can use session wrapper's for that. That will be the best option. With UE DLL, you can set a range between which user can change the date. <br />
<br />
This is one of the solution you can try ~Vamsi's Solution (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=559)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kw_foo</div><div class="date">24th October 2013, 03:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestion, the solution seem too technical for me.<br />
<br />
Will try to explore further.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We  have inventory say 100 nos in one lot. But we want to transfer this inventory in two different lots say A and B. How to transfer is without doing adjustment order .<br />

In both of these rework order, you can maintain the estimated material as item (with 100 nos in one lot) and its desired quantity, remove all the operations in routing. Complete the production order, issue the material, etc. and you get same item with 2 lot numbers.</div></div><hr />
