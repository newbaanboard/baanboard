<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">9th March 2006, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">The Process Deliverd Purchase Order session (tdpur4223m000) processes purchase orders order by order.  Is there any way to on process a single line of an order?  We have situations where we do not want to make certain lines of a PO go to Deleting Line status because we are waiting on pricing and want to be able to utilize the Maintain Prices/Discounts after Maintain Receipts session.  As an added note our Finance department does not want to utilize print purchase invoice step due to the time involved in printing them.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
We do not have access to source code and I bet it would not be difficult to add a to/from position field on the form and alter the main query of the session to deal with our issue...</div></div><hr />

Can you not have a separate order type for orders where you may want to change the price and only for that order type put Print Purchase Invoices as an extra step?</div></div><hr />

<br />
we follow the practice of PDPO once in year i.e after the completion of financial year.<br />
At that time we run the print purchase invoice and then PDPO.<br />
<br />
Please clarify on why you require to run the PDPO on daily basis and take print out of Purchase invoice from finance department?<br />
<br />
If you run once in a year than you will not face any problem in order by line for PDPO.<br />
<br />

<br />
I may need to revisit the Print Purchase Invoice Step...</div></div><hr />
