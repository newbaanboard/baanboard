<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prademaker</div><div class="date">30th November 2001, 11:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Want to make an ordertype for which the last step is<br />
&quot;release outbound&quot;, so without making an invoice.<br />
When I define an ordertype, the system tells me that<br />
printing the salesinvoice must be part of the procedure.<br />
Has anyone done this or can give me a clue?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Print sales invoice is a mandatory order step. What are you trying to achieve with this order type? as there may be another way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prademaker</div><div class="date">30th November 2001, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a lot of promotional items (gifts) we're giving away to our customers. We want to keep them in our inventory and possibly even make an order/packing note for it.<br />
Now we have to make zero-invoices and we would like to avoid this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">30th November 2001, 12:52</div></div><div class="posttext">If you wish to hold these items in stock and also pick for specific customers then sales orders with 0 value would work but of course you may end up generating a lot of these invoices. Alternatively, keeping the items in stock but using inventory transactions to control the stock would be possible. Again here you would probably have a lot of transactions but you could attach a reason code to keep them seperate and text to identify which customers have received samples . Will depend really on what the critical information is you are trying to retain. <br />
<br />
I would generally use sales orders for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">3rd December 2001, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You could also create a dummy &quot;gift&quot; company which would &quot;buy&quot; the items with a drop-ship address of your other customers.  At least that way you would not risk haveing a zero invoice go out to the real customer.  you could also take the steps of printing those invoices &quot;on-line&quot; (to the &quot;D&quot; printer) And then deleting them.<br />

<br />
Rather than sales orders for gifts, promotional items etc., use Service Orders.  Set up a Service Configuration for the customer, and a Warranty to provide 100% relief against materials.  Against the Service Order Activity, record an Estimated Materials line of type 'From Warehouse'.  Release the Activity, and the warehouse order will be created in a similar manner to Release to Warehousing in Sales.  When the warehouse order is shipped, complete and close the Service Order.  This would normally create an invoice, but the warranty arrangements will suppress it.  If you really want to simplify things, then making the Activity Estimated Material 'From Service Inventory' rather than 'From Warehouse' allows you to show the item as having been sent without the need for ever having it in stock!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are using BAAN V why not just use the manual sales orders in Warehousing.<br />
These orders can be entered in whinh2500m000 manually and are then shipped via Warehousing the regular way with an outbound advice, pick list and a shipment.<br />
No need for invoicing but it will still allow you to stock and shipped these kind of items.<br />

<br />
Why don't you try to make a sales order with 100% discount on the price. In this way you will be able to use all the steps in the order type and will have a 0 amount invoice in the end.<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen Ruger</div><div class="date">10th December 2001, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">The 100% discount and warrenty methods work OK, except you will still generate paper to the customer.  That may be a problem if you do not want any paper going to them.  Otherwise the results are the same<br />
