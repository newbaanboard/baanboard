<br />
I do not 100% understand what you are asking but let me explain the basic setup needed for a warehouse having locations. This is the first important flag, set the warehouse in warehouse data having locations.<br />
<br />
Ones set, 3 basic locations need to be defined. A receiving location, an staging location and a reject location. First create this locations for the warehouse. Most of the time I use a naming convention like this:<br />
<br />
If the warehouse is named 340100, then I use REC_340100 for the receiving location, REJ_340100 for the reject location and STA_340100 for the staging location. Also a normal location of the type bulk or pick is needed, this to put away the stock in the warehouse.<br />
<br />
Link the 3 basic location in the warehouse session to the warehouse.<br />
Also set the inbound priority in the warehouse to bulk if you want to consider first bulk location or to pick if first pick locations need to be considered.<br />
<br />
In general the flow of goods is :<br />
<br />
When goods are received (from purchase or production) they are received first in the receiving location of the concerned warehouse (so in REC_....). After this receipt an inbound session is/can be started which looks for the appropriate pick or bulk location available. So goods are moved from the receiving location to the exact warehouse location when the put away is confirmed.<br />
<br />
I hope this clarifies what you were looking for.<br />
