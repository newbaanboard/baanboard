<br />
We are looking to be put in contact with someone who has expertise in EDI for Baan IVc4 with Supply Chain.<br />
<br />
We have had an EDI system set up and have enough knowledge to maintain it and fix small hiccups that occur. We would like a person to review our setup and then deliver full EDI training to a small group of key users.<br />
<br />
If anyone can do this or can put me in contact with someone who can do this then I would be very grateful.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
