<br />
thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

ya thats true. its only applicable when location control is implemented. I would like to know when exactly in the order procedure(before making the approvals or after making the approvals) the inbound data is generated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DStroud</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">When you can run generate inbound is based on several factors:<br />
<br />
1. Location control must be turned on<br />
<br />
2. If item does not have to be inspected  then generate inbound  can be run after Maintain Receipts (Item will be in receipt location)<br />
<br />
3. If the item must be inspected  then generate inbound has to wait until Maintain Approvals has been completed  (Item will be in inspection location)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kumarsandy</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">If ILC is Implemented , then u have to define Receipt Location and Inspection Locations in Maintain warehouse ( tcmcs003)<br />
<br />
In case Item has to be inspected , as soon as u receive material , it will move to INSPECTIOn location else It will be in RECEIPT LOCATION.<br />
<br />
Now after approval ( if inspection = Yes) u have to generate Inbound data , and release it.Releasing Inbound transfer material from Inspection Location to Normal location<br />
<br />
While if Inspection is NO , u can generate Inbound , after Receipt of material .<br />

<br />
1.For Item with Inspection = yes then<br />
 <br />
You have to do the Generate Inbound/Release Inbound after the Session &quot;Maintain Approvals&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. For Item with Inspection = No then<br />
<br />
You can do the Generate Inbound/Release Inbound after the Session &quot;Maintain Receipts&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope the above situations are cleared to you.<br />
