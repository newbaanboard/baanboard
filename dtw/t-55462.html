<br />
We have an employee who is currently responsible for 1 department G32MNT <br />
Now he is becoming responsible for another one called G32ESG.<br />
Would it be possible to have him “linked” the 2 Department entities at the same time so he can manage the Warehouse Orders based/depending on the Warehouse, Item origin, etc…? <br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
Do we need to create a very new profile for him and link him to the new Department G32ESG, but in this case he will have to toggle between his 2 profiles..?<br />
<br />
Please see the attachment.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

How do you currently manage the warehouse orders based upon 1 department? <br />
Department of the employee has no direct link to a warehouse. <br />
<br />
Secondly an employee needs to be linked to 1 department only. The department of the user is mainly used for booking costs. For example, hours spent are posted against the department of the employee. So linking the employee to 2 departments does not make sense.<br />
