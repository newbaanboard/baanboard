<br />
Is there any way to block a Baan Sales Order as a demand from planning process ( MRP, MPS, PCS ..etc)<br />
<br />
The blocked field on the sales order header doesn't seem to stop it from picked by MRP as the demand.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any help, Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Alternative is to change the warehouse to a non nettable warehouse<br />

Try switching the warehouse on the sales order to non-nettable untill the sales order is ready to be unblocked. MRP and MPS does not see transactions in a non-nettable warehouse.</div></div><hr />
