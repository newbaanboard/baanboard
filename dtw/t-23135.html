When loading  a sales order line, the ATP window is not popping-up (let me remind that only pops-up when there is an ATP issue, like no inventory available for the requested date).<br />
<br />
The point is that on that date, there is no inventory planned, nor can the supplier provide products in such date (lead time exceeds).<br />
<br />
But: if the same quantity for the code is input in the ATP Handling session tdsls4899m000 actually it &quot;informs&quot; that there is an ATP issue! (because of the lack of projected inventory).<br />
<br />
Why can this session differ from actions that occur during the load of the sales order line?? at the end we are talking about the same item, same qty. and same requested delivery date!...<br />
<br />
Can it be some kind of setup on the specific item that prevents from activating the ATP?? -actually seems to be configured (planning data) ok...<br />
<br />
any feedback...<br />
<br />
thanks many!<br />
