<br />
Please guide me, How we free the inventory from allocated. We Deal in both market International as well as Domestic. We make a sales order for Export and inventory is allocated to that Order. But due to urgent requirement in the Domestic Market, we want to deliver that item to the Domestic Customer.<br />
<br />
But we can't deliver that item for Domestic, due to allocated Inventory.<br />
<br />
Please suggest me how we can free that inventory from allocation.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

Yes, but we not want to delete the outbound advice, because we delivered that material with in a week. But due to priority, we delivered the domestic material First.<br />
<br />
Any other solution or workaround please.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Are you using commitment?<br />
<br />
If there is no commitment, then I believe you have generated the outbound advice for the export order (outbound order line), undo this advice and the inventory will be available to be issued against the domestic order.</div></div><hr />
