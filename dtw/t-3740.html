<br />
We are on BaaN IVc.<br />
We've dealt with such a problem - session tdilc4101m000 DOES NOT allow editing data for one order (SFC) for more than one user.<br />
 We have extreemle huge SFC-orders and we need many users (from different work centres) to work with one SFC order in tdilc4101m000.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanking in advance,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />

By doing so, you could prevent one user from holding the application lock for a long time -- it would, I think, just be held for the duration of the transaction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But...<br />
Could you give just a bit more information about what the 'function server' is? And how to create it?<br />
Or just could you point the numbers of BaaN documents concerning functional server (we have the full documentation)? <br />
Our project team consists of two 'sub-teams' - functional (concerning business-flow, business-processes and all things like that) and administrating (Tools/development etc.).  I'm a member of first part - so I need just a bit more information to give the ideas for our admins/developes.<br />
<br />
Thank you once more for reply,<br />
Michael</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">16th May 2002, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess you could describe function servers as a  &quot;transactional&quot; approach to functionality.  There are DDC function servers, which use Baan's DDC technology, and AFS function servers.  <br />
<br />
DDC stuff can be found under the &quot;Baan IV Connectivity&quot; menu.  There is a session called &quot;Function Server Generator&quot; that will create a function server that can, with some setup, be run under DDC.  A lot of people use DDC with handhelds and create function servers to automate processes such as cycle counting, receiving, shipping, etc.  You probably need source code to run the generator session.  We have it, so it has never been an issue for us when we create function servers for our clients.<br />
<br />
AFS allows you to make certain session calls (i.e., mimic session functionality) without having the standard Baan source code.  Thus, you could create a session to handle some input and process it as if it were entered in the regular session.  There are API calls that you would embed into a program script you create.  I am simplifying things and not doing AFS justice, but I hope you get the idea.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps a little.  If you need more information or assistance, please let me know.</div></div><hr />
