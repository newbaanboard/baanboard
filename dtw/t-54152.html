<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tomlbacon</div><div class="date">31st October 2008, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have an order for 10 pcs and receive 3 you should mark the receipt as Final Receipt for the 3 and Confirm the Back Order.  If its not marked as final you have to go into Receipts Correction Program and mark as Final.  Then you should be able to go to the Purchase Order Lines and under the Specific option you will see Purchase Order Lines Detail.  This is where you can change the back order quantity to 0.  If you need to do a receipt Correction go to session whinh3520m000 find your receipt and under Specific you can do Correction.  Hope this solves your problem.</div></div><hr />
