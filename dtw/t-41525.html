<br />
I have this problem and hope someone can advise.<br />
<br />
I have a Purchase Requisition (PR) that has been approved. When I try to convert this PR to PO, I got this error message :<br />
<br />
Purchase Ordre could not be generated. Cost price structure of item not found.<br />
<br />
I have double-confirm that the cost price for this item has been created and is also effective.<br />
<br />
I am on BaanVc<br />
<br />
Thank in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">11th September 2007, 12:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats the purchase order date and the cost price date of the item in question? If the item code was created on a date after the purchase order date you could end up in a situation like this...<br />
 <br />
sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddybear</div><div class="date">12th September 2007, 04:09</div></div><div class="posttext">The PO date is today date and the item has been created for some time. I checked the efffective date of the cost price. It is at the begining of 2007.<br />
<br />
So, I don't see any problem with it.<br />
<br />
I have a PO for this item last year, but for different warehouse. Now, I want to create PO for another warehouse. I suppose the cost price structure i snot by warehouse.<br />
<br />
Anyone got anymore suggestion ?</div></div><hr />
