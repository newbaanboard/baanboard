<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stephan</div><div class="date">6th May 2002, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Updating your standard cost is a Business decisiion that effects several areas within your system and company.<br />
<br />
Updating the costs will revalue your inventory, effect your PPV's and could effect sales prices and margins. (depending on the setup)<br />
<br />
Generally speaking cost should be updated yearly in a manufacturing environment but some environments where material cost change rapidly and to great degrees may need to look at a semi-anual or quarterly update.<br />

<br />
Typically companies update their cost prices once a year for inflation. However, companies may make exceptions to this rule depending on their business and country they are in.<br />

<br />
We revalue our standard costs for all items at the same frequency that we adjust our overhead rates.  Historically, this has been once per year.  However, if we have a purchased item whose cost had a significant change, we will revalue as needed so that our inventory more accurately reflects it's true value. <br />
<br />
As the others have mentioned, your country's tax laws may play a significant roll in the frequency that you will need to recalculate your standards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 08:24</div></div><div class="posttext">How is revaluation of WIP handled by BaaN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">When Baan revalues items , Baan does following<br />
1. Calculates new cost price<br />
2. For the existing inventory of  the item in question it will generate warehouse/revaluation in integration transaction for the difference with new cost price.<br />
3.Update production WIP with new cost price and generate production / revaluation integration<br />
4. Update standard cost prices history<br />
5. Update cost prices in item master table<br />
<br />
If your inventory figures by warehouse are wrong, then warehouse / revaluation may be wrong.<br />
<br />
When u purchase / sell items with back dated reciept / delivery then system generates Purchase/revaluation and sales revaluation  respectively in integration (when the standard cost price has been revised after the back dated receipt/delivery date).Same  about PRP warehouse / revaluation and Replenishment / revaluation back dated transactions.<br />
<br />
Please note this applies only to standard item (not customized items) inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morpheus</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 12:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Hitesh!<br />
A query related to point # 3. Which table stores the WIP items &amp; respective quantities? In the current scenario, no Report Operations Completed is used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">9th September 2003, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Though I don't have clear idea , I think it's tisfc001 with status less than completed and /or complete equal to no . <br />
<br />
I would request u to test a scenario before going ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kw_foo</div><div class="date">10th September 2003, 03:11</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using Process manufacturing. From what I undersand, the revaluation of the WIP is base on the material issued to the production floor (revalue on the material = price differences * quantity issued) and completed quantity (revalue on the surcharge = price differences * quantity completed). I believe the theory for SFC is the same.<br />
