<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dkulikow</div><div class="date">27th October 2003, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">We have Baan 4c4 NAS0.  We have been using supply chain sales and shipping schedules for a couple of years now.  We are wanting to start using the purchase  and delivery schedules in supply chain.  I have added the contract and purchase schedule as well as the delivery schedule.  However, I do not see these requirements after running MPS/MRP.  Can anyone tell me why?  I was wondering if there was a parameter or something that I could be missing.  It seems strange that it will not generate any planning based on and/or using the purchase schedule entered.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any recent documents on supply chain purchase schedules, it would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are several threads that discuss purchase contracts and generating purchase delivery schedules. One is http://www.baanforums.com/baanboard/showthread.php?threadid=6715&amp;highlight=purchase+contract+MRP<br />

Thank you! My dominant Baan persona is Finance -- I'm pretty sure that I have a hard copy for NASCAR Supply Chain but I don't think I have soft copy to attach.<br />

However, I am still unsuccessful in getting our Purchase Schedules to plan.  I've tried regen's, net change on my item....I've answered yes to only gen DLS question.  I don't have this supplier set up in supply chain.  I wouldn't think I would have to, but could this be my problem.  I do have the supplier master all at &quot;post&quot; for the different messages.   <br />
<br />
Again thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 00:01</div></div><div class="posttext">couple of questions<br />
<br />
if you use the session maintain purchase schedules are you able to manually enter the requirements.<br />
<br />
check planned mrp purchase orders, if the demand is not appearing in the schedules, are planned purchase orders being created instead.<br />
<br />
is it possible that there are already enough purchase orders on the system for the current demand that no further reguirement is being generated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dkulikow</div><div class="date">30th October 2003, 15:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I got it to work yesterday!!!!  Thanks for everyone's help.  It wound up being that the contract originally set up didn't have a total contract quantity.  It had a one in it.  I changed that to 9999999 and MRP worked as it should have.  I had a feeling it was going to be something like this.  Which was quite frustrating.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully, someone down the road can learn from our mishap. :) <br />
<br />
Thanks again everyone!!!</div></div><hr />
