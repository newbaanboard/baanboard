Is it possible to transfer some qty of a particular lot to another lot(new lot) for a customised item.<br />
<br />
This is required to take care of manufacturing leftover.The inventory is maintained in Tonne and issue in tonne. When we issue raw materials of M.S Sheets,Rods, Angles in particular size to a manufacturing item, there may be leftover with different sizes of these items. This left over qty remains in stock which cannot be issued again for the same  purpose since the leftover size is different. However we can use the leftover for other manufacturing items.<br />
<br />
If we are able to transfer these leftover to different lots, wherein the lot  numbers will be with that item left over size, it will be easy to track and issue the different sizes to different  manufacturing items.<br />
<br />
We are not able to transfer materials from one lot to another lot. Is there any solution, or work around? <br />

If you create a production order from type rework, you can issue the old lot, and on receipt tdilc4113s000 assign another lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
                 &quot;production order from type rework&quot; What do you mean by rework, is it  a different warehouse, or am I missing something?<br />
<br />
Thanks. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">10th October 2002, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">When you create a production order, you can select the type of rework order, meaning you have to do some more work on the materials in your warehouses. So in that case you should issue the same lot back to shopfloor and report the order as finished. On receipt you are able to assign another lot code to the material.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
When you create a production  order, u can set the field &quot;Rework Order&quot; to &quot;Yes&quot; of session Maintain Production Order (tisfc0101m000) of Form 2. <br />
<br />
This will enable you to get the same itema(which is going to be manufactured)  as raw material in &quot;Estimated Bill of Materials&quot; so that we can issue the same left over item and complete the production order in different lot number. <br />
<br />
Hope this is clear.<br />
<br />
