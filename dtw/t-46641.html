<br />
i create a contract line item with zero price it won't allow me to activate. so i work around by using price book with zero price. but this cause another problem when generate sales order from delivery scheme, it won't be able to pick up the price from price book and populate to sales.<br />

thanks<br />

<br />
Instead of using Price Book directly, you can use Price Matrix. In that matrix you have to attach your price book then you can define you prices on different attributes.<br />

I'm using the matrix like what you said diff attr for diff areas of usage, however current the SO contract can't translate the price define in the price book over is actually bug, like what arijke mention, probably it will be fix in FP4.<br />
<br />
so i was thinking to customize some form to do dal.update() on so after convert but discover something interesting, script was there. statement compare tdsls301.* if 0 return error was the constraint. guess u know what i did subsequently, haha.<br />
