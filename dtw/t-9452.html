<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sammeer</div><div class="date">1st April 2003, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
you can read the following text as  for detailed understanding<br />
<br />
It may not be specific to Baan procedures but it highlights the basic commercial procedure which any erp/system developer/ vendor should incorporate while designing &amp; maping the concept.<br />
<br />
Ship Complete Only Sales Orders ( Staged)<br />
<br />
When sales orders have the Ship Complete Only flag set to on ( mandatory)They are treated differently than those sales orders that do not. <br />
Ï	When the Ship Complete Only flag is set to on, and all inventory is either in stock or in the receiving location, the sales order will be processed as normal.<br />
Ï	When the Ship Complete Only flag is set to on, and the order cannot be shipped complete, the inventory that can be shipped will be staged until the remaining inventory is available.<br />
A sales order will be staged if it has already been staged by a previous batch shipping session or if it has the Ship Complete Only flag set to on and there is insufficient inventory in the receiving area to fully ship the order.<br />
If the sales order is to be staged, then any quantities selected for the sales order will be moved to the staging area from the receiving location. An automatic pick will also be performed from stock for any remaining quantities.<br />
Once any remainder has been staged from stock, the system should check the quantity staged against the quantity ordered for each line.<br />
Ï	If the quantity staged is equal to or greater than the quantity ordered on all lines, the sales order is considered shipped complete, and will be shipped. <br />
Ï	If the quantity staged is less than the quantity ordered for one or more sales order lines, the sales order will remain partially staged until the remaining inventory to ship the sales order is received and the sales order can be staged the rest of the way.<br />

<br />
I will use this discussion to place my complaint about staged inventory. When we are trying to sell out Lot controlled Item it always goes to the staging location and that's it. For non-Lot items we've never had any problems.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make sense - seems to be bug or misconfig...when I try to release the Outbound advice I get:<br />
Read row error 850 on whltc313...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan5guy</div><div class="date">11th March 2004, 13:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you please give the exact error in more detail<br />
<br />
it would be great if you can also place the relevant portion of bshell log. that way it would be easier to find the exact cause of error</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tzwetan</div><div class="date">11th March 2004, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the solution from the Baan support:<br />
1. From a command prompt type the following command: <br />
        bdbpre -N &lt;table name&gt; -O &lt;output file name&gt; -C &lt;company number&gt; <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
        bdbpre -N tdsls040 -O tdsls040.pre -C 550 <br />
<br />
2. Once your dump file is created, run this command to drop and recreate the table from your dump: <br />
        bdbpost -m -n -f -k -I (this is capital i) &lt;output file name from above&gt; -c &lt;company number&gt; <br />
<br />
Example: <br />
        bdbpost -m -n -f -k -I tdsls040.pre -c 550 <br />
<br />
3. Then run the session Reorganize Tables (ttaad4225m000) for the table in question with the Reference Integrity option being the ONLY one checked. (Do not check Data and Indices)</div></div><hr />
