<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">18th November 2003, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I set up a credit limit to a customer. My SLS parameter says yes to Block if Credit limit is exceeded.<br />
I have a certain order type, a collect order, whose steps go from 1 Print Order acknowledgment directly to 6 Print sales Invoices. so my blocking is as of step 1. My test shows that its not blocking a customer when i do this. What causes a sales order to override a blocking logic?<br />
<br />
Certain Order types with Picking list status (2) and blocking as of step 2 works fine. any comment on this? Can somebody suggest a workaround. TIA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My undersatnding of Collect Order is that it will not look at 'Print Order Acknowledgements' as a step as the inventory is issues immediatley after each SO line is saved.  Therefore a collect order would not be of use for credit control purposes</div></div><hr />

<br />
I searched Baan's website and got this from Solution 112254:<br />
<br />
&quot;It is Standard Functionality that for Sales Order Type from type COLLECT it is not possible to insert the Block As of Order Step.<br />
The reason is that the customer is already at the supplier site to collect the material and it is not nice to refuse.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
A verbal confirmation from the manager on the course of action and depending on the customer , the situation is dealt with.</div></div><hr />
