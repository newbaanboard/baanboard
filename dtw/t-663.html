<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PV Ramone</div><div class="date">20th December 2001, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">We want the users (or some of them) to only release item for 1 production order at a time. So we want them only to enter the order number field and the other fields should be filled automatically with defaults.<br />
Is there any one who has done this already without havy customization ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">20th December 2001, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
We have a similar situation. In order to try and prevent users from releasing all outbound data by mistake we have modified the form so that the order number range defaults to 0 - 0 rather than 0 -999999. Although this does not prevent the user from releasing large ranges of orders it has helped to reduce the number of mistakes. Other fields defaults are set by user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">20th December 2001, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">For the orno.t field, try:<br />
<br />
(1) Set the default to 0 (this prevents the wide open range)<br />
(2) Set the Inp/Ref expression field (under default) to 0.  This prevents entry in the field.  The value will change automatically with entry in orno.f<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this would limit your ability with other types of orders.  If you wanted to get specific with production orders, you could change the input/ref field to not (koor.f=tdilc.koob.act.sfc and koor.t=tdilc.koob.act.sfc).  Then, if your range was production order to production order for order type, it would prevent entry in the orno.t field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike Richard</div><div class="date">21st December 2001, 14:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an FYI and a friendly suggestion.  I would suggest any session that is a process function that you put a or a couple of key defaults that force the users to put in exactly what they want, even if they want a range.  We have done 3 implementations (Triton, 4b, 5b and soon 5c) and this is one of the first things we do.  There is nothing worse than getting the phone call from someone new to the system or having just having a bad day tell you they just lit up a global order transfer or as stated above outbound, or checkrun by accident.  We have tried our best to dummy proof the system, since at times in testing I have been the dummy lighting up one of these types of runs.  Being a user I always found it annoying that Baan expected everyone to be perfect.  Trying to reverse things if someone makes a mistake in this system is very difficult if not impossible.  On top of that they choose a default in print and process of wide open.  One would figure that with as many trouble calls as they have to solve that they might understand that that the world is not perfect and they we as users need a way to deal with mistakes other than having to go into general table maintenance to undo things.  Until then we will have to do  our best to remove as many opportunities for error as possible by putting in the 0-0 defaults.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jan Park</div><div class="date">21st December 2001, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Since everyone is human and will make mistakes we use the 0-0 default wherever sensible. Not just on processes but also print options since people will accidentally re-print every invoice in the system instead of the one copy they wanted :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prademaker</div><div class="date">28th December 2001, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">We did it by customizing the form. We changed the &quot;order-to&quot; field so that the user can't fill it.<br />
The same could be done for other fields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A Chakrabarti</div><div class="date">4th January 2002, 13:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Release Outbound is one session where accidents are very common. I did face several horrible situations at customer locations as I work as a consultant. You may try the following:<br />
<br />
- Block access rights to the main session 'Release Outbound' to all users and allow only the subsession 'Release Outbound' access rights to specific users who need to issue materials.<br />
<br />
- Use order no series specific to department and user(to the lowest level possible). Allow access rights for the applicable order series and order type only for table data.<br />
<br />
i hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
