<br />
Requisition – Line Details (3rd tab) – General Ledger field<br />
<br />
Though, Help Text say that this field is NOT mandatory, We would like to know if there has been a <br />
solution developed by INFOR to force the user to enter a “General Ledger” value in session tdpur2102s000 <br />
when that field is activated. <br />
<br />
As of today, some users making purchase requests to our Purchase Department tend to forget to <br />
complete that specific field and are saving the Requisition without General Ledger information <br />
which is critical for our account payable analysis.<br />
<br />
At the same time, not all requisitions/items categories require that field to be activated.<br />
<br />
Please see screenhsots attached.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
BOBBY</div></div><hr />

I haven't worked on LN and in case of Baan 4 C4 you could copy the Session / Form to current VRC and in Form make the field session mandatory.<br />
<br />
i assume it must be a almost similar.<br />
<br />
all the best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not an option, because in standard the field is editable resp. not editable based on item type. So making it mandatory will prob. produce conflicts.<br />
<br />
To Bobby,<br />
i have no idea on LN, but on 5.0c there is a possibility to default the ledger account field in PURCHASE ORDERS based on the Integration Setup. The same Logic is implemented in Requisitions.<br />
As i know there are heavy changes in Integration between 5.0c and LN you have to search for the similar functionality. It should be there.<br />
