<br />
Check if there is a display(&quot;whinh310.text&quot;) called once the record is saved. I guess its a standard program so it will be best to check if you have all the related solutions installed else you can log an incident with Infor and request a fix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for reply.<br />
I have also try display(&quot;whinh310.text&quot;) in before display object section as well but also it is not coming but if that was the problem then it should come when i refresh manually.<br />
I already created the standard ticket. <br />
<br />
Thanks you<br />

<br />
You cannot use a display() within before.display.object:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes we should not use display() in before.display.object.<br />
But as test is not coming I have tried all the possible way to appear test description but its not appearing.<br />
I have written in after.update.db.commit: section and also in update.db.<br />
<br />
but even also same problem.<br />
