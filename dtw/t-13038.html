<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kevinm</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a subsidiary company whose sales reps are paid a commission based upon the unit price of the item the rep writes the order for. <br />
<br />
For example :  Item A <br />
<br />
  Sales Price/ unit                Commission rate <br />
<br />
 0.05 - $1.00                              3%<br />
<br />
 $1.00 - 2.49                              5%<br />
<br />
$2.50 - 999999                          10% <br />
<br />
I have no experience in a table setup like this. Everything I read in the manuals indicates variable based on the extended prices <br />
( qty X price ) . Anyone had this before or has a solution ? <br />
Or is this an obvious setup I am simply overlooking</div></div><hr />

<br />
did I get your question right that you would like to have several commisson rates for the same item?<br />
Basicly you are right: the calculation is based on qty * price if you choose 'Grade by Amount' in the agreement parameters. But you can also define a 'Grade by Quantity' for your agreement (with an extra grade unit), so the calculation is based on the quantity in the salesorderline. I'm not sure if that's what you intended to do...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kevinm</div><div class="date">18th September 2003, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">No the situation is this ... based on  a sale quantity of one the possibility of a different commission rate exists. The rate varies strictly by the unit price the rep is able to obtain.<br />
<br />
This motivates the rep to get the top unit price but offers them flexibility to reduce price and accordingly there commission rate. The table I attempted to put on the board got jumbled but I will try to graphically do it again <br />
<br />
 Item A <br />
<br />
Unit price                         Commission rate<br />
 $.50 - $1.00                              3%<br />
 $ $1.01 - 2.50                           5%<br />
  $ 2.50 - 999999                      10%<br />
Quantity and extended price are not really variables in establishing the commission rate. The single unit price establishes the appropriate rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">19th September 2003, 09:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got it now. Indeed there is no particular setting in Baan that will exactly meet your needs :( <br />
There may be a kind of workaround by using a profit margin. A lower unit price reduces your profit and leads to a reduced commisson rate. Of course the profit is calculated according to the cost price of the item. Depending on your strategy in costprice calculation the basis of commission calcutation will change within a week, month or year. Is that applicable for your situation?<br />
