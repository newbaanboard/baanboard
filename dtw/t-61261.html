<br />
This is an extremely strange problem I am experiencing and have never experienced this problem before. Our despatch personell are trying to &quot;print picking list&quot; for a specific Sales Order. When we view the Sales Order line status screen, it states - &quot;print picking list&quot;, however, when we go and try print the &quot;picking list&quot;, the error &quot;No data within selection&quot; appears.<br />
<br />
Anyone got an idea on where I should look for the problem? I have confirmed that the Sales Order is not blocked, the customer is not blocked. I have confirmed that their is available quantity of the item concerned.<br />
<br />
Just finding it strange that the picking list will not print. Any ideas? :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a couple of obvious things that spring to mind. Have you checked that there's not anything odd going on with the order date ?<br />
<br />
Does the order print when you set the already printed flag to &quot;yes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cheers Neal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozure Ohashi</div><div class="date">7th October 2011, 00:38</div></div><div class="posttext">The switch &quot;Enter Specific order&quot; is yes.<br />
<br />
There is a subform behind the switch where you can enter up to 10 specific order numbers. Maybe it is empty or an old number is in the subform (User defaults?). In this case the selection order from/to on the main form is not evaluated (with option Enter specific order = yes).<br />
<br />
Another Point the field &quot;Item to&quot;: are there all ZZZZ (16 times) filled or is one missing in the end? The item in the order has 16 characters starting with an Z, therefore will not be in the selection.<br />
<br />
Please try to tab all fields of the mask, maybe then it will print.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
