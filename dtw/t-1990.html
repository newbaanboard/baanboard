<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">10th May 2002, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">We have recently restructured our companies in Baan and as a consequence we have data in the tdinv001 - Item by warehouse table which we would like to delete. As there are over 5000 records we would like to remove the data outside of the tdinv0101m000 session. I have initial concerns that if we delete data from the database level, bypassing the tdinv0101m000 session, we could cause issues with inventory calculations/values in other Baan sessions/tables. <br />
<br />
I thought maybe I could take a sequential dump of this table, remove the data and reload the dump back into Baan. But I'm sure this will cause problems as mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else ever had the requirement to delete this number of records from this table and if so how did you do it?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I have bad news, I sat for 3 days and deleted through the session.  If you do not you will end up with lots of phantom records and references in other tables, I had tested on our devlp system and found this to happen.  <br />
<br />
Sorry I didn't have a silver bullet, but that the way the Baan ball bounces..............<br />

Even without the source, you can write a script to delete the records in there, keeping the session logic.<br />
<br />
Here's the pseudo code:<br />
<br />
Select all the records in tdinv001<br />
For each record:<br />
     Issue a stpapi.put.field for the session index fields<br />
     Issue a stpapi.find to make the record current<br />
     Issue a stpapi.delete to remove the record<br />
           - Issue a stpapi.recover &amp; write error file if delete fails<br />
<br />
This board has help and links on the stpapi commands (search on stpapi).  They will follow all the session logic, so should update all the inventory calculations.</div></div><hr />

I have never used stpapi, but I am definitely going to check it out.</div></div><hr />
