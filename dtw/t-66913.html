<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ubhat12</div><div class="date">24th September 2014, 19:09</div></div><div class="posttext">in our company we want to develop Vendor Registration process.Suppose a computer is supplied by 5 dealers  at different addresses and out of these 3 dealers have registered in the vendor  database.Next time when we float an inquiry for computer the name of only the 3 dealers should be copied into the purchase inquiry so that only they will be required to quote thus speeding up the purchase cycle time.<br />
Please give some idea about how to achieve this i.e maintaining the vendor database and the items supplied by them. and to bring it into the purchase inquiry</div></div><hr />

If you want to generate the list by using create.listbox() and can read the supplier master to generate this list dynamically. But I guess this will take some time as system will have to generate this list on fly. But you can give a try.<br />
