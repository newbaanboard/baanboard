Can this excess transfer be blocked ???</div></div><hr />

<br />
it is not possible to block excessive quantity for deliveries. In my opinion this is not so bad because Baan always sets the outstanding quantity (order quantity resp. back quantity) as default. Thus a lower or higher value can only be entered intentionally. Of course this implies that the warehouse personal do not exceed their competencies.<br />
<br />
Sorry that I have no better answer for you.<br />

Which company would reject extra money? Anyway, BaanERP (ie version 5) in its initial release tried to fix this by not allowing delivery exceeding qty authorised in SO. However, I guess users want the flexibility to over-deliver (like in BaanIV) to be implemented back into BaanERP. In the end, Baan made available the over-deliver feature in BaanERP, but it's controlled with tolerance percentage instead of simply allow/disallow over-delivery. As to whether Baan made such tolerance percentage control available in later update of BaanIV, I'm not so sure. It'd sure be nice, though, to have it in BaanIV also<br />

There are lot of requirement for the same from every corner of the world.This functionality is there for purchase order,production order. Should BAAN add the resolution to this may be giving the option in the parameter session?<br />

   There are no parameter settings for this but the only way to tackle this, according to me, is to put a trigger. You could either put a tolerance or block excess deliveries in this trigger. <br />
<br />
We had a similar requirement in the maintain receipts where we wanted to put a tolerance on the received qty against the ordered. This was resolved using a trigger on the pur045 table..<br />
<br />
So good luck triggering...<br />

<br />
In LN 6.1, the parameter can control whether you want to over-delivery or not. <br />
You may consider to upgrade to LN 6.1. I find that customers generally find it worth to upgrade to LN 6.1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">9th September 2006, 21:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is an option, to upgrade to LN....but i have yet to see a company or an organization upgrade to LN just to have control over this particular issue(Control of delivered quantities). <br />
<br />
To obtain the license to the program script would have been a much nearer suggestion after triggers...<br />

Search for RMCgen (my company's version), QKEY, or 'rush' on these boards.  Any consulting firm could also do this mod for you very simply/cheaply, we have done this same thing in many different ways.  The thing to consider is exactly what change you want made, exactly what session, and if there are any other considerations, like EDI or alternate methods of deliveries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noorulhaq</div><div class="date">23rd September 2006, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Having trigger on tdsls045 (database level)  is the simple solution except few problems. Maintain deliveries session will get hang when the user try to deliver more than the order quantity without giving any warning. Also trigger will disappear when the table is re-organized, so the trigger needs to reapplied if the table is re-organized.</div></div><hr />
