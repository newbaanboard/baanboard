This would be an error that occurs before the invoice is cut.  Is there a way to back out a shipment to ensure invoicing is correct?  <br />
<br />
With the statuses on sales orders, we have not found a way other than re-creating a new sales order and shipping it through (we could use the auto-sales order type that does the shipping).<br />
<br />
Any thoughts here?<br />

<br />
that depends on the order procedure that you are using. Especially the setup for the re-execution of the order steps is important. Can you provide this information?<br />
We simply undo or correct the order step &quot;Maintain Deliveries&quot; and print the invoice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">6th February 2004, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">You can &quot;correct&quot; order steps (with general table maintaince) only if you are not using the finance integration for inventory movements (otherwise your stock ledgers would be wrong). Indeed, there is no other way in Baan IV to handle such a situation correctly but to <br />
- invoice the wrong shipment, <br />
- create a return order, <br />
- invoice that return order as a credit note, <br />
- enter a new order with the correct data, <br />
- ship and invoice this one.<br />
<br />
Baan is not very error tolerant here.<br />

We have introduced a new step in order sale order procedure like- &quot;Order in picking&quot; , &quot;Order in packing&quot;, &quot;Order in Shipping&quot;. We don't release the inventory till the end of the day. When a sales order is picked and packed we move the inventory from our normal warehouse to a logical warehouse. At the end of the day we then relieve the inventory. This has given us the ability to back out easily and do future ship orders. <br />
We have a third party shipping software and that we have interfaced with Baan. So this is all being tightly integrated. Our packing slip comes out of shipping s/w. <br />
But this  is the way we have designed the process at our place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">9th February 2004, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
Actually we do a packing and shipping operation toegther. A user when does packing gets the shipping label. We streamlined the process by combining two different processes and the shipping software helped us in that.<br />
<br />
Our third party shipping d/w does following things<br />
1. UPS and Fedex carrier shipping. It produces the  shipping labels.<br />
2. It handles shipment for Trucking companies.<br />
3. It does item, quantity verification if the item is on the picking list. We also record serial number if the item is serialized.<br />
4. Record the carton content of each carton in shipment. We then transmit this information to our customer via email. The same information is brought into Baan. So customer service from Baan screen can look what was packed in each box. This has eliminated the filing work of picking list, and greatly reduced our errors in shipping.<br />
5. Based on the information we get from shipping s/w we have  implemented EDI with UPS and Fedex- EDI 240 and EDI 214 transaction. That let us allow capture the detail tracking. We get this information from UPS and Fedex. If there is some problem in package or package is not delivered, we generate an exceptional email to customer service, so that we can be proactive.<br />
<br />
Currently we don't have RF, but it is on our plate.<br />
<br />
The name of software is Cargoware. It is not the greatest, based on some old technology. But we got what we invested in the software. It works for us.</div></div><hr />
