Why both. What do they do. I also seen a sequence number 2 if you care to elaborate on that also?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">28th February 2006, 09:16</div></div><div class="posttext">When you create a sales/purchase order line a record is automatically inserted in tdsls045/tdpur045 with a sequence no zero.  When a delivery/receipt is done against the order then a sequence 1 record is created.  If there are multiple deliveries/receipts then you will see multiple records in there tables for an order line.  The exception I think is collect orders.  There is usually only a sequence zero records created for these types of orders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanDeveloper</div><div class="date">28th February 2006, 15:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you - when there are multiple deliveries and receipts is a unique srnb used for each? Or are all deviveries and receipts issued srnb = 1</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is a difference between deliveries and receipts. The first delivery starts with the sequnce number 0. The first receipt on the other hand is the sequence number 1. Sequece number 0 in tdpur045 is kind of a copy of the purchase order line used to generate new receipt lines.</div></div><hr />
