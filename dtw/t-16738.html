  I'm working with Baan IV in distribution.<br />
  I've one query is there any way by which i can create PO line having cost price of cost price item with 3 decimal places.<br />
Current data is stored with two decimal places .<br />
Price fileds accept data in 3-4 decimal place but round it with 2 decimal places.<br />
<br />
Is there any way by which i can store thios without affecting existing data.<br />
<br />
I've seen discussion on this topic on baanboard where it is written that maintaining decimal data in tcmcs0102m000 will serve the purpose but i've checked up that also it does not allow b'cause of existig data in 2 decimal format.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kindly revert back ..<br />

<br />
For this you better contact BaaN Support for changing the Domain size. I don't think without changing the Domain size, it is possible. We have also faced similar problem. Pls report baan support.<br />

                Thanks for reply.<br />
                 Repoprting to baan support and get the solution will definitely take some time .<br />
                If you 've faced similar problem earlier than how did you manage to work with it.<br />
