I was wondering if anyone has gone through the process of resetting first free numbers?  If so, I was wondering if someone could tell me if Baan should seek out and find the next available number in a given series, or if it just adds one to the number identified in the &quot;First Free Number&quot; field.<br />
<br />
My problem is that we have many production orders that show as being available, but when I reset the &quot;First Free Number&quot; for this &quot;Series,&quot; it tells me that it is &quot;Unable to retreive first free number.  Try again?&quot;  I am trying to understand how the first free number functionality works as it pertains to the production orders.<br />
<br />
I guess I was under the impression that Baan seeked out the next 'available' number.  For example, if a series was defined for number &quot;20,&quot; and &quot;Series&quot; &quot;20&quot; had numbers &quot;200010&quot; and &quot;200400&quot; available, and I reset the &quot;First Free Number&quot; in this series back to &quot;1,&quot; it would find number &quot;200010&quot; and then &quot;200400.&quot;<br />
<br />
But, in my tests, even when I have available numbers to use, it comes back and tells me that it is unable to retreive first free number.  Is this standard functionality or is this a bug?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />

It does not truly look for &quot;free&quot; numbers, the are assumed to be so.  I supposed that you could rewrite some of the tcmcsdll0004 functionality to do what you want.  Perhaps there's another way, but I haven't seen such a thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baan does look for the next available number. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately though, BaaN always checks 25 numbers, then brings up this message and if you press &quot;yes&quot; it checks the next 25 numbers and so on.  <br />
<br />
So, if you keep pressing yes, it will eventually find the first available number. <br />
<br />

P.S.: That only applies to manually entered SFC orders. PRP and MRP seeks the next available number without bringing up messages. I heard about problems with transferring MRP though and I believe there is a patch available for that.</div></div><hr />
