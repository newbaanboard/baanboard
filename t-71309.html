<br />
I found a way to tear this file down with a Bash shell script:<br />
<br />
First the normally big file TIME.HIS is splitted into<br />
many little files named th-aaa, th-aab, th-aac....<br />
This is just needed if the file TIME.HIS is really big and the following awk will not work on this big file.<br />
<br />
Then these files are searched for sessions and users:<br />
<br />
For every found session it makes a file and writes the<br />
users that have used this<br />
<br />
For every found user it makes a file and writes the<br />
sessions that the user opened<br />
<br />
Enjoy and be free to use this file...<br />
Don't forget to create the used directory structure beforehand. ;)<br />
