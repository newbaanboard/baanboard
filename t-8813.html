We were archiving just one project.  We see the Subcontracting order 100849 in the Maintain Purchase Orders session and wonder what to do next?  How do we get this error to go away?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

That can be done with &quot;Process Delivered Purchase Orders&quot; and &quot;Delete Order Data&quot; on yes. <br />

Okay - this seems to have solved our problem.  Another question though - should we be concerned that we are deleting our sales and purchase order data?  I see there is no archive session for sales orders or purchase orders so, I'm thinking that all the information about our sales and purchase orders will be included in the archiving of sales and purchase statistics.  Is this correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

yes, you should be concerned. The way it works in Baan standard: <br />
<br />
Sales order and purchase order lines, which are linked to a PCS project, are copied to the archive company when &quot;Archive Projects&quot; runs. Baan doesn't give you the opportunity to archive standard sales and purchase order lines (without PCS projects). I haven't found a company yet, that is satisfied with only keeping the statistic. <br />
<br />
The statistic doesn't give you any details about orders, deliveries or receipts and is not sufficient e.g. for warranty requirements. It just gives you aggregated turnover, cancellation and order intake figures. Companies are usually not too happy with this and try to extract the sales and purchase order data that they want to keep and store it in some form. I've developed the necessary sessions to archive purchase and sales data (as I'm sure most consulting companies have by now) as I found this the simplest solution and I'm a fan of keeping everything in one place. <br />
<br />
I've put some information and FAQs about archiving on my website. Maybe it's helpfull to you. (www.maxsc.com)<br />
