<br />
We are working on Sun Solaris with clients on win 98 &amp; BaaN IVc4<br />
<br />
What exactly i want to do is we are having Network Printer on which user are firing reports from many locations. Also we are having many report that goes beyond 255 column width. So we print such reports by changing printer settings. And the print comes nice. No problem at all. But everytime it's not advicable to change setting &amp; also it is not possible. So what I want is our session should take care of such print settings. Is there any work out in baan to control the print settings i.e. character width. <br />
We have given report font to 17cpi. Is there any way to change beyond that.<br />

<br />
U have not mentioned the device setting . I believe users use Windows printer .<br />
<br />
U can specify the report defaults ttaad3105m000 . That sets the default device setting for printing.<br />
<br />
In case of windows printer, your printer settings of client PC also should match the device setting in Baan.</div></div><hr />
