<br />
My company needs to create and manage a german company in our Baan IVC4 server. We use ps, tc, td, tf, ti and tu) . We'll create it in languaje 2, as we have no local german support .. I have a few questions for the kind german users on the forum:<br />
<br />
-Do you know the &quot;standard&quot; names of the VRC's /PVRC for the German localizations?. I understand that the &quot;C&quot; is &quot;ger0&quot; , and &quot;gerx&quot; for the updates, but we are not sure..<br />
<br />
<br />
-Are there so many localizations , and how important /mandatory they are?<br />
<br />
- Are they translated to english? <br />
<br />
- There is any special advice for this procedure <br />
<br />
<br />
Any help, advice, suggestion... will be welcome.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
just confirm with Infor that German localisation is available for Baan IVc4..in german language or english...<br />
<br />
VRC std name fpr localisation is nothing, its simple the name which you have defined when you create the VRC for localisation..</div></div><hr />

Do someone knows what is the &quot;Finance Brush Up&quot;?<br />
<br />
It's a bit strange, as it seems like a mega patch, but has the stucture of an added fucntionality..<br />
<br />
Thanks again, and best regards!<br />

<br />
we are not using it ... but as far as i know:<br />
<br />
The finance brushup exists in 3 stages I, II, III (III is the latest release).<br />
<br />
It contains functionality for special german tax treatment (hgb) and some special functions like electronic payment &quot;dtaus&quot;.<br />
<br />
It was developed for the german users in cooperation with the local german user group.<br />
<br />
My understanding: German localisation and finance brushup is the same.<br />
<br />
Any comments from german users?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Kozure</div></div><hr />

<br />
No,<br />
<br />
the FBU is on top of the German localisation.<br />
so you have a vrc-structure like this :<br />
<br />
B40 c4	Standard<br />
B40Uc4            Patch Standard<br />
B40X c4 cnt0	CNT<br />
B40U c4 cnt0	Patch CNT<br />
B40S c4 ger0	GER0 VRC<br />
B40U c4 ger0	Patch VRC<br />
B40S c4 fbu3	FBU-3 VRC<br />
B40U c4 fbu3	Patch VRC<br />
B40C c4 abcd	Customer VRC<br />
<br />
Solutions for FBU-3 comes as PMC-Solutions .<br />
For Installation you had to create with PMC-Tools a new Update-VRC. The Base-VRC for this must bei named as B40S_c4_fbu3.<br />
