ich hoffe, Sie sind am Mittwoch noch gut nach Hause gekommen. Hier die versprochenen Tips inkl. neuester Solution zur Journalisierung:Please find here the anwer to your question about how to prevent errors with <br />
finalisation:1. How to prevent errors from happening ?<br />
2. How to solve the errors when they occur ?<br />
1. How to prevent errors from happening ?<br />
A heavy workload and low performance can create these kind of problems. If you <br />
want to prevent the error you can take the following actions:<br />
- Use transactions with update mode &quot;finalisation&quot; (less locks on the history <br />
tables).<br />
- Do not finalise all the batches at the same time/ time period. (Not all <br />
before lunch, after lunch or before going home.) - Use smaller batches. <br />
- Make sure users do not turn off their machines while the background process <br />
has not finished yet. (Let them wait for the unix-dollar sign).<br />
- Use finalisation mode for integration transactions.<br />
- Make sure you use recent software for the finalisationproces (solution 14745)<br />
2. How to solve the errors when they occur ?<br />
In your situation a batch was unsuccesfully finalized. Part of the batch was <br />
still in tfgld102 and part was in tfgld106.<br />
What can you do in a similar situation? In this case it is hard to avoid using <br />
ttaad4100 ! Baan has created a correctionprogram, but if you want to run this <br />
program, you have to set some statusses in tfgld100, tfgld101 and tfgld109.<br />
When a finalization is aborted and the batch is partly in tfgld102 and partly <br />
in tfgld106, you should use correctionprogram otfcor0203: Restart Finalisation <br />
Process. This correction program is made for Update mode:- Real time<br />
- End of session<br />
You can also use this programm for Update mode 'finalization', but then the  <br />
backgroundproces must have been run (for update mode finalistion: the <br />
backgroundproces is started first and after that the moving of the records from <br />
102 to 106 starts).However, there are some conditions for using otfcor0203:<br />
- the batch should have transactions in tfgld102 and tfgld106<br />
- the batch should have batchstatus 'finalization in proces' (in tfgld100) and <br />
the finalisation status should be &quot;selected for finalisation&quot; (tfgld100). <br />
Further, the status in tfgld101 should be &quot;finalisation in process&quot;.<br />
- the finalization runnumber should have the status 'in use (2)'. Check this in <br />
tfgld109.<br />
If these settings are correct, then you can start the program and this will <br />
move the remaining records from tfgld102 to tfgld106.<br />
As the finalisation proces is interrupted, we always advise customers to run <br />
Rebuild History tfgld3203m000 for the period of the runnumber concerned.</div></div><hr />
