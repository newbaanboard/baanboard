<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">19th March 2004, 02:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I get the feeling, you are getting a little confused with some terminology...<br />
<br />
When the code runs and creates the Baan4.Application, it is NOT the Baan application, that it is creating... It is an application object. Hence, the Baan application can be installed on any server, but you can still create the Baan4.Application object on any OLE compliant system (MS-Excel, VB, MS-Access, etc...).<br />
<br />
All you need, is the Baan 4 client installed (from a specific version, but can't remember which)... The version you have (B40c.67) is fine. If this is installed, on the client machine, then the client machine can create a Baan 4 Application Object.<br />
<br />
To check, on the machine you are trying to run this code on, open REGEDIT and open the key;<br />
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT<br />
There will be literally thousands of entries. Scroll down to;<br />
Baan4.Application<br />
<br />
If there is an entry, then you should be able to create the OLE object. Otherwise, you will need to re-install the BW client.<br />
<br />
VB will then talk to Baan through the application object it created (you should have an Option Dialog appear, but no menu browser). It passes the commands through an OLE daemon (ottstpeoldaem) to process the OLE commands.<br />
<br />
Because it opens a BW client, it requires a user name/password (hence takes a Baan licence) and requires a BWC (Baan Windows Configuration) file to be setup, that holds the details on how to connect to your Baan application.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will need to check which user is logging on, when the following line runs;<br />
Set Baanobj = CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application&quot;)<br />
In other words, who logs on, when the bwc file is activated (if no logon box appears, then check the BW configuration file to see what user name is stored, as the password has been saved in the configuration).<br />
<br />
Check which package combination this user is attached to and find out if the VRC level of the library 'tccomdllbaan' is in the derivation structure of this package combination...</div></div><hr />

As per solution provided by both of you i have got success in opening baan session through VB. <br />
Now i come to the point of Baan Licences<br />
<br />
well i found that when user open any baan session through VB it take number of user licence<br />
<br />
how can i achive that only one Baan licence should occup. by the time any number of user use baan session through VB .<br />
<br />
I hope solution is there<br />
plz. help me out about this matter<br />
i'll be thankful of u<br />

<br />
I have written the following code in a VB program.<br />
<br />
Set BaanObj = CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application&quot;)<br />
BaanObj.ParseExecFunction &quot;ottstpstandard&quot;, &quot;zoom.to.menu(&quot;&quot;tisfcm901m000&quot;&quot;,2,&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;,0,0)&quot;<br />

SendKeys (&quot;{TAB}&quot;)<br />
SendKeys (&quot;{enter}&quot;)<br />
BaanObj.Quit<br />
Set BaanObj = Nothing<br />
<br />
<br />
The idea is to simulate press &lt;Enter&gt; over the Execute button of the session to automatically execute it. But in my case the SendKeys lines are not working.<br />
<br />
What I'm doing wrong?,<br />
What's missing?<br />
<br />
Tks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th January 2007, 00:36</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the help you have to activate the app.  I am not sure if you can do that in this case.  In my little test macro once the session is launched with the parse function excel does not keep running - the focus does not return to excel until I close the session.  I really do not know enough about VB.  It would be really cool if someone could get this to work.<br />
<br />
This example uses the Shell function to run the Calculator application included with Microsoft Windows. It uses the SendKeys statement to send keystrokes to add some numbers, and then quit the Calculator. (To see the example, paste it into a procedure, then run the procedure. Because AppActivate changes the focus to the Calculator application, you can't single step through the code.). On the Macintosh, use a Macintosh application that accepts keyboard input instead of the Windows Calculator.<br />
<br />
Dim ReturnValue, I<br />
ReturnValue = Shell(&quot;CALC.EXE&quot;, 1)    ' Run Calculator.<br />
AppActivate ReturnValue     ' Activate the Calculator.<br />
For I = 1 To 100    ' Set up counting loop.<br />
    SendKeys I &amp; &quot;{+}&quot;, True    ' Send keystrokes to Calculator<br />
Next I    ' to add each value of I.<br />
SendKeys &quot;=&quot;, True    ' Get grand total.<br />
SendKeys &quot;%{F4}&quot;, True    ' Send ALT+F4 to close Calculator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry because of the duplicated issue, I didn't realize that I was replying this.<br />
<br />
Ok, according to your answer indeed I found the same code example to run the notepad appplication and it works perfectly well, unfortunelly this sort of applications belongs to Windows system32 and the shell can call them. I tried to do the same with the current Baan Session but it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Actually you can activate any other Window by means AppActivate &quot;window_name&quot; and it comes to first plan and you can do actions over it.<br />
<br />
But with BaaN sessions I didn't sucess.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm trying by means API to launch a standar session passing parameters from a new one.<br />
<br />
if you have anotther sugestion is wellcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th January 2007, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't think of a better suggestion.   There are examples around of using API with VB.  I do hope someone has other suggestions for the sendkeys - because I could find a use for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Al Smith</div><div class="date">12th January 2007, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it can be done but not with SendKeys.<br />
What you have to do is write directly to the window form. This requires using windows API's.<br />
<br />
The way a windows form works is that the displayed form is the Parent Window.<br />
Each control in the Parent is a child of that Parent. These are the Buttons, Textboxes, Labels, etc. in the form.<br />
The Parent and Child windows are identified internally by their Handle which is kind of the internal address.<br />
The problem is that the handles aren't static. They change each time the form is opened.<br />
The good thing is that they're always at the same index within the Parent.<br />
For example, the &quot;Find&quot; button in the form for tiitm0501m000 is always the 13th child.<br />
<br />
The trick is identifying the index of each child in the Parent Form.<br />
Once these are mapped, you can now control the form programmatically.<br />
<br />
Below is some VB module code that will:<br />
<br />
1. Start the Baan session tiitm0501m000 (Display Item Data).<br />
2. Click the Find button on the form.<br />
3. Populate the textbox of the Find window.<br />
4. Click the OK button of the Find window.<br />
<br />
To use the code, create a form in VB with a textbox and button. Set the button's click event to &quot;StartSession&quot;.<br />
Add a module to the project and copy the code below into the module.<br />
<br />
You'll probably need to modify the Shell command and the Windows titles for your system.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
