<br />
My script is as follows:<br />
<br />
Stpapi.handle.subproc(tfacp1110s000,tfacp1130s000,add)<br />
Stpapi.continue.process(tfacp1110s000, error.msg )<br />
<br />
tfacp1131s000 opens and the session hangs.  I have not been able to find any way to control tfacp1131s000. I do add it  in my script next.  <br />
<br />
Stpapi.handle.subproc(tfacp1130s000,tfacp1131s000, add)<br />
Stpapi.continue.process(tfacp1131s000,error.msg)<br />
<br />
If I start the shell and kill the process tfacp1131s000, the session continues. But I have not been able to kill it within script  API calls.<br />
<br />
This code was working in the old tools set.  <br />
Please - Can Any one suggest a solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

If so then you might be able to use a subroutine that I developed to kill un-ruly sessions.  I had to use this in my Create purchase order session.  Originally I was going to make it a normal session, but then never had time to finish it.  It has been a while since I looked at the code - I still have some doubts about it and know there are potential problems. Hope it helps - and improvements are welcome.  By the way part of the code was posted by NPR along time ago.<br />

<br />
Anyway here is the subroutine:<br />
<br />
<br />
function find.a.process()<br />
{<br />
	long    hold.pno<br />
	long    pno<br />
	long    info(256)<br />
	string  pname(15)<br />
	<br />
	sess.found = false<br />
	pno = 0<br />
	hold.pno = pno<br />
	pno = pstat (pno, pname, info)<br />
	while pno &gt; 0 and not sess.found<br />
		hold.pno = pno<br />
		pno = pstat (pno, pname, info)<br />
		if strip$(pname)=strip$(baan.sess) then<br />
			kill(hold.pno)<br />
			sess.found = true<br />
		endif<br />
	endwhile<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a sample of calling it - the reason code was session tcmcs9551s00b and it was automatically starting tdpur9151s00b.  I never could control it, but if I killed it I could then launch the session normally. Do not use pid so I do not know why it is included - hmmm.  Just a cut and paste of the code<br />
<br />
<br />
| Update reason code for change.<br />
	put_reason_code()<br />
|************ This is where it hoses..................................<br />
	ppid = pid<br />
	baan.sess = &quot;tdpur9151s00b&quot;<br />
	export(&quot;ppid&quot;,ppid)<br />
	export(&quot;baan.sess&quot;,baan.sess)<br />
	activate(&quot;tuddc9120m000&quot;)<br />
	stpapi.zoom.option(&quot;tdpur4107s000&quot;,1,&quot;tdpur9151s00b&quot;,fserr)</div></div><hr />
