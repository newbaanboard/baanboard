I'm keep listening from Inform support that they don't recommend AFS as a solution. They insist to use DAL or DLL but when you are in a customer that doesn't have source code how do you want to build a solution without knowing which DLL to use or how to create the DAL similar as standard?<br />

The only thing I can think of that might help is running some of the sessions they give you to see what a session uses - ie sessinfo(I think that is one name), bic_info, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would mention a few scenarios where bad standard code affects replacing AFS with DLL/DAL<br />
<br />
A. One day, I get to know a standard DLL to do some activity like release to warehousing say whinhdll.xyz(). And when I call it, it throws me garbage and non descriptive errors.<br />
<br />
Now, there could be following reasons for errors - <br />
<br />
Reason 1 -<br />
<br />
Retry Point was not set by me as it was not mentioned in the standard doc(ttstpbaandoc)<br />
<br />
Reason 2 - <br />
<br />
Before using DLL, some xyz table needs to be read<br />
<br />
Reason 3 - <br />
<br />
Before using DLL, some xyz DLL needs to be executed as a background process<br />
<br />
B. One day I decide to use DAL for creating Purchase Invoices. Now, there are numerous fields and a lot of tables involved which are not feasible to handle. <br />
Also, there are multiple DLL's involved during Purchase Invoice creation and offcourse not to forget, there are background 3GL programs which gets executed during Purchase Invoice creation.<br />
<br />
In case if I decide to go ahead, handle all this and update all the tables, without source code its impossible to handle all this.<br />
<br />
And when I just check the script for the Purchase Invoice session, the first line written is - <br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
disable.dal()<br />
<br />
What could be worse view than this. :)<br />
<br />
Offcourse, DAL &amp; DLL should be preferred over AFS as it easily beats AFS in terms of speed of execution(batch processing), error handling, group commits etc, but for some sessions, only AFS or a combination of DAL/DLL &amp; AFS will save a developer.<br />
<br />
So, to sum it up, AFS is not dead and won't be dead for long! And, being worked with Non-source code and source code environments, I feel, a developer with source code will always have an upper hand to reach an optimal solution.</div></div><hr />
