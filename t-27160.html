<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">22nd May 2006, 11:47</div></div><div class="posttext">We use Crystal Enterprise with Baan, some of our reports are pushed to the Crystal Enterprise version.<br />
The reports resides in two places, in the Baan Reports Layouts folder and in the Combined Reports folder. According to the manual I understand that it's the best to change report which resides in the Baan Reports Layouts folder however I notice that our software partner changes the reports in the combined reports folder.<br />
<br />
I am curious what other companies do and what is the advantage/disadvantage (besides what is described in the manual) of using one or the other.<br />
