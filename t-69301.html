I want to move Purchase Order BOD from LN to one folder in &quot;c&quot; drive of the ION server. How can I achieve the same? My work flow and events are working fine so connection is working fine between ION and LN.<br />
<br />
As far as I understood, I believe we will have to create document flow but I am not sure which type of connection should I use, also what should be the values in different fields? Can you please provide me some insight on this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you mean, you want ION to create the XML file on a folder in C drive? If that is the case, you need to create a new connection point as &quot;File&quot; and do the necessary setup like the folder name, ftp/sftp details, adding document etc.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot for your reply!!! Sorry for my late reply, I just wanted to confirm you that I was able to achieve my requirement. You response definitely helped me to put in the correct direction, thanks a lot!!!<br />
<br />
I am using standard purchase order approval work flow through &quot;object configuration management&quot; but somehow workflow is not getting completed. I am using demo image, provided by Infor. Workflow status is &quot;Approval Received&quot; in &quot;Checked out object&quot;, when I am trying to check in this object manually, I am getting following error:<br />
<br />
1. Fatal Error - Function &quot;handle.dependent.objects&quot;, recursion not possible; refcount =2<br />
2. Fatal error - Can not continue in ttocm9599m000 in dll 0tdpur400 (Handle.dependent.objects)[last.function:get.var]<br />
3. ttocm9599m000: A not terminated transaction is aborted (Handle.dependent.objects) in otdpur400<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you have any clue about this error and may help me in the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!!<br />
