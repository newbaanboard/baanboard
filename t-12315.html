<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">24th July 2003, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
        I am trying to run session Archive Project (tipcs2260m000) as a test just for one pcs project. But, I keep getting error message &quot;Purchase statistics not updated&quot; since there are few purchase orders linked to this pcs project.<br />
<br />
Now, we never implemented the purchase statistics module. It looked like I had to run Update purchase statistics (tdpst0201m000) and that's what I did. But, this session is been running for 15 hours and it's still not done.<br />
<br />
Couple of questions.<br />
<br />
1. Since we never implemented purchase statistics module, do I have to still run &quot;update purchase statistics&quot; session in order for &quot;Archive Projects&quot; session to archive and delete purchase orders?<br />
<br />
2. If I do have to run  &quot;update purchase statistics&quot;  session, is there any setup sessions I have go through before running this session.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
the archive session checks the field &quot;Log Purchase Order History&quot; in session tdpur5100m000 &quot;Maintain Purchase Order History Parameters&quot;.<br />
If the field is not set to no then the purchase statistic must be updated first.<br />

	I checked the session you mentioned and the field <br />
&quot;Log Purchase Order History&quot; is set to &quot;All&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, that means the I have to update purchase statistics. I have already kicked off the session &quot;Update purchase statistics (tdpst0201m000)&quot; but I don't think it's going to do anything since I have not set up any master data (purchase statistics period, sort codes etc.,). I will try and find any documentation on how to setup the purchase statistics module.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
