<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">26th June 2002, 08:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had some requests, to use ENUM descriptions through VB. Unfortunately, due to the fact that they are binary objects, they do not come through correctly, using DAO or RDO (or ODBC). As a result, you must use ADO to get the objects. Even then, the enum description is not stored in the binary object. Thus, to get the enum description is rather complex. It involves the following;<br />
<br />
a. determine the package combination of the current user<br />
b. find the highest level VRC of that package combination<br />
c. find the highest version of the table in that VRC level to find the domain used by the particular field (this is required, in case the table is customised and the domain of this field is changed)<br />
d. find the highest version of the domain in that VRC level to find the description of the particular enum value (this is required, in case the domain is customised and the description has been changed)<br />
<br />
<br />
Create a new project and ensure you have ADO activated for your project. To do this, from the menu bar, choose;<br />
Project, References<br />
Ensure 'Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.5 Library' is selected<br />
Add a module to your project and copy and paste the code from the attached text file 'ENUM_CD.TXT' into this module. You can then call this function with something like;<br />
MsgBox FindItemType(&lt;item code&gt;)<br />
<br />
If you want to find the enum description of a different table field, then simply plagerise this code and create your own function, similar to the FindItemType function (ensure that you call the 'PreChecksOkay' function the first time you run this, to set the global settings, such as user name, company, package combination, etc. Although, this code calls the PreChecksOkay function each time it runs, this function only needs to be called the first time this code is run. Therefore, you may wish to call this function in the Load event of your form and then not worry about calling it, when you get the enum descriptions).<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE: this example code assumes, that you have the tools tables and your company data tables, in the same database of your SQL server. If this is not the case, then you will need to create 2 connection objects. Also beware, this code will automatically connect to your SQL server, when activated, but will not disconnect. Ensure you disconnect (or close) the ADODB connection object either at the end of the 'FindItemType' function or when you close down your app. If you disconnect at the end of the FindItemType function, then ensure that you call the PreChecksOkay function each time, to re-establish the connection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are adding the enum as a field in a recordsource (eg: you have a db control and db grid based on the db control, then change the recordsource of the db control), you can use the 'CAST' and 'CASE' statements to display the enum descriptions on your grid. The disadvantage with this trick, is that you need to hard code the descriptions of your domains, which means, if you change your domain, you need to change your VB code.<br />
<br />
To do this, use something like;<br />
<br />
dbgrid.RecordSource = &quot;SELECT [ttiitm001100].[t_item] 'Item Code', &quot; &amp; _<br />
    &quot;[ttiitm001100].[t_dsca] 'Description', &quot; &amp; _<br />
    &quot;CASE CAST([ttiitm001100].[t_kitm] AS INT)&quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 0 THEN 'Empty' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 1 THEN 'Purchased' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 2 THEN 'Manufactured' &quot; &amp; _ <br />
        &quot;WHEN 3 THEN 'Generic' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 4 THEN 'Cost' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 5 THEN 'Service' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 6 THEN 'Subcontracting' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;END AS 'Item Type' &quot; &amp; _<br />
    &quot;FROM [ttiitm001100]&quot;<br />
dbgrid.Refresh</div></div><hr />

Benito, what do you mean by 'hiding code?' Baanboard does not hide code, you merely have the option to reformat the code using the Enscript integration (see this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5452)) The formatting only happens when you use the right 'CODE' tags however the admins and moderators scan through the posts regularly and insert these tags to improve readability.</div></div><hr />

How should I do it? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

May be Patrick will look into turning HTML off for this forum as well. We only use it in the Index thread to get tables.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not familiar with ASP, but it looks similar to VB. If this is the case, then there shouldn't be to much of a problem, using the 'CAST' and 'CASE' statements in the 'SELECT' part of your SQLString. Since you are creating an ADO recordset, then this select should still work. NOTE: you are not actually selecting the kitm field in your example. But something like the following should still work (unless there is something in ASP that I'm not aware of, that doesn't allow interrogation of binary fields), eg:<br />
<br />
SQLString = &quot;SELECT Item.t_item,Item.t_dsca,Item.t_citg, &quot; &amp; _ <br />
&quot;Item.t_stoc, &quot; &amp; _<br />
    &quot;CASE CAST(Item.t_kitm AS INT)&quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 0 THEN 'Empty' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 1 THEN 'Purchased' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 2 THEN 'Manufactured' &quot; &amp; _ <br />
        &quot;WHEN 3 THEN 'Generic' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 4 THEN 'Cost' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 5 THEN 'Service' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;WHEN 6 THEN 'Subcontracting' &quot; &amp; _<br />
        &quot;END AS 't_kitm' &quot; &amp; _<br />
     &quot;FROM ttiitm001500 As Item&quot;<br />
<br />
hope this helps...</div></div><hr />

it worked! you're brilliant. i'd never have thought of this solution. i attached the complete script. thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />
