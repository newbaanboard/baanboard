<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoachimKiefaber</div><div class="date">17th February 2004, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
I have the following problem:<br />
<br />
We work in two different companies with the same items.<br />
Therefore we need an update script, which transfers the data from our main company to the &quot;subcompany&quot; once a day/week, so that the items only need to be maintained in the main company.<br />
I wrote an AFS-Script to change/insert the items in the subcompany for Baan Standard Session tiitm0101m000.<br />
The update works very well for the first form, but the fields on all other forms are not updated.<br />
<br />
For example the field tiitm001.cwar on form 2.<br />
If I customize form 1 that way, that the field cwar is on this form, then the AFS Script updates the field cwar.<br />
<br />
Is there any &quot;change form&quot; that needs to be done ???<br />
Or is this only possible under Baan ERP ???<br />
By the way, we work with Baan IV c4 SP 8.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any hints in advance ?</div></div><hr />

There isn't a specific command to change the form, just because there is not an active form in AFS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the same problem before, and it was solved with a new solution of the ttstpapihand, please check to install the solution 141092 (it was the last one until last week).<br />
<br />
After the installation, if you used ttstpcreatdll to create the dll, please execute it again for the tiitm0101m000.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_nagu</div><div class="date">21st February 2004, 22:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I also experienced the same problem some time ago when I was trying to write an AFS for maintain purchase order lines session. It turned out that, when you run sessions using AFS, it sets the auto.nextform predefined variable to true to go to the next form automatically after entering data in the current form. This is key for AFS to fill the data in the fields of different forms of a session. If you think of it, it makes sense because when manually entering data in a session that donÂ’t have auto.nextform variable set to true, after entering data in form1, we have to manually switch to form2 and enter data. So, AFS achieves this by setting auto.nextform to true. <br />
<br />
	When I was writing the AFS for session tdpur4107s000, the AFS only kept filling the data in form1 and all the data that was supposed to be filled for the fields on form2, 3, 4 were ignored. When I ran the AFS, with session tdpur4107s000 compiled in debug mode, even though, the auto.nextform variable was set to true for the first time, it was reset to false with in the tdpur4107s000 session depending on values entered in some fields on form1 and some times choice.again option was also executed. That was what causing the AFS to not fill data in forms excepts form 1 since the auto.nextform was set to false. Since I had the source code for the session, I was able to modify it not to make the auto.nextform variable to false when api.mode is true (session is running through AFS). <br />
<br />
	You may want to try this if the problem still exists even after installing the solution suggested by Edger. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I made the same experiences with AFS dealing with updates on other forms than on form no.1  like you described above.<br />
<br />
I have solved the problem that way, that I have copied the whole session tiitm0101m000 to my active (customization VRC) only changing the form 1 (prrogram scripts is still Baan Standard). <br />
I have inserted all fields on the first form, that need to be updated in my AFS script. Now the form looks very &quot;crowded&quot;, but the new session is only for &quot;API use&quot;.<br />
This workaround should be used until we install the newest servicepack together with update of newest weekly dumps in a few weeks.<br />
We cannot update the &quot;ttstpapihand&quot; DLL (Solution 141092) easily, because we have serveral AFS-scripts in use which need to be tested intensively.</div></div><hr />
