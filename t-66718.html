<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th August 2014, 04:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Since it looks like you are on LN are there any dal functions that you might be able to use?  Do you have source code?  Do any of the sessions you mention ask for a financial company?  You might want to post your code.  Sometimes the way you control the sessions makes a difference - but not always.  I just did one on purchase order batch process that was very difficult to get to work -  in some cases I do not control the session at all.  As a matter of fact the session generates a BW error message at one point, but continues to work.  For the life of me I cannot figure out how to eliminate it - hoping the service pack we are going to put in solves it.<br />
<br />
I can't remember why but in 4c4 we never start with tfgld1101m000 - we go with tfgld1100m000, then to tfgld1101s000 - then to the various transactions.  Not sure that is related to your problem, but thought I would mention it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess, you were getting some other error a few days back.<br />

<br />
So, did you resolve that? If yes, kindly post your solution. Also, for this error, first check whether you are running the program from a proper finance company and then as Mark said, the DAL hooks might be causing problems due missing some DLL calls. If possible post your code snippet.Also, try switch.to.company() and switch to current company before starting the AFS calls to the problematic part of code.</div></div><hr />
