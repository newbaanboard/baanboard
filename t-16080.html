I would like to know if anyone has successfully done archiving on BaanIVc2 on Oracle with heavy customization?<br />
1.  What SP level should I have to run the archiving session successfully?<br />
2.  I want to do this on a Test server which I which I have not set up yet(no Baan program, etc). What are the steps to setup the Test server?<br />
<br />
Would appreciate any help <br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Upgrade to BaanIVc4 first. SP preferably at least till SP8.<br />
What abt oracle version?<br />
(i.e: 8i)<br />
These upgrade could solve some issues on performance and reliability.<br />
Thank you and have a nice day<br />
<br />
Yours in service<br />

<br />
I would recommend you to upgrade to the latest Service Pack 17. The reason being lot of enhancements has been done in archiving, like possibility of archiving purchase orders, sales orders and etc. <br />
<br />
It doesn't make that much differences between migrating from BaanIVc2 to BaanIVc4 SP8 or SP17. It is worth the effort.<br />
