<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">22nd October 2003, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on 4c4 with Oracle and have the new solution loaded that created new fst tables.  I am working on a departmental schedule that will have 5 col's of data.<br />
<br />
1. Current Period<br />
2. YTD Actual<br />
3. YTD Budget<br />
4. YTD Var<br />
5. % Act/Bud<br />
<br />
When I look at tffst300 Maintain Annexure Values I see 5 records for each combination of statement account.  (i.e. the same 5 mentioned above.)  In Crystal I have written a report to pull this data.  My problem is this it is treating each col as a seperate row.<br />
<br />
I need to know how to put multiple records onto one row in Crystal.<br />
<br />
I need to see the following:<br />
               Cur Pd           YTD Act.     YTD Bud    YTD Var    %Act/Bud<br />
<br />
Wages       50                 500            499            -1           102%<br />
<br />
<br />
Instead this is waht I see:<br />
<br />
Wages       50                  0                0                 0              0<br />
<br />
Wages        0                500               0                 0              0<br />
<br />
Wages        0                  0               499               0              0<br />
<br />
Wages        0                  0                 0               -1               0<br />
<br />
Wages        0                 0                  0                0             102%<br />
<br />
This pattern repeats for every line on the financial statement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doug Jefferson</div><div class="date">22nd October 2003, 23:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really sure how to go about doing that?  I also was wondering if a cross tab report would work?<br />
<br />
Can you explain how you would do the grouping.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mjrusso</div><div class="date">23rd October 2003, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have any experience with cross tabs, that may work though.<br />
<br />
Group 1 should be the account that you are trying to see (Ledger #?) on every line<br />
<br />
On the detail line place you fields across as normal:<br />
              ------------------------------------------------------------<br />
GROUP 1 HDR <br />
              ------------------------------------------------------------<br />
DETAIL   Ledger  CurPd YTDAct YTDBudg YTDVar %ActBudg<br />
              ------------------------------------------------------------<br />
GROUP 1 FTR  Ledger Sum(CurPd, Group1) Sum(YTDAct, Group1) Sum(YTDBudg, Group1) Sum(YTDVar, Group1) Sum(%ActBudg, Group1)<br />
              ------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Right-click on the gray area called detail on the left and choose &quot;suppress&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used WhilePrintingRecords formulae to effectively rotate the Baan tables.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">28th November 2003, 05:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Last year I wrote some Income Statements and Balance Sheets using the FST solution. The requirement I provided a solution for included showing Budget/Actual values for current month vs. last month.<br />
<br />
Crystal Reports has some support for crosstabs, but I found that it just wasn't flexible enough beyond the common situation.<br />
<br />
Basically what you have to do is add a formula for each column. For the purposes of this example, let's consider the situation of Previous period compared to Current period. If the database field for period (month) is {ttfst300.perd}, then create two formulas:<br />
<br />
@CURR_PERIOD<br />
if {ttfst300.perd} = 11 then <br />
 {ttfst300.actu}<br />
end if<br />
<br />
@PREV_PERIOD<br />
if {ttfst300.perd} = 10 then<br />
  {ttfst300.actu<br />
}<br />
<br />
Of course, it would be better to use the date functions to retrieve the month from the current date, and subtract 1 from that accordingly. Or, set up a parameter to ask the user for a year/period.<br />
<br />
Place these small formulas in the details section beside each other. Then you can place a sum of each formula into the group footer(s).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if that customer is still using those reports. There were some requirements for unbalanced groups (if you get what I mean) to match the format of an existing manually-filled out Excel report. The FST solution made it pretty hard to do this.<br />
<br />
Depending on what you want to do, the FST is pretty useful. But to do anything even moderatly complicated, you will need formulas and even conditional formatting.<br />
<br />
The FST solution comes with some examples that should be helpful.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps you or someone.<br />
