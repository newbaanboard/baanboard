<br />
We issued a new Add-On for Baan. &quot;Baan Hot Link&quot;<br />
<br />
This new product from Nazdaq allows users to access files on the network from within Baan Maintain Sessions.<br />
 <br />
For example, while maintaining an item in Maintain Item Data you can access its AutoCAD drawing, Ms-Word Specifications, MS-Excel Costing Data and JPG photo, all in a click of a mouse.<br />
 <br />
This easy to configure product makes it easy to link any Baan entity with related files on the network. The product can be activated from any Baan Session, without touching the source code. Linking Baan Data to Files on the network is automatically done using mapping schemes, based on different company naming conventions.<br />
<br />
To get a fully operational demo, check our web site at www.nazdaq-it.com<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bamnsour</div><div class="date">25th March 2004, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">* If you try to open a Hot Link and it does not exist, you can interactively copy a template file, make a link or duplicate an existing file.<br />
<br />
* file names can be generated based on tables different from the session's main table using forigen keys to different tables. As an example, File names which are populated based on any field from tiitm001 can be accessed from any other session where the Item is a foriegn key, like Purchase Order Lines, Production Order Lines and a lot more. <br />
<br />
* File name is generated from five parts, each part can be a variable or a constant. <br />
<br />
* Variables used in mapping can be a Baan field or parts of a Baan field. <br />
<br />
* Special characters in mapping can be replaced ( as an example slash instead of dash) <br />
<br />
* Ability to make different links for the same file without having to duplicate it. <br />
<br />
* Ability to detach files from the link - Delete links or files from within Baan (With proper permission) <br />
<br />
* You can define access levels for users to create/Duplicate/Link/Detach or View files <br />
<br />
* Every action done through Baan Hot Link is recorded in a log file for more security</div></div><hr />

Another great feature is that you can use your own icons instead of the standard Baan buttons. <br />
