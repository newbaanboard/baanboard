<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">3rd August 2008, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">We've been running live for a while (on Baan5) with an API for Report Production Orders Complete (tisfc0520m000 / tisfc0120s000) but since upgrading about 5 service packs in 1 go it has stopped working with no error messages.<br />
<br />
The API works in as far as the qty is entered in the field, lotnumber is generated and when update is run no error message appears.  However you then look at the order and it has just reported the operations complete for that qty not the delivered qty.  <br />
<br />
I found a new message that appears and am handling that.  Has anyone else come across this?  :confused:<br />
<br />
Baan5c sp22 from something like sp15 along with necessary portingset etc upgrades.</div></div><hr />
