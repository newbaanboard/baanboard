<br />
Hope someone is using IWM(barcode) system and scanners with Infor LN.<br />
<br />
Issue is that, some times the scanners are not getting connected(hanging), ( not even getting the login page/window on scanner). <br />
<br />
To solve the issue we changed the IP's and Device name of the scanners in admin page(adcadmin) then the scanner are getting connected.<br />
<br />
This is a recurring issue, not sure if it's related to network or IWM.<br />
<br />
Appreciate your inputs and steps to troubleshoot the issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

How do you use IWM... with Openworld or Webservice for communicating with baan?<br />
if it is with OpenWorld, the scanners might get hung due to fatal error as there is no refresh mechanism unless ASM is used. In such case, look for the error logs and solve one by one. <br />
Webservice has a auto restart mechanism... However, if error occurs it will still be in hung status until restart happens.<br />

To my understanding, if you are on LN10.4+ the default communication method is webservice, but it can be configured to use tmboaserver. less than LN10.3 default is tmboaserver, but it can be configured to use Webservice. So, it depends on how the installation was configured.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where can i find this?<br />
If you are using webservice these settings would be available on the C4WS (Connector for Webservice) server or WSTK (Webserver Tool Kit) server. <br />
<br />
If you dont have details about any of the above webservice servers, then the system should be running based on OpenWorld (tmboaserver). You can directly start looking at $BSE/log/log.* for fatal errors and start solving one by one. Specifically look for fatal errors which are caused by the userID which was used to start the tmboaservers.<br />
