<br />
we are an Italian customer using Baan IV. We tried Cordys, but we were very disappointed. Mainly it is an empty toolbox, it does not perform and does not add value on openworld. We use today MS tools + biztalk and we go via OW to Baan IV. We built our own collaborative solutions. MS tools are flexible to get there. I believe that technology is consolidating and SSA is doing business with the biggest. Why should I invest in Cordys? THey don't have something unique, the same things I can do with MS or even IBM. Plus I don't trust the company, I mean....MS and IBM will be there in 10 years. Cordys?<br />
<br />
Anyother?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are not correct in this area. Please check your sources. OpenWorldX is not dead or replaced. OpenWorldX is strategic to SSA Gobal and will be supported now and in the future. SSA Global has a strategic alliance with IBM to resell and use the IBM middleware products. The IBM middleware together   with OpenWorldX provides a lot of extra functionality and integration capabilities. For example connectivity to other ERP vendors or CRM vendors (like Siebel). OpenWorldX will be used for connectivity towards and from SSA Global products. SSA Global is heavily investing in the OpenWorldX product. <br />

thanks. Yes not getting personal. Sorry if that was the case. I have been to the GGG (Global Guide Group) forum in Rome (March 2004) where the 100 top EMEA customers were invited. SSA Global made there a clear statement that WebSphere will not replace OpenWorld but it would be a natural extension on top of it. For sure, SSA wants to own the last mile of integration, meaning that the adapters and connectors will be owned by them. I saw also a demonstration of OpenWorld Adapter on BPCS, even with WebServices. This is for me a prove that they are investing in OW rather than phasing it out<br />

Good to see that OpenWorldX is not phased out. <br />

 I confirm others answers. OW is not dead.<br />
I've posted a message regarding OW/Websphere after a presentation form SSA chairman presenting a WS strategy and the news published by IBM.<br />
But the answer from SSA France is clear. Websphere will be an extension of OW for others package integration. Connectors and adapters are obviously still needed, but even the broker and studio will be in the SSA solution porfolio...  A new version has been released on the name SSA OpenWorld...<br />
<br />
So, my understanding for integration solutions depending on your requirments<br />
first level... API, OLE and specifics... for a limited number of interfaces...<br />
second level... OW.. specially for SSA centered information system<br />
and for very large project including hetegoneous package... Websphere...<br />
<br />
and don't forget a free alternative... free broker as jonas, eclipse as studio...<br />
<br />
I don't know in that approach what could be the cordys positionning... How to compete on low cost with free solutions, on functionnalities with market leaders, and on BAAN integration with SSA ???</div></div><hr />

Success in implementing this stack!</div></div><hr />

<br />
and more<br />
for ERP: BPCS, PRMS, MAX, MASTERPIECE, BAAN (MK, MANAMAN-X...), and now solutions from MARCAM company...<br />
<br />
the question is: Can you build a long term strategy with such an heteronegeous portfolio... You could answer, of course no....  But do you really think that a &quot;from scratch&quot; strategy is still possible if you want to be a major actor ? <br />
<br />
So, why not a merging strategy ?... and why not being lucky... Suppose a real EAI/BPM standard emerging and all existing solutions working to support this standard... and your problem is solved.. !<br />

<br />
In the latest user group I have seen real customer stories about these solutions. The customer was showing his implementation. I think SSA is choosing best of breed. In addition they stated they will support more. They want the customers to choose their platform. They don't want customers to be enforced to one single proprieraty framework.<br />
<br />
If you are telling me that this is their marketing story, could I think the same about Cordys?<br />
<br />
Good luck with selling this stack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hdruiter</div><div class="date">20th July 2004, 22:33</div></div><div class="posttext">best of breed...??? or best of maintenance...???<br />
<br />
The Cordys story is about 3WC standards Java/XML object architecture, agnostic to J2EE and .Net. The market likes it very much...<br />
<br />
Just keep watching</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jeremyjohnson65</div><div class="date">21st July 2004, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi hdruiter,<br />
<br />
3WC? What kind of standard is that? you mean W3C I hope....I was wondering as an independent consultant why Cordys people always have negative comments / stories around SSA Global? From outside, I like to see a metric driven company that balance innovations with customer demand. That was another story with the old management and most of them are working at Cordys today ( I have heard). Actually a lot of innovations are happening. They are working on a complete linux-mysql-mozilla support for lowering the TCO and using OWX technology to open up the other ERPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdwinvdBorg</div><div class="date">21st July 2004, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jeremy,<br />
<br />
The same is true for the SSA Global folks. I always find they are telling negative comments / stories around Cordys.<br />
It all depends on who you are talking with so please let's keep the discussions on the contents. <br />
The market place is big enough for everybody to share the pie. SSA Global and Cordys will get their share and Microsoft, the 900 pound gorilla, just a bit more.<br />

<br />
The only reason we are or have negative comments is simply due to the fact that we are not allowed to be a BWU member in the USA anymore due to the fact that SSA is negative about Cordys, why? We protect Baan customers for SSA for moving away from Baan to other ERP systems, this is good I believe.<br />
<br />
We would love to use OWX technology to integrate with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jeremyjohnson65</div><div class="date">22nd July 2004, 09:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Edwin,<br />
<br />
no mudding yes, you are right, but I want to react and then let's close the topic. hdrouter was saying that Cordys is not allowed to go to BWU. Last year I was there and sentences like &quot;do you go to gemini or to germany?&quot; didn't help the relationship. In addition, the perception is that SSA does not want to collaborate with Cordys because it is linked to the old Baan management who just failed to make of the company a &quot;continuing&quot; winning story.<br />
<br />
You are right when you say that the market is enough for both companies. hopefully I will get the chance to implement both.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jeremy, it makes no sence to continue making wrong statements. Jan Baan is the only person within Cordys that is linked to the old Baan management, and he left in the summer of 1997, thats when Baan was at its peak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hdruiter: &quot;Jan Baan is the only person within Cordys that is linked to the old Baan management,&quot;<br />
<br />
??? one of you is wrong !!!<br />
<br />
Perhaps the best on that forum is to propose information you have had directly, not one that a friend of a colleague of an ex who heared a guy from a partner of a cousin of jan baan... as i can do to...<br />
<br />
One thing is clear... If you are looking for information on Cordys, you can't find any &quot;legal&quot; or &quot;corporate&quot; information on the web site... only the name of jan baan...<br />
<br />
With google you find easily information regarding merge of vanenburg group and cordys, rebranding of guardess to cordys... <br />
But no figures !.... turnover ?, R&amp;D expenses ? employees ? customer ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm, that's odd, who was that guy that I met when I first started working with Baan in Jan. 1998 then?  He said he was Jan Baan, he looked like Jan Baan,  he sounded like Jan Baan.  By George, it WAS Jan Baan.  If you want to chastise someone about incorrect information, please be certain that you have correct information yourself.  Jan was with the company well into the slide.  I am pretty certain that it was summer 1998 before he left, but he was definitely there when the downward spiral began.</div></div><hr />
