Can you be a bit more specific? Basicly it's the same setup. Do you start it from DEM or do you mean printing to excel?<br />

Set up a printer as follows:<br />
Device: Excel<br />
Device Type: Rewrite File<br />
Locale: (usually ISO-8859-1, but whatever you normally use)<br />
<br />
Driver: (blank)<br />
Shell command: (blank)<br />
4GL program: ttstpconv<br />
Argument: ASCII:excel %s<br />
Path: (whatever, but something like ${HOME}/baanrept)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ehabos</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 13:58</div></div><div class="posttext">B2Win is a simple and Elegant Add-on that automatically downloads every Baan Report Directly into Excel  Word or Notepad, formats it, for you to do additional calculations or editing on the output from the ERP system. <br />
<br />
How is it done today? <br />
   Many users want to take the data from ERP systems into Excel.<br />
1) Send report output to device &quot;ASCIF&quot;<br />
2) Locate the file on your server and transfer it using FTP to your PC.<br />
3) Launch Excel<br />
4) Read ASCII file, by defining the scope of each column<br />
5) Delete all headers and subtotals from report<br />
<br />
Those that do this know it is not fun. In B2Win, this is all done in one click! Just choose device &quot;B2Excel&quot;, and data is loaded and formatted in your excel file.<br />
<br />
<br />
How does B2Win Work? <br />
<br />
 B2Win is fully installed on the Baan Server, and there is no need to install it on every single PC in the organization. B2Win is a Baan Tools session that uses the capability of Baan Client Server to download the report output from the server to the PC, while copying an Excel or Word Macro to your PC. This Macro is responsible for cleaning the report output and formatting it in a way that it can be used in Excel and Word.<br />
<br />
The Excel Macro of B2Win 3.1 has been modified to match any Baan Report with a standard looking layout.<br />
<br />
The Word Macro of B2Win 3.1 works in Portrait Mode and Landscape Mode. The Macro prepares a formatted Word document that is easy to modify and edit. <br />
<br />
<br />
Who can benefit from B2Win? <br />
<br />
-Accountants                                            <br />
Download a Baan Report into Excel, add  additional surcharges not included in Baan, run a Macro and print the report in a different sorting.   <br />
 <br />
- Material Planners <br />
Analyze certain fields from the item data<br />
  <br />
- Sales Representatives<br />
Want to download the price list and open sales orders into a laptop before a business trip to a customer.  <br />
  <br />
- Sales Administration<br />
Want to send a Baan document to a customer, but want to do additional editing in Word before  sending it.   <br />
 <br />
- Buyers<br />
Analyze pricing of suppliers or edit a purchase order before sending it.<br />
And much moreÂ…  <br />
<br />
<br />
Please check our Web Site (http://www.nazdaq.co.il) and feel free to ask for fully operational demo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Johnson</div><div class="date">9th January 2002, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's check your ttstpconv and client connection: <br />
Set up a printer called NOTEPAD as a Rewrite File:<br />
Driver/Shell blank, 4GL Program ttstpconv, Argument ascii:notepad %s, Path ${HOME}/baanrept, uncheck Change Ouput file allowed, Page length 100. Use this devcie and simply print your Device list to it. It should bring up Notepad and your list. If it doesn't, then you should acll Baan and get this process fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 01:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Bart,<br />
<br />
I checked out that Steve's solution does work.<br />
<br />
But maybe Steve can also let us know more info...<br />
<br />
If there is any formating feature to be sent with the excel so that we can get the output columns in a good format or specify a delimiter option. I think its easy on unix to get around the delimiters. I have no idea on excel/word etc.<br />
<br />
I made another device entry with word and it seems fine to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Johnson</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 05:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Word output will be simply text. You can Edit/Select All and change the default font to something like Courier to columnize the data.<br />
<br />
Excel reformatting takes a couple of steps, but not hard:<br />
Select colunm &quot;A&quot;, the first column. Select Data/Text to Columns,<br />
Delimited/uncheck Tab, check Other (put pipe symbol &quot;|&quot; in Other field), Finish.<br />
<br />
If the file just gets to the PC in the same form with delimiters and you import that into Excel/File/Open, Excel will automatically open the Import File Wizard (aabove) and format the file on the fly. Invoking Excel from Baan as a device will not and you have to do that manually. Also note that every 9say) 100 line is an unwanted page heading. This inconvenience is taken care of with products such as B2WIN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">10th January 2002, 12:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Steve. If you print ocassionally to Excel, and since the output is simple text, you must manually define your columns and formats when you open the output.<br />
<br />
Now, if you tend to send reports on a regular basis, my preferred way would be build you own custom report or use a SQL statement to output the desired fields with specific field delimiter and then build a Visual Basic macro that imports the report (good way to exerceice your VBasic skills also :) )<br />
<br />
If you tend to use a lot Excel with several reports, go for a commercial program that will ease all these steps and uses the standard reports.</div></div><hr />

If I try it with Excel or Word, it does the following.<br />
Excel or Word opens up on my W2000 PC. Then 2 error boxes follow. The first states that file &quot;c:\program&quot; is not found. The second states that &quot;files\baan\(temporary file)&quot; is not found. It is obvious that &quot;c:\program files\baan\...&quot; is seen by Word and Excel as two file path names where notepad sees it as one file path name. <br />
<br />
Any tips or suggestions?<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I got Excel to work by adding quotes to give Argument of <br />

<br />
Also I am setting path to<br />

${BSE}/tmp/${LOGNAME}.txt<br />
<br />
to avoid users overwriting each others files.<br />
<br />
When I tried Argument with<br />
<br />
ASCII:winword &quot;%s&quot;<br />
<br />
and same path, Word starts up and says that<br />
&quot;C:\PROGRAM FILES\BAAN\RWRIGHT.TXT&quot; is not found.<br />
I find the file there as &quot;Rwright.txt&quot; if I &quot;open-&gt;browse&quot;<br />
after closing the error box.<br />
<br />
I know zip about W2000, but I keep thinking there is some setting that affects the way this is done.<br />
Steve's response seems to suggest this is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Johnson</div><div class="date">16th January 2002, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe a final comment since we have just about exhausted this thread. The Baan user community is not and cannot be uniform in its current version or patch level of Baan. The specific problem you are having may be related to the level of your ttstpconv program. We are on 5.0b at SP11 + all solutions through weekly dump 43 (roughly end of October 2001). The Unix &quot;what&quot; command shows a compile date on ttstpconv of 01/10/23 [10:26] (Oct 23, 2001) and our latest solution installed against this component is 156332. We do not get the &quot;upper case&quot; issue you are having, nor do we have to put quotes around the %s argument. These are Baan ttstpconv issues, not W2000, since ttstpconv passes the data and the launch command to W2000, who just executes it. :confused: <br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rwright</div><div class="date">18th January 2002, 19:08</div></div><div class="posttext">What you need to do is check the &quot;Properties&quot; of Excel and add its location to the PATH environment variable.

Then edit the PATH variable and append the path to excel.exe.</div></div><hr />

We own the product and it works GREAT!  And (I hope the guys at Nazdaq aren't listening) it is very reasonably priced.<br />

Before investing the time and effort I would suggest you check out their free demo.  Try it, you'll like it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rwright</div><div class="date">2nd April 2002, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Another &quot;trick&quot; is to set the 4GL argument to <br />
<br />
&quot;ASCII: start excel %s&quot;<br />
<br />
This eliminates any need to change the PATH system variable on the Client. <br />
A few Clients that have &quot;Paintshop Pro&quot; will not work with this setting, but everyone else seems to work fine.<br />
<br />
There may also be an accumulation of &quot;tmp&quot; files in the Client's Baan folder. If a file name is configured in the device setup, then a single file is overwritten each time. So any 2nd attempt will fail while the 1st Excel session is still in use. If none is configured, then unique temporary names are used and the users can have more than one at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">6th April 2002, 01:53</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are using Baan V, there is the ability to make Word and Excel templates.  MS Project as well I understand, but I have not used that.  There is sofware on the Baan website to install on both the server and your PC's.  It puts some additional options in Word and Excel to help create Baan templates - you can attach tables and get table field listings and place them on the document as you need.  You can then attach this template to Sessions, where you can select the data you want and choose &quot;Send To...&quot;, and your Template Name.<br />
<br />
It's all kind of a hassle if you just want an excel spreadsheet of the report, and probably not worth it.  But with this option you can create your own reports and spreadsheets directly querying the tables.<br />
<br />
This is the Baan Automation Server (BAS), and the Office Integration solution.  It's all free with maintenance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rwright</div><div class="date">15th May 2002, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">My old problem of not working when there was a space in the path name to the PC file was resolved by using a newer version of &quot;ttstpconv&quot;. <br />
That was on BaanIVc4. <br />
On HP-UX I used &quot;what $BSE/tools/ttB40_c4/ottstp/ostpconv&quot; to see that the second line of output showed the date of that version was &quot;98/12/17&quot;. We changed to use a newer version that showed a date of &quot;01/08/29&quot; and the problem went away.<br />
<br />
If it does not work...<br />
Open a DOS window.<br />
type &quot;excel&quot;<br />
Does Excel start up?<br />
type &quot;path&quot;<br />
Is the folder where excel.exe is located shown?<br />
If needed, modify PATH=... in autoexec.bat or wherever else it is set.<br />
Even if Excel does not start, the file should be on the PC in the Baan Client directory. If not, then something may be preventing the report file from being copied to the PC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One way to avoid messing with PATH's on user PCs is to use the old style DOS pathnames, ie C:\PROGRA~1\EXCEL.EXE<br />
You can work out what the directory is called by dropping to a DOS box, then do a dir /a on the directory.<br />
<br />
Or, for an easy life....<br />

Document styler from Macroscope allows you to send reports directly to Word and Excel and add formatting along the way.<br />
It works very well and isn't expensive.<br />

So far this thread has been dealing with the possibility to update Excel from BAAN which is a great help for many customers.<br />
However, TriNET and Cordys have provided a seamless integration from Excel to BAAN using the Cordys WCP platform.<br />
There are many occasions where customers need to update BAAN from Excel for example.<br />
Of course the Cordys WCP platform can integrate any application/ data source to and from BAAN.<br />
Let me know if you want to know more about how the Cordys platform can help you to leverage your existing BAAN investment.<br />

If the report is a standard baan report then you might be able to change your list separator, but that is up to you.  You can check that forum and the third party forum for tools that works with excel.  Check out ~Vamsi's free tool.<br />

The way we handle it is to download the file and launch excel with a macro designed to format that specific report.<br />

This is just one post how to get data from baan to excel.  Another way is to use VB code to pull data directly from Baan into excel.  Then you can do the reverse to update from excel to Baan.  Or you can save data from excel into text format and use exchange schemes to load the data back into baan.  There are several possibilities.</div></div><hr />
