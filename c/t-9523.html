I have gone thru the documentation of DDC and all the posting in baanboard. I would like to know how is perl made to interact with the ddc function server, do we have to register the function server in the perl side and also heard that perl is used for writing menu's on the hardware like intermec devices. If anybody has a sample code and would like to shar, i wud appreciate that.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

No proper documents are avaliable since these are properitory owned applications for interfacing with Baan<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">28th November 2003, 09:35</div></div><div class="posttext">We have written some programs for the Intermec wireless devices using Perl. Works very well. We first wrote custom telnet servers, but dcBrowser is a lot easier to develop with.<br />
<br />
Menus are easy to do, since they are just a bunch of HTML links.<br />
<br />
These perl scripts connect to Baan function servers, using web services provided by the SOAP toolkit in Cordys. Works fine.<br />
<br />
I'd like to learn more about DDC though.</div></div><hr />
