<br />
However you could simply put a report in the job queue run it every so often to check the stock and then use mailx within your report script to send an e mail when you find the condition you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Have a look at the numerous mailx threads for examples of this.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

then execute another script to do the e-mail.<br />

Not sure if other database have this functionallity and wht it would be called?<br />

Ye, i think SQL server and most of other RDBS support triggers.<br />
but do you know is there any impact to BAAN if we implement triggers in DB levels? for instance, cause update failure or would be deleted in system update?<br />
<br />
To Neal Matthews,<br />
<br />
The report is not the effect we want. Since it's a methold to pull the data instead of push from system. altought the process can be automated, but you have to check the data to see if an alert araised.<br />
Anyway, thanks for your advice.<br />

There are some 3rd party add-on applications that presumably can provide event/condition triggers or you can address it from the Oracle end. <br />
<br />
Baan [IV] itself, however, doesn't have any event triggers like those you will find in the ERP suites from Oracle or IFS .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I absolutely discourage using triggers on database levels for two reasons:<br />
<br />
1) A technial one: The database &quot;belongs&quot; to the CASE tools of Baan. If you do something on the database that your CASE tool doesn't know about, the CASE tool may cause trobles (example: Baan wan't be able to reorganize a table if there's a trigger on it because it can't drop it (probably))<br />
<br />
2) An architectural one: Always seperate database and application. For maintainability it's very important not to mix those two layers of your software system. GOTO statements are considered harmful in structural programming, as the late Dijkstra told. I consider database triggers as much as harmful for a mission critical software system.<br />

<br />
We have yet to see any great impact on system performance when using triggers.  However, this has only been tested on our<br />
test systems of BaaN and we have yet implemented this in production.  If possible, I would run some timing tests with and without triggers to see if you system is affected. (A lot could depend on hardware and database tuning).  <br />
<br />
There is also some adminsistration that goes along with this like<br />
turning off triggers for MRP runs or other mass updates (like exchange schemes), re-affirming on system failures or<br />
removing triggers if tables are to be removed.  Most of the work<br />
needed though, you should be able to put in a IUNIX/SQL scripts.<br />
<br />
Our DBA is being very cautious about triggers, as we do not want to get 'trigger-happy'  (sorry could not resist the joke),  so I would also take some care and test, test test.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

Have you tried such operation like re-orginize tables or new SP or solution installation in your testing system?<br />
I think database trigger really should be well tested before been implemented.  I will also tested it in our testing system and share the results with you when i closing my current case.<br />
And i think this should be the the last methold to be used.<br />

Thanks for your comments.<br />

Would you please kindly introduce some 3rd party event trigger products to work with BAAN? Thanks.<br />

To be honest, I do not think this has been done.  I think the plan is to turn off all triggers during any database maintenance activity<br />
(I.E. re-orgs, table changes etc.). Since we only do this on planned weekends, it should not be a great burdon.   <br />

I was thinking of Triffit EasyApps, which uses Cordys WCP (Web Collaboration Platform). I checked with Triffit this morning. Event triggers may be handled through either EasyApps or Cordys, depending on the level/type of trigger. Most event triggers, however, are probably enabled at the Cordys level.<br />
<br />
I havenÂ’t a chance to actually work with these applications. For more info on EasyApps and Cordys WCP, look at the Triffit site (www.triffit.com). <br />
