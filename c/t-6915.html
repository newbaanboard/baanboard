BaanV c is better than BaanIV in  functions and architecture.<br />
Below is some enhancement which I think nice<br />
<br />
DEM: control diagram<br />
Warehouse: Better shipping module<br />
Planning: enhance multi-site planning, enhance ATP, CTP function<br />
Common: Take away inventory status from item master<br />
Shop floor:  Tooling<br />
Quality Management: (No enhancement)<br />
Order management: A linking between return orders &amp; its originals.<br />
Costing: More choice of actual costing method, FIFO, LIFO, moving average<br />
Finance: Much better fixed asset<br />
Tools: DAL , Print to email<br />
Exchange: DAL enabled<br />
Service: Some good enhancement<br />
Object Data Management: Change management, document managment , (Good , but too many steps)<br />
Analysis report: (No enhancement)<br />
User interface: A little better<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The enhancement is much and even the tables definition are changed a lot. <br />
<br />
iBaan is just a new brand name of Baan product family and also a new licencing method of Baan products. The core of iBaan is still the ERP, i.e. BaanIV or BaanV, with the additon  of some ecommerce component, CRM component, PDM component, MES component (from Wonderware), supply chain component, plus an integration framework (OpenWorld), a collaboration framework and portal (From Sap).</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, still about Baan V, is it fully prepared to interact with Internet and 3rd party applications?</div></div><hr />

Internet? 3 party apps? Normally people means<br />
<br />
1. Can I use internet browser as the Baan ERP client?<br />
The architecture of BaanIV and BaanV is similar, still traditional three tier client-server base. In order to let Baan ERP runs on internet browser, Baan develops webtop, which is an add-on component and the current versions works for BaanV only.<br />
I would say this is a nice add-on but the setup is quite difficult.<br />
<br />
2. Can I exchange information with Baan ERP through internet applicatons (3rd party apps)?<br />
In the old old decades, we can only write the data  directly to BaanERP's database from our internet application.<br />
In the not so old decades, we are supposed to call Baan BOI to write data into Baan ERP<br />
In this new decade, we are advised to plug on OpenWorld and exchange information with XML, following the standard defined by Rossetanet or Microsoft(?). <br />
Baan supports OpenWorld both on BaanIV and BaanV.</div></div><hr />
