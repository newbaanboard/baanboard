i have no experience in Baan but i am a Java J2EE developer ;-)<br />
<br />
How can i connect a Baan system from my J2EE applicationserver ?<br />
<br />
I think what i need is a J2EE complaint Baan Connector (JCA) !?<br />
<br />
Where can i found this connector? Is it part of the Baan distribution ??<br />
<br />
1000 Thanx<br />

Java Connector Archietcture(JCA) is nothing do with BaaN. JCA is a framework for integrating heterogeneous ERP systems from any J2EE complaint Application Server that supports JCA. <br />
<br />
JCA provides CCI ( Common Client Interface) that need to be implemented by EIS systems. In case of BaaN, the JavaClient that calls BaaN Business Objects (BOI) should be implemented as CCI, which talks to the J2EE Enterprise Java beans residing on the Application Server.<br />
<br />
Also u can skip JCA framework and directly call the Javaclient that calls BOI from an Enterprise Java bean deployed at J2EE Application Server.<br />
<br />
In order to integrate BaaN with Java, You need to write BaaN Business Objects in 4GL and u need some middleware to sync BOI with Java. <br />
<br />
BaaN Connect Kit has the middleware  BCBE API's(BaaN Connection Basic Edition ) but no more supported by BaaN. Also its very complex process. <br />
<br />
I prefer Cordys . OpenWorld is also equally good. You can try other integration methodologies like DDC, Internet Applets but its pretty complex when compare to BOI.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
