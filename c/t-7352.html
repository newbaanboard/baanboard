<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsrini</div><div class="date">25th October 2002, 02:56</div></div><div class="posttext">There is some thing called BI that is same as BW, except that we can have it installed on a WebServer, and we can use that URL to connect to Baan. Once connected, it comes up with the same Main Menu like BW. We used BI for a short period, but that was with Baan 5.0b. I believe there is a Baan 4c4 version of BI also available.<br />
In $BSE there will be a directory called &quot;internet&quot;. There you will find a file called &quot;bisetup.class&quot;. If this is present, go ahead and test it out.</div></div><hr />

There's also another thin client access to Baan through internet called Webtop. However, I've only seen its very cool screen shots but never actually used it yet. Probably others can tell you more about it<br />

We are using b4c4. I checked for the file &quot;bisetup.class&quot; in the directory path mentioned by you, but I don't find any file of this name.<br />
<br />
Does it means..... we cann't access b4c4 from internet.<br />

This is the comparison of the internet interface to Baan that I'm familiar with<br />
<br />
- BI. Basically it'll look just like your Menu Browser. To make it intuitive for users, you'd probably want to alter how the menu is arranged. Authorisation is taken care by AMS module in Tools<br />
<br />
- Webtop. Very cool looking interface and can do many things. I've never touched it but it sure look as if it has the functionalities offered by Worktop, ie. shortcut bar, menu browser/DEM browser, and business process viewer all arranged neatly in panes. All Baan forms must be translated to Web forms. If it indeed mimics Worktop on the net then authorisation can be handled by either AMS (if menu browser shows up) or DEM (if DEM browser show up). Other guys here know much more about Webtop than I do.<br />
<br />
- Citrix. As a thin client sort of interface, it wouldn't be so hard at all to configure. In short time you'll be able to connect your people to Baan through internet. You can use either Menu browser (authorisation by AMS), DEM browser (auth by DEM), or Worktop (auth by AMS or DEM, up to you), doesn't really matter.<br />
<br />
I'm not familiar at all with the other offering, probably someone else in this forum can give us a light :)<br />

BI is only for Baan 5.0 and is not supported anymore.<br />
WebTop is also an interface for BaanERP but it supports only iBaanERP 5.0c and 5.2a.<br />
I'm sorry for you! :(</div></div><hr />
