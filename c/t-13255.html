I'm not on the team but the feedback I'm getting is they provide a good tool and are very flexible with customizations. We're not in the test mode yet since they're still doing mods for us but so far, our team is very pleased.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can somebody explain what the benefits of this application are (supposed to be)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gary P</div><div class="date">10th November 2003, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I spoke to our IS manager. The one we're working on is called &quot;Sales Cockpit.&quot; It's a canned package that's really a simplified user interface for sales that sits on top of standard BaaN and feeds back and forth. She did confirm that Cordys is very flexible and open to customization of their products. They offer other products as well. I'm aware that they have a Quality Management solution and a Service solution as well. I believe both of those offer increased and enhanced functionality but still integrate with BaaN. Other than that I'm not sure what they offer. Might be worth checking their website at www.cordys.com.</div></div><hr />

ThankX</div></div><hr />
