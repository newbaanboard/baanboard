<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jhargett</div><div class="date">25th October 2005, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been disecting the Java code that comes with Baan in the internet directory (the example applets). I would like to use Java to integrate with Baan, but I only want that to be the middle layer, I don't want the front end applets. Of course, I could use OpenWorld or Cordys, but that would require money to be spent :)<br />
<br />
It seems the key to the integration used here is the nserver program that comes with Baan. If I have deciphered all this correctly (very possible I haven't  :confused: ), then the way nserver works is that it listens on a socket for data and takes that data and calls a Baan BOI or AFS-DLL. <br />
<br />
1. Does anybody know if this is correct?<br />
2. I have heard mention on here about BCK, is this the way it works?<br />
2. If this is the way nserver works, does anybody know the format of the data that is sent to nserver on the socket?</div></div><hr />
