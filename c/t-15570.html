<br />
Would you buy these SSA shares? <br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi All,<br />
<br />
It is time for another 'baanassist'.<br />
<br />
Things have been very quiet around the new Baan Web-Client since the announcement by SSA at the last BWU in Charlotte, NC.<br />
Unfortunately this was only done to out-smart Jan Baan with his plans for a Cordys Web-Client for Baan.<br />
In the meantime SSA silently laid off more people at Baan, upset Baan customers with their license-spy tool and created another hype by the announcement to do an IPO at Wall Street this summer.<br />
<br />
It is slowly becoming obvious that the owners of SSA never had any intentions to invest in Baan. By making Baan profitable and to further reduce costs they will make SSA Global Baan more attractive for investors later this year.<br />
Now that almost all developers at Baan have been let go it is clear there will be no release of Gemini this year. <br />
The IPO is more important and time has come to cash in.<br />
<br />
In a way it is sad to see how such a great product has become the victim of bookkeepers and greedy investment bankers.<br />
My advise to all Baan customers out there: contact your nearest Microsoft Business Solutions partner for a demonstration of Navision Axapta.<br />
<br />
Do whatever you think is best!<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SSA-Baan Fan</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 21:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont work for SSA but I have been working with the Baan product since 1995. The last eight months reminds me of the Baan Company in the mid 90s, successful again with a clear direction of developing and providing solutions that adds value to its customers. <br />
<br />
When I read the post by baanassist, I think he or she is probably one of the people let go by SSA and is still angry and now representing Microsofts products!<br />
 <br />
The problem with Baan for the last several years wasn't the product but poor management, people, execution and strategies.<br />
 <br />
When SSA acquired Baan they assessed the Baan employees before the consolidation of Baan within the SSA organization. They kept the good talented people and let others go, that should have been let go long before. <br />
<br />
WebTop is available for Baan IV, SSA has invested another 15 to 20 million dollars in SSA ERP 6 (Gemini) and it is available in July 2004 . SSA is doing road shows in the US currently demonstrating WebTop, Workflow, SSA ERP 6 and other new SSA solutions.<br />
 <br />
SSA is largest ERP vendor in the manufacturing industry, 4th largest ERP vendor overall, growing and profitable. <br />
<br />
SSA is one organization with a good management team, good strategies. All developers have not been let go. SSA has 1100 people in development and 600 in support and plans of more successful accusations in the future.<br />
<br />
I think the shares will do just fine!</div></div><hr />

Think it's a typo. Suppose u mean acquisitions and not charge/blame/allegation by accusation !</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's something I have been reading a lot lately, mainly said by Baan resellers and marketing people, trying to reasure customers. It's adding insult to injury for those that have been laid off. Some of them very good and qualified people. Rumor has it that many positions have simply been shifted to lower cost countries and that SSA has made a strategic decision to reduce the Baan consulting sector. Since many positions have been eliminated and people haven't been replaced, I have to assume that the layoffs were a financial and strategic decision and had nothing to do with the qualifications of those that have been laid off. <br />
<br />
Well, but since I'm not part of the SSA management I'm not privy to information about SSA's rationale. Unless you know for sure, I would be carefull with making statements like that. That's a blanket insult for many people and my experience with mass layoffs in general is that job qualification and technical skills are often not the determining factor for survival.<br />

(Some left and some other were fired) I know from good sources that some projects have been stopped due to the lack of qualified resourses and some more postponed.<br />
The SSA Management team in Latin America hasn´t been good keeping talent due to arrogance.<br />

I totally disagree with your comment about dumping BaaN and getting a demo of Microsoft &quot;Navision Axapta&quot;, people should get demo of Microsoft &quot;Great Plains&quot; instead, now that is great.  :D</div></div><hr />
