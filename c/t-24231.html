We are using BaanIVc3/c4 and are looking for an add-on, to use kanban together with baan. Is someone already using such a software-solution?<br />

<br />
I think there's an add-on from Baan/SSA called LeanWare. The software is adopting japanese kanban concept. You might want to call SSA in your area and ask for some demo.</div></div><hr />

before starting the implementation of Baan IV we used a specialized Kanban system (IKS). However, during the project we decided to switch it off and use Crystal Reports for the graphical Kanban board instead. The standard MRP allows for the generation of planned production orders according to the Kanban logic. The only thing which needs a customization is the recalculation of Kanban lot sizes. That together with a barcode system fulfills our requirements but I would be keen to know any other Kanban software you know of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm aware of 3 KanBan add-ons:<br />
SSA Leanware: only problem is, that you can't use a combination of non-Kanban and KanBan-items in paralel when you want to see the Kanban-orders in the overall sfc-planning<br />
Bridgelogix: add-on build by a UK-firm using standard Baan sofware philosophy and also supported since a few months by SSA themselves<br />
Cordys: KanBan-mgr based on BCP-platform, but now sold by a substitute of Cordys called Bizzapps. I've seen their first implementation from the side and in my humble opinion the product is not very mature yet........<br />
<br />
take care</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your original posting was from 2001 so I was wondering what decesion you or your company has made. Already running a KanBan solution somehow? Perhaps you could share your experience.<br />
