<br />
If it is only accessing and reading of data, you can consider using a rexec object or DLL, and send commands that call qptool.  I have done it quite a lot in the past, and it works perfect!  If you have Baan on a Windows server (your profile is not very specific!!!), I have a shareware program that allows rexec calls to the windows machine, thus you stay totally open-system!</div></div><hr />

Maybe you can use ODBC ( not for bisam/btam)</div></div><hr />

What is qptool?<br />
<br />
I'm trying to determine if I can write a program that, using rexec, can very quickly run queries against Baan. Using the OLE object for querying is so slow, and Oracle native queries have obvious disadvantages as well.<br />

You can use the keyword qptool and search on the forum for many threads.</div></div><hr />

(I had searched for 'baan qptool' on Google, but Google doesn't seem to return too much from baanboard.com)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can also use the Baan.Application object (OLE automation) for connecting to  Baan from VB and can invoke Baan DLLs to perform your job.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">23rd January 2004, 18:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but that's pretty slow and has problems with providing proper error messages and recovering from problems. Messages go into the BW Messages window which is pretty useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you that its slow .... but not always ... it depends on how you program it! Also messages can be called into VB too!!<br />
<br />
The biggest advantage of using it is simplicity ... you can also make standard VB DLLs out of this and use in any program. I have used it at several occasions and found it a good fit.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">24th January 2004, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I wrote a program using VB.NET to try and see how well and how efficient the OLE COM object is for running DLL functions, SQL queries, etc. While calling a simple DLL was fairly quick, using ottdllsql_query was unacceptably slow. Probably at least 100 times slower then qptool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vishbaan</div><div class="date">21st April 2004, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear WIM,<br />
<br />
I too have a similar requirement for a POS transaction. Updating baan areas from VB.<br />
<br />
could u pls forward me some sample lines of code (using qptool or OLE), for querying and handling inserts and updates.<br />
<br />
One problem I remember of is the hash key issue in baan. If you want to insert a record in baan table from outside baan, the hash key goes corrupt. But with the use of qptool the db operations, will it be handled by baan. Does a connection from VB to Baan using qptool cost a license in baan.<br />
<br />
I will really appreciate ur help in this<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

 To answer the last question first: qptool does not need a licence.<br />
<br />
The bad news: you cannot do updates with qptool.  You'll have to use either gcommand, or write an interface. This last is again bad due to the licence it takes...</div></div><hr />
