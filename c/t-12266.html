<br />
According to some inside info at Baan it looks like the first heads are starting to roll.<br />
The rumour goes that Mr. Laurens van der Tang himself is now sitting at home and has been asked not to return to the Baan office.<br />
Many more Baan &quot;managers&quot; below him are now worried to get laid off soon.<br />
I guess the summer of 2003 is going to be very ugly.<br />

<br />
The Baan anouncement credits Mr van der Tang with transforming the company from being 'product-driven' to being 'customer-driven'.  From my perspective, Baan has shown no signs of being even slightly 'customer-centric' let alone 'customer-driven'. <br />
<br />
Despite Mr van der Tang's efforts to undo its 'product-focus',  we need to be thankful that he was not entirely successful. The product is now going to survive, it may even flourish once-again, with the new management.    <br />

<br />
Confirmed 50 job cuts today (Jul 28th) in North American Support. No Suport group was ammune for the slashing of  the ax!<br />
<br />
No word yet on the exact break-down, but there were 3 that I know and used to work with from Baan tools support in Grand Rapids and Golden that will be on the unemployment line today.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Az Baan User</div><div class="date">28th July 2003, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">If the pattern form the previos rounds of cuts holds true, Morale at BGS is most likely very low today. Case backlogs will undoubtedly rise, as will resolution time.<br />
<br />
More than likely, you will seea backlash effect that sr. Baan management is surely dreading. That is, more and more customer pulling their support contracts with Baan, and going to 3rd parties for that support.<br />
<br />
I guess I should count myself one of the lucky ones. I was cut in the very first round in June 2002, and since found a job with a very stable Baan partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">29th July 2003, 03:38</div></div><div class="posttext">50 cuts? More like 15, most of which was unfortunately PEG.<br />
<br />
First level support was barely touched.<br />
<br />
Morale was low, as could be expected, but really, with a 98%+ customer satisfaction, I think that they have a little bit to play with before this dreaded &quot;customer backlash&quot;.<br />
<br />
I haven't heard of a single customer in the last quarter that pulled their contract, as a matter of fact, I've heard of a few new customers. and *Gasp* some old customers (and key customers) are upgrading to Baan 5c and others are asking for Gemini. <br />
<br />
If this cut does as it is supposed to and bring Baan back into profitability, maybe its a good thing, don't count Baan down and out yet..<br />

<br />
Latest rumours are:<br />
<br />
- SSA is looking at a way to eliminate all Baan partners (resellers, consulting, education, ASP, customizations, etc.). They prefer to work only direct with customers<br />
- soon Jan Baan himself will be meeting with the new President of Baan Company and will make some interesting proposals<br />
- all Baan employees working for the Open World have been laid off. So much for OpenWorldX.<br />

<br />
Is there going to be some other alternative for OpenWorld<br />
<br />
My thinking was Baan is doing good in OW by selling it to<br />
all it's existing customer base....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">30th July 2003, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no inside info, and this is just my observation.  However, from above we see that Jan Baan is meeting with SSA.  Jan now has vested interest in Cordy's ya?  And that is a  similar product to Baan OW.  In fact, there are several ways around the very expensive product, so it may be a sinking ship.  If Jan Baan and whatever the Triffit name is now is willing to develop this solution, why should SSA as well.<br />
<br />
Of course..that goes against the &quot;Eliminate all Baan Partners&quot; approach.....  my bet is that this decision, as well as all areas of the business, are in initial planning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanassist</div><div class="date">31st July 2003, 01:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Jan Baan owns Cordys (formerly Triffit) and these guys have created a new Web Services platform called Cordys WCP.<br />
This product does everything OpenWorldX will do in two years from now. They also employ most of the ex-Baan people who designed and created the OpenWorld platform many years ago.<br />
So, SSA is not stupid and it will be easy to replace OpenWorldX with WCP since they are already doing stuff OWX promises to do in the future.<br />
<br />
Recently Cordys also started to develop new applications in WCP as well. These will be add-ons (Automotive, A&amp;D, Service &amp; Maintenance, Lean Manufacturing, etc.) that are basically platform independent and will allow many existing Baan IV customers to move to Baan V or higher and still use an industry specific application on top of their Baan installation. Today in Baan's standard offering for Baan V and Gemini they do not even address these verticals. <br />
Another reason for Jan Baan to talk to SSA.<br />
<br />
The existing Baan customer base is for 80% on Baan IV so with Cordys WCP almost everybody can be satisfied.<br />
Those who want to leverage their existing IT investment use Cordys WCP to link other applications to Baan IV and there WCP serves as the Web Services product.<br />
Those who are on Baan IV with an extension like Automotive can now go to a higher version of Baan and use these Cordys add-on apps for their industry specific needs.<br />
<br />
Like with .NET the WCP platform is not only a Web Services platform it also becomes a programming language.<br />
Very powerfull!!!<br />
<br />
As I mentioned earlier the summer of 2003 can become very interesting for us Baan Lovers!!!<br />

<br />
The consulting ranks have been consistently pared back for a couple years now.  In my opinion, if anything, Baan needs partners more than ever.  Baan does not have the consulting resources to support all customers using their product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanow</div><div class="date">1st August 2003, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure whether there is a need of Baan Consulting Partners<br />
<br />
Is there enough growth and volume of Business which can support consulting partners.<br />
<br />
What I observe is most partners are depending on their existing customers for most part of the revenue.<br />
<br />
Lot of services like Migration can only be done by Baan<br />
<br />
I agree that Baan need partners for sales,technology ..etc</div></div><hr />

Here in the U.S. you will only see &quot;product&quot; partners.  They will want Baan to sell direct (if at all).  <br />

Sad to see more go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanassist</div><div class="date">4th August 2003, 21:43</div></div><div class="posttext">The only issue with Baan doing all the reselling, consulting, education, etc. direct is that all the experienced and good people have left Baan a long time ago.<br />
There is more knowledge about Baan IV and Baan V outside of Baan than within the company. In many cases these people have their own small consulting companies.<br />
<br />
If Baan thinks they can compete on the professional services (consulting, education, migration, customizations, etc.) side with these consulting companies they are making a big mistake.<br />
It would be better to perhaps hire these folks again.<br />
<br />
On the reselling side Baan Company will have a hard time selling Gemini. Too complex for the hotspot in the ERP market, the true mid market companies.<br />
From a product and user interface perspective Gemini may be very rich in functionality and look nice but it is not what the market is looking for.<br />
Ease of use, short implementation time and low cost of ownership those are the features new ERP customers want. Gemini does not have those and it will be a tough sell in the marketplace. We can only wish Baan Company all the best selling direct.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kvdtech</div><div class="date">4th August 2003, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Not another Baan Company mistake!<br />
<br />
It's not Baan making the decisions now; it's SSA.  True it will be really hard if not impossible to sell, implement, train, support, and consult without a good staff.  Baan hasn't had trained staff in a long time.<br />
<br />
SSA I would think would want to get all the ManManX users over onto Baan; it would be the logical path you would think.  I have gone to a few ManMan user group meetings and SSA seems to think that they can get them over onto their SSA-GT  AS400 solution.  Don't know anything about it.<br />

Gemini I'm afraid doesn't have a chance.  :mad:</div></div><hr />

Baan IV users are on a very solid platform and should stay there.  Wait till all support from SSA/Baan is up (8-10 years from now?).</div></div><hr />

Given the life cycle of an ERP system and technology used the so called &quot;replacement&quot; is expected to happen between 2005 and 2007.<br />

Look at all the early Baan and ManManX users that haven't upgraded yet.  I do think 4000 Baan customers will go through a selection.  Gemini is a lot different than Baan IV so why not go shopping?  Wouldn't you?<br />
<br />
New forum Ex-Baan Users, has posibilities!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 08:28</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO it is a matter of money that dictates the stay on BaanIV, as much as the stability of the software.  Just think about the IT expenses of the last couple of years. (Here in Europe!)<br />
<br />
First we had to buy B4, and implement it.  Also, since there are definitely some underdeveloped areas in B4, customizations had to be built, and maintained.  Then, after B4 came the Y2K glitch.  Again a considerable amount went to IT.  In the meantime, we had to keep updating B4 with the latest patches, and also modify our custom stuff to go along with it.  Then came the Euro conversion.  With the state of the first conversion software that Baan released, it cost quite a lot of money to try to get it working.  The later updates performed better, but still we had to test and retest...  And all the time the patches kept coming...<br />
<br />
So now, when we have a reasonable stable platform, we need some time (years) to get at least some ROI from IT!  And without spending thousands more to install a new package like Gemini.  I call it &quot;new&quot;, and that is what it is.  Baan can say a thousand times that there is a seamless upgrade path from B4 to Gemini, but I don't believe them.  Since the software is changed so drastically, there are huge areas that will have to be optimized and basically re-implemented to benefit from the new stuff.  A conversion is never enough!<br />
<br />
As for upgrading all customers before 2008, forget it!  There are still customers on Triton 2.2, who are not even considering a move to B4 or B5, so forget about Gemini.  And don't forget that ManManX is basically T2.2 as well, so all SSA's customers are in fact running T2.2!  As for the AS400 mentioned earlier in the thread, again, forget it!  The small and midmarket doesn't have the money to invest in completely new technology!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that most companies have been quite happy with their Baan implementations.   Very few have upgraded from IV to V because any proclaimed benefits of V did not outweigh the cost of the conversion.  Also because many companies have probably waited to see whether Baan was going to survive.<br />
<br />
In the longer term when systems will be upgraded just because they are 'old', I am sure that most companies will remember the troubles that Baan had and would look at the major alternatives.<br />
<br />
That is; UNLESS the new offerring (Gemini) is really good AND the migration is relatively painless and is low cost.  If it were to cost even half the cost of an alternative system I think there would still be reluctance to put faith in the long term viability of Baan during the next few years.<br />
<br />
I think the SMART thing for Baan to do is to encourage all existing Customers to upgrade to Gemini by providing the upgraded software free of charge and provide free migration tools and even some free upgrade services.  This way they would get to keep the existing user base (with the ongoing licence fees) and be able to boast about their relationship with Customers, the obvious acceptance of their software etc etc.<br />
<br />
If they they were to continue with their previous &quot;milch-cow&quot; view of Customers then I think they will retain very few. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 15:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been assuming that the new software will be free. I thought that if you have a current support contract that was the deal.<br />
<br />
Am I wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kvdtech</div><div class="date">5th August 2003, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are a current user the software is free but the migration tools and assistance to upgrade is not; that's a big issue.  <br />
<br />
Early users T2.2 up to Baan IV would have to migrate to Baan IVc4 before they could jump to Gemini.  If you have customizations heaven help you!<br />
<br />
I think this is a fine mess Baan got themselves into!:rolleyes:   <br />
<br />
<br />
I think Baan IV was a struggly but now it is a good platform to stick with.<br />
<br />
Guess we will have to wait to see what the next episode of this soap opera will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">6th August 2003, 02:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Licence fees provide for upgrade of software. However I think there is some lattertude possible with the interpretation of 'Upgrade'.<br />
<br />
One usually expects that new software will do more than than the older version. If Gemini does more than BaanIV/V, the 'old' Baan would want to charge for additional functionality that is packaged as a new module. <br />
<br />
There is also an issue with source-code for some customers who may have access to source code but their contract may not cover that explicitly. <br />
<br />
It will be interesing to see how a new Baan will approach the arithmetic of marketing.  That is: &quot;charge high prices - sell small quantity or charge low price - sell large quantity.&quot;  <br />

The new President addressed all the BaaN employees recently and his words were pretty 'tough'.<br />
The people with BaaN in The Netherlands were not too happy about what he was saying. One thing was clear: finally somebody at the top who dares to make decisions.<br />
<br />
Soon a big cut will be announced in The Netherlands. Rumours go that 300 people (or even more) will be laid off.<br />
<br />
Now the question becomes how much BaaN Development will be affected and what the impact will be on BaaN's future development activities.<br />
Many times customers have told me they like the BaaN product but not the way BaaN Company treats its customers. The biggest complaint is no communication with the outside world (customers, partners and media).<br />
I can only hope that the new Head is not going to kill the product. <br />
<br />
If BaaN Company wants to survive it will have to keep on developing and building good products and restore good relationships with its customer base.<br />
