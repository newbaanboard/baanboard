<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigJohn</div><div class="date">7th May 2003, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
   I had couple of questions on Openworld (again!).<br />
<br />
   1. If we have TIBCO as our EAI tool and we are using BCBE for connecting Baan.<br />
      What is the advantage if we use Open World together with TIBCO?<br />
   2. We are currently on Baan IV c3 / BCBE. If we were to use Openworld, do we need to       rewrite the BOIs? <br />
   3. What is Baan Portal?<br />
   4. A lot of the documents reg Openworld, say the following.<br />
      &quot;With OpenWorld, the communication between is components is at a semantic level <br />
      instead of a syntactic level.&quot;<br />
      What does this mean?<br />
   5. What is OpenWorldX? Is this the latest version of OW? When will it be available in the       market?<br />
   6. Does OW have standard adapters? If so for which products?<br />
   7. What are QCD/ DCDs?   <br />
<br />
   Thanks.<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">8th May 2003, 04:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I will try to answer the ones which I think I know.<br />
<br />
2. You will have to re-write client side BOIs, but not the Baan side (if any).<br />
<br />
3. Baan Portal was a re-branded version of SAP portal. For more information on the product, you can look at the SAP site.<br />
<br />
6. OpenWorld has standard adapters mostly for Baan products, such as EEnterprise products. They now have standard adapter for SAP as well. Custom adapter can also be built for other applications.<br />
<br />
7. QCD stands for Query Content Description and DCD stands for Data Content Description. These two documents together define a client side BOI. QCD holds the query that will be used and DCD holds the structure of the data that will be retrieved. The BOI compiler generates the java code based on these two documents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigJohn</div><div class="date">8th May 2003, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
   By Client side BOIs, do you mean the BOIS you use when Baan is acting like a client?<br />
   Thanks.<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">10th May 2003, 01:16</div></div><div class="posttext">No. By client side BOI I meant the BOI that is present on the client application. Depending on the requirements, a BOI can have a client side (that will reside on client application's machine, e.g. ESales) as well as Baan side components (which will be in the Baan Server). By switching from BCBE to OpenWorld, I think, you will only need to recreate the client side components.<br />
<br />
Hope it helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Youp2001</div><div class="date">15th May 2003, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Shaboo, but you also need to recreate your BOIs at Baan side. BCBE and BOW are completely different techniques. BOW uses XML messages internally. The BOIs have to be rewritten / regenerated in order to get them working.<br />
<br />
Youp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeyaseelan</div><div class="date">17th May 2003, 07:52</div></div><div class="posttext">BOI's need to be created at the Server side.I agree with Youp. If any of the Cordys users here , please comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">28th November 2003, 05:18</div></div><div class="posttext">The Cordys tools generate function servers to expose the logic of sessions. Using SOAP, you can do any insert/update/delete in any session. What we have also done is call our own DLLs, for some custom action such as &quot;complete production order&quot;. So the existing sessions don't have to be modified.<br />
<br />
Reads are done by going through the BDB Library.<br />
<br />
So this means that the client UI has to be redone in HTML/JavaScript, Java, Perl, or VB or anything else that can send/receive XML over HTTP.<br />
<br />
That's how it is for Baan IVc4. Apparently the newer Baan Connector from Cordys can optionally uses the OpenWorld JVM hooks, but I don't have any experience with that.</div></div><hr />
