I am not sure if I am posting this in right section. <br />
<br />
My question is- Has anyone has experince with Wise App framework from Fullscope. It seems to be a promising tool that helps integrating Baan to another applications. It has also support for webservices. From my initial talk, it seems to be better than Baan Openworld or to Cordys. I want to take opinion of anyone who is using this. The nice thing that I liked about Wise APP is that I can use the same technlogy for numerous things like- BArcdoing, web, integrating with other App, and to me that is a very plus point.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your opinion.<br />

Thanks for your reply. <br />
<br />
How did you find the product? From my initial thought I think they have a nice concept and I think wiseapp has a better approach than Baan openworld. Did you find any limitation?<br />
