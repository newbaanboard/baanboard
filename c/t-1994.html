Is anyone using this product with Baan and how easy/difficult is it to do consolidated reporting across companies??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leonvdp</div><div class="date">1st August 2002, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan recommends the use of Crystal. I've heard quiet a lot about it and most if not all of it is very positive. I'd recommend you check it out. As far as I know it's a lot easier to use than WebFocus, which is also not endorsed by Baan. <br />
<br />
Check it out at http://www.crystaldecisions.com/partners/strategic/baan/<br />
<br />
Just a thought.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to go with WebFocus, let me know how it works for you. I don't know much about it, but I've heard it's pretty tough stuff to use - definitely not something that would enable your users to do (some of) their own reporting...<br />
<br />
regards,</div></div><hr />
