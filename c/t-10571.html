<br />
I am not much familiar with web services.<br />
<br />
if backoffice is in baan and BIS used for analysis,<br />
<br />
there can be issues like retail outlets accessing, syncing the data; outdoor marketing not able to have any remote access; some remotely located logitics not able to post/access the the backoffice with ease. Mobile users not able to view the analysis data; Integration with other systems etcc<br />
<br />
can webservices help on these areas <br />
<br />
can you post some details<br />

It really helps in connecting with external application, without knowing on what it is implemented. <br />
We made similar webservices, which can be invoked by dealers. dealers<br />
 1.can know the price of any item, <br />
2.can order item, <br />
3. can see the status of their order. <br />
      sitting in their system. <br />
That is the best part. Once we make any webservice, any application can invoke that, without knowing the implementation.<br />

<br />
In case of a practical scenario as follows:<br />
<br />
Baan (B40c4) being the backoffice - Supplier End they have IE Browser ; If Let us say supplier sends shipment for a Baan Purchase Order Placed.<br />
<br />
Is this web services developed and left as a service in Baan server?<br />
<br />
How is this done, can you give some info pls.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunprasath</div><div class="date">22nd July 2003, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
let me make one thing clear. a Webservice is NOT a web application. Many people misunderstand this term, as think it is a type of webapplication. <br />
but, webservice can be described as, &quot;accessing any business logic on Internet&quot;, in lay man's terms. <br />
to be short, a client application, sends a XML file,(in a standard format, which we call as SOAP) which is received by a server application (or a service provider), and it invokes any business processes and then sends response back to the user.(which is again by sending an XML file). the client can use the results.<br />
<br />
In ur scenario, when we create a webservice for a baan customer, suppliers can invoke this service sitting in their own system. lets say, the customers have SAP. Sitting inside SAP, they can invoke our webservice. and submit the shipment details.  <br />
<br />
As far as making a webservice for baan is concerned, we can do it, either by Openworld or BCK. as making a webservices needs, XML support(WSDL, SOAP, UDDI), which baan doesnt give directly, but possible by external application connectivity with baan. <br />
<br />
If we want the customer to go to a website, and give the shipment details, then any webapplication will solve the purpose. <br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />

First various reports are generated and then they are available thru any internet browser (baan data can be accessed) - this helps keep baan licences for those whose activities lays beyond reports only. Of course all intranet accounts are properly restricted - logins, passwords, level of access etc. Reports are updated on periodical basis. External access still in the future mainly because of data safety reasons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skennedy</div><div class="date">28th November 2006, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">web services have become far more mainstream in the past years, since they offer a standardized method by which systems can interact. We developed a web services module for our integrated BaaN portal solution. Initially, our portal was designed as an e-commerce / supply chain solution to allow human users at trading partner's to have a secure / simple interface to perform real-time inquiries, transactions and generate reports right out of BaaN, via point &amp; click GUIs. <br />
<br />
As an extension to this, our SOAP/XML web services provide a simplified method to allow any of these things via DIRECT systems integration. Furthermore, WSDL's (web services descriptive language clients) even go as far as virtually automating the integration process itself, making it easy on IT resources at both ends. We've created web services which bridge our client's BaaN with customers, suppliers, external e-commerce sites and even internally with shop floor data collection suites, kanban packages etc... whether they're .net, java or pretty much anything.</div></div><hr />
