<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanassist</div><div class="date">12th March 2004, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
It is time for another 'baanassist'.<br />
<br />
Things have been very quiet around the new Baan Web-Client since the announcement by SSA at the last BWU in Charlotte, NC.<br />
Unfortunately this was only done to out-smart Jan Baan with his plans for a Cordys Web-Client for Baan.<br />
In the meantime SSA silently laid off more people at Baan, upset Baan customers with their license-spy tool and created another hype by the announcement to do an IPO at Wall Street this summer.<br />
<br />
It is slowly becoming obvious that the owners of SSA never had any intentions to invest in Baan. By making Baan profitable and to further reduce costs they will make SSA Global Baan more attractive for investors later this year.<br />
Now that almost all developers at Baan have been let go it is clear there will be no release of Gemini this year. <br />
The IPO is more important and time has come to cash in.<br />
<br />
In a way it is sad to see how such a great product has become the victim of bookkeepers and greedy investment bankers.<br />
My advise to all Baan customers out there: contact your nearest Microsoft Business Solutions partner for a demonstration of Navision Axapta.<br />
<br />
Do whatever you think is best!<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />

I am surprised about your reaction baanassist, because I know, that &quot;we&quot; are almost finished with the Webtop (web interface for BaanIVc) and for BaanERP 5.0c, 5.2a the Webtop is already available.<br />

Hope that I am not one of the silently laid off developers, because then I am here illegal ;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">2nd June 2004, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">What we have heard from SSA is that the JVM from Sun contains a bug which causes a problem. For this reason you have to use the MS JVM right now. They have reported the bug to Sun but it's not solved yet. <br />
<br />
Hopefully (but I have to ask as well) we can use other clients after this is solved.<br />
<br />
To be honest: what I have heard untill know like that SSA is going to deliver portingsets for linux and plans to build a db-driver for mysql I think that they are doing their best. However it will take some time to make them available since I assume that they like to deliver a stable product.<br />

However, the release notes for Webtop 3.0 say that BCLM is required for Webtop 3.0 and looking at the contents of 140164 it seems to contain components that are part of webtop and its connection to BCLM, so I'd say it needs to be installed too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nelsonR</div><div class="date">14th June 2004, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the following notes that reference Webtop limitations on Baan IV.<br />
<br />
Among other things, Forget Webtop if you are running any Baan IV extensions:  (nas0,sch1, etc).  Also you will not be able to print to any windows printer.  (What else is there?????)<br />
<br />
Roy<br />
<br />
Note 3: Baan IV Extensions and Localisations have not been tested with Webtop 3.0, and thus are not supported at the moment. <br />
<br />
When running SSA BaanIVc4 on a Windows server, you will not be able to print to Windows server printers.<br />
<br />
A solution for this problem will be created after the release of Webtop 3.0. <br />
Support of Dynamic Enterprise Modeller (DEM) will become available after the release of Webtop 3.0. <br />
<br />
A limited number of sessions (among others: Graphs, ASCII) are not supported in Webtop.</div></div><hr />

3.1.3	Thin-client<br />
A thin-client is not allowed to access local resources. Local resources are for example the Windows registry, files, directories etc. Baan offers functionality that depends on accessing local resources that can not be supported in a true thin-client solution. <br />
The following functionality is not supported because it depends on local resources:<br />
	BW print<br />
BW print is a software component that makes it possible to print via the locally installed printers.<br />
	File transfer (&#61517;)<br />
File transfer to the client and from the client to the Baan back-end is not supported</div></div><hr />

The solution that they promised us will work that webtop will try to start a local bwprint, if it's not available than it will be transfered to the client.<br />

Of course registry settings etc. still will be a issue (since not everyone is allowed to work as a local admin).<br />

<br />
Reason for asking is that while developing the WBBW, it was a pain in the butt to try and find out when the bshell was finished sending screen information to the client.  With the bshell from the porting set I had available then, there was no message telling the client when the page was finished, so it was trial-and-error to determine the correct point in time to start generating the HTML page.</div></div><hr />
