Reading the &quot;User's Guide for ERP LN Archiving&quot; still one thing is still not 100% clear to me. You create an archive company and &quot;feed&quot; it first with parameters and general/master data from the productive system. As soon as you use one of those archive/delete sessions the data will be (depending on what archiving strategy you have chosen) for example deleted in the productive system and transferred (compressed) to the archive company. Am I right? What happens if you use such an archive/delete session without having an archive company defined? The data is then (in most cases) stored in the &quot;history&quot; - isn't it the same thing?<br />

Yes, as I understand it History means the same as Archive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your thoughts. In the meantime we have created an archive company in our test environment using Infor's documentation. In fact, if you do not have an archive company defined, then the data will be deleted and stored in history tables of the productive company (or deleted only).  <br />
<br />
The documentation is useful, but - sometimes confusing (you have to run &quot;create tables&quot; earlier as it is described in the documentation, also the description of the necessary user authorizations is not correct or at least incomplete). For any of those who will use archiving in Baan: Testing the whole procedure is vitally important, so - do this before you &quot;go live&quot; with it.<br />

<br />
Thus archiving procedure to be followed as per Infor guidelines first removes the data from the dynamic tables and finally on running the archiving \ deletion session it also removes the data from the history tables.<br />
<br />
If you just delete the data from the dynamic tables and keep the history data in the live companies, the database size is somewhat reduced, however running of deletion / archiving session also removes the data from the history tables so as to reduce the database completely.<br />
<br />
Thus archived data can be kept separately in different server / database.<br />
<br />
Thus, to my opinion, both are not the same things.<br />
