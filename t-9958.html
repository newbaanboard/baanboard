<br />
This new product was developed using standard Baan and Microsoft tools. It allows Baan users to attach any kind of file to any kind of entity in Baan, such as customer, item, BOM line etc.   <br />
<br />
Furthermore, you may define references between entities such as item and sale order line, which will allow you to view files that were attached to an item while maintaing a sale order line for that item. <br />
<br />
The attached file can be of any size or format. The files are organized in subdirectories in a shared directory, which is located anywhere the administrator defines.<br />
<br />
The files to be attached may be taken from any path on a local computer or from any shared folder.<br />
<br />
<br />
