<br />
I have seen all Baan CRM Products. Generally Speaking, There are three product families: iCRM/E-Enterprise/SalesPoint, All can integrated with BaanIVc and BaanERP5.<br />
<br />
iCRM is developed by aurum, which is C/S Structure. The families include SalesPlus, MarketingPlus, ConfigurationPlus (Configuration Modeler+E-Configuration), Pricing Modeler...<br />
<br />
SalesPoint is a B/S Structure Product, It may integrate with iCRM+BaanERP, Maybe it is not used widely.<br />
<br />
E-Enterprise is a B/S architecture suite, includes E-Server, E-Sales, E-Service, B2B, E-Procument..., It is development to extend BaanERP, so it may be worked well with BaanERP.<br />
<br />
A single product: E-Configuration Enterprise, is developed to replace E-Configuration, although both of them may be embeded in iCRM, SalesPoint and E-Enterprise, to provide Configurable product support, E-Configuration Enterprise is more powerful.<br />
<br />
