<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">22nd May 2003, 20:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all.<br />
<br />
Although I'm a newbie to this forum, not so to Baan, as the following will explain... :D<br />
<br />
I've built a web interface for BaanIV, whereby the standard windows client of BaanIV is emulated and translated to HTML and JavaScript.  Currently only MS Internet Explorer is correctly supported, but, if there is demand, I will finish the Netscape version.<br />
<br />
The product is now ready to be piloted, meaning beta version.  I'm looking for a couple of sites who are willing to help me test the product.<br />
<br />
The idea behind this product was born during a working spell with TopTier's BDN.  I was frustrated by the fact that you could only display data from BaanIV, and not update (or maintain) the data.  Also, whenever a form in BaanIV was modified, BDN had to be updated as well.  Thus, after some asking around at Baan Development, I decided to build an interface myself.  And it seems to be getting there... :) <br />
<br />
The product consists of a server program, which runs on Windows (preferably NT or better, although even 95 works), and acts as a web server.  The listening port is user definable, with a default of port 80, which is the standard web port.  The framework for secure sockets is in place, although not yet activated at this point in time.<br />
<br />
The client side needs only MS Internet Explorer.  No cookies, no OCX controls, perfectly zero client!<br />
<br />
Anybody interested in becoming a beta tester?  Please let me know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Nico van Beest</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another problem (which is one of the reasons for stopping Netscape development for now) is event bubbling.  Clicking on a form should traverse the objects from top to bottom, and not the other way.  Otherwise selecting records becomes a problem in multi-occurance forms!<br />

If there is something new about such kind of client pls let me know. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old Vens</div><div class="date">28th May 2003, 08:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is also the passage from www.mozilla.org<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Description<br />
name is an optional attribute that specifies the name of content window. Syntax<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe name=&quot;name&quot; ...&gt;<br />
<br />
Example<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe name=&quot;content-primary&quot; id=&quot;main-window&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
Notes<br />
The name attribute is used instead of the id to reference a content window from other parts of the chrome, as when a button loads new content by changing the attribute on the named iframe:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&lt;iframe name=&quot;main-iframe&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
function loadPage() {<br />
  ed = document.getElementById(&quot;main-iframe&quot;)<br />
  ed.setAttribute(&quot;src&quot;, &quot;newpagetoedit.html&quot;)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
You cannot fetch content window (i.e. getElementById(id)) using the id attribute.<br />
<br />
 -------------------------------<br />
... So maybe there is still an opportunity to solve the problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">20th August 2003, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a look at the information on the BWU site (http://www.bwu.org//FW2003/Content_Page.aspx?name=home) about the Fall Workshop, and it seems that the whole program is fixed already.  Thus, it would be impossible to present anything in a session.  Buying a stand is out of the question due to the enormous costs involved (stand, airplane tickets, accomodation, etc.)<br />
<br />
Therefore, a question:  who of you people are already attending as presentators/stand owners?  And, if there is anybody, could we &quot;borrow&quot; a piece?  Alternatively, any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This looks like a very interesting product.<br />
What are the security implications of using this product? If I understand correctly you are sending plain ASCII to the client browser.<br />
Is there a possibility of encryption or is it intended for internal use only? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
The reason for not activating it is that we would have to buy the encryption keys.  (Testing was done using demo keys, which expire in 30 days.)  As we are a two-man company, with zero investment funds, and no other need for HTTPS/SSL at this point in time, we decided not to go this route until the product has proven itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srilal</div><div class="date">17th September 2003, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Nico,<br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting...I would like to be Beta tester too, here my systems configurations.<br />
<br />
Baan    		-	baanIVc3<br />
OS Platform 	-  	Sun Solaris<br />
RDBMS 		- 	Oracle 8.0.4<br />
Clients  		-	WIN2k Professional<br />
<br />
Is it possible me to use your excellent product with this configuration?<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Srilal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">17th September 2003, 14:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Srilal<br />
<br />
As for beta-testing, please send me a PM, with your regular e-mail address, then I'll contact you outside the board.  I'm doing this to keep the board from becoming a contact/support site for my product, since the aim of the board is Baan. ;)<br />
<br />
Regarding the configuration, I don't think it poses a problem.  I haven't tested it against IVc3, but, since it uses the same porting set as IVc4, it *has to* work.  The database and O/S are actually irrelevant.  As long as the BaanIV environment is reachable with a BW client, and you have a Win2K machine to act as server, it works!  The WBBW simulates the normal BW communication, so if Baan can be reached by the BW, it can be reached by the WBBW as well.<br />
<br />
The only actual requirement is that the server is at least WinNT.  The WBBW does run on Win95/98, but the TCP/IP (winsock) implementation of these versions is quite bad, resulting in a dramatic loss of performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">17th September 2003, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty impressive ! I guess this is targeting the BaanIV market ?, as BaanV has  internet/intranet capabilities.that come with it.<br />
What about speed ? escpecially if Baan is in a  3 tier setup  (app and database on different servers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">17th September 2003, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, purely for the BaanIV market.<br />
<br />
Performance is a little slower than the BW, since there is an overhead of translating the forms to DHTML.  The big gain is that where the BW doesn't really work via dail-up connections (time-out problems), this does!<br />
<br />
Another difference is that it is a web-application, and the normal short-cut keys do not work yet!  I actually never thought about this, since I took it for granted that a user who is working via the web will be &quot;mouse-driven&quot;.  Something to rectify, and it is on the wishlist from the beta testers.</div></div><hr />
