PeopleSoft in £1bn swoop for JD Edwards <br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
PeopleSoft is to acquire JD Edwards in a move that creates the worlds second-largest enterprise applications software company. <br />
The $1.7bn (£1bn) deal will give the combined group more than 11,000 customers in 150 countries.<br />
<br />
&quot;The combination of JD Edwards and PeopleSoft is a winning one for customers. Both midsized and large enterprise customers will have access to the broadest suite of integrated enterprise software applications in the world,&quot; said PeopleSoft president and chief executive officer Craig Conway.<br />
<br />
Conway said that PeopleSoft had a strong enterprise portfolio with a focus on HR and financials, while JD Edwards was strong in the mid market.<br />
<br />
The merger would provide PeopleSoft with JD Edwards' skills in manufacturing and the AS/400 platform, he added.<br />
<br />
Writing earlier this year, Giga analyst Byron Miller noted that, &quot;JD Edwards is re-emerging as the clear midmarket leader in its chosen industries: manufacturing and distribution, asset intensive, and projects and services.<br />
<br />
&quot;It remains the only one of the tier-one ERP [enterprise resource planning] vendors (SAP, Oracle, PeopleSoft, JD Edwards) to be fully focused on the midmarket.&quot;<br />
<br />
PeopleSoft's Conway admitted the merged company would have some product overlaps but said there was very little overlap among users. However, he did note that in the last quarter a third of new PeopleSoft customers were mid-market companies.<br />
<br />
JD Edwards UK customers include oil giants Shell and BP, pharmaceutical company SmithKlineBeecham, building firms Miller Construction and Foster Wheeler, and services company WS Atkins</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a merger by two respectable companies who are each in good shape.  If the SSA-GT / Baan acquisition produces a merged company based on the Baan product and SSA management expertise we can look forward to very healthy competition building better products and lowering costs.</div></div><hr />
