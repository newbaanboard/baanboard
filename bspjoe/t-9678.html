<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">17th April 2003, 13:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at the two products means also looking from different angles. After all, technically Navision is a far easier product to admin and develop on, with a large number of tools that Baan needs third party products for. This means that if you gave a techi the Navision product, he would soon realise that everything he wanted to do on Baan, could be done on Navision in a fraction of the time.... but is this a good thing. <br />
<br />
As for functionality, well.... Most functionality works that same as any product, after all, when you make a cake, you simply follow a recipe. Only making a few changes, a touch of cinnimon, a grating of nutmeg... thats company or business process after all.<br />
<br />
So, the only way to see what the functional differences are, is to see the product itself. This, I am sure considering current changes, can be set up by your friendly consultancy team that will soon be contacting you to sell you the product.<br />
<br />
As for the matter of Baan's sale, many of the readers will be considering a move to Navision, due to cost, speed of installation and market saturation. This could lead to a mass fallover with consultancies being over worked with companies wanting to move ASAP..... I ask for you not to jump to soon, give Baan a chance, after all, its a good product, as a software package, it may still have a future, but only as long as the user base stays with it.... <br />
<br />
But as for the differences, its all a personal view, so go and see the product....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ericthomas</div><div class="date">17th April 2003, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jpvdgiessen</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 22:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Navision is a good product but if you want the same functionallity as Baan you need third parties or dealers.<br />
<br />
The module project (tppdm, tpppc etc.) in Baan is not in Navision and you need to buy (in the Netherlands) a Navision based product like 4PS.<br />
<br />
Further, Navision is M$- based, while Baan supports several OS.<br />
<br />
So if you want to decide, ask a demo of Navision.</div></div><hr />
