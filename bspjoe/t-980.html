<br />
Hit by market forces, Baan misfortunes, I tried my hands on Oracle Applications....couldn't stick on to it..<br />
<br />
- 11i is helluva buggy piece of software. Apparently 5000+ patches. Gave up life trying to create a sales order (Kids!!... dont try this at home!!  ;) <br />
<br />
- &quot;Financially&quot; fit. Enterprise looking for Financial applications can shortlist Oracle (11i), can implement once the application is stable. Manufacturing......a NO NO  (is it true that they are trying to look like Baan in Manufacturing!)<br />
<br />
- There are some cool workflow features<br />
- User friendly screens (sales order lines can handle return orders or drop-ship orders)<br />
- Well.... be prepared to use an army of techies in PL/SQL, DBA's, Application DBA's, Forms and reports ....its not my intention to miss anyone here....apologies!<br />
- Strong CRM strategy and tightly integrated CRM package (can run on Baan, SAP, PeopleSoft)<br />
- Any idea as to why Oracle still calls the (zero foot print) architecture as 3 tier architecture?!!<br />
- Not certified on MS-SQL RDBMS (something like Larry has  distaste Gate's new home)<br />
<br />
Somebody help me understand, how Oracle Applications capture market and why not Baan. <br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

I think Oracle applications has been and still is floating on the success and aura of the Oracle database server software. In that area they are king and I am sure alot of people perceive as Oracle Applications as a logical extension of the database software, same methodology, better integration. Whether this is true or not is another matter :)</div></div><hr />
