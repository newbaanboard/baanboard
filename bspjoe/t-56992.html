<br />
actually, I work in BaaN IV and I am wondering what is the future of BaaN? Does Infor plan to continue to develop and support it, or is it a &quot;dead thing&quot; ? <br />
<br />
Thank you?</div></div><hr />

INFOR just living with current customer only... squeeze current customer.. find fault... on license agreement to get more $$$ . no new life..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">10th November 2009, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">No, that's just not true.<br />
<br />
In fact, Infor is investing a lot in the ERP core product. And I'm not talking about all those SOA/Evolve architecture astronauts toys, but about the classical ERP (LN) monolith.<br />
<br />
FP5 is out since a year now, where a lot of new functionality had been developped for vender managed inventory (VMI). FP6, scheduled for end of this year (and this time it looks like they're gonna make it) will focus on automotive. For FP7 (promised for end of next year) some streamlining features are honestly considered that were requested by the german user group (DBuG). <br />
<br />
No, despite of what were the fears when Infor took over: The strategy - or better: what we outsiders see as results of the strategy - is not to milk the installed base as long as this base is willing to sit on a dead horse. That horse is kept well, quite alive and in pretty good shape.<br />

<br />
old customer paid a premium of the license cost as last time is high and hence maintenance support fee high...<br />
<br />
<br />
new users licenses cost now so cheap.... hence maintenance cheap too</div></div><hr />

On BaanIV the MyDay integration will be for free if you are on maintenance.<br />

At the Baan side the changes are delivered as normal solutions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the actual Version of MyDay this is true! But i had a speech with an Infor employee during a german User Group event last week. He told me that in future versions also other OS / DB (i.e. Linux/Oracle) combinations will be supported by MyDay.<br />
<br />
<br />
i am still on Baan IVc4 SP10 and not intend to upgrade the service pack.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but how can you expect to use new functionality without updating your Software. I believe this is a normal process. ;)<br />

It's not really important if it's true or not : this is exactly how a lot of the Infor ERP customers I visit are feeling. At the end you can say 'I was right' but that does not help. I also know Infor is investing in the software - I'm only concerned when I listen to Infor ERP customers.<br />
So I actually agree with you  I only think there's a mismatch in what's happing - a lot of good developments' and what customers are noticing / feeling. <br />
<br />
Best Regards, <br />
Mario</div></div><hr />
