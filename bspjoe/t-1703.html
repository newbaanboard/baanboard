Baan is now in a position to be a fierce competitor in its targeted industries, most of which overlap squarely with SAPs.

Recently, SAP began to address making R/3 more agile, but its approach in vision and execution is still somewhat behind other competitors  i.e. Baan  that have focused on this issue for a while.<br />

After subjecting its users to two false Data Warehouse starts - Logistics Information System (LIS) and Open Information Warehouse - SAP is now preparing to unveil its Business Information Warehouse (BIW), a more integrated, OLAP-enabled revision of OIW (1Q98). While comprehensive on paper, BIW is an ambitious architectural undertaking, even for SAP and its vast development resources.<br />
