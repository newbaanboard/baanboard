I successfully integrated BaaN with SAP R/3. I think its good to share my experience here. I feel SAP R/3 integration is much simpler than BaaN. In SAP there is no dependency like OpenWorld  , BCK and it has good flexibility for interfacing by any other third party programs. <br />
<br />
Both BaaN and SAP R/3 supports the concept of Business Objects. In SAP, they give the entire middleware free of cost. Especially the one I used is JCO ( Java Connection Object) . JCO is a JNI (Java Native Interface)  based middleware for interfacing Java applications. JCO is same like BCBE API's the one we have in BaaN. <br />
<br />
We can build our Business Objects(BAPI's) using BAPI Builder like we have BOI builder in BaaN. There are lot of inbuilt Business Objects avaialble in SAP same like BOI in BaaN that comes with BCK Kit or OW. SAP R/3 supports other integration methodologies like ALE, IDoc and RFC. <br />
<br />
I see SAP is growing day by day becaz its openess and flexibility towards  integrating any other applications.</div></div><hr />

Since OpenWorld version 2.3 it's available. With this connector you can call for example SAP BAPI straight from BaanIV or ERP. <br />
