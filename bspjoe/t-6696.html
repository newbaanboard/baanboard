Determining the Best Platform for your ERP Solution (IBM) - <br />
<br />
Business enterprises today rely more than ever on the hardware and network infrastructure to support their business operations. One of the key considerations in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software implementation is the selection of the enterprise server. Often an organization will have hardware preferences that do not always represent the most appropriate platform for their ERP solution. The enterprise server platform methodology is intended to assist business and IT staff to perform an objective analysis and reach a decision while taking into consideration the specific needs of the executive management, business community, and IT community.

Edwards OneWorld's the ERP solution primarily featured in this analysis, the methodology can also be applied to other ERP software packages in the selection of the enterprise server. <br />
