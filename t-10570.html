<br />
We are creating an ASP.net interface to our Baan software.  All is working successfully except &quot;Dates&quot;.<br />
<br />
We need to have an ASP.net session update a date field.  However we must not be sending the correct<br />
format  We have tried using 'mmddyyyy' as '08012003' to the Date in the form but my Baan logs  indicate that we are receiving a zero.<br />
<br />
If I send the same data to my form from another Baan session, this works. But using  ASP.net, we are failing.<br />
<br />
Can any one help me send the correct Date format ? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Thanks you for your reply....I did not find any specific<br />
API information concerning how to send a date from ASP.net to<br />
my Baan form.  <br />
<br />
We are on Baan IVc4.  I am logging the dates sent to the Baan<br />
form and they are coming in as 0.  We have tried sending a string of six characters as '080103' and as eight characters '08012003'.<br />
<br />
Would any one have any further suggestions ?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd July 2003, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking of this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7409&amp;highlight=date) and this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1269&amp;highlight=Date).  I do not know anything about ASP.net, but one of these threads mention that for using stpapi and ole the format &quot;mmddyyyy&quot;.  And it would be a string.  I was thinking that it may be the same when calling a stpapi command from ASP.net.<br />
<br />
You may also need to use something like Al Smith posted.  I know on my stpapi commands I use something like str$(received.date). So you may need to convert the date like Al mentioned and then pass it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">4th July 2003, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all!  I'm getting confused :confused: by these date fields:<br />
the format &quot;mmddyyyy&quot;. <br />
But the user manual (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=31016) states the following:<br />
<br />
Any necessary type conversion is performed, however, Date and UTC fields must be put in the internal Baan format. Enum fields must be put in the internal byte value. Examples: str$(date.num()), str$(-123.45), str$(etol(tcyesno.yes)).<br />
So, what is the correct way?  And if the first suggestion is right, wouldn't that be linked to the date format of the user?</div></div><hr />

<br />
By testing all the formats that we could think of, the only one that works is the &quot;internal baan format&quot;.  We are passing the number of days since &quot;01-01-0001&quot;.  I am guessing that the API calls from our  external program, ASP.net, are converting the date to the 'MMDDYYYY' that my Baan form and script will accept.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it depends on what you are doing.  On my system I had to format the date for Excel to do a select using one method.  I think the method Al Smith posted and jholdred confirmed, are how to pass dates using stpapi commands from something like ASP.NET and Excel. So no matter what you user is configured to use you need to get it into a format Baan can use.  So I am not sure there is only one method.<br />
