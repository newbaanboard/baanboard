We want to make another secondary backup server so that Baan users will automatically be transferred to this one after failure of the primary one, without any knowledge of failure and primary one will also take the control after its recovery.<br />
 <br />
Regarding that clustering is one of solutions. But, we are not looking for that one. We are searching for another solution so that File Replication will happen taking into account the above condion.<br />
<br />
Does anybody has any experience over this kind of solution ?<br />
Please suggest the popular softwares available on the basis of rating.<br />
<br />
I thank everyone for your valuable suggestion in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me too looking for same sort of requirement, is there any doc on BaaN Site which talks about this concept of backup or clustering ???<br />
<br />
We still havew the BaaN Support, if anybody can provide me the relevant doc. no., i will be really thankfully.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">26th September 2003, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many approaches to disaster recovery. <br />
<br />
1. To have database replication using SQL servers's native capabilities.  <br />
2. To use tabledef6.1 in Baan' to do replication . Please do good  testing if u try this option before putting to use.<br />
3. Clustering servers  is the best option . This only will allow seamless failover without downtime of a fraction second. However this is costliest.<br />
4. File replication approach will never be online . It will be in batch mode.And further this is possible only if u have consistent database snapshot of particular moment of time . I don't know if SQL server has such capbilities or not . In solaris 8 for example, there is such utility  which takes consistent image of a file system in a couple of seconds and creates a temporary mirror file system from where one can replicate files to backup server.<br />
5.To use high speed SAN (which vendors claim to be failure-proof ) attached to both servers and keep the logic server installed on both servers using baan networked licence. Baan database resides on this SAN.<br />
<br />
In most cases u need to re-license ur baan using network license module and Baan porting set on both server has to be same. Except clustering and  SAN solution , you need to take care of Baan's file system objects urself for keeping the backup server uptodate for data dictionary objects.<br />
<br />
So the normal criteria in selecting the options are<br />
<br />
1. Realistic allowed downtime in case of failure.<br />
2. Ease of failover<br />
3. One time and recurring costs.<br />
4. Administrative ease of maintaining the replication servers.<br />
5. Replication of Baan file system objects . <br />
<br />
Despite all the disaster recovery steps, u may still have the disaster and no recovery if you network is not reliable or there is network failure.</div></div><hr />

In the case a server is getting down an other server will take it over (with the same IP adress and settings as the first one)<br />
You don't need to replicate the data, because a SAN can't crash.<br />
