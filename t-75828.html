<br />
I would like to create purchase invoices on table tfacr100 using BODs.<br />
<br />
With Infor OS I need to read a json or xml and with a BOD populate data in tfacr100.<br />
<br />
Does anyone knows how to do that? I think there isn't a standard BOD for this table. How could associate this table to a custom BOD? Is the verb &quot;process&quot; to create data?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />

I have been describing how to create a standard BOD on any table using the Import Table function in an LN Studio interface project. First generate a default interface (will become a BDE) and then remove the implementation and change the type on definition to BOD. Setup the methods and use the generated WSDL to model the BOD from your supplier documents, and model the BOD implementation in Studio. You will have to create a zip file based on the methods defined in an XML file, and an XSD file based on the WSDL to add your document to the Data Catalog in ION after which you can setup a flow to import the BODs into LN...<br />
<br />
But, be aware of the functional limitations and implications when doing this, since usually (an especially in Finance) just adding data does not build up information (like you have to be sure the correct relations like supplier data and purchase orders etc do exist).<br />
<br />
Best of luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
many thanks for your reply, Unfortunately I don't have LN Studio and without studio I think it is impossible that kind of integration :(<br />
<br />
At this moment I managed to create a custom BOD on ION DESK and with a stored procedure I can populate data in tfacr100, but now I need to convert a json file (from supplier) to my custom BOD,<br />
<br />
Is it possible with ION Desk? I have just tried with a mapping block but it needs a BOD as a source...<br />
<br />
Best reagards.</div></div><hr />
