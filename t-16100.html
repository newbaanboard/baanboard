<br />
In 2000 we started working with BaanIVc4 (informix database). We use a Single-Finance / Multi-Logistics setup (9 companies). We use the packages tc, tf, tp, td and ti.<br />
<br />
We have reached a point where itÂ´s necessary to decrease the data volume. We are thinking about archiving only Finance (without logistics), because the financial tables (tfgld106, acr200 and acp200) cause the most performance decrease (table tfgld106 is over 15,5 million records). Archiving both (logistic and finance) will take a lot time, and the expected performance increase of archiving logistic is small. We are thinking about archiving logistics next year.<br />
<br />
We've already tested a few things, and it seems to work alright. Has anybody experiences in archiving only Finance? or maybe in changing the archiving sequence (start with tf instead of td and ti)? Any suggestions are welcome!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Koen</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can archive finance (tfgld106, acp/r200) only, if you have archived intgeration (tfgld410-419).<br />
You can archive the integration only, if you have archived/deleted th logistical orders/projects etc.<br />
<br />
If you have more questions send me an email.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply to my post about archiving Finance only. You say it's necessary to archive the integration. On our test server we have archived one logistical company. The integration transactions related to the pcs-module have been archived to the archive company. We have also archived the integration transactions with the same original company as the logistical company.<br />
 <br />
Afterwards we have archived the general ledger (with tfgld6205m000). It worked correctly, although the integration transactions of all the other logistical companies were not archived. If it was necessary to archive all the logistical / integration data, the session tfgld6205m000 should not have worked? The general ledger of the year 2000 was moved to the archive company.<br />
 <br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
There isn't a relationship between the archiving of your finance and your integration transactions. In other words it's possible to archive only finance transactions without archiving your logistic data. <br />
<br />
With regards,<br />

<br />
P.S.: Make sure that all interim accounts reconcile to all the related ledgers before you archive your data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are archiving finance only in this moment (tfgld106/tfacr200/tfacp200) without archive tfgld410 (integrations) and it is working correctly.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have the latest solution for tfgld6205m000.<br />
<br />
Bye,<br />

<br />
I've done a test archiving finance only, and archiving integration transactions. I changed functions of archiving integration transactions, so it can be done even when logistic data is still present (all non pcs related info). So far no problem came up. Has anyone information on archiving integration transactions without archiving logistics?<br />
