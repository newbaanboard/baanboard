<br />
I have created an AFS program that was able to create an entry in the BaaN sessions E-Item(tiedm0110m000), E-Item revisions(tiedm1101m000) and E-Item relationship(tiedm1102m000). All modules were working properly in our local/main BaaN server. <br />
<br />
However when we tried using the application in another BaaN server we seemed to encounter a problem. When the E-Item revision(tiedm1101m000)  is getting inserted, the Drawing field(tiedm100.cdrw) is not getting updated although we are assigning values to it. All the rest of the fields are getting updated except for this one which is left as blank. :rolleyes:  Seems weird cause it works fine in the our main BaaN server and there was no change in the version of the software and both servers are of the same version(BaaN4c4).<br />
<br />
So here are my questions:<br />
Does it have to do anything with our SQL server setup?<br />
Is there any solutions for this case that is available for download?<br />
Is it possible that there is something wrong with my code?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would help.  :confused: Thanks in advance. Have a blessed day peeps and continue to rock on!!  :)</div></div><hr />

I have encountered each of them at least once.  I would make sure the session objects, porting set and the libraries(at least the stpapi ones) are all the same.  My first guess is the session.</div></div><hr />
