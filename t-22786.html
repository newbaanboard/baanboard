SITUATION DESCRIPTION: <br />
How is password aging is handled in webtop ?<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION: <br />
Password aging is not currently support in Webtop - any version; however, there are plans to try and include this functionality in a future release of the PortingSet - planned for 2005, though there is not a set date or PS version as of yet. <br />
<br />
3-GL programs are not supported in Webtop.</div></div><hr />

That's strange, can you duplicate the problem and set PWDEBUG=1 and send me the logfile? <br />

Additionally, I've found with the help of mpenno that if you setuid root the passage binary it will work correctly with NIS+ and probably PAM, etc..<br />

There is some more writing about my testing. I followed the instructions and substracted some days:<br />

Then I changed pwd but at the end (bottom) it said (again): &quot;You must change your password to log in&quot; and in file ../security/username '1' changed to '0' !!! I login again &gt;&gt; same as (1)<br />

<br />
If you're using NIS, LDAP or Shadow (i.e., you have a * or an x in your /etc/passwd file instead of an encrypted password - then passage needs to be setuid root to be able to do that comparison, otherwise it just ends up comparing * to * which always comes out the same...<br />
<br />
Are users logging in via BW or ba? if it's BW the .profile isn't sourced. If its ba, are you doing &quot;export PWDEBUG=1&quot; ? or just PWDEBUG=1?<br />
<br />
Looks like i've got something mesed up with the days too, hopefully we can get the PWDEBUG to work, that would help me. <br />

ah see there we go, if there is a &quot;!&quot; then it might need to be setuid root<br />
chown root passage<br />
chmod 4755 passage<br />
<br />
hopefully that works, it seems like NIS vs NIS+ vs LDAP, etc all require<br />
setuid root to access the encrypted password - and I use that to determine<br />
whether or not the user actually changed his password. <br />

I did as you told me (= ch.auth.). Now, what's new:<br />
I started from the beggining - new first logging/creating file. Then:<br />
- substract 1 day &gt;&gt; order to change pwd (as last time) - I changed it and that's it :-) now it works OK, just what troubles me is that day mess; by instructions this message has to appear after 85 days ?!?<br />
- substract 88 days &gt;&gt; &quot;You have -86 days remaining.......&quot;   When I changed pwd, this message had not appeared any more.<br />

The passage binary + the session that is coded above will lock users out of Baan. Not unix. if you want to use it for unix then you could script it into their .profiles or something similar.<br />

Have a look on the website http://www.mr-paradox.com/passage.html <br />
for more info on what it does vs. what it doesn't do. and for ideas on testing and scripting.<br />

Actually I made debugging of the script you provided with the pstat function and when running the session I don't get the right process number, therefore the kill command doesn't work in this situation, this what I meant locking not in the Unix level. The correct behaviour is to kill the bshell process from the first time user loggs in with expired pass and doesn't change it.right ?<br />
<br />
Note: shurely it would very good solution if it's encoded for the Unix level in passage script in later stage.<br />

<br />
Interesting, you might be the first Baan 5 person to try this (I've mostly worked with Baan 4) <br />
<br />
Maybe pstat is different in Baan 5 or maybe someone here can help with pstat - I'm really not much of a 4GL developer.  NP you out there?<br />

There was a bug in the blogin/badmin binaries that allowed one to log into BaaN and work even if the password is expired and its fixed in the latest porting sets as I have indicated.<br />
<br />
And I am not sure of Dave's logic how the password calculation is done.<br />

1. I have checked the badmin6.2 utility and it's not implemented in my system. I don't use password aging option using Baan binary badmin6.2.<br />

-1005: The aging for name is turned off.<br />
<br />
2. I haven't made any changes to Dave script with the pstat() function.<br />
<br />
Here's the problem I'm facing:<br />
1. I changed the digit 1 to 0 in the file $BSE/security/user and this way I forced the user password to expire according to Dave passage script usage.<br />
2. I added the session running the script Dave provided in this thread in the BMASK with boot option/Automatical add mask checked.<br />
3. When I log on the system with BSP user I get the shell windows opened with message to change the expired password. attached file.<br />
4. In the shell windows I type wrong old password by purpose to see if the bshell gets killed if user doesn't proceed with the password change, thus the shell windows closes and the bshell process goes on working normally.<br />
Process wasn't killed and user with expired password wasn't blocked and forced to change it.<br />
5. One thing I noticed, running the tccompassage session with the script again after the failure of killing the bshell process would open the shell windows again and I would by purpose try to type a wrong old password, this time the process is killed and the user is out of the Baan BW.<br />
6. I suspect the script can't determine process status when running with BMASK module when the user is logged in the system.<br />
<br />
Dave, What do you think ? have you encountered this behaviour?<br />

<br />
Since Baan's password aging seems to stop people from logging in there must be a function that one could call in the otccompassage program to exit Baan all together. <br />

If anyone finds it, let me know and I can do away with the Startup Session aspect of it (since the bmask is a much better option)<br />

The idea was good but I made some changes to the code you posted since it didn't work the pid should be converted to string in order to concatinate it with the &quot;kill&quot; command.<br />
I tested it with the code posted,  this time it work out properly and it kills the bshell process when session tccompasssage runs from BMASK.<br />
<br />
Posted new code for the script:<br />
<br />
long    ret<br />
        long    info(PSMAXSIZE)<br />
        string  progname(512)<br />
        long    procid<br />
        string  cmdstr(500)<br />
	<br />
<br />
function main()<br />
{<br />
        ret = shell(&quot;${BSE}/scripts/passage&quot;,SHELL_MWINDOW)<br />
        if ret &gt; 0 then<br />
                procid = -1<br />
                procid = pstat(procid, progname, info)<br />
		cmdstr=&quot;kill &quot; &amp; str$(bshell.pid())<br />
		while procid &gt; 0<br />
                                      procid = pstat(procid, progname, info)<br />
	 		shell(cmdstr,SHELL_MWINDOW)<br />
			kill(procid)<br />
		endwhile<br />
        endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
I will use this solution for the production invironment. I will check also the release of bug fixes for it.<br />
Thanks for your assistrance,<br />

 function main()<br />
{<br />
        ret = shell(&quot;${BSE}/scripts/passage&quot;,SHELL_MWINDOW)<br />
        if ret &gt; 0 then<br />

        endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
You shouldnt kill the current process pid, there might be other programs started after this tccompaassage 3-GL script.<br />
Here is part of my code -<br />
<br />
	for i = 1 to proc.counter<br />
		if processid.array(i) &lt;&gt; pid then<br />
			kill(processid.array(i))<br />
		endif<br />
	endfor<br />
free.mem(processid.array)<br />
kill(pid)</div></div><hr />

In neither of the scripts the kill seems to work or actually stop the bshell.</div></div><hr />
