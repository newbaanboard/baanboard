When the session is run by a user working with the menu browser,<br />
no problem, it is working perfect.<br />
But when a user with the dem browser runs the session (with exactly the same authorizations), the session hangs on the stpapi.find command and give the next message:<br />
Fatal error: object 0 in process 14 not found,<br />
proces 14: Fatal error: process terminated by display server.<br />
Can anybody help me please?</div></div><hr />

So maybe you just need updated DEM objects or tools objects.  <br />
<br />
Some questions - Can the DEM users call the sessions that are in the stpapi commands? Are they in the same company and VRC?  Same version of Baan(client also)? Have you tried recreating the DEM Desktop for the users? If yes to these questions then I do not have a clue as to what is causing the problem, but I will be interested in what the solution is. Sorry I am not much help.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

Yes, the users wich gets the error,<br />
can start the session without problems if it is present in the DEM browser. It is the session tpptc1509m000 Baan ERP, I believe version 5b.<br />
As soon we change the same user to menu browser, the session with the stpapi command runs perfect.<br />
But when the same user is working with the DEM browser, the session crahes again.<br />
<br />
This session wich is called by the api creates records in tpppc109,<br />
for the whole project structure.<br />
So, I don't have to program this by myself, if the api command works also with the DEM browser.<br />
<br />
If there is someone who knows more about the combination of api and DEM, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Now I know, that not all api commands are crahing in the DEM browser. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We faced similar problems while calling api calls from dem. We were calling DLL functions and in this DLL functions we were calling API calls.<br />
<br />
To Resolve this problem. We created 3GL Object of the DLL and instead of giving call to DLL directly we called this 3GL Object. We donot have such problems now. <br />
<br />
If you need more details please let me know.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jdhaan</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 22:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, if you can give me more detail, please!<br />
<br />
What do you mean by: create a 3GL object from the dll.<br />
<br />
We don't use a dll for the api calls.<br />
The stpapi commands are directly in the program script.<br />
Also the called session don't use dll's as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Thanks;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th January 2002, 23:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not have a clue about that possibly being the problem. Anyway I always use ttstpcreatdll to create a DLL script for the session that I will be calling.  None of my functions servers actually use the stpapi commands, they are in the DLL I create with ttstpcreatdll. I then just attach the dll to the session script.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jdhaan</div><div class="date">20th March 2002, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">As you can read in the last messages,  the problem was solved by an update of the standard program.<br />
<br />
No changes were made in the stpapi commands,<br />
the program works perfect,<br />
also when it is running from the DEM browser.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thomas_b</div><div class="date">26th July 2002, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note pertaining to using stpapi calls in sessions located on the DEM browser.  If you generate session authorizations via DEM, some users will get permissions errors when running the custom session, if they do not otherwise have access to the called sessions.<br />
<br />
One way around this is to make a manual entry in ttadv237 linking the script of the custom session to the called session.  Then when DEM generates, it will read this entry and provide the appropriate authorizations.</div></div><hr />
