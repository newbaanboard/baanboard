<br />
Would you be interested in linking an add-on Open Source e-Commerce application to your BAAN system?<br />
<br />
After going live with the first site last month ViFactorum in The Netherlands is now offering an Open Source e-Commerce application fully integrated with BAAN.<br />
The solution has been developed such that it works for both BAAN IV and BAAN V. <br />
We would like to work with a few BAAN customers who are ready for a new challenge.<br />
<br />
The advantages of Open Source is that the software is free and the applications are OS independent and in most case also database independent.<br />
<br />
Our e-Commerce solution is very robust and will provide customers lots of value doing business over the internet.<br />
Worldwide this product is already being used by more than 10000 customers and can be utilized for Business-to-Business (B2B) as well as Business-to-Customers (B2C).<br />
Important methods of payment and delivery have been incorporated in the standard product like credit card payments and payments by Pay Pal.<br />
It also supports multi-language and multi-currency.<br />
The application software is free and can be installed with Linux/PHP/MySQL/Apache. It will also run on Windows with an Oracle database for example.<br />
The performance of the e-Commerce application is very good because PHP is being used.<br />
<br />
Our integration for BAAN IV is immediately available. Within two months we will have our BAAN V integration ready.<br />
<br />
We guarantee the implementation time to be less than 2 weeks and the total costs (including the integration) to be less than EUR 20000 ( or USD 24000).<br />
<br />
If you are interested please mail us at info@vifactorum.com.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
