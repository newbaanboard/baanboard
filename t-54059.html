 <br />
At the moment, my job is to create a new table for six different baan installations. You know what that means:<br />
six times { login, import and create runtime, then logoff and login again, create tables }. Hey, think about the menu browser just had an option &quot;read data dictionary again&quot;, wouldn't that be cool for the admin? Even regular users might find this very useful if they have been assigned a new menu and so on.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Whenever you have to change some session parameters of a job, the official way is to print the session parameters, remove the session, start the sesssion and enter the new session parameters.<br />
 <br />
There are two situations when session parameters have to be chnaged: The data need to be adjusted, and the session has changed (added or removed form fields).<br />
 <br />
It would be nice if there were an easier way to adjust session parameters. I could imagine a separate session that could look e.g. like ttstpqbf, and I could imagine that the behaviour of &quot;Tools&quot; / &quot;Make Job&quot; would be enhanced. <br />
 <br />
But folks: I would like a standard way, not those workarounds!</div></div><hr />
