<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bizen99</div><div class="date">20th September 2002, 13:13</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to archieve the data of a 30 logistic companies which depend on a three finantial companies. The archieve of  the finantial companies is not a problem, we can create three historical companies for the three finantial companies so our question is how to archieve the logistic companies data.<br />
i.e. if we use the session tdinv7210m000 Archieve inventory transactions by item ( table tdinv700) for every logistic company and  there is just one historical company; how can we find the source of the data?.<br />
We have the same problem with sales and purchase orders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">25th September 2002, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">You'l need multiple archive companies. Make sure they are set up in a proper way (tccom000 table) to be able to use them.<br />
<br />
Technically it is possible to use one archive company for all 30 logistic companies, but make sure that all data is unique!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rdixit</div><div class="date">2nd October 2002, 14:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally, you should keep archiving companies setup (table sharing etc) similar to  your operational companies, rather replica. This will prevent many confusion during actual archiving process. This is our practical experience.<br />
<br />
Even Archive Scan services from support eye tools will be usefull. You can contact your center for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guzzisto</div><div class="date">2nd October 2002, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with you about the replica idea. I believe that's a MUST.<br />
<br />
I've seen a worked out report from archive scan but don't like it. It's more an summary of what might be done, but lacks important advises about data consistency, sequence and timing of archiving sessions and so on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a detail documentation of Archiving with information on sequence of event.  It is my working document based on my own experience doing archiving for my clients plus from the Baan standard documentation.  If you still want it, I can send it to you.</div></div><hr />
