<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marine</div><div class="date">21st January 2003, 23:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I have contacted Baan support about ways to visually make the GUI different for our TEST environment than our Production environment so our Core team doesn't accidentilly enter production data into the test system or test data into our production system.<br />
<br />
The only solution they have provided was to change the icons on the Menu Browser.  But once you are in a session, you can't tell which system you are on !!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Has anyone implemented an alternative solution on Win2000?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice you can provide!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">22nd January 2003, 00:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the following BW options -<br />
<br />
<br />
I found few more options -<br />
<br />
-set BAAN_WIN_TITLE=BaaN-ERP-Series would show the string BaaN-ERP-Series in the title of all Baan sessions.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, there are some predefined strings that can be used in the window title string. They are:<br />
<br />
%C Company Name <br />
%c Company Number<br />
%h Host Name<br />
%p Package Combination<br />
%S Session Name<br />
%s Session Code<br />
%u Userid<br />
<br />
<br />
Please refer to this thread for more options -<br />

<br />
there is a very simple way:<br />
<br />
change the graphics in $BSE/gif/gfd0002<br />
<br />
These are the images you see in the toolbar of your Bw gui and they are downloaded by the gui!<br />
<br />
We changed them to be red at a lot of clients. Finished.<br />
There is also a file called bwlogo.gif, which contains the logo during loading a session.<br />
<br />
You can change this too!<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanTech</div><div class="date">7th February 2003, 22:00</div></div><div class="posttext">When refreshing our test environments from Production we<br />
change the icons in the test boxes.  This works for letting<br />
users know what they're logged into.<br />
<br />
The problem comes when two users print the same report to the<br />
same printer.  One from PROD and the other from TEST.<br />
<br />
To ensure that no TEST output is filed away as LIVE output or used to plug in values for LIVE it is recommended to change the<br />
company name as well via ttaad1100m000.  This eliminates<br />
at least some of the confusion at the printers.<br />
<br />
This also allows Menu users to see the specific company name (applicable to the test instance) when running Change Company (ttdsk2003m000).<br />

Anyone know why ?? do I have to shut Baan down to clear the cache/shared mem or anything ??</div></div><hr />
