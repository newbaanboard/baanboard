<br />
I have developed a software solution for a very special production process. <br />
<br />
At the moment the data transfer from LN to software is processed by a QR Code containing all needed information. This means if data changed in LN after the QR code was printed, i have worng values inside the QR Code.<br />
<br />
To eleminate this issue i want to connect my software to LN and get live data with SQL. Is there any API (maybe ION) that can result a triggered request into my application? I don't want to use Oracle Database Driver.<br />
<br />
LN 10.3 and Oracle DB, application in C++ / Qt5.<br />
<br />
Many thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your 3rd party app can host and consume a webservice, LN has the capability of calling that webservice using SOAP methods. Else, you can use BDE's too. Other option could be near real time solution where your application is calling LN DB Stored Procedure in some interval to check the latest values from that specific table you require. Multiple ways, you need to decide which one to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. webservice is not implemented.<br />
2. what is BDE?<br />
3. actions on database are not allowed.<br />
<br />
I just need a simple query result from LN. Look at this code:<br />
<br />
<br />
void pushButtonClicked()<br />
{<br />
  ...<br />
   SQLresult result = **run query** &quot;select * from ln_table where ...&quot;<br />
  ...<br />
}<br />
<br />
So this action **run query** I want to implement. Is this possible with LN?</div></div><hr />
