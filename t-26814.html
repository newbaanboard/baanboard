<br />
this is my solution for the general problem of selecting local files. Please follow the instrauction in the README file. <br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
Although located on the server, the BaanFileSelector.exe is of course run on the client and not on the server! It will be copied automatically to the Windows Temp directory if not already there and then started. To find out the location of the Temp directory on your PC you can type the following in your dos box: <br />
cd %TEMP%<br />
<br />
The program generates a text file in this temp directory which will then be copied back to the server for interrogation <br />
<br />
You can do a stand alone test of the exe by copying it to your PC and running it. The usual windows file selector dialog should come up. If you select a file and exit a file BaanFileSelector.txt should be generated in the same directory.</div></div><hr />

nice idea!<br />
We do it the same way for some years now. Only difference is that the program is located on our server and we transfer and execute it to/on client from the Baan Session. No requirement to install on client and it also works with WebTop.<br />
<br />
Next Step (if i will find the time) is to make the FileSelector Program platform independent (java ?) so it can also be used from a Linux-Client.<br />

<br />
I think I caused some misunderstanding in my description: My solution works exactly like yours. The BaanFeleSelector.exe is on the sever and will be copied to the client if not already there. <br />
<br />
As for platform independence: This is not going to be easy as long as there is nothing comparable to bwdll for Linux.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a suggestion for a serious practical improvement. Right now I cannot determine the file types to be looked for. It would be very handy if I can for instance send an optional variable along in the Baan function, with the file type(s) which the file browser dialog should display, and maybe another parameter indicating whether the user is allowed to choose different file types in the dialog, just like regular Windows functionality...<br />
<br />
For instance, for a data import program I want users to be able to see only txt-files..<br />
<br />
Would be great if you added this feature to your program..<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
En</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for your very good suggestion. Here a new version with filter functionality that you requested. Please note that the old exe must be removed from client Temp folder (see README.txt file enclosed). <br />
<br />
There is now an extra paramter for filter string in the form of:<br />
description1|filter1|description2|filter2|...<br />
<br />
example: &quot;All files| *.*|pdf files |*.pdf&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">9th August 2006, 10:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for this updated version. It works fine. Just had to do 2 little changes to the script to get it working: you probably forgot to include<br />
	#pragma used dll ottdllbw<br />
<br />
and I gave the path in function server2client instead of the non-declared variable you used..<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />
