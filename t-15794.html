<br />
I try to use api.mode in a DLL, but the compiler delivers an &quot;api.mode not declared&quot; message. I used api.mode before in another session without Problems?<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />

<br />
api.mode variable is inherrently a Sesssion thing and should be used exclusively in UI-Script and hence is it also predefined by Baan for such scripts. <br />
<br />
A library - and for that matter a function - should have no knowledge of the UI-stuff. It should generally be concidered a bad programming practice when any of the following is used in a function or a library: display(), choice.again(), choice, update.status or as in this case api.mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 14:02</div></div><div class="posttext">So Baan doesn't care about its own rules. <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
./tiB50U_c_stnd/ptihra/phradll12100:	if api.mode then|#ADC1.0.n<br />
<br />
There are more examples like this in &quot;stnd&quot;.<br />
<br />
Btw.: I just declared &quot;api.mode&quot; an it seems to work.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vahdani</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 14:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Well nobody (including a Baan-Developers) is perfect! But I hope you agree with the point I'm trying to make: When you use api.mode hidden somewhere deep inside a DLL your code will become harder to maintain and understand. <br />
<br />
I don't know what Baan-Developers are told to do or not to do. From my personal expereince I have learned to separate as far as possible concerns such as UI, Business-Logic, etc. It is not alway easy (or possible!) but it always helps in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 14:57</div></div><div class="posttext">You may be right. Also I think in may case, I have to do some additional things in a DLL if calling sessions are started via AFS, it's the only (payable)way I know to find out, if this is the case.<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that from the UI until to my specific session is a queue from at least 4 DLL calls with some more functions calls; I see no way to pass the informatoin to the place, wehre I need it, except &quot;api.mode&quot;.<br />
<br />
Payable proposals are welcome  :D</div></div><hr />
