Have you then created and tested the ODBC connector defined for that database?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">31st March 2006, 17:19</div></div><div class="posttext">You should have several CD's that are included in your Oracle 10g pack. One of those should be titled, Oracle Database 10g Client for Microsoft Windows. When you insert it, it should automatically come up and present you with the installation options. If you are not familiar with Oracle network installation and configuration, then you should invest some time and read up on it. I don't know that I could explain it all, and I do not know how your database is set up. Do you have a DBA or someone who set up your database? If so, I would start with them.<br />
