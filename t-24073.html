<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">minizao</div><div class="date">18th May 2005, 11:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm having a problem in session : tdpur4120m000. when i make a receipt trought AFS.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
First receipt for order :<br />
tdpur045.diqu = 1000<br />
tdpur045.dqua = 200<br />
tdpur045.bqua = 800<br />
<br />
tdpur041.bqua = 800<br />
<br />
If i try in same order and same receipt number to increment the tdpur045.dqua to 300, it will happen this : <br />
<br />
Second receipt for order :<br />
tdpur045.diqu = 1000<br />
tdpur045.dqua = 300<br />
tdpur045.bqua = 700<br />
<br />
tdpur041.bqua = 1500  =&gt; It has been incremented 700 to 800... This value should be 700...<br />
<br />
If i do this in the session it works fine... With AFS i have this error...  :( <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea of what is happening?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Nuno</div></div><hr />

I do not know what errors we received when we tried what you suggested, but when I did the function server they had me always create a new receipt.  So if like you mentioned they only received 200 first, then the second would be a new receipt for 100.  One reason what you mentioned does not work for us because of TipQA product we use for Quality control, but even without this we saw problems when modifying a completed receipt.<br />
<br />
On a side note we disable the back order qty so the user can not enter it - Can't you just set the correct quantity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">minizao</div><div class="date">18th May 2005, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to modify the qty received, because when some trucks arrive, the products are not all together... so we need to modify the quantity arrived.<br />
If i do only one movement, all works fine.<br />
<br />
If you modify your line order directly in session tdpur4120m000 using BAAN Client... it does everything well.<br />
And you can see in session tdpur4510m000 all quantity data well filled.<br />
<br />
My problem is when do it with Function Servers. In session (tdpur4510m000) that works with table 41 the field dqua is not correct(it was incremented, not updated), in session tdpur4120m000 it's all correct (i can update any fields).<br />
<br />
&quot;Back order qty&quot; is the quantity of the order line created?<br />
I only know the names in portuguese...  :o <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th May 2005, 18:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Same situation here.  Multiple deliveries for one PO could be in multiple boxes.  So what our receipt people do is pull one box scan the info, create the first receipt.  Then whenever they run into the second box, they scan that info and it creates a new receipt.<br />
<br />
The back order qty is suppose to be total line order qty - the total qty received.  We found our system did just like yours - even when doing it by hand.  When we changed the qty received the back order qty then became old back order qty plus (new total qty on order minus the new total qty delivered).  In your case the bqua would equal 800 + (1000-300) which equals the 1500.  This happened when doing it manually and I never really tested the api code.  I just made it always do a new receipt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don't want to create another receipt...<br />
I have to keep temporarly all the receipts for one line, then send the total to BAAN.<br />
This way it will work fine.<br />
