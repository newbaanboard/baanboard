<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">E.Toniolo</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I have created a Visual Basic program that, through OLE automation calls a my functions library in Baan.<br />
<br />
This program works correctly into my development PC, but, from the customer, this program will be used on of the PC connects through terminal server to the main server.<br />
<br />
If the program is used from a single customer all works fine, but, if the program comes at the same time used from two users (two terminal server sessions on the same main server) the password in the BECS configuration is deleted.<br />
<br />
At this point my VB program show the BECS dialog to request the userid and the password to logon on baan system.<br />
<br />
Why the user password is deleted?<br />
<br />
I use the Baan IV c4 and Baan Cable 8.1 - SP12, and the BECS is the bw_072_I386.exe.<br />
<br />
Where I can find the technical documentation about OLE automation in Baan?<br />
<br />
PS<br />
Obviously I have opened a case on the Baan support site .... but  the reply is:<br />
Baan OLE automation is a not supported feature that you can use at your own. Instead, you should use OpenWorld.   <br />
:rolleyes: <br />
Great solution for the smallest  problem!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th February 2004, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know of any technical documentation and the support was discussed in this thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12844&amp;highlight=OLE+and+Support).  I do not know anything about terminal servers, but I have had trouble running two OLE scripts at the same time on my PC before.  Never tried to figure it out, but the lack of support from Baan is the reason I never rolled it out into production.<br />

in effect I have read all related messages  about OLE automation present in Baan Board included your thread, but my hope is hard to die! :( .<br />
<br />
I have a very small problem, an external program writed in Visual Basic need to get a new ID number from Baan, To do this I have writed this Baan library function:<br />
<br />
function extern domain tdlra.leno tijob.dll0002.getIDNumber()<br />
{<br />
   domain tdlra.leno    leno     | First free ID Number<br />
<br />
   dbgMessage (&quot;tijob.dll0002.getIDNumber&quot;)<br />
<br />
   if tdlra.dll0023.get.idno.number(leno) = false then<br />
      leno = 0<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
   dbgMessage (&quot; --&gt; Found leno %d&quot;, leno)<br />
<br />
   return (leno)<br />
}<br />
<br />
The VB program is a third parts product that use my VB library to connected with Baan through OLE.<br />
 <br />
If the OLE automation isn't a valid solution and Open world is a very expensive solution for this small problem, what is the best solution to do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
    <br />

The problem is that I do not know enough about terminal servers to understand how to solve your problem.  I would think that as each user logged into the terminal server they would be sharing the apps.  I do not know how a terminal server separates the apps (memory, disk, etc.) and if they access a shared resource you could have problems.  I do not have a solution or even an idea where to point you to look.  Sorry I am not any help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">6th February 2004, 23:30</div></div><div class="posttext">are you calling the configuration file directly ie.<br />
<br />
baan4.application.&quot;the name of the configuration file&quot;<br />
<br />
if you call baan4.application it will use the default configuration file.  if it is using the default then both users are using the same clsid  in the hkey_classes_root portion of the registry which maybe causing the problem<br />
<br />
<br />
could try this, create a configuration file for each user call it the same as the username and then have the vb program connect to baan4.application.%username%</div></div><hr />
