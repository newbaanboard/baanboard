Standard session  allows archive production orders only for standard items(anonymous).<br />

The session &quot;Archive Projects&quot; (tipcs2260m000) archives most project related data (production orders, integration transations etc.). So, that's the session you'll have to run.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">20th February 2003, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I've doing the same thing with projects/prod orders and receiving an error message that a reference exists for aprod order 'TO tisfc001  FROM tisfc010' (production order table tisfc001 - production planning by order table tisfc010).  I've run some other sessions that clear up orders, process delivered purchase orders and purchase statistics and still receive this error.   Does anyone have any other ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">20th February 2003, 23:23</div></div><div class="posttext">When a production order is closed, the production planning in tisfc010 should not exist anymore (at least in 4c). The archive process only selects closed production orders. Is it possible that production orders were closed through General Table Maintenance? If that's the case, you might have to do some more GTM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">18th March 2003, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We have archived a range of projects successfully.  However, there are a handful of projects that did not archive in our range.   These projects had subcontracting purchase orders on the production order.  So I ran the process delivered with delete order data to yes.  I also ran update purchase statistics.  Tried to archive the individual project and still receive a message about a subcontracting order present.  Is there something that I'm missing?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">18th March 2003, 19:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Have a look at the subcontracting order. The following are the possible reasons, that might prevent a fully processed and paid subcontracting order from being deleted:<br />
<br />
- an inbound advice for the order still has to be generated and/or processed<br />
<br />
- a transport order is linked to the purchase order<br />
<br />
If the project is closed, the subcontracting order must have been fully processed and paid, but since it appears (from your earlier messages) as if there has been some GTM involved, I would also check, whether the subcontracting order has been properly paid and matched to the invoice. <br />
<br />
The way to do that: in GTM, table tdpur045, form 2, check the field &quot;Delivery Status&quot;. That should be on &quot;All Approved&quot;. If it is not, I would check with your Finance department and make sure that the invoice has been paid. If it has been paid, then the invoice hasn't been matched to the order. If that doesn't bother your Finance people, you can change the field to &quot;All approved&quot; in GTM and delete the order with &quot;Process Delivered Purchase Orders&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">18th March 2003, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked the inbound data of one p.o. and there was nothing to inbound.  There doesn't look like a transport order is linked either.<br />
<br />
I then checked the tdpur045 table for  this p.o. There are 5 lines.  Each line has two sequences 0 and 1.  The delivery status for sequence 0 is 'Free'.  The status for seq. 1 is 'All Approved'.   <br />
<br />
In the meantime, I will check with finance to make sure this p.o. is invoiced and matched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">18th March 2003, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds ok. Only the lines with sequence no. 1 have to be on &quot;all approved&quot;. <br />
<br />
I forgot one possible cause: are there open backorders for the lines? If the field &quot;Back Order&quot; in tdpur041, form 3 shows a quantity &lt;&gt; 0,  then that would prevent the order from getting deleted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">18th March 2003, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked with finance and they double checked for invoice matching, backorders were zero.  Everything checked out to be ok for the process delivered session.  There's nothing else they know of to check at least from finance's side. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">18th March 2003, 22:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume the invoice date and the receipt date are before the date you selected in session &quot;Process delivered Purchase Orders&quot; and the company number in tdpur045, form 4, field &quot;Company&quot; is the same as the company in which you're running the session? <br />
<br />
The fastest way, to find out what the problem is, is to run the session in debugger mode (works only if you've got the program scripts) and step through the program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">18th March 2003, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope that's the problem...me.. <br />
<br />
I only processed up to 1999 and these p.o.s were invoiced in 2000.  I processed the 2000 and re-ran the archive session and they successfully archived.  <br />
<br />
Thanks so much for your help Karin!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timb25</div><div class="date">1st April 2003, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to archive one project.  The first attempt, I set 'archive general data' to NO.  I received an error message 'reference does not exist' between the tables tipcs022 and tipcs021 in the archvive company for the project number I'm archiving.  <br />
<br />
The second attempt, I did the same thing but set 'archive general data' to YES.  It processed for a while and them errored out with a reference does not exist between tables tiitm001 and tiitm100 in the archive company for an item.  I re-ran it again and received the same error, this time with a different item.  <br />

Has anyone seen something like this before?<br />

I've seen these problems if there is corrupt data in the original company.</div></div><hr />

Customized Bill of Material.  This project had a couple lines with blank manufactured items tied to it.  This was a problem once we went live. <br />

Anyways, I removed these lines from the custom bom and then rearchived this project.  It was successful.<br />
