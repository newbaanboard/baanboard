We are Baan5b.<br />
<br />
Currently we have two different sites, which has their own servers and run independently. Each of this sites handles all logistica and fianance on their own.<br />
<br />
Now, My cleint wants  to change this to a multi site environment. But wants work on two different servers.<br />
<br />
Their Idea is :<br />
Site A should handle everything(Logistics and finance) realted to site A and sales Order/ Purhcase orders of site B(They wanted do receipts/issues from site B, But wants to maintain Purcahse Orders/Sales Orders from Site A). But they want to do everything related to finance to be done from site A.<br />
<br />
This is possible with the Mutli site functionlity of Baan, if everything is done on the same server..<br />
But they want use different server for each site...<br />
If site A has to do any fianncial transaction, all the sales order/Puchase order information should be available on the server of Site A. How can we esnre this?<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Rama Rao</div></div><hr />
