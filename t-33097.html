<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bamnsour</div><div class="date">22nd March 2007, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">NAZDAQ has lots of experience in coloring Baan screens for the purpose of differentiating between companies (Production and test for example) or companies with the same number but run on different servers. Our PC based Baan Color Changer was launched in 2002 and is now used in many sites around the world.<br />
<br />
We are glad to announce a server version of Baan Color. This new version is installed once at the Baan/LN server and can be used by everybody connected to this server. It does not color all of the Baan Form, but rather adds a bar as you can see in the attached printscreen. Some users prefer the bar option over coloring the whole screen.<br />
<br />
The product is already running successfully on few Baan and LN servers and is marketed with very attractive pricing. You may want to visit www.nazdaq-it.com to get a fully operational demo version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does your solution also work with Worktop?<br />
This would be very useful as well.</div></div><hr />
