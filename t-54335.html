I have a question, after 8 years of use of BaanIVc4 we are going to run out soon of sales orders. <br />
We will have to delete old sales orders, <br />
But we want to save the old orders, there is a discussion here what is preferred to use archiving, which would require us to upgrade porting set and its been a log time since any corrections where installed on the system. <br />
<br />
OR copy the entire company into a different company / server and then (after testing) delete all orders <br />
<br />
OR Copy all tables in to an Oracle server and access all tables using Crystal reports Or Cognos or Oracle reporting tools <br />
<br />
And after we are confident (and test the delete process) that there are no problem remove all the old sales orders, we will be glad to do that <br />
<br />
<br />
So what would you recommend? 	<br />
By the way upgrading to Baan 5 or 6 is not an option</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best way ofcourse is archiving which helps in reducing the integration transactions of fianance. We faced the same problem couple of years ago, we started archiving and also enlarged the sales order number from 6 to 7.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our company did not update the porting set since 2001 ?</div></div><hr />

Back then there wasn't an option to archive sales orders. You could only delete them, so to get round it I did an exchange scheme that dumped all the completed sales orders from the system and another scheme to loaded them to the archive company and then deleted them from the live company. I also printed all the the sales orders to PDF documents ( did it in blocks of a thousand).</div></div><hr />
