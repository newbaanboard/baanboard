We are just going live and have a LOT of reports to write.  We also use Big Projects and PCS together and no Baan reports summarize both of these area at the same time</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you may know TriNET is an official Crystal partner and I will check for you whether such a repository exists.<br />
I assume you are talking about Crystal Reporting and not Crystal Analysis.<br />
What is the Crystal version you are using?<br />
<br />
Hope all is well.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
 We are using CRW 8.5 with CE 8.0.  We are also using the Baan 2.0 Native Drivers for reports which do not require high performance and direct SQL 2000 Access for higher performance reporting.<br />
I spoke to a gentleman at BWU from Invensys who had done this exact task.  I am trying to track down his business card.<br />
<br />
I can call you if you'd like to speak further and we can post our findings to this thread<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I mailed your request to our in-house Crystal experts to find out what they know on a Crystal Repository.<br />
Hopefully I will have an answer for you shortly.<br />
