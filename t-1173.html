How good is HP/UX MirrorDisk striping?<br />
Has anybody measured it in real world? Maybe compared to some hardware striping...and  to JBOD's and so on...<br />
I'm just thinking of increasing Baan/Oracle performance.<br />
Maybe $BSE/tmp and Oracle areas.<br />

<br />
Striping is not really the right term in connection with LVM mirroring.<br />
<br />
Striping is normally done on block level (lets say 2k or something). Mirroring with LVM is done on extent level (most of the time 4 MB). They can not be combined!<br />
<br />
What can be done is the so called &quot;distributed allocation&quot; with Mirroring. Here the LVM will just allocate the extents dirtributed over the physical disks.<br />
<br />
Yo could call it striping with a stripe size of 4 MB. This obviously is not nearly as good as striping with a much smaller stripesize.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can not give you concreate measurements. But we use for all our installations distributed allocation with mirroring for the database files! I would not place the redo- or archive logs in the same stripeset as the database files or use the mechanism at all.<br />
Also I would not expect Baan istself or $BSE/tmp to gain much from distributed allocation.<br />
<br />
Even without measurements, I have a very good feeling about using distributed allocation. Some HP folks even say, that a FC10 with distributed allocation is as fast or even faster than the raid products (VA7100/VA7400) of HP and might even be able to compete with an XP!<br />
<br />
Try it!<br />

<br />
I have not done any performance tests though.  It would be faster than not stripping and putting the same contents on the volumes.</div></div><hr />
