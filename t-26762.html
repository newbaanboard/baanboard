<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vnusbaum</div><div class="date">29th March 2006, 20:56</div></div><div class="posttext">We are an ERP 5.0c company that has used Optio for all external reports.  Our reports can be quite complicated.  We take the Standard Baan output and manipulate and based upon what we find there, we go back to Baan via sql and pull out extra data.  We also ftp some files occasionally and insert into the document.<br />
<br />
However, we upgraded to the new gui version of Optio and now have lost our current flexibility in the programmed documents.  We are trying to see what all our alternatives might be for purchasing something new.  Does anyone currently do anything close to this with your Baan install?<br />
<br />
We are considering Streamserve, and ecQ and would like to know if there are any other options out there.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
