It used to work earlier . Currently we are on SP12 + some later tools objects. <br />
<br />
Our other AFS codes with Baan standard programs are working fine. The customized session tijwx9185m000 (in the code attached) is a simple single occ maintain session without  any validations etc.<br />
<br />
We did debug the code tijwx9185m000 and saw that all statements in before program are executed . Immediately after the last statement of before program, it stops with fatal error index out of dims . And the process (for tijwx9185m000) gets aborted.<br />
<br />
As the code in AFS is customized one  ,  we have already done a worked around for this with normal code without AFS.<br />
<br />
However curious to understand why the error comes. Anything changed in the later codes . Anything we need to change. Has anybody experienced.<br />
<br />
We have asked Baan support abt this and they are to give feedback on this.<br />

I do not see anything that should stop it from working.<br />

  Can you please check all the domains of the fields are correctly formated and mapped? and Message string is ok to handle the message returned? It is some thing to do value not fitting into it's domain.</div></div><hr />

Author J Veum Creation Date: 09 Jul 2003 Alternate ID:<br />
Solution No: 163178 Last Modified: 09 Jul 2003 Status: Published<br />
Product: ttB40c4 Sub Product: Session: various<br />
Package: tt Version: B40 Release: c4<br />
Solution Type:<br />
Symptom information<br />
stpapi.handle.subproc<br />
AFS: inserting sales order lines via AFS no longer works with SP12<br />
Solution description<br />
VERSION(S):<br />
Baan IVc4 SP 12<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
Using Application Function Server (AFS) to insert Sales Order Lines (or could be to perform some other action)<br />
<br />
ATTACHMENTS:<br />
n/a<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The custom script is inserting sales order lines and dictates a specific Position number for the line. With SP12, the position number cannot be dictated, rather it takes the next default position number when inserting the record. This still can be done manually, however.<br />
<br />
In general, the custom AFS script no longer works as desired.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Some changes and improvements have been made to some standard scripts to resolve some issues related to the standard iBaan Domain Pack BOIs. This involved the introduction of the &quot;boi.call&quot; variable. This variable will be used going forward in conjunction with the &quot;api.mode&quot; variable to handle both AFS and BOI calls. This new variable will be supported going forward, and is a solution to the problem, not a workaround.<br />
<br />
So to solve this problem, it is necessary to add this variable to the custom AFS script:<br />
Add to your script:<br />
extern domain tcmcs.str132 boi.call<br />
<br />
and inside the function:<br />
<br />
boi.call = &quot;tdboidll0005&quot;<br />
<br />
Without this variable, certain portions of the code were being skipped, which caused the problem. Adding the variable corrects that, and will bring even further improvements to the AFS process as well.<br />

<br />
We did check the domains. There are no arrays used anywhere.<br />
Further I had seen the solution of sales order . But that does not relate to my problem. Ours is a simple main table form type 2 customized session which was working earlier even in SP12 . It's only we installed some tools solution that this code did not work.<br />
<br />
So tell me what can be changed in the code to make it work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">5th March 2004, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried commenting out the code in the before.program just to see if it would get any farther?<br />
<br />
Mark</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">5th March 2004, 16:32</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact I had written something intentionally in before program of called session just to test it. It did execute all statements in before.program. After the last statement of before program and before init.form first statement , it gives index out of dims and the called program aborts . So for all my api calls in calling session I get the same error message Index out  of dims. <br />
<br />
Currently I have worked around by direct update in the table. But if anybody can give some cue, I'll test the same.</div></div><hr />
