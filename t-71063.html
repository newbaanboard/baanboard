<br />
We have created Custom BOD using Infor Business Studio and tested from ERP LN after registration on LN with Trace File and getting Expected xml output. Now when we trying to register it on ION using file template by loading xml file received in Trace file but we are getting error as Invoke &quot;GenerateXSD&quot; failed. We are able to register same with ION 12.0 using file template but right now we are doing it on 11.1. <br />
<br />
Other option is to load XSD and Xml files into ION Registry. I have exported XSD files from ION 12.0 and trying to load thos on ION 11.1 but it not accepting these files. <br />
<br />
May I know how to generate XSD files from Business Studio or by any other means which will be readable from ION11.1 Registry folder. <br />
<br />
Any help appreciated. <br />
<br />

There you need to register in Custom Documents...<br />
<br />
You need to make a Folder with xsd File as well as an xml File where you mention which all verbs are applicable for your BOD.Like Sync,Process and Acknowledge. Then you need to zip the Folder and then import the Zipped File. The name of the Zipped File must be the same as your BOD name. For example, if your BOD Name is MySalesOrder. The Name of the file is MySalesOrder.zip file.</div></div><hr />
