<br />
did you check the Crystal Enterprise solution for Baan log file?<br />

Actually the server that runs crystal is in another location but the guy there says he can't see anything wrong (but I'll ask again).  I was hoping that someone else had seen this error before from the Baan side.<br />

<br />
The C:\Program Files\Seagate Software\Crystal Enterprise Solution for Baan\IBR\ss_log directory on the Crystal/Win2k server is empty.<br />
<br />
Where is the CES log file that you're suggesting to check?<br />
<br />
(I'm the Crystal guy working with Ev on this Crystal &lt;-&gt; Baan integration project)</div></div><hr />

\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Seagate Software\Baan IRT\Logging Level<br />
<br />
Set this value to 1, otherwise no logging files will be save in the ss_log dir.</div></div><hr />

That logging option works and I get logs in that directory now. However, they aren't more verbose then the error message in Baan. The error message was about 'corrupted username or password' or so.<br />
<br />
Have you been able to get CES2.0 to work with CE8.5? I've had major headaches with it so far, because CES2.0 is not compatible with CE8.5 but I wasn't told that when the products were sold to us. We downgraded to CE8.0 but that has its own batch of nightmares, although IBR is now sort of working.<br />
<br />
Wim</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NikeNiek</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 14:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I was able to get CES2.0 work with CE8.5.<br />
<br />
If your password for BaanViewer or BaanAdmin is corrupt, that will be a problem, because it cannot be changed. W've had a lot of problems with that. Crystal provides the tool BnIRTConfig.exe, but that don't work. The problem is that the password is stored in the registry, which don't match with the password in the database. <br />
<br />
Another option would be to use the utility ResetPassword.exe. This resets the passwords for BaanViewer and BaanAdmin to 'password'. However, that utility may also give problems.<br />
<br />
You can also uninstall CES2.0, remove all Baan users in the Management Console(Baan, BaanViewer, BaanAdmin, maybe others). Delete registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Seagate Software\Baan IRT\Administrative Options. Reinstall CES2.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, interesting.<br />
<br />
Did you install any hotfixes/patches/upgrades for either CE8.5 or CES?<br />
<br />
I tried installing CE8.5/CES2.0 several times, but it never ever created the Baan accounts in CE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't find ResetPassword.exe... where does one find that?<br />
<br />
Now BnIRTEntWorker.exe crashes when printing via Crystal Device in Baan. The log file still gives this message:<br />
<br />
----- ERROR -----<br />
Error occured in worker process:<br />
Worker failed to access or create users or user groups! Please make sure your administrative user is setup properly.<br />
----------------- <br />
<br />
any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Wim</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NikeNiek</div><div class="date">16th November 2002, 18:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I attached the ResetPassword tool.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I used CE8.0 with CES2.0, which works well.<br />
I've heard that CE8.5 does only work with CES2.5, which isn't available yet.<br />
<br />
It seems that on your CE system the BaanAdmin user isn't created.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">18th November 2002, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for clarifying what versions you are using.<br />
<br />
I created the BaanAdmin user manually (with the appropriate groups and rights) but now the worker process just dies a miserable death.<br />
<br />
Back to 8.0 I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bk.tvse</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We had the same problem of corrupted username and password and we tried  changing the password thru BnIRTConfig.exe and worked fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">19th November 2002, 15:55</div></div><div class="posttext">With CE 8.0 or CE 8.5?<br />
<br />
Using that tool was the least of the things I tried. The tool has no problem changing the passwords in the Registry, but can't access the users in Enterprise even after creating them manually...<br />
<br />
What we are now doing, is sticking with CE 8.5. Instead of using the IBR via the XML print device, you can add a button to a session's menu to bring up Crystal Enterprise with a previously designed report that uses the Baan driver. The ability to easily convert an existing Baan report to Crystal is lost, but we'll still be able to easily hook in our own reports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanMart</div><div class="date">6th December 2002, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Wim,<br />
<br />
I use CE 8.0 with SK 2.0 / Baan V.<br />
<br />
The use of BnIRTConfig.exe works fine but it does'nt solve my problem with &quot;new&quot; CE users.<br />
<br />
I found out that Baan V / SK is able to creat &quot;new&quot; users in CE if the BaanAdmin is part of the CE-Administrator group.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esanmar</div><div class="date">15th September 2011, 18:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Wim,<br />
<br />
I have the same problem.<br />
I have installed Crystal Enterprise 8.5, Crystal Reports 8.5, and Integrated Reporting for Baan in windows 2000 and Baan IVc4 sp 10.<br />
I can use Crystal Reports samples with the data of my Oracle database.<br />
<br />
But when I try to create the template in the ttaad3130m000 shows this error:<br />
<br />
3260 worker failed to connect to Crystal Info/Enterprise! You user, password and/or regsitry setting may be corrupted.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
