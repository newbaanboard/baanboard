<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryMoore</div><div class="date">24th July 2003, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using function server between Maintain Receipts and Maintain Approvals.<br />
<br />
In Maintain Receipts, I select a P.O. Line and click a new button which runs the Maintain Approvals session in api mode.  It works perfectly.<br />
<br />
However, when I try another P.O. Line and click this new button, as soon as my stpapi.put.field is executed for the second time, I get this:<br />
<br />
Error base_extern baanapi_input_data not found in process xxx<br />
Can not continue in tdpur4320m000 in DLL: ottstpapihand (get.company)<br />
<br />
If I come out of Maintain Receipts and go back in, select that second P.O. Line and hit the button again, the problem disappears.  However, when I select another P.O. Line (without coming out), I get the error again.<br />
<br />
Anyone please help?</div></div><hr />

I am not sure if it is the porting set, tools release or stpapi release.  I am also not sure if there is a fix for this. I currently see this type error only for large amounts of transactions. This varies depending on the session that is called.  This is in my 4c3 environment and I have not had a chance to test it in 4c4.  See the attached error.<br />
<br />
One thing you might want to check in your function server is that you end the maintain approvals session.  I typically start a session, then process a record, then close a session.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vahdani</div><div class="date">24th July 2003, 23:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Close the maintain approvals session after each processing with an stpapi.end() call. This forces a restart of the session the next time you press the button. This trick has always worked for me when everything else failed.   :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryMoore</div><div class="date">25th July 2003, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason for the problem is that at some stage in the development, I couldn't get my Maintain Receipts (tdpur4320) session to close down Maintain Approvals (tdpur4121) via stpapi.  I was able to close down Maintain Approvals (ILC) (tdilc4123), but that left tdpur4121 in limbo.  Even an &quot;stpapi.end.session (&quot;tdpur4121m000&quot;)&quot; did nothing (it should have jumped to the &quot;choice.end.program&quot; section of the script, but it didn't.<br />
<br />
To resolve this, I coded an &quot;execute(end.program)&quot; in the &quot;after.update.db.commit&quot; section, and this seemed to resolve the problem.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, IT DID NOT FULLY RESOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I SHOULD ALWAYS USE STPAPI.END.SESSION IN THE CALLING SCRIPT!<br />
<br />
The &quot;stpapi.end.session&quot; does more than jump to the &quot;choice.end.program&quot; section of the selected session.  However, that's all you see in debug.  But, behind the scenes, it must close down the stpapi process, thus allowing you to do another one. <br />
<br />
My &quot;solution&quot; of adding the &quot;execute end.program)&quot; in the CALLED session rather than adding &quot;stpapi.end.session&quot; to the CALLING session was wrong, as it didn't shut down api mode.</div></div><hr />
