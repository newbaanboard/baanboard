	<br />
I have designed an excel application integrated with BaaN using OLE. I am trying to deploy it to some of users and I am running into this problem.<br />
<br />
All of our users use BW client version 061. As some of you might already know that the BaaN's OLE functions only work with BW client version 044 or older. So, I thought I will install BW 044 client of their computers and it should be ok. But, what's happening now is that, if they have already logged into baan and they try to use this excel grid, it blows with an errors. It's happening because I think, the excel tries to use BW 061 and retrieve data from baan. When I changed the regedit setup for baan automation to point to BW 044 and ran the excel application, it asks you to login again using the BW 044 client. This causes one user holding two licenses. <br />
<br />
Users here still want the BW 061 client to login to baan since they want use the feature of printing baan reports to word or excel (which is not supported by BW 044). So, is there way I can make the excel application to use the client BW 044 when it is interacting with BaaN and at the same time users don't have to login again if they have already logged into BaaN?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help.<br />

Thanks,<br />

I am able to have both an OLE connection open and a logon to the company.  I have a separate BWC file for my OLE automation piece that has my password in it so I do not have to logon again.  I do not know of a method to just use one logon for both - so yes I do use two licenses.  So I am not sure if this helps.<br />
<br />
Even with the .065 client if I use the same config for both OLE and user logon I get errors.  That is why I have to BWC files.  Note I added edited my post to add this.<br />
