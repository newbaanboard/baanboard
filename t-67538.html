Not sure if that is possible. But, there can be workaround to this. You can put a drop down list on the calling session which will show the available reports. Based on the selected option, call that specific report in your AFS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th March 2015, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">That is exactly what I do in some cases bhushan.  I attach the reports to the AFS session.  Then I use either the standard rprt_open to open the report, then I close it.  Spool.report and spool.device are set and I can use them in the stpapi.call.<br />
<br />
Or you can use brp.open and spool.open to do the same type thing.  In one case I think I had two reports to run out of one session.  I used report groups in that base - so brp.open twice to get the two report names and spool.open to get the device.  One thing to remember is to always close them after the open.</div></div><hr />
