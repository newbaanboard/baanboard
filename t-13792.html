I want to avoid creating a customised library to return the description of a table field, but was wondering if there is a standard Baan library that will do this for me, from an OLE call.<br />
<br />
IE: I have a VB app, that uses OLE to return some records.. One of the fields returned, holds a table field (eg: tcedi501.trfd)... Now I want the description of this table field, using tt.field.desc, but since I am using OLE calls, I need to find a function call in a standard library that does this...<br />
<br />
I have tried using bic_info on some standard Baan tools objects (such as odll_sqlquery and a few others), but can't find one, that returns the field description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 23:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just right a select statement in VB for the table that the field description is on?  Not sure which tools table that is, but this sounds like it would work.<br />

As a work around, I am using a select on ttadv422 to get the ttadv422.clab field (if applicable) and then checking ttadv140 to get the label description, based on the field (if ttadv422.clab is blank) or based on the value of ttadv422.clab...<br />
<br />
Was hoping to avoid doing this lookup, if there was a standard function that I could call...</div></div><hr />

I think maybe the last post by NPR maybe what you are looking for. I know there are some DLL routines to return information on fields I just can not remember what or where.<br />

It did kind of help, but I don't know the VRC level, so would need to determine the package combination of the current user, then search the VRC's in ttadv112, then for each VRC check ttadv422 to see if exists.. <br />
<br />
Since I am not to worried, if the label has changed, I am finding the first VRC in ttadv422 where the table field exists, to get the clab setting. This function call will mean, I still need to do this (to get the VRC to pass to the function), but can call the function, instead of checking ttadv140...<br />
<br />
Was more hoping, for a function call that allowed you to pass only the table field (eg: tt.field.desc), without having to determine any VRC details..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd December 2003, 15:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep - checked and there it was.  I have a two scripts I run with bic_info6.1 for ottstp and ottdll.  For some reason all of the bic_infos for ottstp were commented out.  Sigh.  Fixed it, ran it and then found the DLL Hitesh mentioned.<br />
