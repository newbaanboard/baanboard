<br />
<br />
For the current business environment, it seems the performance issue still no improve.<br />
<br />
At the hardware side, more and more power hardware used. Still no big improve.<br />
<br />
ltittle result I got asfollowing<br />
The baan does not support.batch update. For instance, if you want to update many records, in baan, you can select them and update them one by one. It is a good example like the mapping in finance module.<br />
<br />
The other is the code quality  is awful. For example, in one ui or dll, there had been used select statement, in the loop, it called other dll,  it is very strange that in the dll, it used the select statement again. Even sometimes, they does not use variables to store the value instead to use select statement record by record. A good example is generate the HU during the receipt process.<br />
<br />
The above is what I found as so far.<br />
Any one have comments on it?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Early one with our 4c4 system baan support would provide us with debug objects - we worked with them on several occasions to improve the code. In one or 2 cases they actually used what we provided them.  If you own source you can improve it yourself and see if they are interested.  The problem becomes if they do not incorporate the changes then future service packs will over write it.  I think in one case we bought the code since they did not fix their code.</div></div><hr />

One thing is not everybody have the source code, so it is not easy to find tbe problem or bugs. And the other is even found the problem, they are not interested to improve it.<br />
