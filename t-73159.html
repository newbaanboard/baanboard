<br />
I'm running session tipcs5201m000 Generate Planned PRP Orders with system performance boosters set up. <br />
<br />
When I execute the process from session, all shells are opened and the process concludes correctly, for this I setup my user and password on the BW and check box as default in BW Configuration.<br />
<br />
I added the session tipcs5201m000 on a Job, and when I started with session ttaad5203m000 - Activate Jobs, the session also runs with multi shells on parallel and concludes correctly.<br />
<br />
But actually I want to run the job via Unix with rc.statjob, but when its executed indicates runtime error, and the /baan/bse/log/log.comdll0200 file indicates:<br />
root710;tipcs5201m000();client:Unable to start server(s) 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 after timeout of 120 seconds.<br />
root710;tipcs5201m000();ppmt123ib:Unable to start server(s) 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 after timeout of 120 seconds.<br />
<br />
Is there something else to be configured in order to run parallel shells from UNIX. :confused:<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Most of our batch job is below.  We had something like that happen to us after a servicepack.  We worked with infor to get it resolved.  Been too long for me to remember the solution. And we no longer run it since we converted to Oracle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Altrev</div><div class="date">13th May 2020, 02:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark, Just one question.<br />
<br />
If I run on Unix the rc.startjob, how is related the windows BW to the Unix session, how its supposed to open the session or how is the setup?<br />
<br />
Or in Unix I have to define something to indicate BW user passsword to be able to open multiple shells?<br />
<br />
I'm confused  <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th May 2020, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure I get the questions - but in UNIX the way I recall it was the job is run in the background.  There is no client to connect to - so things like client2server, etc. do not work.  It is just running the session as described in the job.<br />
<br />
The job I posted using runs our weekly GRP run with tipgc5201m00b - the only thing we ever used boosters on that I recall.  So looking at the job there is nothing special to be done for multiple shells.  I do recommend logging a case with infor on this - we had something like this 3 or 4 years ago.  If I recall correctly they would time out also, but I am not sure.  Infor worked with us until we had it working.</div></div><hr />
