<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">9th June 2009, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been using the Solution Kit for Baan from Crystal Reports / Business Objects. We are also aware that support for this product is being discontinued after Crystal Reports XI R2. That means that Crystal Reports 2008 (a.k.a. XI R3) and forward will not have the Baan solution kit built for it. Infor has made the following announcement regarding their ODBC driver for Baan. My question is, have any of you out there looked into this? We are pursuing this information, but would appreciate any other thoughts, opinions, or experience with this ODBC driver for Baan offering from Infor.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Currently, we have several options to offer Infor ERP LN, Baan IV and Baan ERP 5 users of Crystal Reports who would like to continue using an Infor supported reporting solution. Those options are:<br />

 Available solutions<br />
 <br />
Infor Baan IV, Baan 5.X<br />
 1)  Move to Crystal Reports 2008* and use the ODBC driver for Baan as <br />
      provided by Infor. This solution is not a standard offering, will not be<br />
      supported and will require Infor Professional Services to implement; or<br />
<br />
 2)  Move to Infor Reporting in combination with Infor MyDay.<br />

<br />
If it's different (like native driver) , it certainly requires some consulting and probably some licensing .<br />
<br />
From the threads available on this board , think it's not much of a difference except dates and enum . But some crystal experienced one can be more authentic on this .</div></div><hr />

 We are already using our underlying database (Oracle) as a substitute for the Baan Solution Kit. I have developed functions to deal with enums and text that we use in a view against the table. I am hoping that Infor has something different than that. I don't want to have to develop another security model in Oracle that I already had using the Baan Solution Kit which used Baan security.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsharpe</div><div class="date">22nd April 2010, 18:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend that you check out Oracle's PL/SQL programming language.  You can use it to bypass the Baan driver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">22nd April 2010, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't aware that you could do that. Could you elaborate on how that works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsharpe</div><div class="date">22nd April 2010, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You must have rights to install Oracle programming code.  The &quot;CREATE OR REPLACE&quot; commands tell Oracle you have code to install.  Once the code is in the database, it is accessible to Crystal reports (stored procedure).  Instead of telling Crystal to look for Baan tables (assuming you have the Baan driver), you check a box telling it to look for stored procedures instead.<br />
<br />
Here is some code I use for a report:<br />
<br />
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE HCI_SVR001_CMP200_PACKAGE<br />
AS<br />
  TYPE HCI_SVR001_CMP200_TYPE IS REF CURSOR;<br />
END HCI_SVR001_CMP200_PACKAGE;<br />
/<br />
<br />
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE HCI_SVR001_CMP200_PROCEDURE (<br />
  HCI_SVR001_CMP200_CURSOR IN OUT HCI_SVR001_CMP200_PACKAGE.HCI_SVR001_CMP200_TYPE,<br />
  startdate_in IN DATE)<br />
AS<br />
  startdate DATE := TRUNC(startdate_in);<br />
<br />
  BEGIN<br />
    OPEN HCI_SVR001_CMP200_CURSOR FOR<br />
      select distinct<br />
             tdssc017.T$ides &quot;Advice Note&quot;, tdssc017.T$cuno &quot;Customer Number&quot;,<br />
             tdssc017.T$cdel &quot;Delivery Address&quot;, tdssc017.T$cdat &quot;Truck Out Date&quot;,<br />
             tdssc017.T$ctim &quot;Truck Out Time&quot;, tdssc017.T$vhid &quot;Trailer Number&quot;,<br />
             tdssc017.T$rout &quot;Window Time&quot;, tdinv700.T$logn &quot;Login ID&quot;<br />
        from baan.ttdssc017200 tdssc017,<br />
             baan.ttdinv700200 tdinv700<br />
       where tdssc017.T$orno = tdinv700.T$orno and<br />
             TRUNC(tdssc017.T$cdat) = startdate and<br />
             tdssc017.T$ckor = 2 and<br />
             tdinv700.T$koor = 3<br />
    order by tdssc017.T$ides;<br />
END HCI_SVR001_CMP200_PROCEDURE;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gguymer</div><div class="date">22nd April 2010, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, but what about using views? How do you replicate ENUM's, NULL Dates, and Text fields?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsharpe</div><div class="date">22nd April 2010, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">When you go with Oracle stored procedures instead of using the Baan driver, you lose access to Baan's data dictionary and all the niceties that go with it (like descriptions for fields and such).  That's the downside.  The upside is that you are not limited in your ability to retrieve data and the PL/SQL code can run lightning fast.  A report of mine that took 40 minutes to run using the Baan driver ended up taking a few seconds using PL/SQL.<br />
<br />
Instead of ENUMs, you have to go with the ordinal values.  For example, if you are used to seeing &quot;purchased&quot; or &quot;manufactured&quot; as values for a field, it's now an integer value of 1 or 2 in Oracle.<br />
<br />
A NULL date (or NOT NULL DATE) can be tested with something like this:<br />
<br />
SELECT …<br />
   FROM …<br />
  WHERE TO_CHAR(T$EXDT, 'MM/DD/YY') = '00/00/00';<br />
<br />
Text fields can be represented by PL/SQL's VARCHAR data type, which holds variable length strings.<br />
<br />
I hope I'm answering your questions correctly, because I'm not really into Baan all that much.  I was hired, in part, to do Crystal reporting.  If I need to know what Oracle tables or fields I need to check to create a report, I ask one of the two Baan gurus I sit across from at my job.  I understand Baan primarily from the data it leaves behind in Oracle.  All I need to do is hook Crystal into Oracle and I'm good to go. :)</div></div><hr />
