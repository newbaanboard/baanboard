<br />
We have a standard setup for ION for approvals. We recently started experiencing this issue, which is - when the user approves/rejects anything in ION, the submit user get a notification of approval (or rejection) but there is no change in LN side. The workflow status remains Pending for Approval.<br />
<br />
I checked the activities for these objects and they are sending proper data to WF_Result parameter too. Is there something, which I am missing to check here?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Ishan</div></div><hr />

Please have a look in IONDesk on wether there are error BODs related to the AcknowledgeWorkflow BOD.<br />
<br />
One other question on this, did the workflow really end in ION? Please have a look in Active Workflow screen.</div></div><hr />
