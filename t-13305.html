But it looks as so, that this software doesn't run stable on w2k. It runs fine under NT4 with a SP not higher than 3. <br />
But to satisfy our network security requirements, today we need at least NT4 with SP6. <br />
<br />
<br />
Does anybody have ideas / experience to make this Software runing stable?<br />
<br />
Btw.: I searched the web, but &quot;www.jetform.com&quot; seems no longer to exist?</div></div><hr />

JetForm does not exist anymore. It was aquired by Adobe.<br />
<br />
I have some contacts that still work with it. Let me know what do you mean by not running stable so we can try to help.<br />

<br />
the thing is, that we have running jfserver.exe on a w2k system. On that system printing stucks, let's say two or three times a day. In that case we have to stop and restart jfserver.exe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you elaborate more on the problem?<br />
What is your printing configuration, and how is your jfserver configuration?  Is there any code involved?  Can you cut and paste?<br />
<br />
Please send me more info and the symptoms, and if I can't help you then I can hook you up with someone at Adobe.<br />
<br />

<br />
don't know much about jfserver. I am this one who stop and start  jfserver if printout stucks. <br />
The only thing what a know at the moment:<br />
 jfserver runs together with a programm called &quot;copy manager&quot; which is, maybe selfmade (unitl know I thougth both programmes are a set from jetform.com. <br />
If printing stucks, we always close and start both programms. I have no glue, where how to configure jfserver.<br />
<br />
So maybe, for the first, it is better if I ask only one question:<br />
Sould jfserver.exe (Vers. 4.2.206) run without any probs on w2k?<br />
If that is the case, we should focus the &quot;copy manager&quot;. !</div></div><hr />

<br />
JFServer for Windows should be stable.  You should not experience printing problems.<br />
The version that you, however, is pretty old.  That doesn't mean that it should give you problems.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you check task.ini and the log file to see what's causing your problems.<br />
<br />

<br />
I tried already, to find something in the event logger. But I found nothing which seems to come from jferver. Task.ini is one more possibility, thank you.</div></div><hr />
