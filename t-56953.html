<br />
I was trying to write AFS For PO Invoice matching.<br />
<br />
I stated with tfgld1101m000 then opened tfacp1110s000 (maintain Purchase Invoice). till here its fine.<br />
<br />
It Works all fine if we give Amount full as full PO Receipt amount. It will open tfacp1230s000 and Link receipt, approval receipt will come YES. click on MATCH ... things will go fine.<br />
<br />
Now Problem come when i don't give full Po amount in tfacp1110s000. It will open tfacp1230s000 and Link receipt, approval receipt will come NO. click on MATCH ... it will open tfacp1131s000  then  say complete Match and close.<br />
<br />
It will open tfacp1130s000 session.<br />
Now here i have click on &quot;Approve&quot; in tfacp1130s000 for futher approval where i can give ledger account and dimension. <br />
<br />
Approve button is 2nd FORM COMMAND in BaaN C4.<br />
<br />
I want to know how to click on &quot;Approve&quot; and continue further....<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
Ranjan</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the Approve button is a form command , you will have to use<br />
<br />
stpapi.form.command() , below is the syntax<br />
<br />
void stpapi.form.command(string session, long command.type, string<br />
command.prog, ref string err.mesg)<br />
<br />
If the Approve button is of session type then you will have to handle the subprocess .<br />
<br />
