I was encountering a performance issue when opening a session.<br />
I took CGP of that particular session in order to find out the root cause.<br />
<br />
In that, I found one Query taking most of the time in which Index Hint was being used since secondary index were used.<br />
<br />
I wonder on SQL server that query works fine with hint reducing the time.<br />
<br />
Thus I wanted to have clearer view on does Hint effective depends on SQL Server, DB2 etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Waiting for your all valuable suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Hint Clause is a code processed by baan bshell so it is independent of the backend database. Weather your database is Oracle, SQL Server or DB2 the hint clause will work the same.<br />
It is basically to tweak the evaluation plan generated by the query processor, to execute the query. <br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Thanks,<br />
