<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vamcphee</div><div class="date">10th May 2002, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">We are considering using Business Objects tools such as Web Intelligence Reporter as a report writer, query, BI tool for use with Baan. How easy is it to do cross company reports for the<br />
end user or for the developer? One client reference apparently<br />
is doing multiple query/reports for each company and then combining them, which appears to be somewhat clumsy to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">invensys user</div><div class="date">11th May 2002, 00:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Business objects is certainly not the right tool for queries over different companies etc. You should consider Croko Reporter for 3 reasons:<br />
<br />
1) It is using Crystal designer for designing the report<br />
2) Croko retrieves faster data out of the database then any other report writing tools<br />
3) Croko can read in the datadictionary, something which BO is not capable of doing<br />
4) Croko Reporter is at least 5 times cheaper then BO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leonvdp</div><div class="date">1st August 2002, 00:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd agree that BO is not the way to go. Crystal has changed licensing over the years so I'd be concerned about potential licensing issues going down the Croko route... <br />
<br />
Why not go with Crystal? It's also a solution that Baan endoreses. From what I've seen customers are pretty happy with it...</div></div><hr />
