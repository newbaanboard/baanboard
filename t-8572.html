Here is my code:<br />

Dim BaanObj as Object<br />
<br />
Sub BaanConnect()<br />
     If BaanObj Is Nothing Then<br />
          BaanObj = Server.CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application&quot;)<br />

<br />
Wild guess here but are you accessing the webpage from the local intranet/machine or from the Internet?<br />
You might wan't to check .NET security in Administrative Tools -&gt; Microsoft .NET Framework Configuration. The default security setting for Internet is supposed to be very strict.<br />
<br />
Also is that message from a BWmessage window or from the IIS server?<br />
<br />
If you can be more specific maybe I can have other ideas. I never used the OLE object from ASP.NET but I use it from C# .NET applications regularly. I also have some experience with ASP.NET but with C# also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CathyB</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your reply.  I am accessing the web page from the local intranet/machine.  The local Intranet security in the .NET security is set to full trust.  The error message that I am receiving is an IIS error (See the attached text).<br />
<br />
The error message mentions the local user {machinename}\ASPNET.  I verified that the {machinename}\ASPNET user has full control to the local machine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just did a quick test here at the office. <br />
I got the same security warning.<br />
<br />
After reading some notes I had about machine.config I changed the parameter userName attribute of the processModel in that file to SYSTEM (needs a reboot),  This is not the best solution. :<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;processModel<br />
            enable=&quot;true&quot;<br />
            timeout=&quot;Infinite&quot;<br />
            idleTimeout=&quot;Infinite&quot;<br />
            shutdownTimeout=&quot;0:00:05&quot; <br />
            requestLimit=&quot;Infinite&quot; <br />
            requestQueueLimit=&quot;5000&quot; <br />
            restartQueueLimit=&quot;10&quot;<br />
            memoryLimit=&quot;60&quot; <br />
            webGarden=&quot;false&quot;<br />
            cpuMask=&quot;0xffffffff&quot;<br />
            userName=&quot;SYSTEM&quot; -  change from machine<br />
            password=&quot;AutoGenerate&quot;<br />
            logLevel=&quot;Errors&quot;<br />
            clientConnectedCheck=&quot;0:00:05&quot;<br />
            comAuthenticationLevel=&quot;Connect&quot;<br />
            comImpersonationLevel=&quot;Impersonate&quot;<br />
            responseRestartDeadlockInterval=&quot;00:09:00&quot;<br />
            responseDeadlockInterval=&quot;00:03:00&quot; <br />
            maxWorkerThreads=&quot;25&quot;<br />
            maxIoThreads=&quot;25&quot;<br />
        /&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
 Be carefull with this change. This will give the ASPNET process potencially full control of the system. I recommend you to use this just for testing until you get a better solution. <br />
<br />
This way it will not give a warning at least over here. But I noticed a similar problem in this approach to that of running the object through a system service. <br />
It will hang in the creation phase :rolleyes: . Probably, and this is just my guess, because the service (this one for sure) and the asp.net process will not allow the option window to be created, so it fails. <br />
My approach to this problem is to create a .NET console application just like it was a function sending parameters as the program arguments and getting the results from a XML file or string.<br />
<br />
If you really want to continue exploring the same approach I will recommend this link to find a better solution to the security problem (Sorry, I didn't have time to explore):<br />
ASP.NET Security (http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/sampchap/6501.asp) <br />
<br />
Hope this helps,</div></div><hr />
