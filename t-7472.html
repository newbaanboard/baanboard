I was wondering if anyone has had experience archiving text using Exchange?  I am finding that some of our customized archiving sessions are not archiving all records.  Thus, I have decided to try and archive the records that have been missed through Exchange.  Essentially, I am creating an export scheme using a date &quot;range&quot; and then importing it with no conditions.  However, I have noticed that many records have not been processed.  When I check these records, I have found they have not been inserted due to the fact that they contain text numbers.  <br />
<br />
Since the text number has a mandatory text reference if present, I decided to use Exchange to export and import the entire TTXT001 table.  However, when I look at the records after import, I have found many that did not exist before, and others that were not imported for some reason.  Since the reference is only on the TTTXT001 table, I was just going to import this table.  <br />
<br />
I am not an Exchange expert, but from what I have heard is that text can be a bit tricky.  If I want to use the same text numbers from our production company, how must I setup the export and import exchange scheme?  Is this the recommended procedure to get the purchase order history and sales order history records if they have text?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

In your field relation, you can specify you want to export/import the actual text instead of the number.  This may solve your problem.</div></div><hr />
