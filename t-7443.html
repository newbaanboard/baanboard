<br />
When I look at the log.bshell, it tells me that reference does not exist tdinv700,cprj --&gt;&gt;tipcs020.cprg [138567].<br />
<br />
When I look at my data, here is what I see.<br />
<br />
Live Company = 500<br />
tipcs020.cprg for 138567 does exist.<br />
<br />
Archive Company #510 used 18 months back for 1998 &amp; 1999 <br />
tipcs020.cprg for 138567 does exist.<br />
<br />
Archive Company #520 which I am now archiving 2000 trans.<br />
tipcs020.cprg for 138567 does NOT exist.<br />
<br />
It appears that in table tdinv700, that I have inventory transactions for project 138567 dated January 2000 and because the project does not exist in company 520, the program aborted with error #606.<br />
<br />
Has anyone encountered this problem?  What was the solution?<br />
I have already opened a case with BaaN and they are advising that I re-execute and send them log.bshell message.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. - Joy Conner</div></div><hr />

I understand that the project# never has been used in your live company?<br />
Did somebody changed the data in the table tdinv700 by General Table Maintenance, and used the wrong number?<br />

I archived 1998 and 1999 transactions into company 510 in spring of 2001.  No one has had write capabilities to this company.  The process left behind inventory transactions in my live company which are associated with the project but the date of the transactions were during 2000.<br />
<br />
Now I am archiving year 2000 transactions.  The project is referenced in the inventory transactions but the system cannot see the project because it was archived the previous year.<br />

Reading your comment, i supose it has to do with the sequence and variables in the form of sessions for archiving.<br />
Do you use tppdm7820m000: archive and delete?<br />
If so, I think you should use only archive.<br />
Use delete if you are sure that there are no references anymore to that project.<br />
Or use archive and delete and use the finish date of closed projects to take in account. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">tipcs020 is copied to the archive company not deleted (unless they have changed the archive project session) but even if you run this session again it probably will not copy the records you want they will have a status of archived in the live company. If it was me I would dump the tipcs020 table from the 510 company and import to 520.<br />
<br />
I have had a few problem like this before because Baans archive strategy (or lack of one) means there are just individual archive sessions that do not take into account how the other archive sessions are used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use BaanIVc4and0, maybe that's the difference.<br />
Our session tppdm7820m000 has three run types:<br />
1. Archive Only<br />
2. Archive and Delete<br />
3. Retrieve from Archive<br />
That's why I mentioned it.<br />
With option 2: tppdm7810m000 (delete projects) starts automaticly after archiving.<br />
Concerning to dump the table and import it, he should take into account 'new' projects which are not in the old archive companies.<br />
And also the refer-tables, i think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 17:40</div></div><div class="posttext">if the table is  dumped  from 510 then it should only have the old projects that were archived not the new ones in the live company.<br />
This is not a an ideal solution as really if you archive a project then all transaction that reference it should be archived to the same company. <br />
Personally I think it is better to use only one archive company rather than split them into periods.  Unless there is a good reason like reused order numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm inclined to agree with your first posting on this subject.  The archive projects session, tipcs2260m000, prompts you for a range of project numbers.  The Archive Inventory Transactions, tdinv7210m000, prompts you for a date which is defined as &quot;Archive Inv. Transactions up to&quot;.<br />
<br />
When archiving 1998 and 1999, the project was archived but it left behind inventory transactions which referenced the project.  The date on the inventory transactions are January 2000.<br />
<br />
It appears that there is an inconsistancy in how the system handles the various archive sessions.<br />
<br />
So, how can I archive the inventory transactions that reference a project that was archived in a previous year?<br />

<br />
We have the same problem.  We use projects and archived a good deal of them into our first archive company.  However, we (or should I say the last archive team) never archived the TDINV700 records using the tdinv7210m000 session.  Now, when I go to run this session, it bombs out for the vary same reason.  I logged an issue with Baan Support regarding the problem and they had no answers except to copy the TIPCS020 records from our first archive company and put them into the second archive company we are now using.  I decided to skip this piece of the archiving for now, but need to revisit it soon.<br />
<br />
By the way, depending on the version of Baan you are using you also may want to make sure you have the latest solution for the tdinv7210m000 session.  If you installed one of the previous solutions for this session, you may find the session actually deletes your data and does not actually archive it.  They have come out with a solution to fix this problem earlier this year.<br />

Since the project still exists in the operating company, you may want to archive the project into 520 again.  This is just to bring the project into the archive company.  :)</div></div><hr />
