I read in another post that back in 2008, there were plans to add the integration to a feature pack for LN.  We're hoping to hear they've had enough time to integrate with IV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">12th March 2010, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this is also being build on BaanIV. It is not yet GA but if you are interested please contact your Account Manager. I could bring you also in contact with the product manager for this integration.<br />

Our account manager have told me that no exist a &quot;native&quot; integration between EAM and BaanERP. That integration only exist between LN and EAM using SOA.<br />
<br />
Our account manager also told me that there is SOA available for BaanIV... funny, isn´t right? Why in the heck I will need to install SOA on my BaanIV environment if I can´t integrate it with other systems, EAM by example?<br />
<br />

<br />
On BaanIV there is the SOA based integration to MyDay and to EAM. The last one is not yet GA but it is possible to sign up for a LA phase. That's probably the reason that your account manager is not yet aware of the availability of this.<br />
<br />
If you are interested please let me know. I can bring you in contact with the product manager for this integration. <br />

Call felipe_saavedra_olvera by skype. We use that. You can publish all Baan an LN functions with Web services. It's very good.</div></div><hr />
