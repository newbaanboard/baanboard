if api-mode then .....<br />
But how can you know which program caused the api-call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">29th September 2003, 18:22</div></div><div class="posttext">You can always use the predefined variable prog.name$, which stores the main calling session, api mode or not.  Does that do the trick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweetie</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">no the var prog.name$ gives the programname of the program you called in the api</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">O I see that now humph.<br />
Well, what they seem to be doing in the standard programs is a structure like:<br />
<br />
<br />
if api.mode and boi.call = &quot;ccboixxxxx&quot; then<br />
    do boi stuff<br />
endif<br />
<br />
<br />
And boi.call is declared in the called process.  So, I guess they are setting boi.call externally and exporting it in the calling processes.<br />
You can see some of this in the latest versions of hours accounting tihra1101 if you have the source.<br />
<br />
Edited:  just saw Hitesh's post.  Prob true, but I guess they are doing this because when you use the boi's through openworld, etc, what would pstat show?  Would it be different for each boi?  Or maybe show the openworld process as the parent all the time...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sweetie</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">i will try both solutions and keep you informed thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 17:21</div></div><div class="posttext">pstat function simply queries the bshell all it's sub-processes and gives the program code for the pid input argument . In api.mode with parent pre-defined variable one should be able to get the program name of the parent .<br />
<br />
Baan standard program sets the prog.name$ for all 4GL/3GL programs. So as u stated, prog.name$ should also work if u import the same like <br />
<br />
domain tcmcs.st15 prnt.prog<br />
<br />
if api.mode then<br />
       import(&quot;prog.name$&quot;,prnt.prog)<br />
       .......<br />
endif</div></div><hr />

and then de import in the called program is working<br />
thx<br />
the pstat <br />
i will try it later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">3rd October 2003, 21:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Not entirely relavent, but I just had a BAAN case resolved a few days ago where I could not get Maintain Receipts to do it's thing through AFS and the solution was to set 'bot.call' to 'tdboidll0011.Create' because they (Baan) had used the if structure mentioned above to wrap some of the necessary logic.  Without that variable set, my AFS session was just hanging.<br />
<br />
This variable use is undocumented and unless you have the source, you just have to log a call and have someone tell you what that variable needs to be.<br />
