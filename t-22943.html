<br />
I have developped a set of macros for this editor that will do wonderful things. It should do all that the scite editor does, as well as auto indent and reformat declaritives. (Makes the declaration section very nice)<br />
<br />
It has some rules for formatting case while, if, repeat, select... endselect etc syntaxes, and knows how to do keyword matching, including the jumping over of nested expressions (while matching if`s jumps over nested if's).<br />
<br />
I recommend the editor, and if you have it, or want it, I will gladly at no cost, send you the baan stuff (including an install guide).<br />
<br />
I am not associated in any way, except as a customer with the purveyors of multi-edit editor. But it is, for me, a wonderful tool. I would not want to live without it. <br />
<br />
you may email me via the board or directly at  lsatenstein@yahoo.com</div></div><hr />

I remember seeing your post similar to this earlier. The Code &amp; Utilities forum is for postings of code or utilities :-).<br />
<br />
Please attach macros to this thread or I will move it to some other forum.</div></div><hr />

There is  a document file in the download that explains more or less (with print screens) what the editor can do.</div></div><hr />
