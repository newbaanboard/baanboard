<br />
Has anyone ever got error message &quot;Session not available&quot;?<br />
<br />
Here's some return string from baan.functioncall:<br />
<br />
&quot;stpapi.save(&quot;tdilc1121s000&quot;,1,&quot;Session not available&quot;)&quot;<br />
<br />
and some more<br />
<br />
&quot;stpapi.save(&quot;tdpur4121m000&quot;,&quot;Session not available&quot;)&quot;<br />
<br />
It seems to only happen for some sessions, because other seems to work fine.<br />
<br />
I only got these errors for one day and now everything is running fine but i can't figure out what was wrong..<br />
<br />
I'm using Baan 4c4 on informix and HPUX<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance,<br />
Ardi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th May 2007, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not had anything just like this.  I have had sessions that run in debug mode, but do not run when compiled normally.  And yes I did get errors like &quot;session not available&quot; or it would just hang.  In some of these sessions I put in suspend statements to give the background sessions time to finish or activate.<br />
<br />
Another thing that has happened in the past was processing too many records through the inventory adjustment function server.  It used to be we could only process 500 or so records before getting an error.  I can not remember what the error was. Again this went away in one of the SP updates.</div></div><hr />
