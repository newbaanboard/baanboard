	I have a weird problem with the spool.device variable and a session I am trying to automate through AFS. <br />
<br />
	I am trying to automate the close PCS projects session (tipcs2250m000). When you run this session, it kicks off another session (tipcs3250s000) for calculating cost price. Both sessions have a report and I am setting the report for the session tipcs2250m000 with set.report call and also assigned a device to the spool.device variable. When I run the session tipcs2250m000 manually, it calls the session tipcs3250s000 and it uses the device that is in the spool.device variable to print its report. But when I call the session tipcs2250m000 through AFS, the spool.device that I have setup is used in tipcs2250m000 but it gets re-set when it gets to session tipcs3250s000 and thus this session get terminated. <br />
<br />
	I have tried to use the handle.subprocess to add the session tipcs3250s000 and set the report of that session to a device, but it does not work.<br />
<br />
	Any ideas on how I can get this resolved?<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help,<br />

PS: I have checked some of posts related to spool.device but was unable to find what I was looking for.</div></div><hr />

	Thanks for the response. I have the source for tipcs3250m000 and ended up modifying it to keep the spool.device if its called from AFS. Its working now.<br />
