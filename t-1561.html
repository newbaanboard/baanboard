<br />
We have been  running the session tfgld6205m000 (Archive/Purge Finance <br />
Transaction) since Friday. <br />
<br />
In this regard, the effect is the slow performance of our server. We wanted to know what will be the effect if we abort the session Archive/Purge Finance Transaction? Will this cause problems?<br />
<br />
Please help..<br />

<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
we are running Baan IVc4 on Oracle 8.0 and noticed no problems when archiving sessions were aborted.<br />
At the very beginning of archiving we had several problems such as 'snapshot too old' and 'rollback segment too small' were the session suddenly stucks. Restarting was always no problem. But our main objective during archiving is to get rid of the data. We actually do not need them for further investigations. So if a record is missing nobody would care.<br />

<br />
I agree with Martin that it's usually no problem. If you kill the archiving session, the not-committed part of the data-moval will be rolled-back in Oracle (or any other DB). If you restart, the data-moval will run for the remaining data within the selection.<br />
<br />
If you run the Baan database (tbase) you might run into serious problems as there's no decent roll-back mechanism. In that case restarting might cause errors like &quot;duplicate rows&quot; in the archiving company.<br />
<br />
PS. Martin, why don't you delete instead of archive if nobody cares anymore ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
want I wanted to say is that the archived data are not 'mission critical' for us. Sometimes it's useful to take a look in the archive just to understand the present situation of inventory transactions for instance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">4th April 2002, 02:04</div></div><div class="posttext">It sometimes happens that you get a duplicate record error when you restart an archiving session after a process was interrupted. <br />
<br />
That can also happen if you have a database with a good rollback mechanism. Archiving sessions in general first copy the data from the original company to the archive company, then delete the data out of the original company. If you abort a session between copy and delete, data might not get correctly removed and you might have the same records in both companies. Most archive sessions simply skip those duplicate records when they are restarted, but some dont. That depends on the session and the solutions you have installed. Im not quite sure, but I believe for session tfgld6205m000, that was a problem, which has been solved with a solution at some point in the past. I would make sure, that you have the latest patch installed before you restart the session.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, the worst case could be, that you would have to identify the duplicate records and would have to remove them from the archive company before you can restart the session. That happened a few times to me. I have a session that compares tables in the archive company with those in the original company and prints out the records which are present in both. <br />
<br />
Ive never seen data disapear because a session was aborted, I just had to much sometimes</div></div><hr />
