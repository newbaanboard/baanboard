I am facing a problem catching a error message while exceuting  session tfacp1140s000 using stpapi.get.mess.code in my AFS program.<br />
<br />
The problem is that when there  error is encountered while processing tfacp1140 script ,a error message is generated ,  and then a call to choice.abort.program is made thus ending the session tfacp1140s000 automatically.<br />
<br />
Now when the session is run thru my AFs program , my <br />
stpapi.get.mess.code () returns empty string , instead of the error code tfacps0107 which it shud rightly do , since it was the error message that was generated before the session was aborted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions , why is the AFs not able to catch the error message.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also i used the stpapi.get.mess.code(&quot;tfacp1140s000&quot; , error.mess1) after <br />
 stpapi.continue.process(&quot;tfacp1140s000&quot; , error.mess2)<br />
<br />
i noticed that error.mess2 contains Process is Gone<br />
<br />
Is this the reason why the message is lost ?<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get around this problem<br />

I missed this post, but yes I do think that is why you are not getting the error message.  Once the session is killed I believe you get the &quot;Process is gone&quot; message.  I had a problem like this in one function server, but not quite as bad.  The only solution I found was to test for the error condition before calling the Baan session. So I trapped the error and handled it myself.  I am not sure if this will work for you or not.<br />
<br />
The only other way to get around the problem would require the source code to eliminate the choice.abort.program, and if I recall correctly you do not have the source.<br />

As u rightly said , I get the Process is gone message .<br />
<br />
I dont have access to the source code , but i can ask the client's baan support partner to make the changes  .<br />
<br />
in fact  , i got in touch with them and then they looked at the source code , but the problem is that choice.abort.program <br />
does some processing (resetting some values )  in the before.choice , so we cant remove that section.<br />
<br />
actually , tfacp1140s000 sessions prog script tfacp1140 makes a function call to itfacp0015 .In this function depending upon different errors , choice.abort.program of tfacp1140 gets called from many places from within this function.<br />
<br />
So I tried to set a long variable api.error.message in<br />
choice.abort. of tfacp1140, and then export it from there<br />
using export(&quot;api.error.message &quot; ,api.error.message )<br />
<br />
And then included a<br />
 import(&quot;api.error.message&quot; , api.error.message ) ,<br />
in my API/AFS program<br />
<br />
<br />
But though the variable gets set in tfacp1140 , it is never imported into my API/AFS program.<br />
<br />
:-((<br />
<br />
Is this a right way of trying out ....is this a right direction .???<br />
Am i going wrong somewhere wrt import , export stmts ?<br />
<br />
Do u think the above idea might work with some modifications?<br />
<br />
<br />
I am totally out of ideas now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please try and help if u can .<br />

The export and import are a good idea.  I will have to look and see how I do this when I get to work on monday. I would expect this to work.<br />

<br />
So my observation that stpapi.get.mess.code() is not always accurate is correct. I've found quite a few situation where the stpapi.* function returns an error message, but the stpapi.get.mess.code() issued right after the command failed to find anything. I had to go to debugger and click on the error message variable name right after the culprit stpapi.* call -- and just before stpapi.get.mess.code() -- to retrieve the actual message.<br />
