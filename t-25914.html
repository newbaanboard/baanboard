<br />
This seems very interesting for Baan/LN users with intention to integrate a CRM. This paper and the ideas sounds great, but it's future yet.<br />

====================================================<br />
This statement of direction provides a preview of the SSA Customer Relationship Management (CRM) current roadmap plan. The information contained herein is primarily intended to help SSA Global customers (including customers of Epiphany®) and prospects with their planning.<br />
<br />
However, the content outlined in this statement of direction is not meant to be complete and SSA Globals product direction is subject to revision or change without notice. This document is intended neither to commit SSA Global to any particular course of product development nor to<br />
constitute an obligation under any license agreement or any other contractual agreement with SSA Global or concerning the SSA Global products. <br />
<br />
With the recent addition of the Epiphany product suite, SSA Global now offers a CRM solution that includes outbound and inbound marketing, sales, service, and CRM analytics. These applications are based on a service-oriented architecture similar to SSA Open Architecture, built<br />
using Java® 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE®) technology. This combined architecture can provide the flexibility needed to integrate with existing enterprise applications and tailor solutions for specific<br />
industries.<br />
<br />
We perceive the synergies between SSA Global and Epiphany to include the following:<br />
 A significant percentage of shared customers in manufacturing, finance, and services industries<br />
 A commitment to serving mid-market and large global enterprises with quality solutions and the potential for providing high return on investment (ROI)<br />
 Common adoption of open standard, service-oriented technology<br />
 The same core values of customer satisfaction and commitment to quality products, implementation, and support</div></div><hr />
