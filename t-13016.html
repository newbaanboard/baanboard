	Recently I posted couple threads related to Core dump and shell server terminated errors. This thread is related to those posting as well.<br />
<br />
	After doing some head scratching, I was able narrow the above problems to some sessions that are using stpapi calls (AFS). Mainly, when users are running these sessions, they get shell server terminated error and a shut down of their BW client with core dumped in their home directory.<br />
<br />
	We designed these sessions (that are using AFS) in our development server which is on porting set 6.1c.05.01 and our production server is on porting set 6.1c.03.01.<br />
	<br />
	After all the testing of these sessions in the development server, we never encountered these problems. But, when we went live these sessions, now we have users calling about these sessions crashing. So, I think since we have an older version of porting set  on our production server (older than the one on the development server) could be causing these problems.<br />
<br />
	I would love to do a porting set upgrade (time permitting) but mean while, are there any particular binary files ($BSE/bin, $BSE/lib etc) that I can copy from the development server to production server to address this problem?<br />
<br />
	Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
You are definitely using an old portingset, both on your live server as on your development server. I assume you also use old software in standard program. <br />
<br />
If you check the text of solution 10923 (ttstpstandard et al), there have been some 40 defects solved in AFS. Most of them have been solved since january 2003, so recent fixes.<br />
<br />
I think portingset is not the bottleneck, but it is the standard program. That in itself may depend on portingset updates, although there are no hard requirements.</div></div><hr />
