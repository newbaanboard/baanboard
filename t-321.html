<br />
Is anyone using their product?  Are you satisfied with it? <br />
<br />
Are there any other faxing solutions for Baan?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use a product called dbfax from Version One software. They are based in the UK and further info is available on their website. <br />
<br />
http://www.versionone.co.uk <br />
<br />
We currently also use their forms software and are thinking about using their mail software.<br />
<br />
Another package that handles this sort of thing is StreamServe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bartbk</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Solution that I chose is ActiveFax (www.actfax.com). I am very happy with this one. Anybody else use this? I chose it because I wanted to have one general solution for whole company (not separate Baan fax and Winfax) and possibility of sending email is also nice bonus ;-))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santiago</div><div class="date">6th December 2001, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, There is a product called Ecom Connector for BaaN. It uses RightFAX as a fax engine. <br />
<br />
THis is a 100% Document Delivery Connector for BaaN. It is 100 Baan integrated.<br />
<br />
RightFAX has 25% of the world market, so it is quite improbable you get the same problematic situation than now.<br />
<br />
The  Ecom Connector for BaaN allows fax, email, and SMS messaging from BaaN. No changes on reports. Notification of faxes within BaaN sessions. Completely integrated with BaaN.<br />
<br />
Some details on how it works are on :<br />

<br />
Email is sent as a PDF file.<br />
<br />
Faxing is done through an ASP fax service. You do not need to install any Fax software package. Faxing is done through a third party company that sends Faxes through email. <br />
<br />
For example, to send a fax to 001-510-647-0112, you just send an email to 0015106470112@faxservice.com and the attachement is your fax message.<br />
<br />
B2Email makes this solution easy.<br />
<br />
To learn more about this functionality, check our web site at www.nazdaq-it.com<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">2nd May 2002, 23:50</div></div><div class="posttext">We've been using Merkur with Baan for a few years now.  The stability of the Merkur fax servers has been excellent, and tech support has been helpful and responsive.<br />
<br />
Considering the pricing and the scalability, the Merkur fax server product (also known as &quot;comfax&quot;) may be overkill for a small company.<br />
<br />
They also now have a separate Baan integration product called MerkurIS, which lets you use a third party fax engine.  MerkurIS comes with a PCL to fax/Postscript/PDF conversion software, which is great for us.  It can also transmit the output via e-mail attachments rather than sending it to the fax engine.<br />
<br />
So a smaller company could probably go with MerkurIS and the ActiveFax server, and save money over going with MerkurIS + Merkur fax server, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Harder</div><div class="date">3rd May 2002, 09:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
something different,  we use a Hylafax on a Linuxserver and<br />
have a seperate windowsdriver for pc faxing.<br />
<br />
Baan side is done with a simple Baan printer which calls a<br />
unix script for the faxnumber, remarks and then<br />
its sends the ascii file to the Linuxserver.<br />
<br />
We use a program to convert the ascii reports to faxformat,<br />
called 2fax (www.atbas.org) which supports 80/96/132 fonts <br />
and also can use pcx overlays (forms, logo's) with the text.<br />
<br />
We setup hylafax with a 8 modems and have setup an intranet<br />
page where every fax (from pc or Baan) can be viewed.<br />
<br />
Sending about 100 - 150 faxes a day for the last 4 years<br />
Downside: none, besides time to setup and unix/hylafax<br />
knowledge.</div></div><hr />
