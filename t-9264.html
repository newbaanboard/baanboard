<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rozlynn Smith</div><div class="date">15th March 2003, 01:31</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using a two digit series for production orders and have a couple of those series that have reached the limit.  We archived production orders from 1998 and 1999 so that we could re-use numbers, so we reset the first free number of those series back to 1.  We have run into a couple of problems after doing this.<br />
<br />
The problem I ran into yesterday was that an order that had been archived still had a record in Hours Accounting (tihra100).  We were able to add another production order with the same number, but when the user ran the Cancel Production Orders session against this order which was at status &quot;Released&quot; she got an error message saying &quot;Order found in hours accounting file&quot; and it would not cancel the order.  No hours or material had been posted against this order.  When I checked tihra100, I noticed that the records for this production order had dates indicating that they were actually for the archived order.  I used GTM to delete these records and she was able to cancel the order.  Does anyone know of a fix for this?</div></div><hr />

Did you also run session:  'Archive hours accounting' tihra1215m000?<br />

Thank you for your response.  A BaaN consultant helped us with our first year of archiving and created a document with procedures for us to use for future archiving.  This session was not included in that document.  We will give this a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">17th March 2003, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">This is actually a bug in Baan. When a new production order is entered, there are checks on all kind of tables, but not on the HRA tables. The best way to work around this, is to set up an archive procedure in which HRA data is always scheduled to be archived before Finance Integration Transactions are archived. That way the problem can't happen anymore, since an order number can not be reused as long as the financial integration transactions still exist. <br />
<br />
There are more problems like this in Baan. E.g. don't set back sales order numbers before you've deleted CMS records belonging to the old sales orders.<br />
