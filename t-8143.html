<br />
Baan GUI looks a bit dated, and always has done.  SAP GUI looks really nice and stylish.<br />
<br />
Think a new look would bring a feel-good-factor back.<br />

<br />
the GUI looks like a Windows 3.11 GUI. We live in the year 2002! <br />
Happy New Year Baan!<br />

<br />
But I don't pay a lot of money to upgrade on iBaan - if I only want a up-to-date GUI. Is it so hard to write a new GUI for IVc4???<br />

Even when I will love to see a new GUI for a version like Baan IV, I'm happy to see that at least there is one nice looking GUI at Baan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ivo Ladage</div><div class="date">24th December 2002, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Worktop is new GUI also available on BaanIV. Might not be that fancy as Webtop, but at least it is less boring then the static menu browser, desktop manager, DEM browser and Process Viewer;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arunkw</div><div class="date">1st March 2003, 20:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys,<br />
Baan 4 and Baan 5 don't have a good GUI Interface...<br />
What worries me is not the GUI  looks but the GUI controls and functionality, i.e GUI features of Drag Drop, Graphs, Images etc which are must for any big Application. <br />
Just Imagin if you could drag your item icon icon to your purchase order, or how the real images of your item would look like or what does your graph shows for your finance entries <br />
Baan had done mistake of not considering these functionality as the inherent intenal requirement of the client application itself.<br />
I have always explained to myself that baan is not an Ice-Candy software which will have have all the Jazzy Fx and But has always considered it as a serious ERP software whose main aim is to make its functionality strong and because of the performance reasons may be baan must have dropped down the idea of providing a good GUI<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ivo Ladage</div><div class="date">6th June 2003, 11:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Both Worktop and Webtop are for free and downloadable from the Baan support web site.<br />

<br />
Gemini (Baan6) has an improved GUI, which should please those of us inside the bubble, but if you really want to know how important the GUI is to end users, try to convince a dumb terminal ASCII user to upgrade.  They know they have a more efficient and robust solution and would rather not have their people using a terminal that can play games and surf the net..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't need a fancy gui. I would be happy if I just could &quot;copy and paste&quot; from a windows application into the default text editor or select a record within lists without using the mouse. Even those most basic features do not exist in Baan IV seven(!) years after it was released...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pvenutti</div><div class="date">29th January 2004, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: is BA really not available in BaanV o higher?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm trying to stay with BA where our company is migrating to BW<br />
<br />
But the main and most important is the data entry rate. For sales office that _do_ data entry not programmers or account managers. Being keyboard only and  figures (numbers) commanded BA can't be beaten.<br />
<br />
regards<br />
PV<br />
<br />
Here are some points of dis-like with BW (sorry for poor formatting, was a table). <br />
<br />
BW<br />
------------<br />
BA<br />
-------------<br />
where we found it<br />
---------------<br />
 <br />
No copy&amp;paste<br />
--------<br />
copy&amp;paste as data possible<br />
-------<br />
any windows<br />
 <br />
No full line view<br />
-------<br />
 view of all line data<br />
--------<br />
 Mantain Receipts<br />
 <br />
No full line view<br />
---------<br />
 available if terminal has auto form resizing<br />
----------<br />
 any reports with 132/215 colums<br />
 <br />
BaaN sessions behave differently from BA<br />
---------<br />
----------<br />
Most session with many fields per each form and as example <br />
tiitmc401m090 second zoom.<br />
 <br />
Poor data validation in input field<br />
--------<br />
--------<br />
 any field where user doesn't validate with tab or return. It brings <br />
a fatal error message.<br />
 <br />
keyboard shortcuts are different for different computers<br />
--------  <br />
---------<br />
 bw version B40c.68 gives &quot;save&quot; as ctrl+w or ctrl+s<br />
 <br />
<br />
fatal error: &quot;no permission for&quot;<br />
------------<br />
 session works normally<br />
-------------<br />
 zoom fields<br />
 <br />
serious fatal errors leave &quot;option dialog&quot; open and on windows <br />
9* this doesn't let turn off the machine.<br />
--------------<br />
--------------  <br />
 windows 9* clients<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
BW Network load is much higher than BA (6x factor)<br />
---------------<br />
 BA can be used from remote with lower bandwidth.<br />
---------------<br />
 (attached a network capture sample)<br />
 <br />
<br />
Form don't resize and some data field aren't displayed.<br />
---------------------<br />
---------------------  <br />
 tdsls4101m000 using 800x600<br />
 <br />
print to screen doesn't resize with wide format<br />
--------------<br />
 Window's font switch to small pitch<br />
--------------<br />
 Every printout to device D</div></div><hr />
