<br />
- I wonder if anyone did this on 4c3.   If so, please share your experiences.<br />
<br />
- I am not sure if it is wise to upgrade to 4c4 from 4c3 before starting to do the archiving.</div></div><hr />

Upgrading may cause so many other problems and will not ensure better archiving results.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">29th March 2002, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Archiving shouldn't really be an issue when it comes to a decision on whether to upgrade or not. I think there are some additional archiving sessions in c4 but all the core archiving sessions are available in c3.<br />
<br />
We have now almost ran the full set of archiving sessions in c3. We were really forced towards this by issues regarding performance and disk space as is usually the case with archiving.<br />
<br />
The best advice I can offer is to set up a test environment with archive compnaies (if disk space permits we had to do it by treading very carefully in live) and get as much information and documentation from the board as you possibly can before testing the sessions.<br />
<br />
Due to the risk of removing data that may still be required by users it would be a good idea to set up an internal project within your company to ensure that all users are aware of which data will be taken offline.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karin Espelage</div><div class="date">30th March 2002, 06:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive archived on b2, as well as on c3 and c4. The sessions available are the same. I noticed definitely performance improvements between the b and the c versions with comparable data volumes though. These especially for archiving projects and integration transactions, which might have to do with the changed table structure for integration transactions. (How noticeable these improvements are depends of course always a lot on the amount of data that has to be archived.)<br />
<br />
I havent noticed any differences between c3 and c4. I wouldnt upgrade because of archiving, but if you plan to upgrade anyhow, I would do the upgrade first. Baan constantly releases new patches for archiving and I still expect new once to be released. You should import the latest versions to save yourself a lot of trouble. If you upgrade, you have the latest version anyhow. If you archive before you upgrade, you have to go through testing in c3 and again in c4 after the upgrade.<br />
<br />
How much testing has to be done, has of course a lot to do, with the amount of data you have. Archiving in a company, where the archive processes can run on weekends is quite a different story from archiving in a company, where some archive processes run for 14 days while users are on the system.</div></div><hr />
