<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Henrik Brondum</div><div class="date">1st November 2009, 22:57</div></div><div class="posttext">There's not yet any integration between Baan (Erp LN) and Infor PM 10. Questions is also what's possible to integrate. In most models the Infor PM 10 structure will be different (more aggregated) than the structures in the underlying ERP's. Infor PM 10 customers will quite often buy and sell companies faster than they are able to integrate into a common ERP.<br />
<br />
Data integration is typically solved by using Infor PM 10's strong WEB based dataloader. This dataload is often run by end user's, so it's often preferred to to have an SQL extract producing a CSV file from the ERP, which the local users then grab with the WEB data loader. The local user's are able to maintain their own local mapping from local structure to the corporate structures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are currently working on an Infor Open SOA based integration between LN and PM10. In this standard integration PM10 is not replacing LN Financials but is running on top of it. Please contact you account manager for more details.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">2nd November 2009, 18:18</div></div><div class="posttext">However, they are having a hard time coming up with good references for us to talk to.  We'll be going from FRX to PM10.  We have multiple companies in different currencies and PM10 has been billed as the answer to our problems.  Before spending so much money for it though we want to talk to people about their experiences with it.  <br />
<br />
So if there is no direct integration with LN, there most definately won't be with IVc4 which is what we're using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">2nd November 2009, 21:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok great to hear that you are in contact with your account manager. The SOA based PM10 integration will also be delivered on BaanIV. However we are still developing it. But your account manager should be able to get more 'offical' info on it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NXG_Ruben</div><div class="date">22nd July 2010, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently completed a project for a large corporation with headquarters in Sydney and subsidiaries in several countries with multiple currencies. This was implemented using Infor PM 10 with direct integration into LN / BAAN. We have a generic model that can be connected to different LN / BAAN databases. The Infor PM product is an excellent solution with OLAP and direct access to the underlying SQL tables through the front end.<br />

I think we are talking about the same thing. Good thing is its all web enabled. We also have subs in Europe and Asia besides US. Obviously all the currencies are in play. I will be more than happy to share our experiences.</div></div><hr />
