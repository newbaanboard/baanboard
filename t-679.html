Now if I would like to use API,AFS for standard sessions since I cannot have standard script should I would write code in AFS so that it works as if user inputs data from the session. For instatnce if I use this for Maintain receipts session and have the received quantity in the input ascii file how the back order qty should be updated in the table? Will it be updated automatically or it needs some more code to be written in AFS assuming I don't have standard script for Maintain Receipts Session <br />

Thanks and Regards, <br />

Yes that is exactly how I approach function servers.  I run the sessions by hand to see what they do, what I need to fill in and what sub-sessions get called in what order.  I am not real familiar with maintain receipts. It seems to me the first thing you do is put in a packing slip number, then it pops up and asks for a purchase order, then it returns to the maintain receipt session.  Then you can fill it in.  Not exactly the easiest session to start with for your first function server.<br />
<br />
It also sounds like you are in the same boat as me - no source code.  At times it makes it hard to resolve problems. But you can always ask questions here in this forum.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
