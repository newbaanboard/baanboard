<br />
Is anyone accessing BaaN V with Crsytal report? I have tried  but I am getting the message:<br />
<br />
  &quot;unable to to logon to the Server, The Server environment or user/password combination may be invalid.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have no problem in connecting to BaaN IV with Crystal. I also have  no problem in connecting to the native BaaN V. Do I need extra crystal drivers or am I missing something? If anyone has the new drivers for BaaN V, can you please send them to me. Thanks. :p <br />

I also have the similar problem of crystal report. I can connect to crystal enterprise server,not only in BaanIV,but also in BaanERP ,but system always showed &quot;user/password of APS error&quot;. I make sure communication between Baan Server and Crystal Server is ok,because I can get the XML file and log file at the server that installed crystal enterprise8.0 and solution for baan version 2.<br />
<br />
So who can help us??<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Is the portingset 7.1c.02 or higher?<br />
<br />
Passwords can be changed with the utility BnIRTConfig.exe in the \Crystal Enterprise Solution for Baan\IBR folder. Don't change these passwords via CMC.<br />
<br />
Is there anything logged in the \IBR\ss_log folder? Note that you have to set the following registry value to 1.<br />
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Seagate Software\Baan IRT\Logging Level</div></div><hr />
