<br />
I have a requirement that i have to get to a sales order in tdsls4100m000 and then chnage the customer order no field in either details session (tdsls4100m000) or tdsls4100m900. <br />
<br />
I have used the details session using the stpapi.form command as sales order session can't synchronise to tdsls4100m900 in LN.<br />
 I can able to open the details form and put the changes in customer order no. through stpapi.put command.<br />
<br />
However when i update the values by using stpapi.update, it causes a problem and returns &quot;editable synchronised dialog not started&quot; and thus the process ends.<br />
<br />
What i can see from front end is that, as soon as i click the save button after making change in the header customer order no., it pops up a form asking for synchronising - tdsls0280m000. This activity, it seems that is not coming in AFS.<br />
<br />
Please suggest a way that as soon as i simulate clicking the save button through AFS command 'stpapi.update', i'am able to open this synchronisation session.<br />
<br />
I'am attaching the script i'am trying to use. Please suggest what changes can be done in this.<br />
Please advise at the earliest.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<br />
Also if you are dead set on using AFS code then make sure all session objects and stpapi libraries are current.  Since this is LN it is the best(and actually only) advice I can give.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanx for your advice, but can you provide me the source for tdslsdll1234 if available.<br />
<br />
All other help is welcome.<br />

I have found that Baan is very helpful with source when we have issues - I recommend contacting them.  Plus I am on 4c4 and we do not even use the sales module. You should be able to use bic_info on the library and see what routines are in it.</div></div><hr />
