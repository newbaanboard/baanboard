  We have created Monitor on PO Creation and added Distribution List as Email. One PO creation, we are able to see BOD message for created PO in One View. On selection of document, we can see Steps as BOD entered ION -&gt; BOD Consumed by Engine -&gt; BOD Sent to Queue of Monitor Engine -&gt; BOD Delivered  by Engine -&gt; Monitor Instance Triggered -&gt; BOD Delivered by Engine<br />
<br />
Though BOD Message say Monitor Instance triggered we are not receiving any email. We have changed distribution list from email to User but no alert seen for selected User. <br />
<br />
Any Help will be appreciated.<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you see the rising of Alert Created number in the Manage-&gt;Monitor&amp;Workflows-&gt;Active Monitors?<br />
<br />
If you can see the rising, the problem is in your ION SMTP setttings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vik.patil</div><div class="date">12th April 2018, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We can see Alert Created count is zero and Document Processed count is 3. May I know why this count is not increased though Monitor Instance Triggered? May I know how to troubleshoot this issue.<br />
<br />
There might be ION SMTP issue so we will check this but when I select Distribution list as User without email check box checked we should see Alert message for selected User.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you see alerts created count is zero , then your rules for alert is not working. You should verify the conditions then you can look the SMTP settings</div></div><hr />
