<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veyant</div><div class="date">5th May 2006, 11:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
this is related to BAAN V.<br />
<br />
I am creating a Sales Order Splitting AFS in which it starts from tdsls4501m000 (Sales Order Lines) and then invokes (tdsls4101s000), make the Split delivery Flag as &quot;Yes&quot;, after pressing details button , it invokes &quot;tdsls4501m200 (Sales Order Lines details)&quot; which invokes &quot;tdsls4101s200&quot; . <br />
<br />
In session tdsls4101s200 - total qty is shown and if u click on split detail button, it invokes &quot;tdpur4000s000&quot; where u have to put the qty to be split and after pressing OK, it closes &quot;tdpur4000s000&quot; and changes order qty to bal qty (original order - split qty) and generates a new line with the split qty as seq no. 2<br />
<br />
in AFS, it calls tdsls4501m000, invokes tdsls4101s000, then session tdsls4501m200 is invoked with details button and split delivery as &quot;yes&quot;, now session tdsls4101s200 gets invoked and it calls &quot;tdpur4000s000&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am inputting &quot;qty to be split as<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4000s000&quot;,&quot;ordered.qty&quot;, str$(5))<br />
then i am sending a update followed by Save, in save error it gives message (&quot;commnd id disabled&quot;.) it ends the session with stpapi.end.session and when it check manually, whether split happened then i found that it doesn't split.<br />
<br />
Do anybody help me on this. session &quot;tdpur4000s000&quot; has three fields and 3 buttons.<br />
<br />
field 1 - Ordered Qty<br />
field 2 - planned del. date<br />
field 3 - planned del. time<br />
<br />
button 1 is &quot;OK&quot; which is basically a save &amp; exit button, then second button is &quot;cancel&quot; and third button is help.<br />
<br />
I want to know is there any commend in STPAPI to call &quot;save &amp; exit&quot; button option.<br />
<br />
As if send &quot;stpapi.save&quot; it returns with error &quot;command disabled'<br />
<br />
need quick help on this.</div></div><hr />

Check to see what the okay button is setup as on the form.  Usually on sessions like this the okay button is the same as continue - it processes and closes the session.  I am not familiar with these sessions so this is just guess based off your description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veyant</div><div class="date">5th May 2006, 16:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried bothy stpapi.save and stpapi.continue.process<br />
<br />
while using stpapi.save , it returns error &quot;Command is disabled&quot;.<br />
on stpapi.continue...., it does nothing.<br />
<br />
actually, i checked that OK button is a standard command button which is standard command &quot;Save &amp; Exit&quot;.<br />
<br />
so can anybody help me in this what should i do to press ok button after putting Ordered.Quantity and del. date as STPAPI.SAVE &amp; STPAPI.CONTINUE.PROCESS both r not working.<br />

<br />
I used tdsls.dll4101.create.total.line(reason) in one of my  Baan V projects. the function return a long value (0 = ok! else error). Parameter reason is also long (0= split shipments or &gt;0 = other reasons). This must be called  inside atransaction with the current tdsls401 record selected (not for update!). If ok the position will be split into a total and a detail line. To create subsequent detail lines I use dal.new().</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danny Leolux</div><div class="date">9th May 2006, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Normaly save and exit would be invoked by<br />
stpapi.update(...)<br />
stpapi.end.session(...)<br />
<br />
If the button however is a user.choice there is also the command:<br />
stpapi.application.option(string session, long form, long option, ref string errm)<br />
<br />
option should be between 0 and 9 (choice.user.x)<br />
<br />
If the session is has a report perhaps the next command can be used:<br />
stpapi.set.report(...)<br />
stpapi.print.report(...)<br />
<br />
Hopefully this helps,<br />

Just noticed that you say baan V - have you tried stpapi.form.command? I thought this was what you used in Baan V.  I am not familiar with the format of this command.  Also you may just need the latest stpapi objects or session objects.<br />
<br />
I think what vahdani was trying to say is that using DAL functionality in Baan V is (or could be) easier that using the AFS method.  It seems several Baan V users have stated that around the board.  Since I am not familiar with Baan V I won't be much help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After putting alot of efforts, i got the error changed, now when i send stpapi.update, followed by stpapi.endsession , it returns back a fatal error : USE of NULL pointer '  '. I searched and found that it is a bug in ttstpstandard and SSA has given a solution 140121 for the same. I am trying to get it installed so that i can test the scenario once again after installation of this solution.<br />

thanks for all the support</div></div><hr />
