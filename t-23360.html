<br />
A.    We are running crystal 10 &amp; CE 10 and I have unsuccessfully tried to send reports by email but nothing is working. Here is what I did;<br />
<br />
1.  I have Set up the default email (SMTP) destination on the Job Server(ours is; CE.reportjobserver)<br />
<br />
2. I have also schedule - the destination on the object to deault Email(SMTP)and set the values as my email address as the user<br />
<br />
However, when I run the report nothing is being delivered into my email and when I check the history, the report is still pending. Any thoughts/suggestions/ideas would be very much appreciated. Does the email work with any version of CE 10?<br />
<br />
B. Can some also tell me how to schedule the report to run under a specific calender and how to dynamically change a schedule report dates to include fresh parameters on the new report?<br />
<br />
C. Which is the best way to deliver reports with a very limited user license in a CE environment?<br />
<br />
D. I have also switched on the thumb nail on the preview, but I am not getting any. Any idea why?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
setting up of SMTP Setting can be tricky but this works. It helps when you are 100% sure ablout your connection data. Use an eMail client say &quot;Outlook Express&quot; (Not the Outlook) on your Crystal Server and set up a your Email account so that you can send a test Mail. When you get this to work then you can go ahead and enter the information in CE.<br />
<br />
When you have a limited number of licences  then you can create generic users in CE: for Example create users &quot;Sales&quot; or &quot;Accounts&quot; instead of  users &quot;John Smith&quot; or &quot;Mary Webber&quot;. then all sales staff for example can login using the same user name.<br />
<br />
Thumbnails: You must also select save thumbnails when publishing (saving) your report to CE.</div></div><hr />
