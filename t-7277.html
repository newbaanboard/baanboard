<br />
We are in the process of integrating wireless scanners in our company's ERP. <br />
Our ERP is Baan IV based on SQL Server 7 and running on Windows NT. I'm new to Baan but I have experience in programming and SQL.<br />
We use our scanners for other purposes (PTC-960SL) and they are managed trough a Wavelink server.<br />
<br />
We need it to validate new source-material entering the factory against Baan tables and if it exists acknowledge it. Also in a second phase we want the finished product to be entered into Baan so we can accelerate the expedition  process.<br />
 <br />
My question is. Can I use C source code to interface with Baan? I have searched trough the forum and haven't found anything relevant except using function servers. I have experience interfacing directly with SQL Server (recently with .NET) but I want to use Baan validation.<br />
I have analized the api directory in the baan directory and I seem to understand most of it but I really need documentation for it. <br />
<br />
In resume I want to use C or C++ because of the WaveLink interface but I also want to validate the data trough Baan.<br />
<br />
So my question is: Is there any documentation related and/or explaining the DB C source code examples in the Baan directory,<br />
if so can anyone point me to it. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had posted some BaaN-C interface document somewhere on the Board here. You might need to search for it.<br />
<br />
I am just aware of the topic but never used it.<br />
<br />
You might also find some example code in <br />

Good Luck!</div></div><hr />
