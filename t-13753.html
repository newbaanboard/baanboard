<br />
Hopefully someone can help me out on this one.  I'm busy with a conversion project at a customers site, splitting a logistical company into two.  (The functional logic is all in place, so please do not give advise or suggestions in this area!)<br />
<br />
During the conversion, I need to rectify logistical company numbers in the tfgld4xx tables.  This is where we noticed something strange, and I think it is due to archiving problems.  The record counts of the tables are the following:<br />
<br />
tfgld410:  4 024 562<br />
tfgld417:  3 914 032<br />
tfgld418:  7 915 791<br />
tfgld419: 11 462 389The difference between tfgld410 en tfgld417 is expected, since sales orders book both debit and credit lines to tfgld410, and nothing to tfgld417.<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever seen these kind of differences?  And can we safely discard the records in tfgld418 and tfgld419 when there is no matching record in tfgld410?<br />
<br />
Please help!</div></div><hr />

418 should be 410 + 417.<br />
I have no experience with 419.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 11:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply.  However, more questions:  if 418 = 410 + 417, how are they linked?  The keys of 410 and 418 have 7 fields each, and 417 has only 6 fields.  The links that I assumed, are the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
tfgld410.ocom = tfgld417.ocom = tfgld418.ocom = tfgld419.ocom<br />
tfgld410.tror = tfgld417.tror = tfgld418.tror = tfgld419.tror<br />
tfgld410.fitr = tfgld417.fitr = tfgld418.fitr = tfgld419.fitr<br />
tfgld410.trdt = tfgld417.trdt = tfgld418.trdt = tfgld419.trdt<br />
tfgld410.trtm = tfgld417.trtm = tfgld418.trtm = tfgld419.trtm<br />
tfgld410.sern = tfgld417.sern = tfgld418.sern = tfgld419.sern<br />
tfgld410.line                 = tfgld418.line = tfgld419.lino<br />
<br />
Is this correct?  If not, what is the correct relation?</div></div><hr />

I think that this is the situation:<br />
For most of the integration transaction, that have both 410 (debit) and 417 (credit) lines, than line = 0 in 418 is for the 410 and line = 1 is for the 417 line. <br />
(Allthough it does not implicitly exist in 417)<br />
<br />
In Sales / Sales Invoice transactions, where there are no lines in tfgld417, there is a 1 to 1 relationship between 410 and 418.<br />
