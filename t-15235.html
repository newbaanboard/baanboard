<br />
I wanted some feedback from those who have archived before (we have never done so). Our consultants tell us that archiving Baan (we have three companies in Baan 4) takes 16 consultant days, 45 IT days and similar amount of department days. Is it true that archiving is really that work-intensive?<br />
<br />
If yes, should we really bother to archive? Is it worth it?<br />
<br />
For that amount of work, I can invest 30K $ into a new, faster server?</div></div><hr />

I would advice you to spend some time on it yourself: surely you will find out that it is not that timeconsuming<br />

<br />
The most problems are the incorrect/inconsistent data.<br />
<br />
And You should be on the right software level for the archiving sessions at Baan IV.<br />
<br />
Normaly I discuss with my customers the right way at one or to days and the customer knows how to work.<br />
<br />
But donÂ´t forget the law, eg. at Germany!</div></div><hr />
