I asked for them to clarify this by asking:<br />
1) does that mean Safari does not work with BaanIVc4 ?<br />
2) does that mean Baan will not offer any standard support for Baan/Safari problems.<br />
<br />
They have still not clarified for me....anyone know the answers ?<br />

thanks....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a customer who uses Safari: the problem we noted so far was that with the new 7.1c portingset Safari didn't worked at all anymore.<br />
However Safari delivered rather quickly some new executables after it works as before.<br />
Safari doesn't become a message from Baan anymore if Baan changes the portingset.<br />
<br />
Within ERP you can't run the financial statement reports anymore that used to run with Safari.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps a bit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">18th May 2002, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Like Han said above, Safari does no longer work with porting sets 7.1 and up. This is true for all versions of Baan.<br />
<br />
2) Yep, that is exactly what it means. It took me a lot of phone calls too to have Baan make a clear statement but what it boils down to: &quot;Safari is out, Seagate is in&quot;.<br />
<br />
What bothers me to no end is that Baan (and this is a long tradition) once again leaves their customers hanging because they offer NO solution other than paying for Crystal.<br />
<br />
Now I personally rather write my own reporting tool than give in to this kind of extortion. Probably cheaper too.<br />
