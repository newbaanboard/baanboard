<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st October 2009, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry forgot about this, but I was correct.  I do not have any code for tfacp1131 or tfacp1130.  As a matter of fact we modified tfacp1131 so that if it gets called from any of our api sessions it closes itself.  I am still not aware of any method that will allow you to select a subset of the records.  If you all find a solution please post it.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thomasm</div><div class="date">2nd October 2009, 09:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure how relevant this is but the same kind of problem is in the session Maintain Receipts when working with Advance Shipment Notice from EDI. Basically it is a number or records in a table you zoom to, each of the lines representing each of the lines on the purchase order with the quantities delivered. What you do when you work manually is to select all the lines that belong to the sales order you are working with and 'save and exit'.<br />
<br />
What I did to automate this was to combine regular SQL and afs (with code for receipts originally posted by Mark) in my session.<br />
<br />
I guess you will need to have a close look at the source to figure out if a solution like this is possible and how to build it. <br />
<br />
I do have code for approving invoices, with respecting the approval limits before calling the afs, which I'd be happy to share. But of course, that is another thing.<br />
<br />
Another idea could be to take a step back in the process and see if it is possible to start with automating the step of registering the invoice. Because then you could use the EDI functionality to receive the invoice and benefit from the fact that EDI will match your invoice automatically. But please be aware that to get the invoice to match the receipts have to be maintained (which technically is not an issue to automate, but can be for the business). Yeah, suddenly the problem grew :D<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
