<br />
They want me to transfer an existing Clippership &lt;-&gt; AS400 connection to Baan. I barely know what the program does. lol<br />
<br />
Any information will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I do not know clippership too. But I had a email from one BaaN customer who asked for ideas and help.<br />
<br />
Here is that old email, I think you can use the BaaN Socket functions to replace them or else make use of the better socket/ port programming features from &quot;C&quot; language and interface with BaaN Application.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well Prashanth, IÂ´ll try to explain it in english, We are a Sugar manufacturing company in Venezuela South America, we use scales TOLEDO in order to weight sugar cane and white <br />
sugar trucks.<br />
<br />
Now we have a simple Clipper application to read data transmited from scales TOLEDO (Com1 and Com2) and creates files in separate directory through commands like COM_OPEN(), COM_INIT(), COM_READ(), COM_COUNT(), it work <br />
good,BaaN session checks that directory and gets value in file .TXT and after calculate prices, quantities, etc,. We want to get that value directly running a Baan session. (We want to eliminate Clipper in our organization).<br />
<br />
We use 2400 bauds, 7 bits data lenght and 1 stop bit, to initialize <br />
ports.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your attention.<br />
In touch.<br />
Jim.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can look into the BaaN help manual for the socket functions-<br />

I am not quite clear if clipper and clippership is one and the same or not... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">22nd August 2002, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Clipper is well known to us old farts in the programming business. It was quite a neat DB development tool at the time. I believe (but I am not sure) that it has gone up in Borland. I don't know if it still exists as Clipper.<br />
<br />
Clippership I believe is a VB application, so that wouldn't match. However, the description in your email fits clippership. It produces shipping labels and information 'of the scale' and links currently to an AS400 machine running a program called Mozart.<br />
<br />
I am tasked with linking Clippership to Baan, but I don't even know where to start. We have no in-house knowledge left of the application and so far, nobody I have talked to seems to understand the full picture either.<br />
<br />
I did however get a phone number at Kewill in the mean time (owners of Clippership Software) and as soon as we are done playing phone tag, I should know a little more about what I am up against.</div></div><hr />
