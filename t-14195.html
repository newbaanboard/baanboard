I heard we might end up with problems if hyper-threading is enabled in the server.<br />
<br />
Is anybody using hyper-threading with Baan IVc4 &amp; Windows 2000 Servers?<br />
<br />
Any feedback will be much appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have BAAN IV c4 on IBM x235 whit hyper-threading and we dont have any problem's</div></div><hr />

If an application runs on a multi CPU system (as Baan is doing) no issues are to be expected on a hyperthreading system.<br />
<br />
Have no ideas where you heard these rumors, but I can't image any reason for problems in this area.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

I have seen benchmarks that suggest performance benefits from turning HT off.<br />

It may be worth testing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">28th September 2004, 02:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the opportunity to do a benchmark at Dell earlier this year as well as have several client running with HT.  It has a very positive effect on performance and overcomes some of the earlier restrictions on minimum numbers of processors given a batch load on the system.  I have seen decent performance on two processor systems with a light batch load -- definitely not the case without HT.  <br />
<br />
SO yes -- HT good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with JamesV. I wonder if ythe benchmarks you have seen are Baan/SSA benchmarks or other benchamrks as on 2cpu.com<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzmaus</div><div class="date">3rd November 2004, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">You need two thinks to take an advantage of HT:<br />
<br />
1.: Your OS must support HT ( Linux 2.6.xx or late 2.4.xx, W2k3 )<br />
2.: Your application should support HT too. <br />
<br />
So neither W2k nor the Baan binaries support it!<br />
I `d made some tests with a 4-way server with W2k and Corelli. I win 20%-30% performance switching HT off.<br />
<br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can image that your results are correct. You probably ran a few (up to the number of CPU's you have) batch processes in parallel. We use the rule of thumb that a HT CPU is in fact 2 CPU's of 60%. When making full advantage of it (Full Load with OLTP), you have in total 120% of the CPU power compared to switching HT off. This explain why you measured no improvement when HT was on. The amount of parallel processes was too low.<br />
<br />
So, when only having a few processes in parallel, HT can decrease your performance, when having more (like OLTP), your system will gain from HT.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Dick<br />
<br />
BTW: As you see above, your application doesn't need to support HT to benifit from it. And believe me, we have done tons of benchmarks here.</div></div><hr />
