<br />
I am processing a BOD into LN through a process BOD. Code written at OnProcess is working fine as expected but it is not creating acknowledgement BOD back to ION. Can you please guide me about the reasons behind the same? Do I need to make any specific setting/setup for acknowledgement BOD?<br />

<br />
Have you added the Acknowledge XML on the ION server directory? Also, have you added the Acknowledge method to your BII implementation?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have done following activity:<br />
<br />
1. Added zip files of all the supported verbs and xsd in ION registry. Apart from this there is no other place to add BOD in ION.<br />
<br />
There is no acknowledge method in BII. We have even set actionCode throug setControlAttribute command but still do not see acknowledgement BOD in ION. Please let me know if you think we are missing anything. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">8th August 2017, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">You will need to enable Incoming Acknowledge event in your XSD first. If it's enabled, you should be able to add Protected method OnAcknowledge in your BII. <br />
<br />
Once that is added, you need to add this code in your OnExecute hook.<br />
<br />
dal.set.error.message(&quot;@This is an acknowledge message&quot;)<br />
<br />
return(DALHOOKERROR)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have already included &quot;Can be published&quot; method in BID. As you suggested I will included &quot;Can be received in application&quot; as well and write the code that you provided but I am just wondering if &quot;Can be received in application&quot; would make any difference in publishing acknowledgement while processing a process BOD into LN?<br />
<br />
Also, when I process test BOD through tlbct3232m000 it show me an acknowledgement BOD when I click on &quot;Show output&quot; on session tlbct3232m000 so does that mean system is creating acknowledgement BOD but it is not reaching ION?<br />

Please find attached screen shot of the output response that I get when I run my test BOD through session tlbct3232m000. Do you think it looks fine or you see any issue with this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">10th August 2017, 13:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. This looks good. It should create the acknowledge BOD.<br />
<br />
Can you also share the events in the BII? OnAcknowledge method should be added to the BII. Also, the XML should be placed in the directory/registry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">10th August 2017, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">This looks okay too. Hope you have written the required code in the OnExecute hook. Also, is the AcknowledgeMaterialIssue1BOD.xml placed in the repository?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What code should we write in OnExecute? Also, do we really need to add acknowledgement BOD specifically in registry? I don't see any acknowledgement BOD in registry right now in our system? <br />
