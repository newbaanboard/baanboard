<br />
The other day somebody mentioned to me that iBaan CRM only works with BAAN V and not with BAAN IV.<br />
Is that correct? and what other CRM solutions do BAAN IV customers typically use?<br />
<br />

<br />
A standard CRM in the BaanIV world?  There is none as far as I know.  If they do CRM, they normally get a package off the shelf that works for them, and then interface it via exchange or customization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">e_sully</div><div class="date">7th August 2003, 22:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe iBaan CRM does integrate with Baan IV. I have not done it. I integrate with Baan V but Baan IV is a selection during installation. Whether is works or not I can't say. Just wanted to create some hope!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acapulco</div><div class="date">8th August 2003, 03:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan IV and CRM 4.2 and 4.3 do have build an off the shelf (not so off the shelf ) integration package via open world.   You should contact people from Baan CRM (if there is someone left) for more info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmermans</div><div class="date">23rd December 2004, 01:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Each new version of what's now called SSA Sales Force Automation (the former iBaan SalesPlus product) and SSA Interactive Selling (the former iBaan SalesPoint product) comes out with as Baan IV integration as well, as it's SSA Global's policy to support existing ERP customers with extension products such as CRM. And since Baan IV is a large install base, there's an obvious demand as we see by new SSA CRM customers with Baan IV every quarter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">2nd March 2005, 10:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice story Patric, and not being negative at all I always tend to smile reading stories like these: isn't Phi also Baan/SSA partner since ages, so the case might be a bit coloured.........?<br />
I do believe that SSA is more then able to offer the full enterprise package nowadays, allthough I've just encountered some painfull issues with integration of solutions........<br />
But after all, when it's an easy job they wouldn't ask us would they? :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmermans</div><div class="date">2nd March 2005, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Smiling is allowed of course, but Phi Data is not a partner of Baan/SSA Global. They are a provider of barcode and data-collection equipment which they integrate with SSA Baan if required. Maybe that's where the link comes in? This is however not in the form of a partnership, and I'm not aware of any joint business.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ericrasenberg</div><div class="date">2nd August 2005, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is possible to integrate Baan IV with CRM. I did a stand alone implementation of CRM with a lot of customizations. Via Open world is an integration possible. <br />
There is documentation available about this integration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ROLAND</div><div class="date">3rd August 2005, 07:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hai eric,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ericrasenberg</div><div class="date">12th August 2005, 11:22</div></div><div class="posttext">This might help you, but you need some software from SSA to get it running</div></div><hr />
