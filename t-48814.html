As mentioned see the sticky thread that will give you an idea of what it does and how you use it.  As for me - what it does is automate Baan sessions so you do not need to worry about updating all the correct tables(like with exchange or writing your own session).  <br />
<br />
Where we use - my answer is where it makes sense.  Exchange or your own program could be a better solution.  So you have to decide where to use this functionality.<br />
<br />
How to use it - see the sticky thread.  It will not always be straight forward and it might not always work.  I have managed work arounds in several places that suit me just fine.<br />
<br />
Why we use it - the best answer I can give to this is &quot;it saves time&quot;.  So for example in our case of receipts - the user had to print goods received notes, do the receipt, then print the receipt tag.  Each screen asking for common information and in some cases requiring the user to think about which line they should be receiving.  Not anymore - the user enters the order, the item, the qty, and if necessary some lot information.  The program runs all three sessions in the background and receives the part.  An added bonus is that we now use Certified vendors - so instead of having to go into our Quality program and make the record as inspected.  This happens automatically also - they can go straight to the inbound function sever.  Which is also streamlined - all in all this saved us a ton of time.  <br />
<br />
Another good example is the bin to bin inventory transfers.  The manual process is three sessions deep (since we have pegged inventory).  In this case what we did was write a program to generate tags for the inventory to be transferred(warehouse to floor stock warehouse).  With one screen the user scans the item, warehouse/location from, quantity and the warehouse/location to - then scans enter.  The user can probably do 20/30 of these in a minute - versus the old enter part, tab, enter warehouse, tab, etc., etc.<br />
<br />
Another good example is how we load our simulation company.  First production is copied from production to the simulation company. Then the user runs two function servers that completely loads all of the simulation data from costing links to hardware demand.  What used to take a week is down to 1 and 1/2 days.<br />
<br />
Just my rambling for the day!</div></div><hr />
