<br />
I am working on a session which makes use of a DDC Function Server. In this Function Server (which I generated myself using tuddc9201m000, Function Server Generator), there is a set of sub-processes activated as follows:<br />
   process.xxx = activate(&quot;session_xxx&quot;)<br />
   switch.to.process(process.xxx, SWITCH.WITHOUT.INTERACTION)<br />
<br />
process.xxx correctly results in the process being created, but every time the process is &quot;switched.to.process&quot; or &quot;send.to.process&quot;, a message results: <br />
   &quot;object 0 in process xxx not found&quot;<br />
<br />
Regardless of the message the logic in the sub-process'es seems to be executed correctly ???<br />
<br />
We're running BaanIV c4, SP9. <br />
I suspected the Standard Program to be the reason, and have therefore patched this to the latest level - still without positive results.<br />
<br />
I have now thrown my suspicion towards the fact that the Function Server script was generated from a 4GL session with Forms and &quot;generated&quot; into a 3GL session without these forms. Can this be the reason? <br />
...as far as I have understood the &quot;switch.to.*&quot; commands are made to support the graphical interface, which is not activated using 3GL.<br />
<br />
Can anybody tell me how to break this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

We had a similar problem, with errors of 'object x in process y not found'. But this was due to creating a more advanced session to fix offline DDC errors (as Baan is very basic in this area). It appeared, that the process errors were caused, because in the script, we had not added the BMS session. We found that we had to change the 'ituddc0010.bms.sess' variable (in the function 'ituddc0010.decode.bucket') to fix the errors. Not sure if this will solve your issue (although, you might want to try setting the 'ituddc0010.bms.sess' variable before calling your switch.to.process function. Then setting it back to the original value after calling the switch.to.process function).<br />
<br />
Can't gaurantee that this will work, as your issue sounds a little to different to the problem we had, but may be of some help.<br />

Unfortunately I don't have access to the latest ituddc functions, and meanwhile I decided to switch to the AFS technology, which (in this case) works beautifully.<br />
<br />
Anyway I am sure that your tip may help me - and others - in similar future situations (as many sessions still don't work with AFS...).<br />
