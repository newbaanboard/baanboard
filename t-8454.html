<br />
We have asked Crystal and been told there is one but cannot get hold of it<br />
<br />
Can anyone guide us <br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

Do you mean that Baan data in the APS module is not available in Crystal? <br />
If not, I suggest using Croko Reporter which builds its own datadictionary from the Baan data dictionary<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">16th January 2003, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">We are trying to get some statistics on the reports<br />
 themselves<br />
<br />
ie How many times a job is requested <br />
How frequently is it requested<br />
What time of day is it requested<br />
How long does it run , longest , shortest<br />
What is the delay time between schedule request and start time<br />
What is the delay time between schedule request and finish time<br />
How many jobs get requested per hour during 24 hours<br />

<br />
It takes advantage of Crystal's processing extensions capability to format activity log transactions to an external database. Using this solution you can obtain statistics on report usage, system activty performance, User ID activty, date/time stamping, etc. Their website is www.apos.on.ca.<br />
<br />
I obtained this information from the crystaldecisions knowledge database, so it isn't a personal recommendation as such. There may be other vendors in the UK offering similar solutions.</div></div><hr />

You can build your own program based on the tools tables from Job Data and Job History.<br />
<br />

ie How many times a job is requested <br />
How frequently is it requested<br />
What time of day is it requested<br />

Green</div><div class="date">29th January 2003, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">The job management module in BaaN provides information on jobs that have been executed within BaaN (ie you might schedule a report of MRP reschedule message - timrp1437m000 - to run overnight).<br />
<br />
What Frank is talking about, though, is monitoring the traffic &amp; performance of scheduled Seagate crystal reports themselves that run on the Crystal Info Report server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davids@dmgrpt.c</div><div class="date">4th February 2003, 01:04</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are reporting out of the Crystal Enterprise APS Database, your best bet is to stream out the data (via XML) into another database for reporting.  There is an administrative crystal &quot;Plug-in&quot; that will allow you to fully expose the APS database (which has many fields that are all combined into 1 field) and parse out the data.<br />
<br />
Once upladed into a new database, there are many vital stats that can be retreived.<br />
<br />
Note: Crystal Decisions does not reccomend or support reporting directly off the APS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">4th February 2003, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks davids !<br />
<br />
Do you have the Admin &quot;plug in&quot; if so how did you acquire it ?<br />
If not do you know how to get hold of it ?<br />
<br />
We have been told by the Crystal support group in Canada? it exists and that the UK support site would be in contact but.... they haven't for 2/3 weeks now so we have gone back to the Canada? support site for further assistance</div></div><hr />

<br />
There also is documentation on the CE CD that can walk you through the Admin SDK.<br />
