<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peter.Helberg</div><div class="date">1st July 2005, 00:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to use OLE from VB to return all fields for a table. I then want to loop through all fields and create the definitions in a locally stored database at runtime.  I see that there are functions rdi.table and rdi.table.columns that appear to be what I need for this but they dont seem to be available via ole.  Is this correct?  If they are available, what dll are they in?<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

So right off-hand I can see two ways to do this.  First you can write your own Baan dll using the rdi commands you need.  Then call this from VB.  Second you can always read table ttadv422 to see the fields and their declarations.  Of course you need to know which VRC the table is in - then just query straight against the table.</div></div><hr />

I was trying to avoid this for the obvious performance reasons and was hoping to use a native baan tool so we dont have to worry about upgrades and modifying a custom dll.  Let me know if you find the rdi's anywhere because I couldn't find them either.</div></div><hr />

There is always other tools (http://www.fasbenderinc.com/xql.html).  I have no clue how Gordon wrote this, but it did not have any performance issues.  I used this a few times and it looks like he has made some improvements to it.  This returned the table structure, references and etc.</div></div><hr />

PS.  by GO Cards, are you talking STL Cardinals?</div></div><hr />

I was wondering when someone would ask about that  -  University of Louisville.  I added that to my signature during the start of the NCAA Basketball tournament. :)</div></div><hr />

Create a ur own dll and function in Baan and call the same in ole . That can serve ur purpose .</div></div><hr />
