<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HAMASCH</div><div class="date">12th February 2003, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: <br />
Hi,<br />
I tried to use session tisfc0204m000 (Release Prduction Orders) with the AFS.<br />
This session print data to two reports !!!<br />
The reports are selected in:<br />
    <br />
    choice.print.data:<br />
    on.choice:<br />
<br />
When I debug the session (tisfc0204m000) this section is never reached !!! (api.mode = 1)<br />
<br />
I set api.mode = 0 in the debugger and the section was executed.<br />
<br />
Under C4 the variable api.mode was check but not in ERP ?!<br />
<br />
I don't know how to handle it.<br />
I can change the session, but I have to change less scripts as possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks so far<br />
Martin</div></div><hr />

I was just wondering if the stpapi.print.report would have a different effect than something like stpapi.continue.  I am not familiar with ERP version, but thought I would ask the question.<br />

<br />
Yes the api.mode does work in the BaaN ERP.<br />
<br />
An example usage -<br />
<br />
group.1:<br />
init.group:<br />
	if not (api.mode or job.process or background) then<br />
		get.screen.defaults()<br />
	endif</div></div><hr />

This commands are only for Baan IV.<br />
ERP : stpapi.set.report and stpapi.form.command.<br />

<br />
of course you can check the variable api.mode.<br />
<br />
But I don't want to change the original source !!<br />
<br />
ONLY THE SECTION <br />
CHOICE.PRINT.DATA:<br />
ON.CHOICE:<br />
<br />
ISN'T  executed if api.mode = 1<br />
<br />
It has to be hard coded by BaaN !!<br />
<br />
I compiled the sourc with debugger and changed api.mode to 0<br />
in the debugger just before reached this section.<br />
And now this section was executed.<br />
If this section isn't executed the program crashed in after.choice.<br />
if you change api.mode in the script, then the session crashed cause there is no window.<br />
<br />
so that's my problem.<br />
<br />
thanks for your answer<br />
Martin</div></div><hr />

it is impossible.<br />
I found the new guide for AFS in an post from Mark.<br />
In this version there some changes and it says that sessions with more than one report couldn't used with the AFS.<br />

<br />
Have you tried getting the latest object for tisfc0204m000 and try using API around the latest object?<br />
<br />
We've done extensive API programming for production order processing as part of our barcoding integration to BaanERP Manufacturing. We constructed production material issue, hours accounting, and reporting of qty completed API sessions to integrate data from our barcode system. However, we've yet to make one for production order release<br />

I impress that I've got the latest objekt (SP10).<br />
<br />
You did what I have to do.<br />
Can you post an example how you realized it with the AFS.<br />
<br />
An other question :<br />
Stand the P for Prasetyo ?<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a developer I worked together some years ago.<br />
He is back in Jarkarta.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry, we haven't actually made any API session on production order release. In our case, we leave the production order release to be done by our front office staffs using normal BaanERP interface. We only need API to integrate data from our custom made shop floor and warehouse barcoding software<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, no, the P stands for Pambudi not Prasetyo :)<br />

ret = tisfc.dll0221.release.production.order(<br />

<br />
I have run into a few sessions that provide 'report not found' when successful even when I supply the report information.  You can check the API error and ignore (assume success) when this message is returned.</div></div><hr />

thanks for the reply. i used your script (pragma and dll0221) but it display error during compile as 'Error: Unresolved reference to function 'tisfc.dll0221.release.production.order' i'm not sure why unresolved bec i put already the pragma in the declaration. thanks again.<br />

<br />
First check whether the DLL exists in your system or not. You can use ttstpbaandoc session or directly check in the Program Scripts if its present.<br />
<br />
If it is then include it using<br />
<br />
#pragma used dll otisfcdll0221 to use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually DLL Library &quot;otisfcdll0221&quot; does not exists in BaaN IVc4, it is a function.<br />
Still error message apear when Compiling.<br />
<br />
Fatal Error: Can't open DLL 'otisfcdll0221' for reading<br />
<br />
Thanks for any Feedback.<br />

<br />
What do you mean when you say &quot;otisfcdll0221 is a function&quot;. If this DLL is not present you need to find out which DLL is called. You can use a Bshell trace and check the DLL used and then use that DLL in your program.</div></div><hr />
