<br />
i work as an intern and now i have a new project where i need to build an .Net application witch need to communicate with  our Baan system. During the last days i read alot about how to create code for the baan communication. But i never read WHERE. I m totalz new in Baan and don t know if i need to insert a dll in my c# project of if there is a kind of editor in Bann itself!?!?<br />
<br />
Can anybody please help me???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th November 2010, 15:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Without really understanding what you are doing my recommendation is to contact infor for documentation.  I have never done a .net application, but I believe you can get to Baan data through direct access or maybe calling BaaN code or libraries.  Baan allows a varietie of editors to create programs(or DLL's) in Baan.  But your .net development would be on another platform to call the baan code.  At least from what I understand.  As mentioned infor should have some documentation to help with that.</div></div><hr />

What people are talking about here is to use OLE (object linking and embedding). Yes, this 10 year old technology. You will need to have the Baan client software (bw.exe) installed on your computer. During the creation of configuration files for this application (.bwc-files) Ole-Objects get installed (and registered in the windows registry). Basically, you will have to use OLE-Functionaliy of C# (you will have to find out how), to create such an OLE-Object (do a search here in the Forum to find some visual-Basic examples).<br />
<br />
If you have that OLE-Object, you basically have a connection to the Baan client on your client. Now you can call a method on that client, that in turn calls Baan-internal functionality on the Baan server.<br />

Hope that helps<br />
