<br />
This is the response from BO Support:<br />
<br />
&quot;The following versions and porting sets are supported for Business Objects XIR2, the list has been taken from the platforms.txt on the installation CD:<br />
<br />
Baan requirements<br />
====================<br />
Baan Server           PortingSet<br />
SSA Baan IVc          6.1c.06.05<br />
SSA BaanERP 5.0c      7.1d.04.150<br />
SSA BaanERP 5.2a      6.6a.01   <br />
SSA ERP LN 6.1        7.6a <br />
<br />
Unfortunately at the moment there are no plans to support newer porting sets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having now spoken to my BO account manager, it seems that as things stand at present there will be no support for Baan at all from BO XI R3.<br />
<br />
So guys, if this is important to you, please raise the issue with your BO Sales contacts now!</div></div><hr />
