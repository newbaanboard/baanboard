    We are using StreamServe for Printing POs.<br />
    I am having 2 issues with it.<br />
<br />
    # 1<br />
    In the US the Buyers use &quot;letter&quot; size paper.<br />
    In Asia they are using &quot;A4&quot; size paper.<br />
    What is the best way to accommodate this.<br />
<br />
    #2 <br />
    Sometimes the users tend to have PO Header texts<br />
    which doesn't fit on one page (Don't ask me why).<br />
    How do I control it?<br />
    If it doesn't fit in the &quot;block&quot;, I want it to go to the &quot;block&quot;<br />
    on the next page. As of now if prints all over the page.<br />
    It overwrites the &quot;footer&quot; section too.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I logged a case with Streamserve support and got an answer on how to fix it. If I can find it I will forward it to you. It sounded way too complex so we just told the users not to get carried away with typing text.<br />
On the paper size I would suggest doing something with different output queues and defining a variable to select the appropriate queue.</div></div><hr />
