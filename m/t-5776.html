Webtop is a thin-client, fully web-based user interface for BaanERP. It offers access to ERP sessions via your browser, without any client-side installation first. Please see the Webtop presentation (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=20254) for more information.<br />

<br />
The WebTop seems promising and we are hoping to use it on our production systems. But we are not yet able to configure to use it. <br />
<br />
My personal suggestion is to improve the setup and installation documentation as well as the support. I guess you can share more knowledge and have K.T. sessions with the BaaN American Support so that they can give us the first level support, instead we looking upto BaaN Tech Netherlands for more support, which seems hard to us with the differences in time zones.<br />
<br />
Also the compatibility issues has to be covered well in your installation, documentation, testing - like using it with IIS or Websphere etc.<br />
<br />
Right now, we find the documentation insufficient.</div></div><hr />

    We are currently on Baan Vc and right now we have many issues with worktop like security and sometimes end users are getting access to full menu etc.  Can we get this Webtop in place of worktop?  <br />
<br />
regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you please put foward what are the security issues you faced with Worktop ?<br />
<br />
I think worktop handles well, and that you need to control the users' authorizations based on the Role Templates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reintjan</div><div class="date">23rd July 2002, 09:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, regarding the security issue, I have the same question and remark as Prashanth Rao has. What exactly do you mean by this?<br />
<br />
Reint Jan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reintjan</div><div class="date">23rd July 2002, 09:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear N. Prashanth Rao,<br />
<br />
I understand that sometimes the installation and especially the configuration of Webtop is quite cumbersome. The reason for this is that it uses a number of (Baan) software components like OW adapter, ASM, and a web server. We recognized this, and try to help as much as possible by delivering a Diagnostics Tools together with Webtop, and moreover, by improving the configuration proces and administration console significantly in the upcoming Webtop 2.0 release.<br />
<br />
In Webtop 1.1, things have improved. I recommend to install this version and use the documentation for Webtop 1.1. With Webtop 2.0, which will be released around September, we support web deployment, making life a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Webtop (1.0/1.1/2.0) can be run on any web server supporting Java servlets. On IIS, you need to install a separate servlet engine (like e.g. Servlet Exec of NewAtlanta); if you would like to use e.g. WebSphere or iPlanet, the servlet engine is included in this software.<br />
<br />
Support on Webtop 1.0 and 1.1 is partly shared between the Baan Support organization and Baan Development, this might explain your experiences with support issues. <br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please contact Support in the USA first, but also feel free to contact me whenever you want on any Webtop issue.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Reint Jan</div></div><hr />
