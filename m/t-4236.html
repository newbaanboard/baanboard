<br />
I did the script and ran it, and notice that he keeps a log!<br />
<br />
it means the tool print all session the user opened in the past <br />
<br />
and the present and not telling just what he is doing right now<br />
<br />
(like ps in &quot;Start Bshell&quot;).. i.e. I see even sessions/processes<br />
<br />
that the user ended and closed and won't know when <br />
<br />
he open it and if he finished with it.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to do that.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  from the user data template - if you enable the history, you will get the list of all the sessions, used by the users with the time stamping. You can then see the output from -<br />
Tools -&gt; User Management -&gt; Miscellaneous -&gt; Print User History. Make sure to check the size of the TIME.HIS file (which stores the user history). You also have the option to delete user history.<br />
<br />
2. you can use the ps -ef | grep [bshell/user id] - which gives the oracle and unix processes, but does not show the baan sessions which are currently opened by the user.<br />
<br />
3. you can see bshcmd to see the process list including the sessions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Syntax<br />
<br />
long  pstat ( long pid, ref string progname, ref long info(PSMAXSIZE) )<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
This returns status information about a specified process. <br />
<br />
Arguments<br />
<br />
pid	The ID of the process for which you want to retrieve information. Specify a negative value here to retrieve information about the init process.<br />
progname	This returns the process code.<br />
info	This returns status information that you can retrieve with the following macros:ps.state(info)	returns PSRUNNING, PSBLOCKING, PSSLEEPING, or <br />
				PSTERMINATINGps.group(info)	returns the identifier of the process group to which the process <br />
				belongsps.parent(info)  	returns the identifier of the parent process of the process group<br />
Return values<br />
<br />
The process ID of the next process in the internal process list.<br />
<br />
Context<br />
<br />
Bshell function.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
<br />
long     info(PSMAXSIZE)<br />
string   progname(512)<br />
long     procid<br />

while procid &gt; 0<br />
		| process info<br />
		procid = pstat( procid, progname, info )<br />

this is equivalent to the output, from the start shell and using the ps command.</div></div><hr />

Well, pstat is a great function, but it only gives me the process status of the bshell running it and not for other bshells in the system...<br />

<br />
Firstly, I am not clear by your idea/intention of that kind of a program/utility.<br />
<br />
if you need to check the other bshells and their processes etc, you have to use the unix shell scripting than baan tools to do that.<br />
<br />
you basically need to -<br />
<br />
ps -ef | grep bshell <br />
# get all the bshells on the Unix system and even of different environments.<br />
<br />
then redirect each of this output to the ps -ef or a pswalk (process walk utility on the HP-Unix) to get the various subprocesses associated with the bshell connection.<br />
<br />
This might need some good shell scripting and awk usage.<br />
<br />
Just an idea for you to start with....<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bamnsour</div><div class="date">21st May 2002, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi NPRao,<br />
<br />
What I want to do is to know every sessions that is running on the system.<br />
<br />
ps -ef will give me the process id of each bshell.<br />
<br />
(With NT, you try the freeware ps.exe and link it with licmon as posted in another thread)<br />
<br />
Then, I want to see the sessions that each bshell is running. I tried bshcmd, but it gives sessions that were already closed.<br />
<br />
This is my problem for now  <br />

<br />
I got ur idea for the program, but didnt get whats the purpose for making such kind of a program.<br />
<br />
also refer to the sessions used by the bshell in another posting, <br />
<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1936<br />
<br />
you can customize it removing a grep for the session tracking.<br />
<br />
you need to use only -<br />
<br />
bshcmd6.2 -s -p -u5 -w5 $i <br />
<br />
try to reduce the time interval, but 5 seconds is Ok... <br />
<br />
if you are trying to make a LIVE process monitoring tool, then you surely will have a few seconds delay in any kind of tool.<br />
<br />
I dont know which version of BaaN are you using. If you are on one of the latest versions, try to check the prototypes of the session, ttgbfprocess.<br />
<br />
I think you might need to also investigate a bit more into the bms functions, which is used for the Interprocess communication <br />
(bshell). <br />
<br />
I checked once that session gbfbrowser is open, even if I opened other sessions, it shows up on that the browser, and when I exited the sessions, it disappeared from the list. <br />
<br />
Logically, I think that program might be associated with the parent process of a connection and gets all the child processes, and is refresh when any message broadcast to the parent process id.<br />
<br />
This is something new idea for a monitoring tool. Maybe you can develop and let us know how and where it goes...<br />
<br />
Good Luck!!!<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">21st May 2002, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Addition...<br />
<br />
If you have an older version of BaaN-5 series than the Baan-5.2 as me, you might find that the gbf modules are in the tg, they are moved into tt now with the 5.2 version, so you might get to look into the source code, and get more ideas... <br />
<br />
also, I found a include, called bic_process in the $BSE/include6.2 on our server. But I dont know the available functions inside it.</div></div><hr />
