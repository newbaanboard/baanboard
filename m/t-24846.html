I don't see this problem in Baan IV anywhere, I work a lot with Hours Accounting - certainly don't know every screen in Baan - is it somewhere else this is doing it?<br />
<br />
In LN I have that issue.  But it's coming up as 12:00:00 AM, which is basically the same, as stored in the database, as 00:00:00.   I don't know where that's setup or if it's possible to change that - <br />
<br />
Let us know where you are seeing that - what session / Baan version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mozkiller</div><div class="date">17th August 2005, 20:58</div></div><div class="posttext">This is an issue related to Baan V.<br />
<br />
For Baan V we have the dates as UTC dates (date and time), right?!<br />
<br />
Just for example, imagine any session where you have a date field (domain tc.date) and this field has no default value (it is empty). This kind of information requires the date and the time. Once you enter with the value for form field &quot;date&quot;, the other form field &quot;time&quot; receives 00:00. The users are complaining that before the last update, this value for form field time used to be 12:00 instead of 00:00 as it is now.<br />
<br />
Just remember that domain tc.date is a value in seconds (since 00:00 01-01-1970) that is showed in form as two different fields date and time.<br />
<br />
So, Did I get to explain better???<br />
<br />
Thanks for your attention!!!!</div></div><hr />
