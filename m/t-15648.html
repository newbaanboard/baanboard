<br />
Does anyone of you know if there is somewhere a working interface between BaanIV and Microsoft Project. <br />
<br />
Or, maybe, another softwarepackage which can be used as graphical planboard and which has a customized interface with BaanIV.<br />
<br />

<br />
I believe there is already an interface available between BAAN IV Project and MS Project. I have to check around but I am pretty sure there are customers out there that have implemented this already.<br />
<br />
Another working solutions is Open Plan Professional from Welcom (www.welcom.com). They have a working interface with BAAN IV for sure but are a bit on the expensive side.<br />
<br />
You can also get in touch with BAAN Support and ask them what interfaces they have and, potentially, support between an external planning package and BAAN IV.<br />
<br />
If you need more help with this let me know.<br />
<br />

Thanks for your reaction. It has to be an interface between the pcs-module and Microsoft Project.<br />
<br />
When you know a working version of this please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
As far as I know only interfaces exist between BAAN Project (tp) and external planning packages.<br />
I have been involved with BAAN for more than 8 years and have not yet seen any existing interfaces between tipcs projects and external planning packages. <br />
My suggestion is to pick the best one and face the fact that you will be the first ever doing this.<br />
<br />
