<br />
1. Does the Chinese version of Baan allow both English and Chinese interface depending on the language attached to the user. Meaning, can I see the Baan menu and sessions both in English and Chinese?<br />
 <br />
2. Does the Chinese version of Baan have an interface or link to the Government invoicing system (the system needed to print Fa piao)? If not how are companies using Baan transferring the invoicing information from Baan to Fa piao?<br />
 <br />
3. What is the process for obtaining the approval from local authorities once the Baan system is implemented? Do we have to keep our old system and Baan running parallel until Baan is approved? <br />
 <br />
4. I understand that the Chart of accounts have to be in a certain specific coding in China. How is this handled in Baan? Is the Legal ledger field sufficient for this or does the localization have additional fields for this information?</div></div><hr />

1. Yes, baan4c4 is implemeneted in china with chinese and english interfaces<br />
2. I dont know the name but i heard there is a statutory application (for finance for tax purposes?), which needs to be used by all chinese companies. Yes, baan has an interface with that already.<br />
Note: I heard that chinese govt. is planned (or already passed the law) to remove the compulsion of using that statutory appln.<br />
3. I dont know about this.<br />
4. I guess this can be handled in standard itself. Pl let me know the specific details.</div></div><hr />
