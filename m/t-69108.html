<br />
Have good day :)<br />
<br />
I just received Crystal Report installer and assigned to produce a stock movement repot . This is new challenge for me and looking forward your advise. Attached screen shot is my goal to produce. <br />
<br />
Currently the report manually prepared by user and this report will help them. <br />
<br />
I can produce report which display line by line and for specific purpose for example : Receipt of the month. <br />
<br />
I need to polish the skill to produce report as requested by user. As start, I have the list of the table and field to produce this report. Now, im trying to arrange the field as per required but only manage to have specific transaction. Im unable to arrange as user's perspective. Kindly guide me. <br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.. Use subreport in Crystal report<br />
2.. Create view at database level to group it as required and use this view in crystal report</div></div><hr />
