I have worked on BaaN IV c4 , in that we have the option to Edit or View the Program Script, but in BaaN V we have the option to open script only in Edit mode, anybody knows why view has been not provided in baaN V ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">5th November 2004, 19:20</div></div><div class="posttext">It's kind of misleading.  You only have 1 button to open the script, but it puts it in read only mode if your PVRC is not the same and / or whatever else it decides that on.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately you are not notified of that when you come in, at least not in all editors.  I use GVIM, and when I come in in read only mode I notice on the bottom when I open the file, it gives the file name, and the tag 'readonly'.  If I try to edit, at the bottom it gives me a warning that I am in read only mode.  If I try to save, it tells me no, I'm in read only.  I think that would depend on your editor, though, so I think this is not the greatest feature in the world, we would rather know clearly when we enter, like in Baan IV.  I think in notepad it does not say much, just exits and does not save, which is horrible.  I would suggest getting GVIM (it's freeware) or some  similar real code editor if you are having a lot of problems.<br />
<br />
One trick, if you find after making changes that you are in read only mode, instead of exiting and redoing, try Select All, and copy to the clipboard.  Then come back in in edit mode, Select All, delete, and paste your updated script from the clipboard.  Of course, be careful with that delete!!!  Make sure you have the full script replaced before you save.</div></div><hr />

In that way, when I open a script which is just ready only, the background is yellow (or whatever color you want to change to). If the script is editable, the background is white. In that way, I can clear see whether I can edit a script or not.</div></div><hr />

Thanks . that solved my doubt with respect to edit/view for Program Script.<br />
<br />
One more small doubt which i have is in BaaN IV we use to have Form 1 attached to Maintain Sessions ( ttadv2100m000 ) which use to tell that how many forms/ Reports have been attached to a session, but in BaaN V this is not the case ???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">8th November 2004, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">You can attach and refer to forms like in Baan IV, Form 1, Form 2 etc.  You care given more flexibility on naming them, so they are not named that when the user pulls them up, but you still refer to them as form.1 and form.2, according to the Form Number on the Maintain Form's screen (as zoomed to from Sessions).<br />
<br />
You may be getting the dynamic forms?  When you generate sessions, is the 'Dynamic' checked?  That's a different concept, and very nice, but not supported in the BI interface, and Baan development does not use them much, I try to stay away from those.  If so, uncheck dynamic when generating and maybe this will but you back in familiar territory.<br />
<br />
** Edited **<br />
O, I see, you mean the views on form 1 of maintain sessions that take you to the displays only screens of the attached forms/reports.  Your right, it's gone.  You went to a separate session anyway, so they just take you right to the forms / reports sessions and you can see there.  You can add forms or reports to that session using the specific drop downs now - the 'Link Form to Session' or report.</div></div><hr />
