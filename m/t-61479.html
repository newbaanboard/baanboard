<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chornfeldt</div><div class="date">16th November 2011, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">This morning our Baan server License server will not start. It is complaining it is missing 7 xml files from the <br />
C:\Program Files\baan\shared\bclm\1\6005\server <br />
folder. I have done a search on the server for any xml files matching the ones it is complaining about but have not found them.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Can anyone tell me what these files are?<br />
<br />
<br />
I will go ahead and state I have 0 idea how to use or support Baan. This is a server that I inherited in an aquisition and the data was used for archive purposes and invoice reprints only. All personel who supported this system are no longer with the company so I will give as much information as I can but, I have little information about this server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it possible to restore them from a backup?<br />
<br />
If not it's probably the most easiest to install it once again and to configure the license again. On www.infor365.com, solution 22881484 contains the lastest version of SLM.<br />

If I go the install SLM route, is there a master license file that lets me know the number of users etc that are named for each version if so where in the program would I find that? Or is this something I would need to call infor to get?</div></div><hr />

The can tell you where to find the documentation as well.</div></div><hr />
