<br />
I am not able to delete item from tcibd001.item. I used the below script and checked in all the tables resulting from the script and i am sure there is no record in any of  the tables containing the said item<br />
<br />
pack = &quot;tc&quot;<br />
modu = &quot;ibd&quot;<br />
tabl = &quot;001&quot;<br />
	<br />
	select	ttadv422.*<br />
	from	ttadv422<br />
	where	ttadv422._compnr = 000<br />
	and	ttadv422._index5 = {:pack,:modu,:tabl}<br />
	selectdo<br />
		if ttadv422.rffd=&quot;item    &quot; then<br />
			report.data =	ttadv422.cpac &amp; sepa &amp;<br />
					ttadv422.cmod &amp; sepa &amp;<br />
					ttadv422.flno<br />
			rprt_send()<br />
		endif<br />
	endselect<br />
when i try to delete it through the famous GTM(i.e. ttaad4100), it is giving me this error :<br />
Error 605:Cannot deleter record because reference exists) on tcibd001100 in db_delete. Specificaition:[There are still references for this table(tcibd001.item-&gt;tcid001.item;'         Itemabc'<br />
<br />
is it not possible to delete an item once it is created?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">You should probably try to delete throught the Maintain Items session in Baan.  It is possible that the delete section will check for other tables and delete from them, or at least let you know why it can't.  Of course, it may give you the same error, but best to do it there.<br />
<br />
This should be a rule of thumb, to not use GTM for deleting unless absolutely necessary to correct data.  <br />
<br />
For instance, pretty sure in Baan IV you have some connection from tiitm001 to tiitm100, that may be causing the problem but the session routine would handle that.   Your reference script I have not used so, not sure what it's giving you.<br />
<br />
And - you can delete items, but not if they have been used anywhere.  Like..sales orders, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">forsms2002</div><div class="date">2nd December 2003, 05:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I am doing all this, as I am not able to delete the item from tcibd0501m000 (General Item Data).<br />
Whenever I am trying to delete it gives me a message &quot;Unable to delete;record being used in other table&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">2nd December 2003, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you try checking the logs to see if they give you the table name?   Check any logs that were updated during your process.  Or, you can try database tracing which writes a log file of the sql, that should/may give you what table it's failing on..<br />
<br />
Here are 2 excellent links that walk you through how to do that:<br />
<br />
Link 1 (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1068&amp;highlight=database+tracing) <br />
<br />
Link 2 - the full guide (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7665&amp;highlight=database+tracing) <br />
<br />
Hope that helps - the reference to tcibd001 could be anywhere I guess.  Post back the results if you have time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please check through session &quot;Print References To Parent&quot; ttaad4229m000 (Baan V Tools/Database Management/Miscellaneous).<br />
<br />
This session is very helpfull.<br />
