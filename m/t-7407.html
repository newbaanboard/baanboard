The aim would be to be able to view the invoice for a certain order without having to go and dig it out of the cupboard ...</div></div><hr />

theres a new product called document management which enables you to attach any file you please to any baan record<br />
e.g. you may attach an item picture to an item data (or of course a pdf file...)<br />
you can reach me at yuvalf@newapplicom.co.il<br />
or ilansui@newapplicom.co.il<br />

So for an item you know to launch word with a file out on the server.  You could do it yourself, but it would require some work and discipline from the users.<br />

<br />
Can you please guide me how to do this.<br />

<br />
We keep Material Safety Data Sheets on all items in our system.  They are PDF documents that are stored in a document library (just a series of directories and subdirectories on the server).  I used the otgbrg0019 DLL to invoke the file browser that can access this document library and anybody that has access to Baan can view them.  <br />
<br />
They access the file browser, select the document they want, the file is copied to their local machine, and then you execute the file.  Since the file is associated with Adobe Acrobat, Acrobat opens up with the PDF file.<br />
<br />
We're Unix O/S with Baan 4c4 and the clients have various Windows O/S.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th October 2002, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">The steps sound easy, but I have not done it. Also I expect that you are familiar with tools arena.<br />
<br />
(1) Decide on where the documents are going to reside and how they will be named.  In my example I am going to use the Maintain Standard Item.  So each item would have a file named &lt;item&gt;.pdf.<br />
<br />
(2) Add a new button to the form.<br />
<br />
(3) In the code for this session - when the click the button it does app_start or run.prog. The command depends on where you put the files and the type of system. You would know which file to open because you just concatenate the item number with &quot;.pdf&quot;.<br />
<br />
That is all there is to it.  Basically it is what Eddie Monster described.  You can see examples of some of the coding by looking at the Code and Utilities forum.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bilbo Baggins</div><div class="date">30th October 2002, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a question (I'm a bit of a newbie!) ...<br />
<br />
How do you &quot;add a button to the form&quot; - and what is the &quot;form&quot; - is it the session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 18:14</div></div><div class="posttext">It is easy enough to add buttons.  In the maintain forms session(ttadv3100m000) session you first set up the special options.  Then you click on buttons and add what you set up in the special options.  Next in the code of the session you would add something like choice.user.0 section.  In the on.choice section add the code to launch the application with the file.<br />
<br />
You may want to start making use of the tools forum - you will probably get quicker answers to some of your questions. Plus you will not have to rely on me answering - sometimes I miss posts in other forums.<br />

Good Luck!<br />
