<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">10th May 2012, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have edited an existing form that accesses tdsls100 and want to show a value form tdsls900 ( custom text table )<br />
<br />
Both tables contain the same Index qono ( quotation Number ) ..<br />
<br />
I added in the tdsls900.txtz field i want to show cia the DFE.<br />
<br />
Under the Properties &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; tab I put in an Input/Ref. Expression that I hoped would make the connection between my sls100 and sls900 table for a matching quotation number.<br />
<br />
I tried many variations but figured that the expression would need to be something like tdsls900.qono = tdsls100.qono.<br />
<br />
I get a blank box appear on the screen.  Am I going about this the right way or so I need more scripting somewhere to tighten up the table relationship with a select stmt or something ?<br />
<br />
<br />
I should also add that I am trying to see a text field  of type txtn.  If I want to see the value of tdsls900.qono that seems to work OK. It is maybe text related issue .....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance ....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am able to show fields from other tables in my session, just not txt type fields, they come up blank for some reason...</div></div><hr />
