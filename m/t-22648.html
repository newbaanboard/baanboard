Everything is working perfectly except on about 50% of machines accessing webtop i get the following error just after logging in :  &quot;could not load: class com.baan.bfe.webtop.client.widgets.ie.TabWidget$TabStrip$TabStripItems&quot;<br />
<br />
All the clients are running IE 6, with the Microsoft JVM<br />

Indeed, the next version of Webtop (Webtop 4.0) will be independent of both the MS JVM and IE. Instead Webtop 4.0 can be run on any platform and browser that supports Java. The problem with Windows XP SP2 will also be solved in this version. Furthermore, Webtop 4.0 will be much faster than its predecessors. Webtop 4.0 will be available at the end of this quarter.  :)</div></div><hr />
