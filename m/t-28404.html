I have to rename an article number in tiitm001 and I want to know where it is being used. I have tried session ttaad4229m000 but it is not showing everything. I'm sure that the article I want to rename also is present is table tdpur051 but that's not what session ttaad4229m000 is showing me.<br />
<br />
Is there an other way??? :)</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
if sure that domain used for article (tcitem) is only used for itemcode, session<br />
ttadv4410m000 &quot;print where used domains&quot; will show you all tablefields, where this domain is used.<br />
<br />
Because item is used not only in the above tables , it's used in e.g.<br />
tdilc , tdinv , ticpr tables a.s.o.<br />
based on your baan parameters.<br />
<br />
