Everything looks nice, but when I try to configure my first connection, I get an error window saying something like &quot;error: bwc.dll not found; hint: configuration is only available, if a BaanV is installed&quot;.<br />
<br />
wtError.log contains:<br />
16:18 06-06-2003 Error 043 : CLSIDFromString failed. <br />
&lt;params: &gt;<br />
<br />
16:18 06-06-2003 Error 001 : Baan Automation not registered correctly. <br />
<br />
16:18 06-06-2003 Error 014 : Could not find Baan.Configuration in registry. <br />
<br />

<br />
For Worktop you will also need to have BW installed. And you also need to create the BWC files as you were used to using BW. After that, you will see the configuration files in Worktop and can select them while creating a new Worktop document. <br />
Note that Worktop supports central deployment, which means that using Worktop you do not necessarily have to install Worktop and BW on all clients. Instead you can share one centralized installation.<br />
<br />

Keep a  thread to a singular topic please. We don't want all Worktop issues to be concentrated in one single thread. Thanks!</div></div><hr />
