<br />
Yes, Worktop 2.2 is available on BaanIVc4. Officially, you need Service pack 9, but you can already make it work on SP7 with some additional PMC solutions.<br />
Worktop is a new User Interface on top of ERP, replacing the old menu browser, desktop manager, DEM browser, process viewer and BDN toolbar. It also hosts an internet browser, keeps an history of recently performed actions and supports central deployment.<br />
So basically, it's an extended interface for BaanIVc4 (as well as for 5.0c, 5.2a and 6.0). If you need more info; just ask me.<br />
<br />

I thought WorkTop just is an interface over the bw interface?<br />
<br />
There also seems to be a dependency towards portingset 6.1c.06.05 or higher to have Worktop working with the DEM browser.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I indeed said &quot;replacing the menu browser&quot;, not the BW client. So indeed, you still need a BW installation. However if you run centrally deployed you only have to install it once on the Worktop server.<br />
There is also a dependency with the porting set version. By coincidence i'm just checking if we can make Worktop available on older versions of the Porting Set. If that is possible, the next Worktop version (2.2.25) will probably already support this.<br />

<br />
Regarding that rumour; that's simply not true. Baan will continue to support it now and in the future. Since you can't use BW anymore on 5.2a and later Baan versions, Baan simply has no choice.<br />
However, what you might have heard is that Baan is focussing on Webtop (Web based version of Worktop) as the primary user interface. But that doesn't mean that Worktop will not be supported anymore. For some particular user roles (modelers, programmers) a Windows interface is still preferred over a web based interface.<br />

<br />
We've been wanting to use Worktop ever since we moved to B5c beginning of this year. Our problem was that it doesn't do as good job as DEM browser in term of decluttering the menu. If a user didn't have access to a certain part of the business process diagram, that part wouldn't appear in DEM browser, but would still appear in Worktop. If this can be solved, we'd certainly use Worktop instead of DEM browser. Anything we have to set to get the same decluttering feature?<br />
<br />
Also, in its early age (Worktop 1.x), we encountered problem whereby if a user used Worktop to connect to our B5c server, the user would have unreliable connection. This would not be observed if the user connected using Menu browser/Desktop Manager/DEM browser. Baan Support said back then that it would be fixed with a later version/porting set<br />

<br />
I think what you mean with &quot;decluttering&quot; the menu is just an option in Worktop; the option is called &quot;Only main process&quot; (in the View-&gt;Tree menu) which is by default off. The same option is available in the DEM browser and when you enabled it in the DEM browser but disable it in Worktop, that explains the difference.<br />
Anyway, as I said before Worktop replaces the DEM browser on 5.2a and later completely and therefore any functionality that was available in the old DEM browser is also available in Worktop 2.2 now. <br />
If you have any additional Worktop related questions or want more information about the cluttering issue, please ask.<br />
<br />
Regarding the problems you had with Worktop 1.x; 1.0 was released a long time ago so i would recommend to try 2.2 instead.<br />
<br />

I've tried the &quot;Only main process&quot; option you mentioned but it still doesn't declutter it. Pls refer to the attached pictures. Pls note there that the menu for the purchasing staff was decluttered properly in DMB, but full menu still appearing in Worktop. The person still can't access what she's not supposed to access in Worktop, but the cluttered menu is intimidating :) . Thanks for your help. BTW, the worktop is 2.2.21<br />
