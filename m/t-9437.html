Baan continues to remain focused on delivering services and tools intended to improve the performance of its manufacturing customer base. As part of Baan's 'Measure Up' campaign, the Invensys business unit has released the iBaan Diagnostic Analyzer, a tool to help identify potential bottlenecks in the performance of manufacturing systems.<br />
Companies have invested in their enterprise backbones; now it's time to measure the effectiveness of their processes by examining the underlying technology supporting them. The iBaan Diagnostic Analyzer is a step toward bridging the gap between the data and transactions maintained within enterprise applications and meaningful business metrics. Through the measurement of these metrics, companies will be able to enact improvements as needed.<br />
<br />
Most competitors have undertaken similar steps to become more than an application developer to their customer base, yet none is as focused on discrete manufacturing as Baan is.</div></div><hr />
