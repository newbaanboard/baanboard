To put it in a different way, what are the options to set up Baan<br />

The reasons are limitation of space and shopfloor environments.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I did read about citrix clients being an option.<br />
I also have a fair idea about the general thin client concept.<br />
I was wondering if Baan Worktop / any specific Baan components<br />
are needed on these thin clients other than the regular baan client.<br />
Now that you mentioned citrix clients,what are the necessary<br />
components here?any cost formula based on terminals? any<br />
special networking changes/additions?<br />
your inputs are appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are currently testing solution for the same requirements; thin client for warehouses and shop floor. Our test system uses Win2K server terminal service and WinCE based thin client. We separate the terminal server from our Baan server but connect them to the same switch. We simply install B5c client on the Win2k terminal server and running Menu browser or DEM browser on the thin client is no problem. No need for extra software. Everything runs just as if it's a normal thick client<br />
<br />
However, we decided that both the B5c browser might be too complicated for WH and shop floor personnel here and are developing our own middleware<br />

 Thanks for the information.<br />
 It is Good to know about a similar situation you are resolving<br />
 through the extra client server configuration.Is it necessary to <br />
have the win server instead of connecting to the Baan server<br />
directly.If not what are the major plusses by doing so.<br />
we are on Baan4c4 and hope the thin client enabling is no major<br />
issue on 4c4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We separate the 2 servers because both require high power servers, especially since we're going to replace most of our Wintel boxes in the company with thin clients in the near future. If you only have thin clients coming from WH/shop floor, then you can probably just crowd them in the same Baan server box, as long as there aren't too many of them (below 10?)<br />

<br />
Could you please clarify your remark about the 5c browser to be too complicated?<br />
<br />
we decided that both the B5c browser might be too complicated for WH and shop floor personnel here and are developing our own middleware <br />
<br />
I would like to know more about this since i'm involved in usability of the Baan's User Interfaces. Your feedback can be of valuable input for us...<br />
<br />
regards, Ivo</div></div><hr />
