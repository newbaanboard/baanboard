I install Baan B40C.73 client, I set everything up and I can access the databases with no problem.<br />
In order to get access to diffetent companies with in Baan I install the worktop 2.2.32 and here is where the problem arises.<br />
I install the application and I suppose to be allowed to create different configurations within worktop, so the users don't need to change companies manually. But I can't, it always defaults to the same company and eventhough I save the changes, it always shows the same company number. Do you have any idea? I am new installing this application, and so far nobody has given me any solution.<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried putting in the following command in the command option of your BW:<br />
<br />
-set PACKAGE_COMB=&lt;package combo&gt; -set BSE_COMPNR=&lt;comp#&gt;<br />
<br />
The package combo is only needed if the package combination differ from what the user has in their u file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you don't need worktop to allow users to have different default company configurations. just use the variables in jaotto's post in your BW.<br />
