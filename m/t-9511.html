In a very depressed market, Baan Italy has signed 4 new names in the last Quarter. Two of them were signed because of  features in Baan Dimension, an area where we have practically no functional competition. With the ability of our direct and indirect sales force and the competitive advantage of our product suites we achieved a superb result, especially in the context of the current economy.  Baan Italy wants to say Thank you to all the people that gave their time and experience to achieve this result !!!</div></div><hr />
