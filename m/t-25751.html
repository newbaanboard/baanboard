How do you handle first processing a cost invoice (doesn't have to go through Order Management) for miscellaneous services or cost disbursements, and then commingling those purchase invoices into a sales invoice to be recharged back to a customer (possibly with a additional fee for handling).  I would rather not set up a project for each client. Ideally, you would have the purchase history &amp; linkage.  :confused: <br />
This is for ERP LN 6.1 FP1. <br />
Thanks heaps!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KazinOz</div><div class="date">9th February 2006, 01:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi folks, FYI, the following solutions can work:<br />
Set up the project or service, and in Finance - Chart of account, under the Miscellaneous tab, set the integration indicator to e.g. Project Costs for an expense (P&amp;L) account (but don't switch on the integration flag). <br />
You need to set up the sundry cost item in Project (as well as the element, activity, etc).<br />
During data entry in GL, when you choose that account, after putting the amount in, the Project Sundry Costs session tpppc25911m000 will pop up, and you can enter in your costs.  <br />
Finalise the journal as per normal in Finance, then go to Project module, and approve the Project costs. <br />
If, for example, you set the project up as being cost plus, then go to Sundry Cost transactions to be invoiced tppin4561m000 and release to Central Invoicing.  <br />
That cost can then be included onto an invoice via standard Central Invoicing.<br />
I would appreciate any other suggestions of how to do this, without having to set up Projects or Service!</div></div><hr />
