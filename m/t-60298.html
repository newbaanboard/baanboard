<br />
I have maintained the maintenance concept for an item and generated predicted activities. But after running generate maintenance plan, I am unable to generate the planned activities.<br />
<br />
Please can anyone let me know the checks and setups in case I have missed out, for doing the same.<br />
<br />
Also does anybody have a real-time document of the process steps for Service-Preventive Maintenance.</div></div><hr />

Check following fields in following sessions,<br />
<br />
1. whether same usage class is defined on the cluster or not.<br />
2. Make sure the planned until date and time is not defined for the periods you are trying to generate activities. if it is defined, make it blank or modify from cluster lines (if it is FP2. if it is FP7, it can be done from serialized items itself)<br />
<br />
Hope it will resolve your problem<br />
