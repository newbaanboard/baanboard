<br />
Using Business Studio, following are the steps which i have executed<br />
1. Create Business Interface Definition and Business Interface Implementation.<br />
2. Generate ERPLN Implementation for the BID and BII created above in step 1.<br />
3. Test the Interface generated in step 2 - Result is that the correct functionality is present.<br />
4. Make some change to the Business Interface Definition and Business Interface Implementation.<br />
5. Generate ERPLN Implementation for the BID and BII created above in step.<br />
6. Test the Interface generated in step 5 - Result is that the new changes made in step 4 is not visible.<br />
7. Close Business Studio and once again Start Business.<br />
8. Test the Interface generated in step 5 - The new changes made in step 4 are now visible.<br />
<br />
Is there any setting/way whereby we do not need to logout of Business Studio everytime we Generate new ERPLN Implementation.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,<br />
Fred.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you give a bit more details?<br />
<br />
* How do you test the generated implementation? With the Business Studio test possibilities?<br />
* What kind of changes do you make to the implementation which are not visible unless restarting BS?<br />
<br />

<br />
I have tried to make WarehousingOrder BDE through Business Studio Eclipse. session (whinh2100m000_whinh2100m100). Initially it was not allowing to implement the BDE as it was saying that there is a BDE for the session already exists. So i replaced the name of the BDE which i created to WarehousingOrders (the same name as of already existing BDE). So the Implementation was successful . But when i tested, I am getting the error,<br />
<br />
'UnknownObject: Object 'WarehousingOrders' doesn't have an implementation (public library)'<br />
<br />
Please help me in this . What i have to do to implement the customized BDE for Warehousing Orders?<br />
<br />
Looking for urgent support pls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends on what you want to customize.<br />
<br />
If you want to make a customized version of the WarehousingOrder BDE you can use the following steps:<br />
<br />
* Import the standard BDE from the backend via the Business Interface from Runtime Repository importer. The result will be a linked library in your project.<br />
* Open the library in the interface explorer and search for the business interface implementation<br />
* Right click on the interface implementation and choose specialize, use the same name as the standard. The result is a interface implementation in your project which you can customize.<br />
* You can generate code for this implementation.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you for your reply... and it is working fine. <br />
<br />
Now i would like to ask about another thing regarding the Purchase Order Line BDE implementation . I created the Implementation for the Purchase Order Lines but when I compile it , I got these error as below, <br />
<br />
ptdpurbl901st000(1490): Error: Dimensions in array assignment differs: 1:0<br />
ptdpurbl901st000(1491): Error: 'afs_retval' not declared<br />

ptdpurbl901st000(2375): Error: Unresolved reference to function 'get.afs.fieldarray'.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it is because of the data type which is an field array. <br />
<br />
Please help me to sort out this issue.  Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been confirmed by the developer as a bug in the AFS code generation templates. To deliver a fix for this we need an incident being reported in Infor Xtreme. Can you log this? It would be very helpfull when you include an export of you Business Interface.<br />
<br />
By the way, why are you extending an existing standard BDE with a form integration (resulting in AFS code)? Is there a good reason to do this instead of linking a table?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rashna</div><div class="date">28th January 2014, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, We have some local (external) applications like Purchase Order , Sales Order etc which are customized as per our company needs. So at the final stage of the Purchase Order Applciation, we need to upload the data into the LN Purchase Order table. I have to the same for almost all modules in LN like Item Creation,  PUrchase Order , Sales Order , Warehousing Orders Adjustment Order etc.<br />
<br />
And in Item Creation , actually i need to copy an exisiting item data into a new item code with all data. But i could not customize the 'Copy Item Data' session (tcibd0205m000). Error coming as 'Command disabled'. So that i need to do create sessions for all like Item Master, BOMs, Item Sales Data, Item Purchase, Item Costing, Item Planning etc etc.  That is also a problem .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rashna</div><div class="date">28th January 2014, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I have log a case with infor regarding the above error. Waiting for the reply .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rashna</div><div class="date">29th January 2014, 08:07</div></div><div class="posttext">See the below which I got reply from infor regarding the data type, But i dont understand what they mean, beacause for LineDiscount already I have the datatype as  tcdisc_depth11, they are telling to assign the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;You need to assign a datatype that has dimensions for these variables in business studio. Like for lineDiscount you can assign tcdisc_depth11. If you observe tcdisc is the domain associated with the lineDiscount field in LN and it has depth 11 so the new datatype in business studio will be tcdisc_depth11.<br />
Similarly you will have to handle other variables too. &quot;</div></div><hr />
