If you have the tools module you can at least look up tables and maybe see what they have for setup information.  In our company that would not give you enough information to connect into the database to even read tables.  Now what I could do is get enough information to use to connect into baan with the client (when you configure it there is an automation tab) and run sessions thru something like excel or VB.  You can search this forum  http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/forumdisplay.php?f=59 for OLE and information around that.  But that was even more cumbersome to me than the client itself. It might work better for you, but I no longer even look at it.  <br />
<br />
Also if you log into baan using the client and bring up a session usually you can hit the help button and click on field to see its name.  Without the tools module I am not sure how you could look up the tables see what is available and how they all link together.  Someone else might have a better idea on how to poke around and see what is out there.</div></div><hr />

I tried query on dtssoc210.orno but you point it it's in fact tssoc210.orno ! So it works but it doesn't qive me all tables.. you know this table's name are they all common ? I don't know what kind of database it is ! I've got no other tools.. just bw.exe and i would like to extract all data from my session tssocc511m000 just to make a webui !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th May 2017, 07:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure - but in 4c4 I know I could query table ttadv420 in company 000 to get the table names - not sure that would help you.  Then I could query ttadv422 to get the field for that table, or ttadv421 to get the index columns.  I am not sure about LN or if you can even get to tables like that.  On our unix systems I can shell out and run like bic_info6.1 on a session to get more information - not sure that is available to you.  Once upon a time I had a tool that did something like this from Gfasbender - not sure if another company has tool like that or not.</div></div><hr />

So i tried : <br />
Set BaanObj = CreateObject(&quot;Baan.Application.default&quot;) <br />
Query = &quot;select ttadv420&quot;<br />
B_function = &quot;olesql_parse(&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; Query &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;)&quot;<br />
BaanObj.ParseExecFunction &quot;ottdllsql_query&quot;, B_function<br />
query_id = BaanObj.ReturnValue<br />
<br />
B_function = &quot;olesql_fetch(&quot; &amp; query_id &amp; &quot;)&quot;<br />
BaanObj.ParseExecFunction &quot;ottdllsql_query&quot;, B_function<br />
Wscript.Echo BaanObj.ReturnValue<br />
But olesql_fetch return -1 ??</div></div><hr />
