Since we're awaiting a license check by Infor and the last one has been done years ago, some things are unclear:<br />
<br />
1) Is the procedure still done by 'Smart Audit'?<br />
2) How does the software recognize whether program sources are used or not? Last time our system has been checked we've been told that sources were found. This was only partial true because some were left on the system by SSA's support and some even didn't exist physically (recognized by objects which were generated by compiling sources?).<br />
3) How does the software recognize how many licenses are in use (concurrent user model)?<br />

<br />
We recently had an audit on our system. I can supply with the info below.<br />
<br />
1.) Yes, Smart Audit is still used.<br />
2.) The programs are checked on compilation date, so if you recently modified a standard programs and you official have no source codes available you might have a problem. This means, you can remove sources codes but from the last compilation date can still be retrieved from the objects.<br />
3. The users available in the Baan user table ( tools ) are scanned, afterwards the Smart Audit check during a period of six weeks which users are active. Times, number of logons, used sessions etc. are monitored.<br />
<br />
After the audit the audit team might ask you for explanations for issues found on your system, f.i. unknow softwarecomponents or source codes found. Source codes can be distributed by Baan Support self when importing solutions, you mentioned this yourself already.  The audit team supplies you with detailed informtion about the audit results after the audit.<br />

Thanks a lot for the information. The compilation date shouldn't be a problem as the objects were generated by external partners. Those external partners have legally obtained the sources and are allowed to modify and compile the sources. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions how to find any forgotten sources? I guess only the application directory will be scanned...<br />

gern geschehen :-)<br />
<br />
About tracking the forgotten sources, refering to the stated OS in your profile 'Solaris' is assume you're on a Unix box. I used the Unix find command to scan the $BSE/application directory.  You can simply move the sources found into a temporary directory as it will not have any effect on the working of your application.  <br />

<br />
The find command is a good idea. We will check if there are any left sources  and remove the files - what about the source directories?<br />
