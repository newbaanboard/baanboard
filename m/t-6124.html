&quot;There is no need to install Tools and Applications at the same time, although you are advised to install both at the same time. If needed, you can choose to install Applications at a different time than the Tools.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I have to admit, it took me a few times to get to grips with what they meant! Is this unique or have any other users come across problems with other Baan manuals?</div></div><hr />

&quot;I am not sure what is going to happen, you are on your own.  Good Luck&quot;</div></div><hr />
