<br />
We have BaaN IVC4 SP7 and Porting set is 6.1c.03<br />
<br />
Can I have worktop2.2 on this setup?<br />
<br />
What solutions I need to install so that it works. I don't want to put SP8 and SP9 as of now.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the screenshots i cannot tell you what's wrong, but one thing is for sure; it cannot be a 'functional gap'. As i said before, Worktop provides the same functionality as the old DMB does. I think we'd better continue this particular case 'offline'. I come back to you on this topic.<br />
<br />

<br />
To make Worktop work on BaanIVc4 SP7, you will need to install the following solutions;<br />
<br />
113744stnd <br />
114517stnd <br />
118130stnd <br />
118548stnd <br />
155701stnd <br />
<br />
There is also a dependency with the porting set. At least 6.1c.05 is required, however i'm just evaluating if it possible to make it work on earlier porting sets. Probably Worktop 2.2.25 or 2.2.26 will also be available on earlier porting sets (like 6.1c.03).<br />
I will post more information over here when i know more on this topic.<br />
<br />

<br />
I aws able to connect from worktop to baan after I loaded the solutions given by you.   :) <br />
If I access worktop tree in &quot;Maintain user data&quot; I am getting a Message  ttaad21014 ???????????<br />
<br />
May be I need to put some more solutions.<br />
<br />
Forgive my ignorance abt worktop, but the end user would enter the data in the same baan session as he was doing. isn't it?<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
The message ttaad21014 is &quot;Worktop not supported by this bshell&quot; which means that the porting set you are using is too old to be able to run Worktop on. I investigated the porting set issue further;<br />
At least porting set 6.1c.06 or later is required for Worktop. This porting set was released in August 2000. So to make everything work correctly, you should update your porting set. Futhermore, the current Worktop version also requires 6.1c.06.05 or later, but probably the next Worktop version will also be available on 6.1c.06.02 or later.<br />
You said before that you are using porting set 6.1c.03, which was released in 1998. I strongly remommend this porting set. <br />
<br />
Regarding the session data entering you mentioned, Worktop is just a navigation framework. Nothing has been changed in the Baan sessions itself, it just provides an easier navigation framework around the sessions and around other navigation metaphors (DEM, BDN) and external applications (Web pages, MS office).<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for that info. I have a test server and hence I cannot put the new porting set as I need to have licenced server in that case.<br />
<br />
You said worktop can host an internet browser. Can you pls. elaborate. Does that mean from my home (or any other place) I can connect to BaaN through worktop(assuming that baan server is at office. Worktop server might be at office or at home) using internet. To put it simple can I connect to baan from home using internet?<br />
<br />
One of my client wants to connect baan through web. Can I suggest worktop?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Ok, well with this old porting set it is possible to use the Menu Browser normally. The only thing you really need the porting set for is for the component authorization. So to be to also see the Dynamic Menu browser and Process Viewer in Worktop, you will need this update. If you just want to have a 'sneek preview' there is one workaround to enable these components. If so, let me know.<br />
<br />
With the web page integration i mean that an internet browser is hosted insight Worktop, not the other way around. So you cannot run Worktop from within a web browser, but Worktop supports 'central deployment' which enables centralized installation and configuration of Worktop. This is very suitable within a LAN network but not over a telephone line. However, you can choose for a centralized configuration and a local installation. In that case you install Worktop and BW locally, but keep the configuration (things like hostname, BSE, username, etc. etc.) centrally.<br />
So there are possibilities but i need more specific information to see if there is a suited solution for your particular case.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot for that Info.<br />
<br />
Can you give more info abt the 'sneak preview'<br />
<br />
I have a test server with 6.1c.03 and I backdate and use it.<br />
I have loaded 6.1c.06 also but with that baan is not getting loaded and it says &quot;You cannot run baan shell any more&quot;. So I reverted to 6.1c.03. I will rename bin and lib diectories accrdingly.<br />
<br />
Now I can connect to baan from worktop  when I use 6.1c.06 but baan sessions doesn't open. Menu will appear. I cannot give worktop auth in Maintain user data because of ttaad21014 Message error. Hence I am unable to see the process.<br />
<br />
I cannot connect to baan from worktop using 6.1c.03.<br />
<br />
