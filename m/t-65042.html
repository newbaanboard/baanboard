The method i am using is that first i will migrate data in tccom136(ZIP/Postal Codes) and then in tccom130(Address).<br />
<br />
I have migrated data in tccom136but facing problem in tccom130 migration.<br />
As we know that in tccom130 we need only four field (Address Code, description, Country Code,and zip code) to save data rest all fields will get their values from zip/postal codes and countries sessions(Time Zone).<br />
<br />
So in my flat file i have only four Fields mentioned above. and i want rest of the data to get populated auomatically.<br />
<br />
How can i do it?</div></div><hr />

You have 2 options, either use an AFS or you can use Exchange Scheme to do it.</div></div><hr />

Have you tried to use &quot;Default&quot; check for those fields and &quot;Update Dependent Fields&quot; in Table Relations Import? You will need to play with that a bit to understand how Ex. Scheme works. If that becomes too complicated, you can do it in Excel as well if you know the correct functions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am also doing the similar process for migrating Work centers. But here I am finding error &quot;tcemms1220 Enterprise Unit not found.&quot; while trying to insert records to tcmcs065. Records are still inserted but they are not taking required finance company as per configured constant in the field mapping. <br />
<br />
Similarly records insertion to tcemm124 is failing with some error but the error text is not available in the log. (probably text is not maintained for this error)<br />
<br />
Could anyone help?</div></div><hr />

Yes i have done that but its was not working, reason as city code is mandatory in tccom130, and i want city code to come from zip postalcode session automatically. So i have used conditions to update city code by passing zip code as parameters. Now its working and updating all the fields.</div></div><hr />

Glad that you solved it. If possible please post the conditions you used to do it, so that if anyone else has the same requirement, it will help them</div></div><hr />

I have used the below mentioned condition in Table Relations(Import) session on city field of TCCOM130, and mentioned  ccty and pstc as parameter in parameters by condition session. <br />
<br />
<br />
table tccom136<br />
table tccom130<br />
domain tccity   ccit<br />
select  tccom136.ccit  from  tccom136 <br />
where tccom136._index1 ={:tccom130.ccty, :tccom130.pstc}<br />
as set with 1 rows<br />
select do<br />
endselect<br />
return(tccom136.ccit)<br />
<br />
Also i have checked use DAL option while uploading</div></div><hr />
