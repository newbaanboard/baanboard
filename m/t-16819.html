<br />
Technical : The migration is easy with no problem (because the evolution is minor)<br />
With the last SP you have the new tools : for example PMC, or in the developpement the AFS<br />
<br />
and for the functional, i think the difference is essentially a set of program corrections<br />
<br />
If i refind my documentation, i send this to you<br />
