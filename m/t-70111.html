It just says ro0cess complete but without any output on the printer.<br />
Display device is working well without any problem.</div></div><hr />

What's your printer Setup for non Display devices?<br />
<br />
We're using windows server printers, which are working fine. <br />
<br />
AFAIK it needs to be server. Normal windows printers do not work, because LNUI can't access a local installed BW client. At least they don't work on our LN 10.5 system when using LNUI. (And LN is giving no error.)<br />
<br />
If you want to use local printers installed in Windows of the client pc, you may also check ttaad3108m000.</div></div><hr />

Hi Vincent,<br />
<br />
But I am not getting the desired output in case of device &quot;D&quot; or &quot;PDF&quot;, as in both of the cases what ever font size I give on field properties,its coming small only.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

We will use printing to D as preview, too. And yes, it's not formatting the output like it's formatted on the printer output.<br />
<br />
My opinion is, Infor is messing the print output up. I do already have an Infor case, due to different output of barcodes. You may want to create your own ticket at Infor support, to let them know, preview printing is messed up.</div></div><hr />

Thanks<br />
PDF device has it's own properties file in $BSE/java. <br />
It is customizable per session or universally.<br />

<br />
Tks for put the case to infor, maybe u have a answer about barcode with Ln UI?<br />
<br />
regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">14th November 2017, 12:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Did open a ticket. Did receive an answer: it's as it is. So no changes happened. Sorry.<br />
<br />
We do have three places where barcodes are created in LN when using LNUI:<br />
- LNUI itself (lnui\web\WEB-INF\lib -&gt; used when creating PDF via D device)<br />
- LN-BSE (LN\bse\java -&gt; used when creating PDF with LN internal PDF printer)<br />
- BWPrint.exe on Print-Server (when using server printers) or on client<br />
<br />
First one can be synchronised by copying PDF.properties. BWprint barcode creation is independent from first to places.<br />
I'm thinking of trying to modify PDF.properties so it almost matches BWPrint output, but didn't not work on barcodes yet. (I'm trying to match &quot;normal&quot; output fist; I've somehow learned of a define in the report script to use monospace fonts in created PDFs again: #define monospace)</div></div><hr />
