<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">5th March 2003, 23:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a very simple exchange scheme for updating the Buyer code in the Item Master. There are no conditions. A very basic and simple exchange scheme.<br />
<br />
I have about 2000 odd records to update and when I run the Exchange Scheme for import, it gives me 20 records out of 2000 records skipped. <br />
<br />
The log file is empty at unix level and even the Display Log table (Batch line level) shows only that 20 records have been skipped.<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can find out which 20 records were skipped ??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mgakhar</div><div class="date">6th March 2003, 01:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Well on scanning the input data, I found 3 items which had &quot;-&quot; at the end of the item code. So obviously the system didnt find these items when trying to update. But shouldnt these items be rejected or shouldnt the system show these records as erroneous ??<br />
<br />
Coz now I will have to go through all the 2000 odd records to see if they have some sort of a typo ....<br />

<br />
We have wriiten numerous exchange schemes and have found that there is NO record log of the records that are considered 'skipped'.  On every occassion we found that the records skipped did not exist when we were updating fields in a table.<br />
<br />
The only way we found this out was by dumping the table and comparing it with the input file on the key fields.<br />
<br />
Short of writing a condition script to see if the record exist prior to updating, I know of no other way to find the 'skipped' records<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some!</div></div><hr />

I seem to recall that when those four flags (Add, Overwrite, Update &amp; Delete) are set to No - any records they force out are not logged.<br />
<br />
If your datafile is just Item and Buyer, you could set the Add flag to yes and then without the rest of the mandatory fields filled, the line should fail due to DB/RI constraints.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jph_tours</div><div class="date">6th March 2003, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">just add a condtion on choice ADD, which contains :<br />
<br />
return(false)<br />
<br />
then no record is added and then the skipped records are inserted in the log file.<br />
<br />
Do the same for delete and overwrite.<br />

Do you have checked the log.bshell and log.[database]? Usually there are further informations about some errors.<br />
