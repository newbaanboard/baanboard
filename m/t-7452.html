<br />
I've been asked to review one of our group sites which runs BaaN IVb2.<br />
<br />
One of the things they claim to be having issues with is the support from Bull, something about the discontinuing support because the site is on an old version !?  As the whole group is slowing moving to SAP upgrading is not an option ... keeping BAAN running as is for another 18-24 months is.<br />
<br />
I have no experience of BAAN and not sure what companies ( large or small ) offer support for it.  I am fairly sure that BAAN is stable so support whilst necessary, is not required 24x7.<br />
<br />
If anyone can give me an idea of which companies might be interested in supporting our older version, possibly even on a &quot;pay as you play&quot; type basis I would be grateful.<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
Paul</div></div><hr />

BSP http://www.bsp-uk.com <br />
Watermark(was cirrus) http://www.cirrusbs.com/<br />
Macroscope http://www.macroscope.co.uk/<br />
and many others that would probably be interested.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acapulco</div><div class="date">1st November 2002, 07:13</div></div><div class="posttext">B2 is still supported. <br />
If you want your Baan to conect to new applications migrate top Baan IV or baan 5<br />
Migartion to IVc4 is easy in very inexpensive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 06:29</div></div><div class="posttext">This is paraphrased from the Baan Support site and confirms what Nick said:<br />
<br />
The limitation is that specific fixes are not made for IVb2. Baan Support will try to keep all fixes compatible for which a fix is developed. However, the more a customer is behind in installing updates or Service Packs, the greater the risk that an individual solution causes new problems. It is therefore in the interest of the customers to work with the latest update or Service Pack available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frank Rogers</div><div class="date">4th November 2002, 14:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard a company still getting support from Baan itself but at a premium !<br />
<br />
As you will be moving to SAP you may not be able to leverage some (subsidised) assistance from Baan in upgrading to a later version against the possibility of moving to SAP ( hint)</div></div><hr />
