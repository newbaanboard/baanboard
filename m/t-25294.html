When changes are made and after saving them the diologbox reminds you to start the session again and the changes should be visible then.<br />
After the changes are made nothing is changed after restart the session.<br />
Is there someone who regonize this problem and maybe the solution for it??<br />
<br />
Thanx.</div></div><hr />

The problem occurs when you try to change lettertypes. Bold, Italic etc. Also labelcolors and that kind of changes are not accepted. These kind of changes should be saved but there are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">12th October 2005, 17:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure I'm understanding - you make changes using the Dynamic Forms Editor, then you can't see them in Webtop, correct?<br />
<br />
And you can see then using the normal GUI (Baan IV-V) or Worktop is that's what you use?<br />
<br />
I don't have that problem, but I have not played with the bold and other formatting that you have done.  If the problem is still just with Webtop and you tried the column thing - I just saw something under the Admin Console called 'Online Form Cache' and 'Delete Form Cache'.   Have you tried deleting your cache?  <br />
<br />
You get to the admin console by going to the login URL, and changing the 'login' part of the URL to 'admin'.  Then there will be a login.  <br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rumaca</div><div class="date">13th October 2005, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem i described is a standard function within Webtop itself. You don't need to customize forms or delete cache etc. The user should be able to customize his/her own settings for each form. This is shown on a demo given by SSA.<br />
The customizations done by tools or dynamic form editor are correctly shown in Webtop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">13th October 2005, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to remove the cache sometimes manually in order to get the correct form. <br />
<br />
You can find them in &lt;WEBTOP ROOT&gt;/tomcat/webapps/webtop/applets/com/ssaglobal/javaforms/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;package combo&gt;<br />

<br />
On Webtop I am able to remove columns, change width, change order of columns.   I can log off and back on, these changes are saved.  <br />
<br />
If you can't do that, maybe we can help.<br />
<br />
I cannot find anywhere where you can change the Font, Label colors, etc.  Where are those stored?  Do you mean the Admin Console for Webtop?  I see some company colors that I am not sure how to get working, but I don't see anything for label colors or what you have described.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that you HAVE those options but they do not save, or that you saw a demo with those options, but cannot find them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">13th October 2005, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, don't answer, I found documentation on what you are describing.<br />
<br />
On my version of Webtop, which I believe is current, the 'Customization' button is greyed out every form I look at.  If it is not greyed on your form, you are one step ahead of me.  Perhaps this is ready for future functionality, not yet stable or released.<br />
<br />
I think if you contact SSA and specifically refer to the options in the Help under <br />
Webtop 4.0 \ Working with Webtop \ Personalize ERP Sessions<br />
<br />
they may be able to explain why they are not yet working or available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply. The fact that your customize options are grey is that yoy have to set the right authorizations within session ttams1110m000 'User data Template'. For template DEAFULT set the autorisations on formtab Authorizations and run DD. You should be able then to 'customize' you webtop-forms. <br />
