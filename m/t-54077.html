We would like to try the homepages in Webtop 8.4 but if it won't work then it makes no sense...<br />
<br />
Any experiences with that?<br />

There are two main approaches with the report viewer (Birt).<br />
One is the so called push reporting, the other one is the pull reporting.<br />
In one case the original Baanreport is processed normally (all logic of the report is done). You just use a special Device (Birt). This, in combination, with ttstpconv creates an XML-File wich serves as the datasource for the BIRT Report. So no access to Informix from BIRT.<br />
In the second case you can directly query the Baan Database through an appropriate jdbc-Driver (Baan not involved). So if there is a driver for Informix you can access the DB directly.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

We have checked the server and discovered that only ODBC driver is running atm. As soon as we have the JDBC driver working (hopefully we don't need additional license), we will install the Report Viewer and the homepages to see if it works.<br />
