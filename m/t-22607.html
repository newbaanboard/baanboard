<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FriarTuck</div><div class="date">14th December 2004, 19:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Bit o' background first... I'm the UNIX/Oracle guy here at the office.  I've no background in Baan at all.  I have a spare Sun lying around with a rather large StorEdge array.  I'd like to install Baan in its most simplistic fashion so that I can play with it and try to learn a bit about it.<br />
<br />
How does one perform a simple install?  I've got the master tape, done the mas.read6.1 and received a gaggle of 'Package VRC' to choose from (the default being all).  I'm thinking that I can strip out most of this stuff (like Nascar, etc) but I don't know what the VRC choices mean at all (example output attached).  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Helpful information<br />
I'll be installing on a Sun Ultra 2 Ent. running Solaris 9.  I've got 2x200MHz CPUs with 512MB RAM under the hood and 50GB RAID.  I've already got running a local install of Oracle 8.1.7.<br />
<br />
Again, this is only to be a sandbox so I don't really worry about &quot;performance&quot;.  All I really care to get is a &quot;true&quot; install that is worth testing/playing on, but not a &quot;production&quot; machine.  (If any of that makes sense)<br />
<br />
Any help you might be able to provide would be most helpful.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<br />
Since you just want a basic Baan setup, select all the xxB40_c4 packages, these are the standard ones, and leave out all the other ones (the xxB40Lc4yyyy, these are localizations you do not need).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FriarTuck</div><div class="date">16th December 2004, 15:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah ha!  That makes good sense.  I aborted my install and redid it using your suggestion.  mas.read6.1 sure went faster for sure!<br />
<br />
Actually, the install I aborted was the fourth install attempt.  I was able to track down our installation manual (and box of other docs) which identified a slight problem with my method.  This is kind of fun - but darn, does it ever take a LONG time to build.  Whoa!<br />
<br />
This should be an interesting exercise... I'll post again with my success (or lack thereof).<br />
<br />
Cheers, and thank you for your help with the VRC confusion!<br />
