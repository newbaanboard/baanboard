<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">18th March 2002, 07:25</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you go about petitioning Baan to modify tools components? In particular, I am talking about the 'Export Data Dictionary' session (ttiex1280m000).<br />
<br />
We do a lot of cusomisations and any component we modify, we attach to a 'Customisation Project'. The issue with the Export DD session, is that you can either do a session or range of sessions or sessions listed in a file (which is handy, if you have modified a few sessions, but only want to dump one or two, that may include others in your range). However, there are cases, where there are a few sessions in a  range, that you wish to dump (without dumping other sessions in that range), but also wish to dump components that are not related to those sessions (thus; specifying a range of sessions will not work nor will specifying sessions in a file). But, all your modified components are attached to a specific customisation project (and possibly, project part).<br />
<br />
Are other people able to see the benefit of updating the Export DD session, to allow you to enter a cusomisation project (and or part), to create a single DD dump, instead of having to specify your different ranges and options, to create multiple DD dumps for a single project and if so, how do we present this to the Baan company as a suggested upgrade (who, have told me there is no demand for this requirement)?</div></div><hr />

Please take care that they are ordered correctly other wise it will overwrite you previous dump.<br />

<br />
Is there any documentation for the session - ttiexdeliverp <br />
<br />
Did you ever used the session ttiexcdeliver  and any documentation of it ?<br />
<br />
Please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am using sessions ttiex4100m000 Maintain Patch Code and ttiex4110m000 Maintain Components by Patch Code. I've developed a new session wich copy components code by customization part from table ttadv176 to table ttiex410. It works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ClausStr</div><div class="date">24th April 2002, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">In baan 5 baan included the session ttiex4210m000, which copies from your customization project to a patch.<br />
Patches then are maintained from session ttiex4100m000 and session ttiex4110m000.<br />
<br />
On baan 4 i believe session ttiex4210m000 was included in a pmc upgrading at some point.<br />
<br />
session ttiex4100m000 and ttiex4110m000 have allways been there.<br />
<br />
Its a pity baan havnt completely integrated customization projects with the dumping/create patch sessions (its still separate tables, with different layouts), but they now have a solution that works. (which means that customization projects isnt just a waste of time)<br />
<br />
Before baan introduced this feature we developed a solution ourself. Actually this solution can now be used to track customized components based on sessions or tables. You can also compare vrc's to notify which sources that should be checked when new patches have been installed. And a few other features.<br />
We still prefer to use it even on baan 5, if you plan on continue using cust. projects i would recommend you making your own utilities (translate/copy from cust. project tables to patch tables), or give me a note then we could probably work something out.</div></div><hr />
