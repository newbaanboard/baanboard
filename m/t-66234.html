You can check the authorizations for Baan related folders. Give full permissions to Everyone for those folders as the report temp files are created on that path.</div></div><hr />

You can do this by right clicking on the bwprint.exe file and chosing properties&gt;Compatibility. Hope you find this useful.</div></div><hr />
