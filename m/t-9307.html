<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwallace</div><div class="date">20th March 2003, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a great many direct delivery transactions per day at my company.  In fact, I have a whole company in Baan devoted to these transactions.<br />
<br />
I find the IVc4 process is very time-consuming.  I have verified with Baan that I am performing all the necessary steps (I can elaborate to anyone interested).  I have automated the steps, so that the user does not have to execute them individually from the menu.<br />
<br />
The trouble is that the process just takes too darn long to get an invoice out!  It's several minutes start to finish, with very little user keying involved.<br />
<br />
So.....is there anyone who has had any customization done in this area that could share their consultant info with me?  I tried to integrate AFS commands, but these sessions, as of svc pak 8, are not set up for api commands - (tdsls4240s000 and tdinv3260s000).<br />
<br />
Thanks to anyone with advice!<br />
