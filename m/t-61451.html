<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">9th November 2011, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the products we produce are for the medical industry.  We utilize a document called a Device Master Record(DMR) or Production History Record(PHR) which are supplemental steps the operator is required to perform to ensure that the product is manufactured properly and meets all quality requirements.  For example in Baan we may simply have an Operation 20 on a production order which is an incoming inspection operation with its associated task and workcenter.  But the DMR/PHR has supplemental steps to perform (and sign-off on) such as:<br />
<br />
 Verify Quantity with PO Quantiry<br />
 Verify Material Certificate of Conformance<br />
 Verify all dimensions per customer drawing #XXXXXXX<br />
 Package to avoid damage or loss during transit<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently these DMR/PHR instuctions are documented in a separate file and printed separately as the shop packet is created for each production order.<br />
<br />
I'm just curious to see if anyone has a similar process and if they have addressed it within Baan so that it prints out as part of the Baan route sheet or just different ideas on how their company handles it.  Do you use a different application, have a separate data store which then gets pulled in and printed using a sophisticated forms package???  Looking to see what other people do.  <br />
<br />
Any input is greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />
