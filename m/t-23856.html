<br />
A short overview.<br />
1. At source side (Baan IV), in the BC (Baan Conversion) package a lot of setup for the target (SSA ERP LN 6.1) must be prepared based on the source data. Generation and validation sessions are available to fill the setup and to check it.<br />
2. Data is exported into flat files.<br />
3. High performance loaders import the data into the target system.<br />
<br />
Pre and post conversions are avoided as much as possible. We paid special attention to that. Migration manuals are available. Ask your support center.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no single kit available.<br />
There is migration software availble from Baan IV to LN.<br />
On migration path from triton 2.2 to Baan IV I don't have any info.<br />

<br />
I accidently read your post. Some years back, we have successfully migrated multiple triton 2.x customers to Baan IV using a proprietary (but still open in terms of source code of the conversion sessions) conversion tool. Although there are some limitations, most modules, especially the most common ones like Distribution/Finance/Manufacturing, can be converted to Baan IV using the tool. <br />
<br />
I truly don't see any official tool coming from SSA to migrate DIRECTLY from Triton 2.x to SSA ERP LN 6.1, so you might consider to upgrade as follows:<br />
1. First step: Upgrade to the Baan IVc4 database structure using our data conversion tool<br />
2. Second step: Upgrade to SSA LN 6.1 using the official SSA upgrade tool to go from Baan IV table structures to SSA ERP LN 6.1 table structures.<br />
<br />
Final note: We do not charge for the tool itself, however we do assume involvement in the actual process of migrating (and implementing).<br />
<br />
In case you're (still) interested, contact me on my HOTMAIL E-mail address, being 'mrosetx@hotmail.com' (please replace the x by the number three)<br />
