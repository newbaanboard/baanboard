<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VilasoorRavi</div><div class="date">9th October 2005, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">We are a bit behind in catching up with data in BaaN,as we have introduced it for the first time.  We are importing data temporarily into other software to take monthly Profit and Loss account.  Consumption of material for production is being recorded on the date that date is being keyed in and not on the date of actual production, making it almost impossible for us to import consumption data into the other software in the right month.  Is there anyway this data can be identified for the date of production and imported correctly from BaaN?  Maybe it is a nonsense question but forgive me for the same.<br />
