<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foongms</div><div class="date">4th October 2002, 08:46</div></div><div class="posttext">This is quite related to an earlier thread -- &quot;Launching Excel from Baan&quot; started by Stephen Ruger.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone out there with much experience on the Baan - MS-Office Integration? :( <br />
<br />
I hv installed the MS-Office Integration Client Ver1.10.105 (supposed to be the latest update of the product).  However, I am having much problem with creating/maintaining the TEMPLATE files.<br />
<br />
I am hoping to generate some discussion on this topic so I can access if the problem that I am having is an installation issue or is the product still very buggy.:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">4th October 2002, 22:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you referring to the Baan Automation Server (BAS)?  That has templates, and for those to work you must have the proper connection with Baan.  The install/setup is indeed not straightforward.  I'm sorry, I have no docs for the process, but I have seen it done.<br />
<br />
The trick is in the registry, you have to use REGEDIT after you install to change the name of ....something.  I'm sorry.  Something in the HKEY-LOCAL-MACHINE / BAAN.APPLICATION registry entry.  That's all I remember, but hopefully you are semi-familiar with the area.  The guy I was working with knew the registry very well.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone here has found this problem and can explain better.<br />
<br />
Once that's set, the rest is as documented, and it's really a nice tool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes... it seems that the connection is going thro' BAS and I hv already looked thro' the Windows Registry but I did not find anything that is suspicious enough for me to edit.<br />
<br />
Can u check with that guy and tell me what variable I should change or add?;) <br />
<br />
BTW, my problem is with the Baan Design tool bar.  When I link Baan fields to the Excel worksheet the first time I create the Baan Excel template it is fine.  However, if I were to save that &quot;incompleted&quot; template and hope to come back to it later -- this is where the problem is.  It seems to lose all Baan fields and worst, I cannot even activate the Baan Design tool bar again!!<br />
<br />
Hv anyone come across this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">7th October 2002, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I see.  The registry entry I believe must be correct then, hopefully they fixed that part of the install since last I saw it (some months back).  We could not view the Baan tables at all without it.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen your problem, you probably have a later/different version than I saw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slavko</div><div class="date">20th November 2002, 15:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe this is not a problem, but did you check your Excel security settings for macros? I saw, that if you have setup &quot;High security&quot; a problem like you have can happen.<br />
<br />
Best reg's <br />

<br />
Thanks for your input.... BUT it is not that problem either.  I hv tested the security setting as u hv suggested but still the problem remains there.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slavko</div><div class="date">22nd November 2002, 08:18</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some other things to check:<br />
1. registry entry (see attach.) in HKEY_CLASS_ROOT set as You see. For &quot;Baan.Application&quot; key &quot;CurVersion&quot; must be an entry that is active in your BECS configuration (in my case &quot;Baan.Application.5&quot;). &quot;CLSID&quot; must be the same number as in case of entry &quot;Baan.Application.5&quot;.<br />
2. Check to be sure that in BECS you have active-default configuration<br />
<br />
Also you can try next: start Baan, then start Excel and try tocreate template. But normally problem is in regedit.<br />
