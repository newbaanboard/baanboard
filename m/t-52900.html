<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">2nd July 2008, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure but I think a FP ( Feature Pack ) extends the functionallity of the Baan environment and a SP ( Service Pack ) contains software components which will replace existing compenents in order to solve bugs.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, I not sure of both are delivered in the same package ( SP/FP ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">2nd July 2008, 12:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, but doesn't a FP include the bug updates too (plus the new functionality)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">2nd July 2008, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. There is no sp3 for LN 6.1. As far as I know only an SP0/SP1, than FP2 and FP3. From FP3 on you can download monthy fixes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">15th July 2008, 00:58</div></div><div class="posttext">No, a couple of days ago they indeed released a Servicepack SP3 for Featurepack FP3. It is an aggregated solution for FP3, with a seperate documentation (U9473A US) available describing the more important &quot;functional enhancements&quot; within these solutions.<br />
<br />
The difference between service and featurepacks for LN has to be seen from a development point of view (not from the marketing blabla with &quot;customer impact&quot; and so on, even if that's interwoven): A Feature Pack is a new development branch, a solution is a patch for a particular branch and a service pack is a collection of solutions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">23rd July 2008, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">For information, we're not talking about Windows servicepacks but Baan Baan Servicepacks &amp; Featurepacks. The servicepacks contain fixes voor the Baan application. A Baan servicepack does not include al previous released solutions therefore in a Baan environment you can't install servicepack 3 without installing servicepack 2.   As mentioned it can be confusing but servicepack 3 for Baan is something different then servicepack 3 for Windows XP. Due to combination servicepack from Baan and the used portingset for Baan installation may have consequences for the level of the O.S. you're running Baan on.</div></div><hr />
