<br />
We are on Baan IVc4 and about to start implementation of LN6.1. LN 6.1 has several add-on's (Business studio, Infor Reporting Studio, e-Message connector etc). Our Infor Technical consultant has configured LN6.1 training server but not configured several software components like Infor Business Studio, Reporting Studio &amp; e-Message connector.<br />
On being asked about these products, even he was not sure about the commercials of this softwares.<br />
<br />
I would request all the experts to help us identify which are the software components alongwith LN6.1, which we are entitled to get free so that we can take advantage of these free softwares.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Vishal</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though somebody will probably clarify / answer ur query ,   it's better to confirm the same with Infor only abt this . They will be more than happy to clarify this for u. U can share this information with the board which will motivate others to migrate to the latest version.</div></div><hr />
