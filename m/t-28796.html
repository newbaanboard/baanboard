<br />
I used Unit Effi in My LN env.<br />
<br />
But I can not click the Expection in BOM.<br />
<br />
Is there any option should be selected?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />

I suppose you have a parent item PI for which, you need to maintain unit effectivity. This item has two items:<br />
- Child Item 1 (CI1) which is purchased and<br />
- Child Item 2 (CI2) which is purchased, but not mandetory in the BOM and exeptions are allowed.<br />
- Then you can PI with &quot;Unit Effective&quot; in the Item Master (tcibd0101s000) as &quot;yes&quot;<br />
- For both the children define the &quot;Unit Effective&quot; in the Ietm Master (tcibd0101s000) as &quot;no&quot;<br />
- Then define the Items-Effectivetity series (tcuef0101m000) for PI.<br />
- After this, define the effectivity units for PI (tcuef0502m000) and in special define the requierment for which you want the exeptions to be.<br />
- After this try to define BOM and then you will see the exceptions field to be accessible in which you can select for CI2<br />
<br />
Hope this will solve your problems in defining expections.<br />
<br />
Best Luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, before your reply, I had finished the job following your step.<br />
But unluckily the job failed too.<br />
<br />
So I really did not know what's the wrong.<br />
<br />
And I had made a screen record, So would you kindly to have a view?<br />
Thank you very much.<br />

I assume that you have set in correct parameters for unit effectivity in the session tcuef0500m00. Is your parent item (PI), lot controlled? It needs to be lot controlled in order to have the unit effectivity @ P-BOM level (session code tcibd0101s000).<br />
If you have already taken care of the above, then we need to investigate your problem further. Could send it to me on my personal e-mail id, I could not open the winzip file attached by you, it said it it corrupted.<br />
<br />
Hope to solve your problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all thanks a lot for your reply.<br />
<br />
In the UEF parameters, I selected Generate Effectivity Unit during Order Entry, And set a Default Series. For the Miscellaneous, I selected All Effectivity Units are Interchangeable, Set a Number Group for Effectivity Unit.<br />
<br />
My PI is not under lot controlled.<br />
<br />
I am very sorry the attachments problem. Because the screen record was made by VMware, if I use winzip, the file will be too large. So I used winrar to do the zip job. After finished, I rename the .rar to .zip file.:D <br />
<br />
And I will often be online at msn: beyond_ysb@163.net<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

Unit effectivity end item &amp; unit effective supply check box must be ticked. Then only you can define exceptions for bom line.</div></div><hr />
