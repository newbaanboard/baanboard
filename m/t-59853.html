<br />
We think about buying touch screens for a BaanIV-session that reports production quantities.<br />
<br />
I am aware that operating Baan with a touch screen is similar to operating a session with a mouse only.<br />
<br />
Also I know that it can be tricky in Baan, if you do not exit an input field with the tab-button, and you just click into another field with the mouse. Sometimes checks are not executed, some times they are executed later.<br />
<br />
Does one of you have experience with touch screens?<br />
Can you tell me what things work fine, and what things don't?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />
