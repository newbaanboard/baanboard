<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">20th May 2010, 14:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Our Baan Server is on HP-UX 11.11, with Oracle 9 DB<br />
<br />
All of our clients run Windows XP, 7, etc.<br />
<br />
All of our other servers are Windows 2000,2003, etc.<br />
<br />
We use active directory, but Baan logins are separate.  This is a pain in the ass.  When end users have to change their passwords, they do it through a telnet window.  Also, end users get really confused, and they lock out their accounts often.  While their accounts are locked out, they can't work.  <br />
<br />
If attempting to get authentication based on Active Directory, the documentation that I can find on that requires HP-UX 11.23 or 11.31.  We currently run 11.11.<br />
<br />
I was thinking to test this out on VMWare, but HP-UX can not run on VMWare, due to processor incompatibility.  <br />
<br />
So, now I'm looking at ... why don't I just migrate it to run on Windows, and have that fix my authentication problem?<br />
<br />
Seriously, I find that my three biggest issues with users are the following:  passwords, permissions, and printers.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is a case of passwords becoming such a big issue, and such a drain on our time (that could be spent on other projects).<br />
<br />
Theoretically, I would hope it was a simple matter of installing some services, copying some flat files, and restoring a database .... but all of my web searches turn up information with regards to some company that hired a consulting company to do it for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Migrating it to windows is possible. You could even use services for unix to make it more easier to migrate your unix scripts.<br />
<br />
But back to your problem: Infor has some solutions which makes it possible to let users change their passwords more easily. Did you even checked theses?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I had not heard of this before.<br />
<br />
But, it's still maintaining multiple user accounts.  I'd like for my end users to have only one user account to maintain ... single sign-on.<br />
<br />
It looks like Citrix Password Manager would be the ideal solution for this case, but long term, I think whenever we do upgrade the ERP, it would be windows-based, and if we've suffered for the past twelve years (apparently) don't know how one or two more would hurt.</div></div><hr />

SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Session Change Password (ttstpchangepw) is provided. With this session end-users can always change their passwords, also outside the period of password expiration/aging. Session is present in menu User Management/Miscellaneous. <br />

Solution Description<br />
English	SSO (Single Sign On) configuration BaanIV<br />
TOOLS VERSION(S): B40_c<br />
<br />
SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN: &quot;Maintain User Data&quot; (ttaad2100m000)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
In BaanIV Tools it is not possible to set-up and configure Infor SSO (Single Sign On). This is required for Infor MyDay (Role Based Homepages).<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
A new session Maintain SSO Parameters (ttams0100m000) is introduced. With this session it is possible to activate and configure SSO (Single Sign On).<br />
Session Maintain User Data (ttaad2100m000) has been modified. It now shows a few extra fields which can be used to configure some user specific attributes related to SSO (Single Sign On).<br />
Session Convert User Data to Runtime Data Dictionairy (ttaad4200m000) has been modified. In case SSO (Single Sign On) is active it will dump an extra runtime file per user which is used by the portingset during the login process of the user.<br />
See the Session and Field Help of these sessions for more information about the SSO (Single Sign On) configuration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">21st May 2010, 09:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a bit confused about your topic. Do you really want to kick HPUX and run baan on Windows? Later, your're talking about problem with password and authentication.<br />
 <br />
Just to your information: We run some live systems with HP-UX 11.31 and a test system with HP-UX 11.11. All have AD integration, so <br />
our users always enter their &quot;windows&quot; password to get into baan. They never open a telnet window (hey, think of security!). <br />
 <br />
The only problem happens when some very clever users use the &quot;feature&quot; called &quot;save password&quot; so that they only have to click on the baan icon on their desktop because we normally use a link to bw.exe. But that can be solved by using a link to a bwc file instead.<br />

<br />
<br />
can you please tell some details about how to make AD integration to login with windows user.<br />
Is there a &quot;Generic System User&quot; used? Which client do you have in use?<br />
Did you make the integration by using sso_config (SSO-Service) as described by NPRao's last post?<br />
Is there a special service to be installed on the Unix Server? How about LDAP, PAM or Kerberos?<br />
How about name convention -- username should not be longer that eight characters --&gt; almost impossible if name includes AD-domainname - ?<br />
<br />
Lots of questions -- thanks for any help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">21st June 2010, 14:19</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, I haven't installed or configured the system. But I might give you some hints (I hope). First of all, run swlist as root and check if you see &quot;LDAP-UX&quot; and &quot;PAM-Kerberos and Kerberos Support&quot;. If you don't see them, you'll probably have them installed first.<br />
 <br />
If you see them, you might have eg. a directory /etc/opt/openldap that contains some config files. Maybe these haven't been be configured yet. After that you should have a look at /etc/nsswitch.conf which might then contain a line &quot;passwd: files ldap&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Last but not least: google &quot;LDAP  HPUX&quot; will lead you to hp's download and documentation pages.<br />

<br />
Could you put me in contact with your sys admin who set this up?  We have hp-ux 11.11, and I ran into some issues with attempting to configure this.<br />
<br />
I did some searching on this issue in the past.<br />
<br />
One problem is that we have no HP-UX expertise.  In San Antonio, it is easy to find Solaris guys (due to the military presence), but not HP-UX guys.  <br />
<br />
I tried the HP-UX method that involved running a service on the Windows servers, and running a single sign on daemon on the HP-UX systems.  I ran into some issues, with regards to &quot;trusted system.&quot;  I could not get past this issue.<br />
<br />
Then, later on, I did open an incident with Infor, with regards to Single Sign-On, and I needed to install a patch or something to our Baan.<br />
<br />
Some other documentation I found, seemed great, but ran into issues with that one, too.<br />
<br />
Like I say, I think the issue comes down to a lack of knowledge, as I am not well versed enough in HP-UX to figure out anything, if there are complications.  I can follow directions step-by-step, but not troubleshoot issues.<br />
<br />
We don't have an HP-UX admin.<br />
<br />
I've tried this three different ways, but since you say you have it running on 11.11, I know it is possible on HP-UX 11.11, just let us know, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">21st June 2010, 22:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Han Brinkman, Nprao:<br />
<br />
I wanted to do this without patching Baan, as I don't control the Baan patching, and we have issues every time we apply patches.<br />
<br />
I also wanted to do this without upgrading HP-UX, as, I said earlier, we have no HP-UX expertise.<br />
<br />
I guess I can't have it both ways, and need to fold on one or the other.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">22nd June 2010, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Our admin gave me some documents that contain confidential information and cannot be posted here. So I created a stripped version which shows some basic steps. Hope that contains enough information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">23rd June 2010, 03:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Gunther, thanks for that information you posted.<br />
<br />
I will attempt to make use of it.<br />
<br />
Can you please confirm, that all of your baan users utilize 8 or less character user names?</div></div><hr />
