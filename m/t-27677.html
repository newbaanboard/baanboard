I have a user who had to change their domain password on Friday.  Today when she goes into session tccom1101m000 - Maintain Customers, she receives the following erorr message - ONLY for certain customers<br />
<br />
1:  process 3 - Fatal error: Index -6 out of dims [1] 5<br />
2:  process 3 Fatal error: Can not continue in tccom1101m000 (after.read).<br />
<br />
This has just started today, and is only generated for certain customers for this user only.  I can look up the customer without any error at all.<br />
<br />
Weird, huh?<br />
Thanks in advance for help!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can other non-superusers access those customers?<br />
<br />
If yes - then try doing a &quot;remove user defaults&quot; for her for that session<br />
If no - then look to her permissions, they may be wacky.<br />
<br />
probably has nothing to do with password.<br />

Is so happens that we had a thunderstorm that after noon and a momentary power outage blew everyone out of their BaaN client sessions.  Apparently this was enough to clear whatever setting was messing my user up.<br />
<br />
when you refer to 'removing user defaults', is that session ttstpdeldeflt?  Does that clear the contents of ttadv920?  I saw stuff in that table for her, but didn't know what it was and wasn't about to mess with it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

Yes, stpdeldeflt will remove those records. On my system it's adv990 but i'm Baan4.</div></div><hr />
