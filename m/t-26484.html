Do you set up an entry for each time period when jobs run (ex. Monday, Night, Month-end, etc.) or do you do it by session (ex. Process Delivered Sales Orders, Post Integrations, Process Hours Accounting, etc.)?  Or do you do it a different way.  What are the pro's and con's of your setup?<br />
<br />
We're re-evaluating the way we have them set up and just looking for some info.<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The benefits are that if a problem occurs i can easily stop and restart the job.<br />
I can manage dependencies by a fancy shell script that i wrote. And i can<br />
easily manipulate performance variables like ORA_MAX_ARRAY* for specific jobs. Plus it's easy put traces on.<br />
<br />
The only downside as far as i'm concerned is that it takes 1 license / job instead of 1 license / company (how it works with the Job daemon)<br />
<br />
Also Cron never mysteriously &quot;hangs&quot; ;)<br />

<br />
All the periodic jobs are scheduled and executed through the Windows task scheduler</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
we have built our job managment based on business procedures and need.<br />
(hourly , dayly , weekly , montly)<br />
Some jobs only have 2, some 20 or 30 sessions.<br />
All jobs are handled by an specific &quot;job-users&quot; cron. Every BaaN company has its own job user, so it is posible to manage the jobtime independent for each company.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">24th February 2006, 18:55</div></div><div class="posttext">We use the Baan job manager and use calenders for jobs which cannot be covered by the standard periods within the Baan job manager (ie. a job which needs to be run Monday and Thursday night).<br />
<br />
We set the calenders up initially by using Exchange on the tools table ttaad507 to import the dates and times.<br />

Cheers<br />
