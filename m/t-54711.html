I create a work top document.  Later, I attempt to open the saved worktop document within SSA Worktop, but, it fails to open, and spits out the error message above.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Also, it may be best to tell you what I'm trying to do:<br />
<br />
I have Terminal Server Users, and I want to define a connection for them, such that they can double-click the .wtd, and then log into Baan LN.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(1) Define the connection in BECS<br />
(2) Create a shortcut to a read-only copy of the .BWC file<br />
(3) Have users click on that shortcut<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />
<br />
I was inpatient, I guess ... I gave up after 30 seconds of trying ... lame.  Maybe I didn't really, I found this ... oh well...<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who read this ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">9th January 2009, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I am wrong.  This does not work.  I am missing a step.  It tells me I need to use worktop.<br />
<br />
if i try to call the .bwc from the bw.exe, it tells me i need to use worktop.<br />
<br />
if i try to call the .bwc from worktop.exe, it tells me it's not supported on my version of worktop to do that.<br />
<br />
when i try to call the .wtd from worktop.exe, it tells me the .wtd doesn't support central deployment.<br />
<br />
I think I will try creating a .wtd for each server, and see if that survives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">instant000</div><div class="date">9th January 2009, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, the final solution worked:<br />
<br />
If you don't have central deployment enabled and/or don't have any idea of how to turn it on [like I do] then use this method as a workaround:<br />
<br />
(1)  Create the .wtd locally on each terminal server.  I just saved mine with same name, to the default location<br />
(2) call it as follows  &quot;c:\...\worktop.exe&quot; &quot;c:\...\doc1.wtd&quot;<br />
(3) if you choose to publish the app, it's easiest for the .wtd and the worktop.exe to be in the same location on each server, by the same name.</div></div><hr />
