First of all, how can you use barcode with BaaN? Do you have something to enable or I have to develope some plug-in to receive the data from scanner and relay it to BaaN for dataentry?<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />

You will find plenty of posts to read.  We use hardwired barcode scanners to replace keyboard input and this requires no coding changes - at least not for us.  Or you can go another way and use all the good stuff that a third party has setup, like the wireless interfaces from RMC.  Best bet is to search the board and one good forum to search is the tools forum.<br />

<br />
Typically a barcode scanner works as a keyboard (input device), so everything that you scan is inserted into the active text-field.<br />
<br />
You will have to use 4GL functionality to code your way around avoiding additional input as much as possible.</div></div><hr />
