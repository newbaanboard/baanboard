<br />
We consider upgrading our 3D-CAD system to the enterprise version to be able to use its functionality as a PDM system. I've searched the internet but there are no details about the interface to Baan (and vice versa). Does somebody have details about the interface? I believe that it's an open XML-interface but what is the exact specification? As we have many customized tables (sometimes with different type of information in a field which should be cleaned up) it is important to know more about it. Does somebody have any experience about it?<br />

We have used PDM Works Enterprise for a couple of years with mixed experience - albeit with Autodesk CAD rather than Solidworks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peturba</div><div class="date">24th February 2009, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">As we already use Solid Works (as CAD system) we had the choice between Solid Works Enterprise (PDM) and Infor's PLM solution. Comparing both we have decided to use Solid Works Enterprise (several reasons, for example the functionality). So, our choice will be Solid Works Enterprise and thus it would be interesting to obtain some details as well as experiences from other users...<br />
