I'd like to deactive to Option Buttons on a printing mask (see additional screenshot). Where can I do that in the form Editor?<br />
<br />
Remark: screenshot is from the work top. Normally we will work in the Webbrowser.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vamsi_gujjula</div><div class="date">28th August 2015, 12:12</div></div><div class="posttext">you can deactivate the field permanently on  form level. i.e on form editor<br />
<br />
or you can program it in the script using  , that is if you want to enable and disable the field conditionally... this can be done using enable.fields() and disable.fields<br />
<br />
also look at inputfield.invisible()  ,inputfield.visible()</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for help. but as you both asume: there should be such a field for These Options. But there isn't. I think These both fields are part of the Standard form. <br />
Yesterday there was for example additional Buttons like the &quot;print&quot; and &quot;Close&quot; button. I've deactivated them by right click on the session tssoc1402m000 in the session list. There I've selected the Option &quot;Standard commands&quot;. Within the Standard commands are three Tabs (Edit, Group Information, Miscellaneous). Where I've deactivated some of These button.<br />
But These both left Option I haven't found there in the Standard command list. <br />
So wherelse I can find them? Do I have to Change the &quot;St. Command Set...&quot; in the &quot;Edit&quot;-Register?<br />
By the way, which is the St. Command Set.<br />
<br />

If you run the session always standalone and not based on a selection in the overview session, you can remove the field in the form and also uncheck the Selection Group field of the Selection Range group.<br />
Or just start again with a new copy of tssoc1401m000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for the hint. Your right, I've copied the sel.use.tssoc100 field out of the form tssoc1401m000.<br />
So maybe the copying was corrupt. I will check that soon and give Feedback.<br />

<br />
I've checked it out now. And the solution for me was to delete the sel.use.tssoc100 field totally out of the form Editor. Now the selection layout is as I Need :-).<br />
<br />
Thanks for help to All!<br />

This might help. We have an option in the Dynamic Form Editor for the selection groups to activate/deactivate based on the following function.<br />
<br />
sel.use.parent.selection()<br />
Syntax:<br />
function boolean  sel.use.parent.selection  (string parent_table)<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
This function can be used in a print or a processing session to determine whether to user wants to print/process based on a selection range, or based on the selection that is made in the parent. If the user wants to use the selection of the parent, you should use the function do.parent.selection() to get the selection. The user can indicate his choice with an optionset. Read below how to create that option set. <br />
<br />
Because the information is not available, you can not use this function in the before.program section. <br />
<br />
<br />
Arguments<br />
string parent_table The table code (e.g. tccom100) of which you need to process records.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Return values<br />
true User wants to use the selection of the given table. (This also means that the parent session has the given table as maintable.) <br />
<br />
false User wants to specify a custom range.<br />
<br />
Context<br />
This function is implemented in the 4GL Engine and can be used in 4GL script types. This function is available from TIV level 1075. <br />
<br />
How the create the selection field<br />
The user can indicate his choice with an optionset. For an example of such an optionset start session ttams2200m000 (&quot;Convert Changes to Runtime DD&quot;) from session ttaad2500m000 (&quot;User Data&quot;). The optionset on the top is the selection field. <br />
<br />
To create the selection field, open the form of the print/processing session in the Dynamic Form Editor. Mark a group that contains a selection range as 'Selection Group' and specify a table code for which the selection range applies. Now the selection field is generated. <br />
<br />
If the print/processing session is then started from another session, the 4GLE will check whether any group on the print/processing session is a selection group with the same table as the maintable of the parent. If that is the case and a record is selected in the parent, the 4LE does the following: <br />
<br />
the option 'selection from parent' is selected <br />
the selection group is disabled <br />
In all other cases:<br />
<br />
the selection field is made invisible <br />
the selection group is enabled <br />
The default for the selection field is always ignored by the 4GLE, and if the 'selection from parent' is selected the 'Add to Job' button will always be disabled.</div></div><hr />
