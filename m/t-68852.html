<br />
I was creating a Javascript and i am really not sure whether this is the correct sub forum for posting this. I apologise if i get it wrong.:)<br />
<br />
And the problem is rather a long one. And i wonder if anybody has patience to solve it or have appetite for &quot;other Programming languages&quot; on a board predominantly for Baan programmers. Anyway i will shoot my question..<br />
<br />
N number of people are sitting in a circle. They are given a ball. They will be passing it in the circle. If a person receives<br />
the ball in odd number of times then he will pass it to his right side to the lth person. And if the person receives the ball in even number of times then he will pass it to left side to the lth person and as soon as any person receives the ball equal to m number of times the game stops. And the program will give the number of iterations.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, if l is 2,m = 3(maximum number of times ball will be passed) and n = 5(number of people in the circle)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To start the game ,First person recieves the ball , then he has the ball one time, so it is odd and he will pass it to the 4th person(two to his right), then the 4 th person after receiving passes it to the second person,second person passes it to the 5th person, 5th person to the 3rd person, 3rd to the first, 1st to the 3rd person(as 1st has received two times that makes it even so he will pass to his left),3rd to 5th, 5th to 2nd, 2nd to 4th and 4th to 1st.Now the 1st person has received the ball m number of times, i.e 3 number of times so the game stops. And the game has had 10 Iterations.<br />
<br />
Now the program will give l,m,n for input from the user and the program will give out the number of iterations,i.e, 10 , in case of l=2,m=3,n=5.<br />
<br />
Now i have build the logic. A[i] will have the number of iterations of each person and i will be the next person in the group to which the ball will be passed.<br />
<br />
i will be calculated as <br />
<br />
1) In case of odd iterations, i = (i+n-l) % n, i.e when the 1st person has the ball, it will give answer as i= (1+5-2)%5, i.e 4<br />
2) In case of even Iterations, i = (i + l) % n, i.e when 1st person has the ball , it will give answer as i = (1+2)%5, i.e 3<br />
<br />
<br />
Now when number of people are 5, i will be 0 to 4 as there is an array involved. So when i is 0 during the start, the first iteration gives is i=3, which is right but the next iteration when i = 3, i = (3+5-2) % 5, i should give 1 but it still gives as 3.<br />
<br />
When i hard code the value of l,m and n, it gives the right answer but when i use document.getElementById(&quot;m&quot;).value then i dont get the right answer. The problem occurs during/after the bolded part in the programming<br />

             i = (i + l) % n;<br />
             alert(&quot;Value of i &quot;+i + &quot; and l: &quot;+l);<br />
             A[i] = A[i] + 1;<br />
        }<br />
        iter = iter + 1;<br />

    alert(&quot;While Loop Ended&quot;); <br />
    //document.write(&quot;Hello...Iteration is &quot; +iter); <br />
   document.getElementById(&quot;demo&quot;).innerText = &quot;Hello...Iteration is &quot; +iter;<br />
 }<br />
&lt;/script&gt;<br />
&lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If i use hard code values of l,m,n instead of <br />
var l = document.getElementById(&quot;l&quot;).value; then i dont have the problem but i cant use hardcoded values.:)<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: I am not sure whether we can post questions pertaining to other programming languages like this. you can close it or if is against the forum Rules.</div></div><hr />

Better to try Stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/)<br />
<br />
Though, I would suggest you to try two things-<br />
<br />
Instead of<br />
<br />
var l = document.getElementById(&quot;l&quot;).value;<br />
<br />
You can try - <br />
<br />
var l = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;l&quot;).value);<br />
<br />
Or <br />
<br />
var l = document.getElementById(&quot;l&quot;).innerHTML or .textContent<br />
<br />
Also, the reason might be that the values are not yet loaded in the DOM<br />
<br />
You can check if this (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1829925/javascript-getelementbyid-not-working) helps.</div></div><hr />

Corrected the typo - <br />
<br />
var l = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;l&quot;).value);</div></div><hr />
