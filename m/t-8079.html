<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amartins</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running IVc4 with Supply Chain extension on Oracle 7.3.4 and HPUX 10.20.  We have several production order planners, but only one who has this problem. <br />
<br />
Occasionally (anywhere from twice in a day to once every couple weeks) when this planner goes into Maintain Production Orders, tisfc0101m000, and changes either the quantity ordered or the production start date, the planned inventory transaction in tdinv150 does not change to reflect the planner's modification.  In order to fix it, the planner changes the order back to what it was, logs out of Baan and back in again.  Then when the change is keyed again, the planned transaction changes accordingly.<br />
<br />
The only warning that the planner gets that this is occurring is that when the change is keyed into the production order and is saved, the note &quot;estimated BOM and routing will be reset to standard&quot; only pops up once.  It normally pops up twice in a row when any changes are made to the production order.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to diagnose the root cause of this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
