<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ale_baan</div><div class="date">8th March 2005, 17:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
I am not able to finalize a batch. <br />
This batch has 5 transactions, one of which appears to be &quot;in use&quot;; the remaining 4 have &quot;ready&quot; status.<br />
When I try to enter transactions tfgld1101m000 to such line (now is empty actually) or either directly try to delete the line get the error message &quot;Transaction Type used by other process&quot;.<br />
<br />
Other details: when searching for the batch in Global selection of Batches for Finalization I can see it with status &quot;ready&quot;.... but of course then it does not finalize it...<br />
<br />
Can someone assist me on how to delete such line or else overcome this error message?<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
  Ale<br />
<br />
ps: I read the thread from rcitra of Feb. 7 2005 but did not find a solution follwing such thread. thanks again</div></div><hr />

If there are no locks than use session tfgld1116m000 for the batch and transaction type.  Change the status there to ready and then delete the transaction type from tfgld1101m000 is it has not transactions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ale_baan</div><div class="date">9th March 2005, 15:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear MariaC,<br />
many thanks for your prompt reply!<br />
<br />
I would like to ask you to kindly:<br />
  1.   ellaborate (very briefly, one or two lines) on the &quot;remove locks&quot; action, its meaning<br />
  2.   confirm, is the session code is *tfgld1116m000* correct?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
  Ale</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if my answer is still relevant for you ;)<br />
<br />
You need not need to try removing application locks for this problem.  <br />
<br />
Just run the session tfgld1116m000, set the status to &quot;Free&quot; <br />
Go back to maintain transactions.  There you see that the status of that particular transaction type is changed to &quot;Free&quot;.  <br />
Just enter into that transaction type and come out.  <br />
The status is now changed to Ready.  <br />
Now you can finalize the batch<br />
<br />
Tell me if this helped you (if not already resolved ;) )<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

thanks for the answer -it's never late  ; )<br />
<br />
Is the  *tfgld1116m000* a Baan 5 session? ..am not able to open it. Else, could you give me its name so as to search it?<br />
<br />
thank again!<br />

Yes, Maria is correct.  It is tfgld1116s000.  Sucking issue with baan 5 session coding logic.  Seems there is no significance for the letter m and s in the session names anymore.  There are many main sessions with s and many subsessions with m in their session name - by the way, I started using baan 5 recently<br />
