31.03.2003 IT Spending to Recover Next Year <br />
The IT spending waiting game will continue into next year,  according to Gartner Group, by which time customers must start spending again. Company chief executive Michael Fleisher is reported to have said spending on IT will recover next year for a number of reasons. These include an end to delays in replacing hardware and software and the fact that the increased cost to maintain existing equipment and code will outstrip the price of buying new systems. However, there are two caveats: the war in Iraq has the potential to cause &quot;massive economic disruption&quot; and delay recovery; and, investor appetite for risk is low, so the number of mergers and acquisitions, which can force IT spending, will be lower than usual.</div></div><hr />
