I'm not too savvy with baan and have been asked to research if this is possible.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

This will keep password inaccessible, although the user name will be visible.<br />
<br />
The directory is &lt;installation path&gt;/lib/user.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However if you are adamant at doing so, you could run the BW Client Configuration tool (by either running Baan\bin\becs.exe or Baan\lib\user\default.bwc) and once in there ...<br />
1) Enter the username<br />
2) Enable the option &quot;Use saved Password&quot;<br />
3) Enter the password<br />
4) At the bottom make sure the option &quot;Used as default file&quot; is checked.<br />
5) Click on Save button.<br />
<br />
Next time the user double clicks on the Baan short cut on the desktop, it would connect automatically without asking for usernames or password.<br />

You have an option that needs to be tried on your own risk !!!!<br />
<br />
You can disable display of &quot;user name&quot; , &quot;password&quot; dialogue and configure dialogue in bwconfig.dll after inserting username , password in configuration and by setting as default.<br />

Sushil, this sounds more of what I'd like to do.  I want to disable the configuration dialogue so that the users cannot change the saved username and password.<br />
<br />
Could you or anyone else walk me through the steps for how to do this.<br />
<br />
Where is bwconfig.dll and how do I disable the username, password and configuration dialogue.  I'm not too familiar with this and appreciate any help.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I had done some changes long back - in one of my Remote location where user was very notorious - changing the setting in BW config - (where i had set for license limitation).<br />
<br />
if your are in windows platform using baanIVC4 Bw client then you find bwconfig.dll in &lt;client installation folder&gt; \bin\bwconfig.dll<br />
<br />
Herewith i am attaching the screen dump .<br />
<br />
Their is a utility to do the same -&gt; you can google it &quot;resource hacker''.<br />
<br />
