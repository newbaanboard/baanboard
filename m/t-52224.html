I have done on many customers warehouse order number extension to 8 digits to avoid this problem. <br />
The solution is to implement a new domain, called tcwhno long with 8 digits instead of 6, and substitute it in all tables on which there are warehouse order numbers. <br />
The field is a long, so no reconfiguration of the tables will occur (the convert to rtdd of course, yes); after that, modify the first free numbers assign where is necessary and do a search on all screens and reports on which this domain is used and do a mass work to adjust...</div></div><hr />

<br />
what do u mean by no reconfiguration is required ? do u mean to say if this would have been string field wherein u would have increased from '5' to '10' chars then it would have required reconfiguration ?<br />
<br />
and the above statement does not apply to long ? is this what u are trying to say ... i am not sure about this beahviour so just wanted to confirm back from u.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">4th June 2008, 12:06</div></div><div class="posttext">All I have said refers to Baan IV environment, not to Baan ERP/LN. <br />
In Baan IV order numbers are numeric, stored in long; in erp/ln order 'numbers' are string. <br />
The domain tcorno has a limit to 6 digits. But long numbers can have a longer range. You can define a new domain (I have called it tcwhno &quot;Warehouse order number&quot;, with 8 digits limit) and still use a long to store it. <br />
Reconfiguration isn't necessary, because in the DB this field continues to be a long...<br />
The problem arises because in baan IV warehouse orders the first digit has a meaning, so you can only use 5 digits in fact, this means that it fullfills rapidly. <br />
I remember a customer that a month after the start up has the 5 series full, because warehouse orders were used to fill initial inventory of the items...<br />
However, you have to modify the first free order number session and the way the order numbers are assigned (And a lot of screens/reports, too, but you can do this when necessary, the sessions/reports continue to work, maybe you see a lot of ###### instead of the number).</div></div><hr />

I got a temporary solution, reset series number by tcmcs0417m000 as we will implement SAP in the end of this year. It will use the unused number after resetting.</div></div><hr />

IT is tcmcs0147m000 and not tcmcs0417m000.</div></div><hr />
