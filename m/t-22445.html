<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">26th November 2004, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Its been over 2 years since I last played with a Baan system and yet, I still wander over to the site to see how the world of Baan is getting on. And I see its changed. Many new faces, products and companies are appearing, and the old ones leaving. <br />
<br />
In the last few months, I have had the pleasure(?) of working towards my MCSE to finally prove that I can do all those things that 13 years of experience allows me to do and yet, the world of IT still seems to be changing. <br />
<br />
As we race further into the next couple of years, I wonder where development, enhancements and evolution of IT will take us. It seems to no longer hold the mystique that it once had, or the benefits that we once took for granted. During the MCSE training, I have met many people who wonder what they will be doing in the next 2 years, well looking back, I didn't think the last 2 would be as they have been for me. <br />
<br />
I have worked on development projects, training and even started up my own small consultancy in the last 18 months alone. Got married, moved a few times and even waited on tenterhooks for the release of HalfLife 2. <br />
<br />
Why do I mumble along in this way. Well, there have been many changes in the ERP industry and, as many companies have written off the expense of Y2K finally, there appears to be more investment into other projects. As these expand to more and more companies, I can see a big change coming. All I hope is that every one is ready for it. <br />
<br />
Its going to be a big splash!</div></div><hr />
