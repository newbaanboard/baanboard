<br />
I am using BaaN 4c4 and new to BaaN Tools. Is it possible to insert a new field in a session and later on retrieve transaction data based on that field? i.e., While doing inventory transfer of standard item from one warehouse to another using Enter Inventory Transaction (tdilc1120m000) session, I need to put a reference no. (sales order no. or project no.) in order to track the qty transferred for a particular sales order no. or project no.. Can anybody please tell me it is possible or is there any other easy way to solve it?<br />
<br />
Or, In Form2 of the Enter Inventory Transaction session, there are some fields (eg. Ledger Account, Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous, etc.), which are inactive for Inventory Transfer. Can we make any of them active and use it for entering sales order no or project no while doing inventory transfers? <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for help<br />
Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th October 2005, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">While I technically agree with manojsharma there is a product I use called qkey.  It allows me to make changes to standard sessions while not actually changing the Baan code.  There are other products available - see the code and utilities forum for ~Vamsi (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=559)  code extension tool and RMC also makes a product that does the same thing. I like this method because you always run off the current Baan code.  The only draw back is when you run into a problem - Baan always wants you to remove your code to see if you still get the error.  So far the answer has always been yes in our case.  There is also a sample qkey script in the code and utilities forum.  Search the board and you should find more posts.</div></div><hr />

Besides the solutions  suggested by Mark , U can also learn and use AFS for this purpose . AFS allows users to integrate Baan standard programs with your own customized  programs . So instead oi  changing the standard , u should have ur own program to which uses function  server on standard session .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your advices. Can I ask you one more question please? If I enter sales order no. in Text of a session, is it possible to make a query to retrieve data based on the values entered in Text?<br />
<br />
If I am asking nonsense, please forgive me.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rameshr</div><div class="date">27th October 2005, 15:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with Manoj and we too never use filtering based on information in text field . <br />
<br />
However if u wish to search any specific information , u can use tttxt1430m000 with keyword 1 as Sales,Key word 2 as Order Line and value in the pattern .Then in the report u have the keyword  3 and 4 as sales order and position respectively. <br />
<br />
Good if this is sufficient for u.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry to disturb you again. I think my question was not clear to you. Actually I dont need to put text in Maintain Sales Order session and retrieve data later on.<br />
<br />
My problem is in Enter Inventory Transaction (tdilc1120m000) session, while doing inventory transfer of standard item  from one warehouse to another warehouse I need to put sales order number or project number to which the items are getting transferred. There is no any extra field like ReferenceA, ReferenceB, etc in this session.<br />
<br />
As I asked earlier, in Form2 of the Enter Inventory Transaction session, there are some fields (eg. Ledger Account, Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous, etc.), which are inactive for Inventory Transfer. Can we make any of them active and use it for putting sales order no or project no while doing inventory transfers? <br />
<br />
Or, is there any other way to sort it out please?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

I do not like using fields for what they are not meant to be used for.  Several reasons (1) Baan may eliminate the field, (2) you may decide to use the functionality the field is for, (3) Baan may decide to use the field.  I have seen baan do both (1) and (3) on us, but sometimes users do not tell us what they are doing.  So far we have not had any problems. Too many risks for me - but you can make that call yourself.<br />
<br />
Here is how a source extender helps me -  I copy the form to VRC and add my table field to the form.  Then I add code into the form to save whatever the user inputs into the field - usually I use events from main.table.io.  So this is one method to do what you want.  This method does not require source code and a patch to the session from really should not cause a problem.  With qkey I usually just have to recompile the code.<br />
<br />
A function server like Hitesh allows you to create your own form for a session with whatever fields you want.  Then use just use the stpapi fields to run the session in the background.</div></div><hr />
