<br />
Need some help on setting up the item surcharge to be automatically added to the item cost when item is received into warehouse.<br />
<br />
We are running using inventory valuation method of MAUC. When we added the Item Surcharges (ticpr1110m000), the estimated price is updated with the surcharge. But however when we actually received the item, no surcharges are calculated or shown in the Financial Integration at all. <br />
<br />
We have try a lot setting but still cannot get it working. Anyone know what have we missed out.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
