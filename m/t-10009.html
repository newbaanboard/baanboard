 I have installed Worktop but when I create a new document get the following message:<br />

<br />
Yes, this error means that the library &quot;ottdllreadmenu&quot; was not installed or detected on your Baan server. This library is used by Worktop to integrate the Menu Browser. The object should come with Service Pack 10 and so should have been installed on your system.<br />
So first check if this library is installed on the system. You can use the session &quot;Display Solutions By Update VRC&quot; for this (ttpmc2501m000). Check if solution 125484 has been installed, this is the first update for ttdllreadmenu. The latest solution for ttdllreadmenu is 127095. If it isn't installed yet, install it. Note that you must restart the shared memory service after you installed the library, otherwise it won't be loaded.<br />
<br />
For Worktop, all solution numbers required can be found in the generic solution 125180. This solution holds the solution numbers for the latest Worktop version, latest version of ttdllreadmenu and the latest version of tgintworktop (tgintworktop is a library used for integrating DEM into Worktop).<br />

         I installed all the solutions but when I create a new document I am getting another error:<br />
<br />
Fatal error: (bms.init) undefined function<br />
Fatal error: Cannot continue in ottstpoledaemon ()<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
This error means that it cannot find the function bms.init, which is a bshell function. This function has been introduced in porting set 6.1c.06.06, so my first reaction normally would be that you should upgrade your porting set. However, you already mentioned before that you do have this version of the porting set. So please check if 6.1c.06.06 is installed correctly. See solution 15219 for an overview of porting set numbers and solutions.<br />
If you can't get this working and keep getting this error you could consider uninstalling solution 130014. This upgraded you ttdllreadmenu to use the bms.init function. So if you uninstall it, it is not used anymore and the error should disappear. The disadvantage is that Worktop won't run the objects mentioned in the BMS mask data (session ttadv4188m000) anymore on startup, since this has been resolved with solution 130014.<br />

Still not able to run Worktop under older portingsets? You were busy with that some while ago...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Worktop does work with older porting sets, however for the latest upgrade a modification in the porting set was required. So you can run Worktop under older porting sets, but then you shouldn't install the latest solution 130014.<br />

<br />
          I got the worktop working by uninstalling the solution you suggested, however, when I open a session I have to minimize the worktop in order to see it, I would like to open the session and see it infront of the worktop.<br />
          Furthermore, when I go to ttaad2100m000- Maintain User Data(Enviroment tab), I can't see the following fields on the screen:<br />
<br />
1. Startup Program <br />
2.  Startup Desktop<br />
3. Startup Menu<br />
4. Level to Load at Startup<br />
<br />
      Is there any connection between the two?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Refer to the thread - Controling Windows (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8583&amp;highlight=tweak)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ivo Ladage</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 09:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Abuibra,<br />
<br />
Regarding the window on the background problem; the thread mentioned by NPRao does indeed offer a solution to the problem by instlling TweakUI. Another fix is by manually editing the sustems registry (or create a .reg file and open it): Open regedit, locate the &quot;ForegroundLockTimeout&quot; key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop and set its value to 0. <br />
This problem has nothing to do with the other problem you mentioned. The fields you mentioned are not on the &quot;environment&quot; tab but on the &quot;startup&quot; tab (the second one from the left). If these fields are missing I really doubt whether SP10 was installed correctly, since again this should have been OK...<br />

Yes, within the User Data session (ttaad2100m000) there are a few new options. In the &quot;startup&quot; tab of this session you will find a group called &quot;Worktop tree&quot;. It contains the fields &quot;Menu Browser&quot;, &quot;Baan Process Browser&quot; and &quot;Baan Workflow&quot;. To enable DEM for a user you must check the &quot;Baan Process Browser&quot; option for that user (do not forget to convert to runtime and to restart Worktop\BW).<br />
<br />

        I have checked the &quot;Baan Process Browser&quot; option and convert to runtime, still can't DEM to work. I have also try to login via the normal BW client and I can see the DEM menu for that particular user. Any more suggestion?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ivo Ladage</div><div class="date">21st May 2003, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Abuibra,<br />
<br />
If the &quot;Baan Process Browser&quot; is correctly set in the user data session then at least a &quot;Baan Process Browser&quot; node should appear in the Worktop navigation area (below the &quot;Baan menu Browser&quot; node). <br />
It might be that the convert to runtime did not succeed, I know there have been some problems with that in the past. So please check manually if the convert to runtime went OK: open the file $BSE\lib\user\u&lt;baanusername&gt; in vi or notepad, where &lt;baanusername&gt; is the baan user you use. There should be an entry called &quot;worktop_trees:&quot; and this entry should have the value &quot;MB PB&quot; (the PB stands for Process Browser). If this entry is missing you can try to add it manually.<br />

<br />
         Your solution worked fine but the worktop_trees:MB PB was missing and I had to insert it. However, now I am getting both the Menu Browser and the DEM Menu. Is it possible to only have one?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ivo Ladage</div><div class="date">22nd May 2003, 09:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Abuibra,<br />
<br />
Yes, of course that is possible. There are two things that determine whether you have the Menu Browser and\or Process Browser:<br />
<br />
-1- When you install Worktop locally (which I guess you did) then you will always have access to the Menu Browser. Reason for this is that when you install Worktop locally, you are considered to be an administrator which therefore always has the Menu Browser. <br />
Usually customers are using the Central Deployment feature of Worktop. This means you don't have to install Worktop locally on all clients but install it only once on a central server. When users are using this &quot;shared installation&quot;, they are considered not to be an admin and will not by deault have access to the Menu Browser.<br />
If you plan to install Worktop locally on all clients, you can change this default behavior: remove the line &quot;MBAccessAlways=1&quot; from the setup.ini file of the Worktop installation media before installation. <br />
<br />
-2- Access to the Menu Browser or Process Browser can be defined in the User Data session, as described before. In the 'manual' case; the entry MB in worktop_trees stands for menu Browser and the entry PB for process browser. So to have only the Process browser, define worktop_trees:PB<br />
