We are trying to import Finance budgets into Baan. Last year we imported them using Samples provided by Baan. It worked fine. This year, with windows 2000 operating system and Excel 2000 when we try to load budgets into Baan we are getting the message &quot;Microsoft Excel is waiting for another application to complete an OLE action&quot;. We don't know what to do. Can anybody help ??<br />

When I tested this I was running the same app twice and they seemed to butt heads.  Never did try to resolve the issue, but you can search the tools forum for OLE automation. Not sure what happened with this link (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1427&amp;highlight=OLE).<br />

Good Luck!<br />
