Baan support can still locate and send you a copy of the knowledge quest CD.  They did this for me about a year ago.  It will cost you.  Make sure you know how much before you 'formally' allow them to send the CD.  It's approx $100 USD.<br />

Hi-<br />
Do you meen contacting BGS in order to get the newest version of KQ? And what about the version you've got from them - what is ithe date of issue?<br />
<br />
We also tried to find out how to refresh our version - but we failed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baanboozeled</div><div class="date">1st December 2003, 23:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately the KQ only went to version  4.0 and dealt with  B IVc3.  Baan was very specific about KQ not supporting later versions of Baan but, I wanted the documentation anyway. <br />
