I need to integrate mobile devices with BaaN ERP.<br />
I want an initial simple solution.<br />
Is there a plug in s/w which allows us to get data from BaaN to our cell phone?<br />
Regards,<br />

Before I answer your question could you please elaborate on the domain and device.... Domain: Sales Force / Service / Projects??? Device/operating system: Blackberry, iPhone, iPad, OS4, Android etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">royspk</div><div class="date">18th August 2010, 13:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
I have BaaN4C4 and I would like to have sales data sent to a mobile which has web enabled capabilities.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ozzieworld</div><div class="date">19th August 2010, 10:33</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's for reporting: at this point we do not have an off the shelf BI Mobile BI tool. You could consider to use myday; export the sales reporting data into XLS and use some freeware. I am an iPad user and use Roambi which I like a lot. Infor is now exploring mobile BI as well for 2011.<br />
<br />
If it's calender and contacts: ERP LN FP7 will have support for syncing data with Microsoft Exchange which will then show up on any device connected to exchange including Blackberry, iPhone etc etc<br />
<br />
Does this help?</div></div><hr />

I am Thank you for the reply. I need to send sales order details to my Nokia set from Baan 4c4 as a first step.<br />

Thanks,<br />

This can be done through exchange or Infor Open SOA. We have no BI platform on Nokia though so you have to rely on 3rd party products for that</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rajnsingh</div><div class="date">21st September 2010, 02:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend the Infor Open SOA approach as well. However if you are looking for a simpler solution, we could develop an app for this requirement. We have a strong mobile apps development team and have developed several app's for Nokia's Symbian OS.</div></div><hr />
