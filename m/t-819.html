<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steve Johnson</div><div class="date">18th January 2002, 04:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We are on a Unix Sun system using Solaris 2.6. We have just upgraded from porting set 6.2a.03.03 to 7.1c.02. All works well. We then updated (our test platform) from Oracle 8.0.6 to 8.1.7. All works well again except Vertex api6.2. Does anyone have a working copy of api6.2 or a copy of the makefile to make api6.2 on the above configuration? We need ASAP. Thanks. (this thread is also on sig/third party):confused:</div></div><hr />

I copied the old (compiled) api into the bin directory and still no result. <br />
<br />
A few days later, my collegue did the same thing and somehow it worked for him. One of those things?<br />

Try using your old 6.2a.03.03 api6.2 file. If that does not work, have somebody _else_ try it ;)</div></div><hr />
