<br />
Does anyone out there know of a way to track specific UI events, such as opening a session, drilling down on a menu, tabbing through fields, etc.  We have varying network connection bandwidths in our facilities, and we are trying to determine a correlation between the network bandwidth and Baan performance.  More specifically, we are trying to provide a recommendation to our lower bandwidth sites in terms of the network bandwidth or hardware required for adequate Baan performance.  We have tuned our db, server hardware, and OS, as performance from our higher bandwidth sites is very good.  Any ideas or recommendations would be appreciated.<br />

<br />

5-1 Tools Technical Manual<br />
This chapter describes the User Interface (UI) page mode in BaanERP. The UI page mode improves the response times on networks where information <br />
processing can be delayed, for example, in a wide area network (WAN). In normal mode, the 4GL Engine validates the entered data per field. In the UI<br />
page mode, the 4GL Engine validates data per page, and not per field. The synchronous interaction between the UI driver and the bshell is therefore<br />
significantly reduced. The UI page mode is designed for experienced BaanERP users, because the interaction between BaanERP and the user is not as extensive as in the normal mode.<br />
In the normal mode, an error message is displayed immediately when data entered in the active field is not correct. In the UI page mode, an error-logging<br />
window appears, which shows all errors that occurred during the validation of all the data entered on the page. In the UI page mode, the UI driver groups together a number of UI objects that<br />
form a logical unit. A UI object is for example, a field, a button, or a check box. The logical unit is known as a page. A page can be an Overview window or a tab<br />
in a details session with more than one tab. If the UI page mode is selected, each UI object automatically belongs to a page.<br />
If the UI object is positioned on a tab, the object is considered part of the page associated with the related tab. In any other case, the UI object is part of the page<br />
associated with the Overview window. <br />
5 User Interface (UI) page mode	Tools Technical Manual	5-2<br />
The following functions are implemented in the UI page mode to improve<br />
network performance:<br />
The UI handles the movement from an active element to another element without any communication with the bshell. An active element is a portion of<br />
the screen that is currently operational or subject to command operations. Usually the cursor or a highlighted section shows the active element on the<br />
display screen. Active elements are, for example, fields, command buttons, check boxes, or list boxes. The UI client handles the behavior of the default button for the command buttons on a page.<br />
Events that result from status changes of UI objects are delayed until a complete page is filled, or another synchronization event occurs. The delayed<br />
events are sent into a minimum number of network frames.<br />
Tab processing<br />
When the UI page mode is selected, the UI driver processes Tab key movements in the details window. The Tab key sequence is identical to the creation order of<br />
the UI objects on a page. Other navigation keys, such as Page Up, Page Down, Home and End are reported to the bshell with the appropriate keystroke.<br />
Default Button handling When the UI page mode is selected, the UI driver handles the default command button. This is the command button that is highlighted when the dialog box is<br />
initially displayed. It can also be the command button with the bold border, indicating that it is automatically selected if you press Enter.<br />
Event processing If the UI page mode is selected, events are treated differently by the UI driver than when normal mode is selected. There are four different event categories:<br />
Suppressed events.<br />
Delayed events.<br />
Synchronization events.<br />
Bypass events.<br />
<br />
User Interface (UI) page mode<br />
Tools Technical Manual<br />
5-3<br />
Suppressed events<br />
If the UI page mode is selected, a UI object does not send suppressed events to the bshell. Instead, suppressed events are handled locally by the UI driver on the<br />
client. An example of a suppressed event is to move from an active element to another active element.<br />
Delayed events<br />
Status changes of UI objects can be delayed. As soon as a synchronization event occurs, for example, by clicking the Validate button, the changed UI objects are<br />
requested to synchronize their status with the 4GL engine. The delayed events are sent in the same order as the Tab key sequence of the UI objects on the page.<br />
This is not necessarily the order in which the user enters data. If possible, the delayed events are sent into one network frame to reduce response times.<br />
Synchronization events <br />
The synchronization events make sure that the statuses of the changed UI objects are sent to the bshell for validation.<br />
Synchronization events are:<br />
Selecting a menu item.<br />
Clicking a button.<br />
Moving to another tab.<br />
Moving from a synchronizing field to another field.<br />
Starting a browse session.<br />
Pressing a key that is not handled by the UI client.<br />
Resizing a window.<br />
Using the scroll bar.<br />
Bypass events<br />
The following bypass events are sent immediately to the bshell without first being synchronized with the delayed events:<br />
Using the online Help.<br />
Closing a Windows application that was started through the application Start feature of the UI client.<br />
Using OLE objects.<br />

How to select the UI page mode<br />
The UI page mode is selected per user to make sure that inexperienced BaanERP users cannot use it. You must define the UI page mode in the user profile of the<br />
user. The user profile is defined in the User Management module in BaanERP Tools. Follow these steps to select the UI page mode for a user:<br />
1 To select a user data template, or to create a new user data template, start the User Data Template (ttams1110m000) session in the Authorization<br />
Management System (AMS) module. Be sure to choose the Use Page Mode check box under Options on the System Data tab.<br />
2 Start the User Data (ttaad2500m000) session in the User Management module. Double-click the user for which you want to select the UI page mode<br />
to start the details session. <br />
3 Under Templates, enter the new User Data template, which is page-mode enabled. Click Save to return to the overview session.<br />
4 On the Specific menu choose Convert Changes to Run Time DD to rebuild the user profile in the run time database.<br />
5 Restart BaanERP to activate the changed user profile.<br />
Check that the following are true to verify that the UI page mode has been successfully selected:<br />
All the fields and options in the overview windows and detail windows are available.<br />
All commands on the menus of the menu bar in an overview window are available.<br />
On the Window menu the Validate command is available in an overview<br />
window.<br />
The Validate button is displayed on a details window.<br />

How to mark UI objects as synchronizing fields<br />
You can mark UI objects on an overview window or details window as synchronizing fields. This means that when you move from one active field or<br />
button to another field or button, all delayed events are sent to the bshell for validation. You can mark the following fields and buttons as synchronizing fields:<br />
Edit fields.<br />
Check boxes.<br />
Option buttons.<br />
List boxes.<br />
Combo boxes.<br />
You must use the Form Editor in BaanERP Tools to mark a form field as a synchronizing field. Complete the following steps to start the Form Editor:<br />
1 On the BaanERP Tools menu, click Application Development, and then click Forms to start the Forms (ttadv3500m000) session.<br />
2 Select a form. On the Specific menu choose Check Out to release the form for modification.<br />
3 On the Specific menu, choose Edit/View Form to start the Form Editor.<br />
Depending on the form type, the appropriate Form Editor starts. The following form editors are available in BaanERP:<br />
The Static Form Editor, which shows the form in an ASCII format. The Dynamic Form Editor, which is a graphical editor in a Windows format.<br />
You can carry out one of the following procedures to mark a field as a synchronizing field:<br />
Static Forms<br />
1 In the ASCII editor, click the field to start the Form Fields (ttadv3501s000)<br />
session.<br />
2 On the General tab, select the Synchronized check box.<br />
3 Click Close to return to the Form Editor.<br />
4 On the Specific menu, choose Check In to finish the procedure.<br />
<br />

Dynamic Forms<br />
1 In the graphical Dynamic Form Editor, click the field to start the Field Properties session.<br />
2 On the Miscellaneous tab, select the Synchronized check box.<br />
3 Click OK to return to the graphical Dynamic Form Editor.<br />
4 On the Specific menu, choose Check In to finish the procedure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just a provoking thought ....<br />
as you are using c4 and running on unix .... did you consider to have the remote (lower bandwidth) users use ba6.1 instead of GUI? Depending on what they actually are doing, many users are even happier with ba6.1, as the absence of of mouse often speeds up their work.<br />
just a thought<br />

webtop servers in the remote locations and cache the forms there. <br />
I think that would significantly decrease the amount of bandwith going over your WAN.<br />
