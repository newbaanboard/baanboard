<br />
I have been requested to add BAR CODES to the BaaN report &quot;Storage List by Item&quot; (tdpur442101000). I have to print the bar codes corresponding to some data already included in the report such as the PO number and the PO Line number. For this request, I have to use the bar code 128A.<br />
<br />
Could someone please help me on this? I really have no idea about how to deal with bar codes and I would be very greateful if you could help me.<br />
<br />
:confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.<br />

<br />
we used barcodeprinting with kyocera printers with prescribe.<br />
<br />
Just one codesquence on the report like !R! BARC 23, 'tdsls040.item' !EXIT!.<br />
<br />
We used Code 128 B (all characters which can be displayed are included, numbers, alpha). You can download company logos to the printer on standard memory cards.<br />
<br />
You can mix baan report layout and prescribe commands.<br />
<br />
This works fine.<br />
<br />

<br />
I appreciate your information. But I am not used to these sentences. Could you please give me more details related to the mix you tell me? In case you have time...<br />

Thanks,<br />

Hello Carlos,<br />
based on printers there are several ways to print barcodes with your documents.<br />
If you use HP Laserjets with Jetdirect Network and Barcode DIM modules, youre able to print barcodes directly.<br />
Also you can use ELP Software (Does the same as DIM modules) but software based (also 2D barcodes on all PCL language based printers).<br />
With this solution you are able to use different brands of printers.<br />
Or you can use bwprint !<br />
As i say, based on your printers hardware and network there are several ways  to realize barcode printing.<br />
<br />

<br />
you can find detailed information for free on the kyocera homepage:<br />
<br />
www.kyoceramita.com<br />
<br />
PRESCRIBE Programming Manual<br />
Tools to download pictures to the printer. (Kyocera IC Link V. 2.8)<br />
<br />
We used the FS-4000DN Modell, first bin normal baan printouts, second bin is for lables with barcodes.<br />
<br />
Please find enclosed a sample, the barcode commando from prescribe, inside the commas there is just a baan report field like tdsls040.orno.<br />
(BARC 23, N, '0=Prefix to asure an order number is scanned not an item<br />
FFFFFF = tdsls040.orno', 60, 60 (Scaling of the barcode), EXIT!.<br />
<br />
The advantage is we have unix environment and do not use windows printer (bwprint is not possible // but is very good on windows server environments).<br />
<br />
If you have an Kyocera printer you can just send a shell command like<br />
<br />
echo &quot;!R! BARC 23, N, 'ABC123', 60, 60; EXIT;&quot; &gt; lpr -Pprinter and test the printout.<br />
<br />

There is no much need to run for a printyer with a BarCoding Capability as the BaaN s/w itself is  capable of printing the Barcodes in any formats.<br />
<br />
To know more about BaaN barcode capabilities, just under Print Preview, Under help - Barcodes<br />
<br />
Also for developing a report with Barcode - see the function bc$ <br />
<br />
Again this is not a complicated development...<br />
<br />
I had implemented the same for Barcodes of some products with different dimension - Labels/ Reports with normal thermal printers / Laser printers<br />
<br />
Again it is upto you , to decide on which technology to adopt.<br />
<br />
For more details please free to contact me on ............<br />

<br />
Thanks to all of you for your info provided!<br />
<br />
I have finally used the device WIN (default windows printer) to get the bar codes printing. With this option the local user setting has to be updated so that the bar codes are correctly printed.<br />
<br />
Some settings modification have to be done in local. 3 files (bwprint.exe, axbarcode.ocx and axbarcode.lic) have to be placed on local (c:\program files\baan\bin) so that the bar codes are corerctly printed.<br />
 <br />
Find in attached file the information related to bar code printing.<br />
<br />
Kind rergards,<br />
