We have so many customizations that we will load no more Service Packs.  Do we need to pay the yearly maintenance fee to legitamately run Baan?  I know if we drop maintenance, we can no longer enter incidents with Baan Support.  What else would we lose?  Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know it doesn't sound fair, and people have invoked lawsuits, I have no idea on how the turned out, but that's still Infor's policy as far as I know...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">7th May 2010, 08:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Dave: Well, I don't think that would be legal behaviour of Infor; of course it might depend a little on the contract, but in most of the time you buy the right to use the software, not the right to use the software *on a server* or *as long as you have support*. If anyone knows od such cases first hand, please make them public - that always helps to convince companies that inethical behaviour is not good for business.<br />
<br />
More important however, what also depends on the contract is the right to update to a new version (in that case, ERP LN) for no additional license fees. Normally that right is in the standard support. So, lylitalo, you've got to read your contract with infor. If it's in, and if your planning to upgrade in a couple of years, you might want to stay with the contract. Infor FLEX (sort of: well-you-might-upgrade-without-having-payed-support-let's-see-what-mutual-beneficial-arrangements-we-can-find-program) probably won't be around always. Of course, if you are already planning to leave that software and use SAP (which is your own fault, then),  you may as well end the support contract now.<br />

Well, like i said, many people have contested it and i don't have privy to any of the outcomes, but that's how it is.<br />
