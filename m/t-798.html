Printing to email device.<br />
How to set up email integration correctly?<br />
Follow the next steps:<br />
<br />
1. Using session &quot;Device Data&quot; (ttaad3500m000) create a new device, called EMAIL for example. Fill in:<br />
Device Type: Rewrite File<br />
4GL Program: ttstpconv<br />
Argument: RTF: outlook.exe %s<br />
Path: outlook.rtf<br />
Page Length: 66<br />
<br />
Notes: Take care that the PATH variable at the client computer is set correctly, in that way that the executable &quot;outlook.exe&quot; can be found. To test, make sure you are able to go to a DOS prompt and type outlook.exe &lt;filename&gt; from several different directories. It should bring up a new message window with your file attached. <br />
Instead of RTF conversion, it is also possible to choose ASCII conversion.<br />
The file outlook.rtf is created in %BSE% at the client pc<br />
The following command is executed on the client pc (in this case): outlook.exe ${BSE}\outlook.rtf<br />
So, in case the BSE path at the client pc = c:\Program Files\Baan, the command is:<br />
outlook.exe c:\Program File\Baan\outlook.rtf<br />
<br />
2. When printing, select device 'EMAIL'<br />
<br />
3. Now, an email will be created, having a rtf file as attachment.</div></div><hr />

Three quick questions:<br />
<br />
1.  I set up an outlook device as you suggested and adjusted the path to include outlook.  When I print to this device, the temp file is created no problem and no errors are reported, yet (whether Outlook is started or not) I get no new message.  Am I missing something?  In the MS Outlook documentation (I'm using 2000) it gives command line arguments of:  outlook.exe /a &quot;path/filename&quot;.  In your device information,  I don't see the &quot;/a&quot;.  Trying to add it caused an error for me.<br />
<br />
2.  Are you aware of a way to have the output not be a file, but the actual body of the outlook message?  Since Outlook supports both RTF and HTML formats I would think it is possible.  Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
3.  Are you aware of a way to specify the To:  Address with this technique?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

I did a little more looking, and it seems that the slash before the filename is the wrong one (&quot;\&quot; instead of &quot;/&quot;).  Any way to switch that?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
You can use the send message option and then click the recipients to fill in the TO, CC, BCC addresses.<br />
<br />
I think that option might send the output as the body of the email instead of an attachment.<br />
<br />
I cannot test that out now, because the email is not working in the BaaN-5.2, we have a case logged with BaaN.<br />
<br />
I think you can do it with the Unix mailx command.<br />
<br />
Another alternative is to make your own DLL, with the cmf functions to put the contents into the body of the email object.<br />
<br />
The functions are available to use http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_emessage_connector_cmf_setattachmentbody</div></div><hr />
