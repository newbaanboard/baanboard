We are a global manufacture with a distributed CAD environment (4 main locaitons around the world).  I am interested in any integrations involving a distributed CAD environment that are managing their CAD data in PDM, and sharing that CAD data between sites?<br />
If so, how is the issue of storing &amp; loading the CAD files handled?  Is there a replication scheme, or something else? <br />
 <br />
Any info. would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
