<br />
Please let me know if any body using  EDI in Baan IV c4.  <br />
Is it possible to use EDI only for sales order generation internally.  <br />
<br />
This is examble (may be assumbtion)<br />
        1.   We will have some ascii file for sales order. This file will have all necessary information related to sales order and kept in common folder<br />
        2.   Thru EDI,  sales order will be generated. <br />
<br />
Is this scenario is possible with EDI ?<br />
<br />
(Though we are using AFS for sales order generation, we wanted to use EDI for some reasons)<br />
<br />
Please advise.        <br />
<br />
regards.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
we use internal EDI for years. Between a LN and an B4c4 site.<br />
(Between B4/B4 in the past)<br />
<br />
A purchase order at LN creates a sales order at B4<br />
The delivery advice at B4 creates a goods receipt at LN<br />
The invoice at B4 creates the ACP at LN site.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pbenven</div><div class="date">17th May 2013, 18:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We also use this to accept orders from a customer with high mix/low volume/frequent sales orders. We use an email parsing tool to monitor an email box. Scripts create the orders1, 2, 3 files from the email message and upload to Baan server. Baan Job periodically checks upload location for files, processes any if they exist.<br />
<br />
Do make sure your system is properly patched because there may be problems that would make it impossible to troubleshoot.<br />
<br />
One thing I am having difficulty with: even though my orders3 file contains tdsls041.revn information and my conversion setup points to it, the sales order line is not populated with it. Clues?</div></div><hr />
