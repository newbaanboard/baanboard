<br />
I have written a .dll to connect to BaaN using a DCOM object.<br />
The dll is in CS (C#), but we also have it in VB&gt;NET and VB6.<br />
Using the .dll, we can upload data to BaaN from Excel, MS-Acces or any other application.<br />
<br />
But as said, a DCom object must be seen in the Component Services environment.<br />
<br />
At our company we worked with BaaNERP version 7.1d.<br />
When we setup a configuration in the Configuration Selector and save it, the Class name &quot;Baan.Application.&lt;savedname&gt;&quot;  is automatically added as DCOm object.<br />
<br />
But now comes the 'problem':<br />
We have recently installed version 8.5a.015. <br />
When we setup a configuration there, NO dcom object is added.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone who have the same problem, or maybe solved this?<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you! Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
Two things to try. <br />
<br />
1. Try opening the worktop (I am assuming you are using one) as Administrator. Now create a profile and save it and check.<br />
2. Try uninstalling and installing the Worktop &amp; BW. <br />
<br />
If that doesn't fix, may be some playing with the registry will be required or if you can do, try re-registering the component.<br />
<br />
** Take a backup of registry before touching. **<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pedroagp</div><div class="date">6th February 2015, 11:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Found the solution to it, and in matter of fact it wasn't really a problem and the entries weren't missing.<br />
<br />
My problem was on a 64bit machine, and in thoses cases MMC defaults to the 64bit view, where the Baan Application DCOM config is not visible, well, because it is 32 bit.<br />
<br />
Launching MMC with the -32 flag (start &gt; run &gt; mmc -32) and adding the Component Services snap-in afterwards, I was able to see the &quot;missing&quot; entries and define their permissions as expected.<br />
