Just wanted to know if anyone has tried or done data migration of history data (inventory transactions, sales order history and Purchase order history) from other systems into Baan. <br />
<br />
We are currently doing a Baan implementation (on IV C4) and there is a requirement to get the sales , purchase and inventory movement data for the previous years from the old ERP system into Baan. Just looking for ideas or opinions on this. :confused: <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
you could use<br />
<br />
(1) Exchange module<br />
Import data, specify field separator, modify data while importing (3gl functionality)<br />
<br />
(2) Import sequential dump (dump file created with script or e.g. excel)<br />
<br />
Important:<br />
<br />
The data from the old system has to match the domain restriction  of the baan system.<br />
<br />
If you import old order numbers you have to specify a number range (old data) new data created with baan. <br />
<br />
You have to set up the tcmcs047 (first free number) table.<br />
<br />
Maybe better to import data in own company number or seperate tables.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

For WIP Production orders what we did was create the production order.  Adjust on the material already issued and re-issue it to the production order.  I think, but can't recall, that for purchase orders we only moved the ones that were open.  When I think back I probably would have moved the history data into some new baan tables and created some reporting around that.  I do not think I would attempt to load all the baan tables that would be involved.</div></div><hr />
