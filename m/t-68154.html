How to perform Baan Automation together with BOI data<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
 <br />
For years we are working with the BOI's used with BCK 1.3 software, Create COM objects, register them on the server, etc. All working fine.<br />
We have build on this technology an extranet, together with web services.<br />
Now we want to stop using the Java Client and BOI COM dll's on the Windows server side (32 bits, registry setting) and go on with the Baan Automation (Baan Client on the server).<br />
I saw some samples of Baan Automation, which are working fine, even with return variables in reference calls.<br />
We can build off course our own library, and then return a separated string, containing the records, but most of the logic is already there in our BOI's.<br />
So  we still want to use the exisiting BOI libraries (baan side) to retrieve, update and delete the data. Therefore I call the class through ASP.NET by:<br />
 <br />
'Sample code<br />
BaanObj = Server.CreateObject(&quot;Baan4.Application.default&quot;)<br />
BaanObj.Timeout = 30<br />
'Predefined variables:<br />
ccur.f.Text = &quot;USD&quot;<br />
ccur.t.Text = &quot;USD&quot;<br />
StructCurrency = 0 'Reference variable to the BaanObj call<br />
StructError = 0  'Reference variable to the BaanObj call<br />
ReqdFields = &quot;&quot;<br />
CallId = 0<br />
SetSize  = 1000 <br />
SetComplete = &quot;N&quot;<br />
Company As Integer = 100</div></div><hr />

<br />
The containers seems still be there after you return in the .NET code.<br />
A new function on the baan side with a reference of the container from .NET can read out the container. If you parameterize it with an index parameter, you are able to read out the complete container record by record and return it to .NET code.<br />
<br />
Also the 4K string limit is solved with this.</div></div><hr />
