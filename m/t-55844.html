Never having seen 5c, we have no idea.  Any input?  Has anyone gone from 5b to 5c?  We have to give our input on Thursday, 5/14/09, to a Corporate representative and we're in the dark.  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done this upgrade in the past, it's not that complicated, Infor supplies software to facilitate it although it's a bit old (doesn't reflect latest SP's).<br />
This software extracts some tables, than you import your tables with the 5b dd, recreate them with the new dd and the migration software updates some tables again from your export out of 5b.<br />
<br />
5b is no longer updated, that should be enough reasons to upgrade. <br />
