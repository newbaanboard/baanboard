Just been playing with this and can not seem to get it to do much besides log into baan.  Just wondering if someone has a sample script they might want to share - either drill down through the menus or maybe to just launch a session using run program.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

Found your writing. I'm playing with AutoIt right now. I 'd like to do a lot of reports (~2000), so I wrote a script. My problem is that I cannot find a solution for how to wait until a report is done. I put already sleep inside, but for some records a report runs for a long time, for others ends for a second. But AutoIt does not recognize that a session is still active/working.<br />
<br />
Any idea ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">13th February 2015, 09:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using 'expect' to automate some Baan sessions on UNIX Servers before AFS was available. The idea: When you run Baan in ASCII mode (ba6.1), the data stream from/to the &quot;terminal&quot; can be interpreted and used to control.<br />
 <br />
The tool 'expect' uses a programming language call 'tcl' (tool command language, read as tickle) which is a bit different to others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frajer</div><div class="date">13th February 2015, 12:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx for some ideas. But the point is that we've moved from unix to windows server (and from ORA to SQL). So, different approach now to automating sessions :)</div></div><hr />
