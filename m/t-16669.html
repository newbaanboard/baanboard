<br />
Second I know our site was assigned a customer code and ID when we first purchase Baan for the branding.  I am not sure if that is still the case, especially since this is Baan V - I recommend contacting the support center.<br />

Try the command licmon6.2 B from your /baanerp/bse/bin directory.if your porting sets are latest you get the all Brand info. We have the same error before while installing the Baan5c on our systemwhat we did was ran the Patch objects after system crash and brought the system in demo mode, sent the Request systems configuration to Baan and got the new license keys -à applied those keys and ran validate the tools session. Baan support responded right away for us and all tasks completed in less than 2 hours. I strongly suggest you to take Baan support help in this regard.<br />

Good luck,<br />
