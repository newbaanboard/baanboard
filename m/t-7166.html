I have heard one is type of license is come with the support, if a customer discontinued the support service, the license is also expired as well.  But I have heard the other one, which even the customer discontinued on the support service, but they are still allow to use the baan software legally... is it true?<br />

Thanks,<br />

It doesn't matter whether you receive technical support or not after it. Having valid /.brand dir (in Unix) allows you to use your Baan untill End date expires.<br />
<br />
This concerns concurrent licences maybe named licences have some differences but i guess it is the same.</div></div><hr />
