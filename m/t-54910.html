<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">28th January 2009, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone,<br />
I have a question about the archive company set-up in Baan IV.<br />
Is it possible to create the archive companies so that no transactions can be made there once data is archived?<br />
Is there some sort of parameter that can be set to make the maintain sessions read-only or something like that?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions.<br />
Sandy</div></div><hr />

The only way I am aware of to do this is to set table authorizations to be read only.  I don't believe there is anything you can do to prevent super users from full access to the data.<br />

Just to continue a bit further:<br />
<br />
Archiving is the process of removing specific data from the operational<br />
company. For each session, you will learn about the actual data that can be<br />
archived. The Baan sessions let you decide whether to archive the data into<br />
an archive company or just delete the data from the operational company.<br />
Generally, when any of the Baan archiving sessions are executed, the system<br />
runs through two sequential procedures. First, the master data is copied to<br />
the archive company to keep the references to the archived data. Second, the actual data is copied to the archive company and deleted from the<br />
operational company. Besides the general data, you also have the possibility<br />
to archive any attached texts. There is usually a check box that you can select in order to archive texts.<br />
After the archiving sessions have been executed, the archived data will not be available for analysis and reporting in the operational company. The data is<br />
moved to the archive company. Users should only have “Read-only” rights<br />
to prohibit modifying the archived data within the archive company.<br />
Archiving is usually not reversible. For example, the archived data cannot be<br />
brought back into the operational company</div></div><hr />

<br />
 If however the intention is to prevent accidental data entry in archieve company , u can play with application  para (like delete / reset all first free numbers , make all ledger/dim blocked for manual entry , enter signal code for all item to the effect that it is &quot;ARCHIEVE COMPANY!!!&quot; etc) .</div></div><hr />

select 'REVOKE select, update, delete, insert on baan.||TABLE_NAME|| from r_baan' from all_tables where owner = 'BAAN' and TABLE_NAME LIKE '%200';</div></div><hr />
