In the most part I know what the abbreviation stands for but what I am trying to get a handle on are the subtle differences and names they are known as -  for eg Big Project / Little Project and Configurator / PCF / CF.  In an ideal world I need a glossary of terms - does such thing exist and, if so where can I find it?<br />
