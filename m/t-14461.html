does anybody know, how to handle RFID data with Baan.<br />
Do I have to make some adaptions or is anything pre installed in Baan.<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
I assume your site want to implement RFID. Do you also have budget for middleware or you want to build up a system from scratch that talk to BaanERP from the RFID sensors?<br />

So I don't know by know wether they need middleware or not, but I think, data are  better to handle, with middleware.<br />
For my opinion, I can choose between two ways.<br />
1. reading the tags with a handheld -&gt; bring it to the workstation -&gt; read data via AFS into baan<br />
or <br />
2. open the particular session and read the data straight to the field (like Barcode).<br />
Am I right?<br />
Are where differences between C4 and ERP redarding RFID?<br />

<br />
In absence of Baan-ready middleware, my preferred method of integrating RFID (or any other remote data collection mechanism) would be to build a simple UI software with AFS connection to Baan server. This simple UI will be the main interface for the end users while using the RFID readers. It's where they get the work instructions (purchase receipt, sales delivery, etc.), get status of their data upload and error warning if there's one. This is because, in my opinion, the Baan Windows UI is too complicated for average warehouse or factory floor operators.<br />
<br />
Baan IV and BaanERP both have AFS, but AFS script written for BaanIV can't readily be used in BaanERP because the functional architecture is quite different<br />

<br />
Please be aware of the pitfall that many Baan users have fallen into when lookiung at RFID or barcoding: There are two ways to do this: 1) the usual way is to replace separate Baan sessions by RFID and/or barcode per session. 2) is to first configure sessions into the most optimal way to run Baan (for example instead of 10 Baan session to for example do receipts, just run one &quot;new&quot; session from the RFID/Scan middleware.<br />
<br />
If you want to know more of what I mean, then please check out our website www.nxtstp.nl and give me a call on the number located there, or reply here on the board, (but it is often easier to talk on the phone to explain the relevant differences.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paul P</div><div class="date">10th June 2004, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">That's right, Michiel. If you can program the middleware to just have one centralized connection to BaanERP server, then you can save bundles on licence and maintenance costs<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">11th June 2004, 13:25</div></div><div class="posttext">RFID is very much a logical step on from barcoding, we have done some testing and found a lot of the RFID technology is not ready.  We also found the existing technology to not quite live up to expectations in terms of how close you have to be read the tags for example.<br />
<br />
The first thing you need to do is some trials with the tags/readers/writers you intend to use to see if what is currently available will even work in the way you intend.  <br />
<br />
Rather then re-invent the wheel it would be best to customise some existing barcode middleware to cope with your particular RFID requirements.  Don't forget, you still need to label the products/pallets with 'human readable' information (maybe barcodes for customers as well).  Some barcode label printers can also write RFID tags, so it would seem best to integrate the RFID system with barcoding, generating all the information in one go.<br />
<br />
We are looking at the concept of 'smart pallets' with www.arcgateway.com (http://www.arcgateway.com) <br />
who already offer a barcoding middleware solution for Baan</div></div><hr />
