<br />
I need your help. We develop applications in Visual Basic .NET for terminals of radio frequency and we connect to some ERPs. <br />
Now it's time to connect to baan. Our client uses Baan IV, i don't know wich database.<br />
We need to send/receive &quot;Selects, Inserts and Updates&quot; to baan, what is the best way to do that?<br />
There exists any dll? any specific tool to do it?<br />
<br />
<br />
best regards, :cool:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 00:36</div></div><div class="posttext">most third party data capture systems use the DDC module of baan. Baan comes with some sample code to help develop a DDC driver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">24th November 2004, 05:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I think an alternative may be to use expensive Baan BOI module. (We have previously been quoted for this by Baan partner for BarCode application which we handled with specific programs) <br />
<br />
Whilst I have not used DDC I have looked at it and compiled test programs and would stongly recommend this approach as it is free (except for the program development).  <br />
<br />
I am sure that SSA will not recommend this approach, but will propose the high cost BOI or some other module.  <br />
<br />
The most elegant (and execution efficient) approach would probably be to develop/customise specific purpose baan 4/3gl programs.  SSA would also impose very high costs for this work.  <br />
<br />
As for &quot;...send/receive &quot;Selects, Inserts and Updates&quot; to baan...&quot;, depending on your application, the tables involved may be more involved than you anticipate. -- You may need at least some quidence/consulting from SSA/Partner (or other) development people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i was in my client, they have baan IV + SQL Server Databases.<br />
I need to get information (about products,...), create new stock entries. I think the best way is to call the procedures used by baan to do that, is that possible?<br />
Run procedures/functions used by baan outthere of baan?<br />
I develop in Visual Basic .NET, what is the best way to do that kind of work under baan?<br />
Can anyone help me?<br />
Anyone have a little example of accessing/calling some procedures of Baan? (there is no problem if it's made in VB6)<br />

<br />
I don't know, but I have an idea how it could work:<br />
In Baan you can create AFS-Dlls. This Dlls do the control of Baansessions. You can call the functions inside the Dlls by the OLE Interface. Complicate, but might work.<br />
<br />
I've never tried this! (but I will try it as soon as I will find the time  :rolleyes:  )<br />
<br />
&gt;Run procedures/functions used by baan outthere of baan?<br />
<br />
Yes, by the OLE Interface<br />
<br />
&gt;I develop in Visual Basic .NET, what is the best way to do that kind of work &gt;under baan?<br />
<br />
There a two ways: OpenWorld an the OLE Interface<br />
<br />

<br />
If you have installed a Baan Client you can find examples and documentation<br />

Look also this thread, its about similar questions:<br />

Maybe the Section Similar Threads at the end of the page can be very helpfull also.<br />

I am currently mopping up after myself for doing a VB integration through OLE.<br />
Because of the single-threaded architecture and unsupported bugginess of the Baan OLE integration, it is no solution for potential high traffic integration.<br />
<br />
DDC is probably a better bet but I never worked with that. <br />
<br />
There are some workarounds too, but a lot rides on whether or not your customer is prepared to sacrafice  a license.</div></div><hr />

Which begs the question... What is improved with ERP LN? What are the methods inwards, outwards and two way communication?</div></div><hr />

Francesco,  You sure have Talent !<br />
<br />
If LN exists.  There is still no evidence that anyone other than the beta sites has or will ever see it.  <br />
<br />
It has now been almost half a year since the release and we don't hear about implementation problems or successes. &quot;The silence is deafening.&quot;<br />

I am not at privilege to disclose everything. In short here are my thoughts. I know that we/Boeing/other customers in California &amp; Michigan, and the 2 other Reger customers are all confirmed to move to Gemini. I have a BaaN/SSA-6.1-ERP-LN environment on one of our systems. We have a project to study the ERP and Tools differences to make up a good process to migrate from one version to another.<br />
<br />
I have seen many of your postings on BB and the BaaN IT-Toolbox. BaaN/SSA was not heavily involved with our implementations when we moved from Reger-Alpha/Beta versions to Reger-GA. We did it ourselves with the help of BaaNs conversion tools and rest of the tools we developed internally and BaaN Support helped us out with some tools issues. We have extensive customizations, 25 databases (50+ companies) and we do code migrations every week and table/domain changes every two weeks. Infact, we finished upgrading Service Packs-3, 4, 5 in 24 hours downtime last weekend speaks of the complexity of our systems and the efforts expected to move to Gemini.<br />
<br />
I can publish our results and share my experience when we moved to Gemini next year. I am more technical person than functional. But some of your observations are true that BaaN doesnt seem to be in the Big-5 as in the 1990s but its still a good product and SSA is trying to do a great job. SSA/BaaN is quite lenient compared to Oracle databases that they didnt desupport any of the older BaaN versions or forced customers to upgrade. Poor marketing and management might have tarnished the image. But there is no perfect software product in the market. I have found differences within the Tools versions from BaaN-5abc to 5.2 and 6.1 versions. So it depends on the customers, if they want to upgrade to the latest version and what they gain from it. Everyone out there wants to see who takes the first bold step than being the one to take it. We were the first Reger customer.</div></div><hr />

I am  very pleased to know that you have a LN6.1 project lined up and you will be able continue with your leading-edge advisory position on Baanboard. <br />
<br />
Given that LN6.1 has been available for almost half a year, it is very telling that you know of only a few, albeit very large, customers who have or intend to start projects. <br />
<br />
Because of the scale of your implementation and that of Boeing and probably the other companies in US whom you mentioned, your companies have enomous clout and influence with SSA.  For others of us with much less clout, it does appear that SSA will only provide LN6.1 when it is coupled with lucrative consulting and migration contracts.<br />
