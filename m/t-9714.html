<br />
As I usual have to write technical specifications before launching the development process, I was wondering if I could find a software able to design &quot;Baan forms&quot;, only for displaying into texts documents to show how the forms must look like?<br />
<br />
Does any of you know something about it?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you need true look alike, then the best is to use any RAD (Rapid Application Development) program (like Visual whatever), where you just use it to build froms and then do a print screen of them and paste into your application.<br />
Check on the web for RAD, you may encounter one you can use freely or as shareware that does what you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bastien</div><div class="date">22nd April 2003, 17:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for the idea Victor. It's nearly what I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
I am actually (trying) to work with a drawing program, but I'm not happy with the result. It's too far from Baan ergonomy. :(<br />
<br />
I had a look on the web for RAD programs; I found a couple of them but they are not 'complete' enough for me... (muti-forms sessions, zoom, list ...)<br />
<br />
Do you know a precise RAD program I could use?<br />
:confused: <br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">23rd April 2003, 23:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it should be more than enough, multi forms under windows uses normal tabs of windows and selection fields also use standard drop down boxes, etc.<br />
<br />
The zoom is just a window with a small title bar and only a close button (I used to build them also, to be used as floating toolbars in MS Visual C++/Basic... a loong time ago, way before than w2k) - this can also be defined in the properties of a main window form on any RAD tool to simulate your zoom boxes.<br />
<br />
Remember, Baan is using standard window gadgets, nothing new... Since I no longer develop, I can't help you on any RAD tool, probably the ones I knew are not free or have disappear...</div></div><hr />
