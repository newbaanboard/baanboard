When we run batch jobs we are using the Baan to determine the schedule. My understanding of how it works is that a job scheduled for midnight would run and complete then reschedule itself for the next day. This seems to tie up a Baan license for each job that is on the schedule nomatter when the job is suppose to run. <br />
<br />
My problem is that we are running a seperate instances of Baan for each geographic location.  Therefore, we are tieing up several licenses to do batch processing. It is also my understanding that there is no way to tell when a job actually completes. <br />
<br />
Is there a more effecient way to run batch jobs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We used to use Job Daemon, but found it problematic. We now schedule all jobs through Unix cron and start them with rc.startjob.  This only uses a bshell while the job is actually running, and uses a separate bshell for each job.<br />
<br />
I set all our jobs as &quot;Periodic&quot; with a period of 1 hour. When you use rc.startjob, the status must be &quot;Free&quot; and the current time must be on or after the &quot;Next Execution Date&quot; on the job.<br />
<br />
You can tell when a job has run by monitoring the ttaad500, ttaad510, ttaad511, and ttaad512 tables. We have custom scripts that monitor these and page us if the job has errors, etc.</div></div><hr />
