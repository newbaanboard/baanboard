<br />
New to this forum. Our Baan iv b2 programmer passed away last week. I'm the Network Admin. assisting on his behalf until we find a replacement. I'm a network guy. Don't use Baan other then setup clients and administer the server<br />
<br />
The application programmer had in his Outlook a schedule as a monthly task &quot;Update Inventory Accuracy Code for new exclusions&quot;<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what this refers to and what he may do?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it is in reference to the Cycle Count reports or Inventory Adjustments Reports.<br />
<br />
What and where is the Inventory Accuracy Code? Where does it get changed and how do you determine what it gets changed to?<br />
<br />
Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I could think of for this was the ABC code.  And I was told this was set based off the Perform ABC Analysis by item - which runs based off your parameters.  Of course I am on 4c4 and this may not even be related.</div></div><hr />
