Did you already contact your local Infor representative? Infor have standard tools to migrate your BaanIV data to ERPLN called DCA (Data Conversion Adapter) tool. <br />
With this DCA tool you can migrate either just master data, but also all BaanIV data including history and it have several options for data recoding and data selection. <br />
It is a proven and very powerful and flexible tool used at several customers in the last 8-9 years. If interested we can give you customer references.<br />
