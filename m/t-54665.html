We have heard in the past that especially consultants and Infor (service) partners do this for their demo installations (usually complete system on one virtual machine). How does the process look like? Is it similar to the standard licensing?<br />
<br />
There are lot of advantages if a such demo system can be used - especially if you have many customizations and you'll make sure that in standard the system works fine. Also it can be used for basic tests which cannot be done on an existing test environment etc.<br />

<br />
the procedure is the following (in my mind):<br />
you can install a new system (also in a VM). For using this you need a licence server (which cannot run in a VM, this must run on a real mashine). As demo you get a licence key between some minutes, this licence key is for a using time of 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
better way for existing customers:<br />
create a separate VRC for the standard updates on your test mashine. This must be paralell to the live-update VRC. (as I know you have this VRC-structure on your system). The create a new company in this VRC/package combination and you can test the standard without customzations.<br />
<br />
Demo for Freelancers and Partners:<br />
in Germany the Freelancers that I know (including me) have paid official and original licences and a support contract like every other customer too. So we have no demo-licences.<br />
Partners can get demo-licences for about half a year and have to renew these after these 6 months. They pay a partner fee for this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a lot for the information and recommendations. It would just be &quot;too good to be true&quot; if one could obtain a demo license for free and extend it after the license period has expired... The idea of creating a new standard VRC company is interesting but another reason (except testing standard software) is testing of update and installation procedures - such as the installation of a new portingset (what in fact is most important for us atm). For this kind of tests an own standalone environment would be the best solution...<br />

Whenever someone would log into your test box, it would just take from your normal pool of licenses.<br />
