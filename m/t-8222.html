There are not really any 'optimal' settings for the shared memory parameters. These settings determine the behaviour of the OS shared memory allocated to Baan. <br />
<br />
shmvalues6.1 just defines the, <br />
<br />
1 Memory segment size, <br />
2 Memory start address, <br />
3 Memory step difference between segment start addresses, <br />
4 Max number of memory segments <br />
<br />
The default memory segment size is 16Mb. If you make this smaller, more segments will be used; if you make this bigger, less segments will be used. As far as I know, the number of segments has no impact whatsoever. <br />
<br />
The memory start address and step size just define the location of the segments in memory - these values should not normally need to be changed. <br />
<br />
Max number of memory segments is used to limit shared memory size available to Baan. The default is 30 segments which is pretty high - this upper limit will prevent any Baan memory problems intereferring with other OS applications/functionality. <br />
<br />
So there are no optimal values for any of these parameters - they are just available so that memory settings can be tweaked should memory issues arise. <br />
<br />

Use of shared memory on Windows NT by BaanERP for BackOffice / use_shm_info <br />
Author K Van den Dool Creation Date: 01 Mar 1999 Alternate ID:  <br />

Product: port6.2a.02.01 Sub Product:  Session: shmserv.exe <br />
Package: tt Version: B50 Release: b <br />
Solution Type: KR:Question <br />
 <br />
Solution description <br />
VERSION(S):<br />
BaanERP (for BackOffice)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The BaanERP database driver uses by default its own memory structure in shared memory.<br />
<br />
Using the resource variable use_shm_info you can disable this shared memory of the database driver.<br />
In that case add the following line to the file $BSE\lib\defaults\db_resource:<br />
use_shm_info:0<br />
<br />
The BaanERP client, like ntbshell.exe, uses also its own memory structure in shared memory.<br />
<br />
Using session ttaad4150m000 Shared Memory Data (BaanERP Tools -&gt; Application Configuration -&gt; Miscellaneous) you can specify what you want to load in the shared memory of the client. After Running a Conversion to Runtime, the file $BSE\lib\srdd_tab6.2 will be filled.<br />
Default the tabledefinitions of each Package Combination will be specified in this file, besides the objects you specified to load in shared memory using session ttaad4150m000.<br />
<br />
Example of a part of this file:<br />
<br />
package=b50a<br />
dbc.pd<br />
dcf.pd<br />
dci.pd<br />
dcp.pd<br />
ddc.pd<br />
dec.pd<br />
//<br />
dtccom001<br />
dtccom100<br />
<br />
So, that means, that all the tabledefinitions of each Package Combination will be loaded in the client shared memory of Baan.<br />
<br />
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:<br />
<br />
Now, when running Baan sessions the &quot;Currently used&quot; / USED BYTES *) of shared memory is increasing, in spite of the fact that all tabledefinitions are loaded in shared memory. You should expect that the &quot;Currently used&quot; / USED BYTES stays stable, because all tabledefinitions are available yet in shared memory.<br />
<br />
*) Windows NT: To view the &quot;Currently used&quot; of the Baan shared memory, start the Baan Shared Memory Manager.<br />
(Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Baan folder -&gt; Baan Shared Memory Manager)<br />
*) Unix: To view &quot;USED BYTES&quot; of the Baan shared memory, execute the command shmmanager6.2 -s<br />
<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
Because the client program (for example the ntbshell.exe) uses another memory structure in the shared memory, then the server program (for example the Baan Oracle databasedriver ora7_srv.exe) the &quot;Currently Used&quot; / USED BYTES will increase. <br />
<br />
When a Baan database driver is started for the first time, nothing is loaded in the shared memory structure of the Baan database driver.<br />
At the moment the Baan database driver needs a tabledefinition, it will first look in its own shared memory structure to see if it is there; In case it is not there, the Baan database driver will ask the client for the tabledefinition. The client will retreive the tabledefinition either from its own shared memory structure / local memory or from disk.<br />
<br />
In this way when running Baan sessions, more and more tabledefinitions will be read by the databasedrivers and loaded into the shared memory structure of the databasedriver. Therefor the &quot;Currently used&quot; / USED BYTES will grow till a certain maximum, because of the tabledefinitions loaded by the databasedrivers in its shared memory structure.<br />
<br />
To load all the tabledefinitions of one Package Combination you need appr. 6MB shared memory.<br />
So, in case you are working only in one Package Combination, the &quot;Currently used&quot; / USED BYTES of the shared memory can increase with 6MB.<br />
<br />
It is not possible for the Baan database driver to make use of the tabledefinitions which are loaded into the shared memory structure of the client.<br />
Because the database driver is working on a RDBMS oriented level, and the client is working on a Baan oriented level.<br />
That means that the way the Baan databasedriver stores tabledefinitions (table-descriptions) in its shared memory structure is totally different than the client does. For example, on database driver level a distinction is made in company-numbers, and on the client side a distinction is made in Package Combinations regarding the tabledefinitions. On the RDMS oriented level Package Combinations doesn't mean anything. <br />
<br />
<br />
To test to what maximum the &quot;Currently used&quot; / USED BYTES will grow, you can run -for example- session ttaad4232m000 Check Tables for all you Package Combinations you are using. (Select for each Package Combination one company, or just select all the companies you are using).<br />
During the execution of this session, all the tables has to be checked, and therefor the databasedriver will need each tabledefinition.<br />
After running this session you know what the maximum is of &quot;Currently used&quot; / USED BYTES, and you can make the size of the shared memory allocated at least equal to this. (To be save, take a margin in count).<br />
<br />
In case your amount of internal memory is not sufficient to do a pre-load of the contents of srdd_tab6.2 and to work with the database driver shared memory, you have to choose which one you want to use: either the client shared memory (srdd_tab6.2), or the database driver shared memory. Specially on Windows NT this can be the case.<br />
<br />
It is hard to say which one is the best for you performance.<br />
In case you do not pre-load the client shared memory (srdd_tab6.2) each client (ntbshell.exe) has to maintain his own local memory, and fill with tabledefinitions. So, in case you have 100 bshells running, maybe 100 times the same tabledefinition is loaded into the local memory of each bshell. So, this is not really a way to save memory.<br />
<br />
In case you disable the shared memory of the databasedriver, by setting use_shm_info to 0, each databasedriver has a lot of communication with the client programs, because it needs to ask for the tabledefinitions. So, this will cause more cpu en I/O usage.<br />
You have to measure in the practice which one is the best.<br />
<br />
It is also possible to decide to pre-load only the most frequently used tabledefinitions in the shared memory of the client.<br />
In that case you have to edit manually the file $BSE/lib/srdd_tab6.2, to remove the non-frequently used tabledefinitions out of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope it will be useful for every one here... :p</div></div><hr />
