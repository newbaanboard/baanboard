Hello! I have an issue with Webtop 1.1 and was hoping you may be able to assist me. The following is a description of my environment:<br />
<br />
Back-end:<br />
<br />
BaanERP5.2a (running on HP-UX 11)<br />
OpenWorld Adapter 2.2 for ERP Server <br />
BCLM ASM 1.0<br />
<br />
Web Server:<br />
<br />
Windows 2k Server, SP2<br />
Websphere 3.5<br />
IBM HTTP Server 1.3.12<br />
OpenWorld Adapter 2.2<br />
Webtop Framework 1.1<br />
<br />
I'm using the XML file option as my directory service. I installed and configured the software components in the following order:<br />
<br />
1 - OpenWorld Adapters (on back-end and web server)<br />
2 - Webtop 1.1 Framework (on web server)<br />
3 - ASM 1.0 (back-end) <br />
<br />
I configured the classpath within Websphere, and edited WebtopProperties.xml for the appopriate BaanERP environment as stated within documentation. <br />
<br />
My problem: <br />
When I enter the URL of http://localhost/webtop/ the defaultlogin.html page is displayed (as expected) but I do not receive a login box for logging in to the back-end environment. I can however access the DiagnosticsServlet and other servlets (i.e., snoop) so I beleive my servlet engine is not the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas or help would be very appreciated! <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first things that comes to my mind when the login dialog does not show is, that you might use the Java plugin at your browser side. If so, please go to the control panel -&gt; Java Plugin and uncheck the plug-in for both browsers as their default Java runtime. Make sure you see a dialog popping up daying 'you just changed your browser settings' or something similar. Restart your browser and try again.<br />
<br />
If that does not work, I need more information that probably will be given by the DiagnosticsServlet.<br />
<br />
Bye,<br />

I was unable to find &quot;java plugin&quot; from the control panel. Are you using a Netscape browser or IE? <br />
<br />
I'm using IE 5.50 with SP2 update. <br />
<br />
I'm also confused as to why I would want to disable the java plugin on the browser. Can you explain? <br />
<br />
I appreciate your reply!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
The Sun java plugin is not supported, and can cause Webtop to 'hang' as it tries to use it.<br />
<br />
I am using IE as browser, as Netscape is not supported.<br />
<br />
Could you give me the outcome of the diagnostics servlet? Or is there some way I could acces your web server via my browser?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
