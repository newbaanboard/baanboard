Any suggestions to improve its performance????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd January 2013, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there any other index you can build in?  Sounds like you are doing a full table scan.  Maybe if you post your query someone might see something to improve the performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shritiwari</div><div class="date">24th January 2013, 07:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is a full table scan. The query is to find all the records having the string pattern(irrespective of case) which contains the entered search argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th January 2013, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">There might not be anything you can do. Without the query there is not anything I can think of that might help.  I know at times I built some temporary tables to load and search, but that was because I did not want to change the core baan table. I don't see where that will help in this case.  Just not seeing a good recommendation that would improve performance.</div></div><hr />
