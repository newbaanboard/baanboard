<br />
I believe webtop 3.0 is out and available.<br />
I havesome questions.<br />
<br />
1)  Is Webtop 3.0 free for all Baan customers?<br />
2)  Has anyone successfully installed it and using it now?<br />
3)  I think to run webtop, it needs another software called Tomcat. Is this Tomcat software free? Where do I get it? :) <br />
4)  Any other information that will help me install and use webtop now.<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards,</div></div><hr />

2. we are using it in pilot phase (Baan ERP 5.0c). not in production environment yet.<br />
3. the installable contains a version for Windows/Linux. Tomcat is included. It will take you only half an hour to install it.<br />

pre-requisite for 4c4: Porting set 6.1c.07.03 Tools Soln: 140164 &amp; Apps Service Pack 14, all of it is documented in the installation &amp; config manual. Search for webtop in the knowledge base and you would see the eantry for webtop 3.0 the complete software download link and the documentaions.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Everything looks just great, except some tools sessions cannot be used in webtop. Does anyone know the limitations of the webtop on 4c4.????</div></div><hr />

<br />
I installed Webtop 3.0 for 5c on a development server to test it out.  Installation went good, installed Tomcat automatically.  The only issue that I found so far that's like a show stopper for us is that I cannot connect to the web server using non-Microsoft JVM.  Our server's OS is Window 2000 with SP4, which removed the Microsoft JVM.  Worked with Baan support to get this working, but with no luck.  I was told that they are working on a version that works with Sun Java JVM.  The server works great, but no one can connect to it.. <br />

With Sp1 there is no prob. Even it is an good idea to translate all the existibg contnent with the Webtop Administration.<br />
Why? Cause you might have a much faster response until the system has translatet and generated all the needed Jave and XML components.<br />
With our Licence there was a Serverlincence for Webtop 3.0 included.<br />
<br />
Any more question?</div></div><hr />
