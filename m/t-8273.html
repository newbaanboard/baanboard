<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sstrohmeyer</div><div class="date">2nd January 2003, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We are re-evaluating our current solution for production printing of drawings and would appreciate your input. <br />
We are currently using AutoCad 2000 and BaaN IVc4 and have the need to print multiple copies of B,C and D size drawings. One job can potentially include all 3 sizes. Our sources for a drawing list vary from one that is manually generated (if we don't have a BOM in BaaN yet) to ones that are generated by a custom session in Baan.<br />
I am interested in hearing what other BaaN users do to print drawing packages, that include multiple copies of many drawings, to send out to customers.<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<br />
We converted our drawings into .jpeg format (software available from www.cadwizz.com) &amp; saved with a structured filename. <br />
<br />
What I did was to produce the a report with the output in HTML format with links to the drawings (using the structured filename it is possible to build this from the item number). I set up a device that automatically open IExplorer, once in explorer the document can be printed. <br />
<br />
This is not the most straightforward method &amp; I would be interested to find out if anyone prints documents which include drawings directly from Baan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will tell you how we handle this issue with our B2Email utilities.<br />
<br />
B2Email allows sending of Baan reports by email. Few flavours of B2Email exist.<br />
<br />
With B2Email Plus, you can email a Baan report and attach an external  document if you wish. So, you can print the report to the device B2Email, choose the email address and then pick the drawings you wish to attach to the email by simply browsing your PC and picking it up.<br />
<br />
With B2Email Mail-Merge, all is done automatically. Reports and external attachments are emailed or faxed automatically.<br />
<br />
For example, if the name of the drawing file is populated from any keyword from the report itself, the system will automatically generate the name, pick it from where it is stored on the network and send the report together with the drawing.<br />

   Can you place the drawing anywhere in the document or does your product print it only in a certain position?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bamnsour</div><div class="date">15th January 2003, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">The Drawing could be anywhere in the document, in a fixed location.  You just need to tell the system in what location it is (Line number, Column Number). <br />
<br />
The attached example shows how we can attach 2 Excel Sheets to a Purchase Order.<br />
<br />
Item Number in the Purchase Order Printout is always on line 25 between column 22 and 42.<br />
<br />
(First Line in Purchase Order).<br />
<br />
The first attachment will be come from the Network and the second attachment will come from the Baan Server.</div></div><hr />
