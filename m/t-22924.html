<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandy Blondino</div><div class="date">20th January 2005, 22:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a requirement to regularly review and certify as correct all the session authorizations for our entire user population. We can generate a raw listing using ttaad2432m000, but the volume of output is immense. Is anyone aware of any third party products that address this need? <br />
How are all of you planning to deal with this?<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance for all your help.<br />

Not one that I am aware of. But since you brought it up as a requirement (which probably is a requirement for every company in the U.S.), one of the Baan solutions providers could jump on it. Perhaps you could write a business case that they can use to develop a solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">21st January 2005, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone read the SOX specs? I've heard that in the specs there is nothing specific stated like &quot;regularly review and certify as correct all the session authorizations for our entire user population.&quot; instead it basically says that you must have a procedure, it must be documented and you must stick to it.. <br />
<br />
Maybe some of the SOX auditing firms (like PWC) came up with their own procedures ahead of time and are trying to push them on their customers? <br />
<br />
I ask his becuase I've heard wild storys and it seems that the requirements are different from company to company...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hutje33</div><div class="date">26th January 2005, 12:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently working as a consultant for a Netherlands based but US comp, the SOX-troops executed a very heavy and severe audit. Due to several organizational and systemwise consolidations it was a true mess, reason for the auditors to digg deeper ande deeper.<br />
Most important issue is, to have a fully implemented Seperation of Duty system, especially for those activities in which financial transactions/risks are involved.<br />
Therefore we'll create a customized table in which all critical sessions are registered (like in the purchase to pay process: create PO's, book receipt, approve receipts, etc) and relate all sessions to a certain role.<br />
A query will present those login id's with access to sessions which are related to more then one role and therefore are not SOX-complying.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the audits<br />

Hutje :cool: <br />
