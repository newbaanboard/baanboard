<br />
We are using BaaN V c on HP Unix and manage BaaN Job Management via Unix cron<br />
<br />
I was just wondering do we have some utility available (prefreably free) which basiclaly takes .cron file as input and produces a nice looking graphs/charts to represents which job runs at what date n time ....<br />
<br />
i can manually key in all this info in excel, but since we are having quiet of lot of baan co.'s and the no. of jobs are high in most of our companies, so i was wondering if we have some utility to do the above task to generate graph/charts ?<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply.<br />

<br />
I have never heard of any such utility and anyway cron only knows, when a job starts, but not how long it usually runs.<br />
<br />
So I actually think, you will get a better result by using the baan job history tables as starting point. Here you can either print the content from Baan into an excel or most likely nicer, connect with crystal or some other reporting tool to make the charts/graphs you look for.<br />
<br />
But if you find such an utility out of the box, I am sure many members here would like to hear about it.<br />

Funny, I was thinking about that this week, too. But I haven't been successful in finding a ready-to-use tool (eg. unix shell script or perl).<br />
<br />
@Markus:<br />
It depends on what you want to achieve. The baan history helps to understand what has happened; the idea of learner is &quot;what will happen&quot;.<br />

<br />
i know finding such a utility would be difficuilt atleast which has the 2nd option too i.e. it goes in baan table to check the session history .... i guess probably i need to develop something  :-)<br />

<br />
3 years ago I developed a chart of type Hilo displaying the job history. <br />
Basically It give a visual time line with the runtime of the different jobs.<br />
I'll try to attach some screen shot.<br />
If you are interested I can maybe add the source in the code and utilities forum<br />
I think that there are some limit and problem<br />
a) description document is in french (needs to translate it):D<br />
b) I tested it only with +/- 40 jobs (some running every 3 or 5 minutes during the day)<br />
c) it is a chart so I think that it work only with bw and not with webtop or worktop<br />
d) the chart of type HILO is complex to manage <br />
