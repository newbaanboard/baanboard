We have an old server with Baan IV. Because I am afraid the server might crash any day I made a copy of it by using vmware converter. The virtual Baan server works fine, except I have to brand?? the software so I get a new license file (vmware uses another mac address for its nic's and this cannot be changed). There are still some unfinished projects in Baan that users need to consult, else we do not need Baan anymore.<br />
Do I have to get a validation key? Is it still possible to get one (since it is old). I found out I can make a new license-file with brand.exe, but it asks for a validation code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you CAN point your vmware license to your old baan server though<br />
just edit/create a file in $BSE/lib/<br />
called &quot;licence6.1&quot;<br />
(yes that's how it's spelled)<br />
<br />
put the IP address of your existing baan server in there.<br />
<br />
you'll still need to keep that server up though, so it may not fit your needs.<br />

vmware uses another mac address for its nic's and this cannot be changed<br />
you cannot license baan in vmware.<br />
<br />
Please be informed , addition to the above information - licensing in Vmware works in latest edition.<br />
<br />
i.e.VMware Workstation v6.0.2 ACE edition.<br />
<br />
Details :<br />
1.It has an option to copy from Physical server from LAN or within .<br />
2.The NIC can be made for same as physical address<br />
3.Even the MAC address could be made same as physical address.<br />
 (after #3 it needs to be of diff. network , thatz it  or shutdown physical)<br />
<br />
Note : No Offence Dave , just the facts.<br />
<br />
Thanks for understanding.<br />

Dave 23: you are right, the VM with baan should work when the physical machine is down; so your solution won't work for me.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Complying with the above conditions it should work.<br />
<br />
Note : I have tested with VMWARE ACE EDITION (it worked) <br />
Herewith i am attaching the Screen shots of ACE edition that worked for me.<br />

There is not any significant difference in your configuration of vmware workstation then mine. I wonder if there are any other hardware configurations (other then the mac address) are being used to create the license file. Because, except for the name of the adapter everything is configured the same compared with the physical machine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you license baan in VMware and Infor audits you - you will be found to be out of compliance and subject to penalties.<br />
<br />
infor is fine with you running Baan on VMware but the license needs to be on a physical server.<br />

I have contacten Infor with my problem. They did not mention that the license must be on a physical machine. The only help they could give me is prolonging the maintenance contract (about 10.000 euro's a year!!).<br />
Since I am not doing anything ilegale: is it technically not possible to run the license on a VM or is it only company rules that do not allow this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Breach of contract is generally considered illegal in most countries. <br />
<br />
When you purchased your licenses you agreed to use baan on a specific hardware / machine. Moving the software to a new machine means you need to relicense (i.e., agree to a new contract for that machine) <br />
which in Infor's idea requires that you to be active on support.<br />
<br />
but there's plenty of contention about that here on the forums, so we don't need to get into that. <br />
<br />
it's possible to hack it, Sushil mentioned 1 way below that may or may not work depending on your version. If that didn't work from you then you're probably out of luck.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
from the above - i understand, you just need to make sure in case if hardware fails - the data needs to be secure. <br />
<br />
<br />
then as an alternative you could take a image backup (note: no downtime needed) - using&quot;O&amp;O Diskimage server edition&quot; .<br />
<br />
1.You can take Image backup (complete) - one time. (like Oracle Rman - L0)<br />
2.daily incrementals or differentials (Oracle Rman L1)<br />
<br />
So that in case hardware fails - you can get H/W resolved and restore in same H/W in seconds <br />
(the best part is - it is Legal)<br />
<br />
For further clarifications - just PM me.<br />

<br />
Afaik it is possible to install and run the complete SLM on Sun's Virtualbox. VMWare Server and Workstation is being recognized by the installation/setup routine as well as by the SLM components so it is not working there. <br />
<br />
I'm not really sure wheather it is illegal to run the SLM in a virtual environment at all. Infor didn't mention in any our contracts or in the documentation regarding installation and running ERP LN that it is prohibited to install and run the SLM in a virtual environment. Allthough there are notes that in case of the SLM an installation in virtual environments is not supported. So as a conclusion for me: As long as your company has obtained the licenses legally and uses these licenses and software components of the system in compliance with the contract there shouldn't be any problem.<br />

<br />
<br />
Please check the Link below where it quotes as<br />
&quot;to use the software, only on the computer specified in schedule A or an identical computer that is a direct and single replacement for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.itjungle.com/tfh/tfh030909-story03.html<br />
<br />
So you can deploy on identical Mac. O&amp;O is an Universal Snap Deployer - just provide the Drivers - Raid or ISCSI or SAS or SAN.<br />
<br />
It will just deploy it.<br />
<br />
Hope this Helps....<br />
