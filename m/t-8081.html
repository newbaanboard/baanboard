<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbadillo</div><div class="date">12th December 2002, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">We initiate a project ERP with a company on the line of furniture. To this time we have finished the second simulation, however the key users of the client have identified and defined more than a hundred (100) customizations to the software. As consultants, we suggest to develop less than half of the same, including only those, which are considered critical, that consist of additional controls or automation of some processes. <br />
<br />
The executive committee of the client requests us to confirm in similar companies that have implemented Baan, how much does the software has customize, in order to in this way carry out a benchmark that makes it possible to question the number of changes that orders the project equipment. I don't know if this is possible or if there exists a registry of the number of Customizations carried out in projects like Herman Miller for example, but for this reason what is contact. <br />
<br />
Do you know or does it have a registry of the number of Customizations that were developed in Herman Miller or similar projects, the number of changes, and if possible the detail of those changes? To whom there could be requested him that information.<br />
<br />
Our interest is to demonstrate to the client that it is not necessary to carry out all the changes that they request and that we should try to maintain the functionality standard of the system, the client is feeling that Baan is not the system most appropriate for its business by the number of changes that have been defined, but we believe that if it covers very well the requirements and that the Customizations are due to the trend to maintain the form of current work. <br />
<br />
If you have any recommendation or data related to the subject, or if you can contact me to somebody who can help us, I would be pleased, since it is going us to help a great deal of to guide this client. <br />

Thanks before hand by your attention and assistance</div></div><hr />
