<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sachinje</div><div class="date">27th January 2003, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
 I have started working on BaaN pretty recently and this is my first Software Development experience.<br />
 I need to know if there is any method by which the components of a current project get selected/updated automatically while I am working on them. i am finding it pretty bugging to manually enter the labels in Project(session ttadv1170m000) since I have to make a lot of entries.<br />
Please suggest me a way....<br />
thanks<br />
Sach</div></div><hr />

<br />
To deliver a number of software components, where the components are list in a sequential file. The layout of a line in the sequential file is as follows:<br />
<br />
Syntax<br />
&lt;package code&gt;|&lt;version&gt;|&lt;release&gt;|&lt;customer&gt;|&lt;kind of component&gt;|&lt;component code&gt;|language<br />
<br />
The kind of component is indicated by two capital characters.<br />
<br />
MS  = Message<br />
QS  = Question<br />
SE  = Session<br />
DM  = Domain<br />
TD  = Table Definition<br />
MN  = Menu<br />
FM  = Form<br />
PO  = Program Object<br />
PS  = Program Source<br />
RO  = Report (source and object)<br />
LB  = Label<br />
FN  = Function<br />
FS  = Function Source<br />
IF  = Implementation Function<br />
HT  = Help Text<br />
CH  = Chart<br />
<br />
E.g.: td|B40O|c4|prod|MS|slsd0001|2<br />
<br />
The sequential file with components must be sorted on &lt;package&gt;, &lt;version&gt;, &lt;release&gt; and &lt;customer&gt;.<br />
<br />
For each Package VRC, a separate directory will be created in the specified directory &quot;Path Dumps&quot;. Under these directories the dumps will be created. These dumps can be read by session Import Data Dictionary (ttiex1285m000). In this session it is possible to read the dumps into a different VRC if wished.</div></div><hr />

Are you talking about automatically connecting components to a project or automatically generating the project...?<br />
I don't know how you would automatically generate the project itself.  But, once you have a Project / Proj Part / Cust Part for  a given exercise, you can connect the componets you are working on to it via the 'special' drop down menu option 'Maintain Customization Parts' available when working on all components (ex.  Maintain Message session, 'special' drop down menu) where you can add your component to the project.   It stores your last value so you can just tab through it if correct.<br />
You can have this come up automatically when you use the option to &quot;Copy components to your current VRC&quot; by setting a flag on your developer (&quot;Maintain Developer Parameters&quot; ttadv0110m000) called 'Zoom to Project' (General form).</div></div><hr />
