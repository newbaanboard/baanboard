   To kill a process started by a user, you got to first find out the bshell process id (bshell_pid) of that user. This can be done by executing <br />
licmon (Bse\bin\licmon) from command prompt. The bshell id is the number that is next to the user's username. Once you get that, exit from licmon using &quot;quit&quot; command. <br />
If yours is a Windows based environment, you could even get it from the Taskmanager (check process ntbshell against the username) .<br />
<br />
Next you have to find the process id of the process you want to close and this can be achieved by typing.. <br />
bshcmd -p bshell_pid <br />
<br />
Armed with these two, execute the following at the prompt<br />
bshcmd -k N1 N2 <br />
(where N1 is the process id and N2 is the bshell id)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">28th February 2009, 00:34</div></div><div class="posttext">bshcmd only works if the process returns back to the bshell at any time (think of the bshell as a virtual CPU running your session) if the session is spinning (since it's been running for 2 days i assume it is) then it will never release control back to the bshell for the kill. <br />
<br />
Also the bshell doesn't cache the bshcmd command, so you have to catch it when it's returned back to the bshell. (not easy).<br />
<br />
<br />
you'll need an advanced task manager (there are a few out there) use one of those to find the 2 day old bshell process that has a ton of memory allocated to it, and kill it.<br />
<br />
Or just reboot the server (you're on windows so you should be use to that... ;) )<br />
