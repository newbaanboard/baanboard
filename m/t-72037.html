in LN 10.4 II can't send report via email (service SMTP) when the recipient address has a different domain from the &quot;&lt;Mail from&gt; domain&quot; in ttcmf0120m000.<br />
So, if the &quot;&lt;Mail from&gt; domain&quot; is industry.com I can send mail to address1@industry.com, but if the recipient address is address1@gmail.com the mail can't be sent. According to the log.ttcmfsmtp the erros is:<br />
<br />
19-07-16[22:46:51]ibenini: **********   S T A R T of Log Message   **********<br />
19-07-16[22:46:51]ibenini: 554 5.1.2 Indirizzo email del destinatario rifiutato: utente sconosciuto   -   Recipient address rejected: User unknown<br />
<br />
Well, &quot;User unknown&quot; sounds a bit weird: can I send e-mail only to the address mails linked to the BAAN USER category?  In  other words, can I send mail only to those address defined in the Addree Book? <br />
I suppose 554.5.1.2 is an error code, but I can'f find how to &quot;transalete&quot; it.<br />
<br />
I tried to send the report from @industry.com to address1@gmail.com and the cmf.send always returned -1 (while cmf.start works)<br />
I got the error message sendig the mail by script,  sending the mail by device SMTP (path: ttcmfsprint), sending a message from ttstopen.<br />
It seems that the mail can be sent only if &quot;mail from&quot; and &quot;mail to&quot; have the same domain? <br />
<br />
Do you think it depends on the mail server? the recipient addres comes from the contatcs and it clearly is different from the mail from domain.<br />
Is it required a List and an address book? If so, can someone make an example, because I tried, but unsuccesfully.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
