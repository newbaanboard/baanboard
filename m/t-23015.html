<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">31st January 2005, 12:49</div></div><div class="posttext">There is just one other book, &quot;Baan ERP Business Solutions - Foundations for E-Commerce&quot; by Robert Jendry. The first section of the book is a lot of blah and marketing talk about ERP and ecommerce, in general and the second half is more or less a copy of a Baan IV functions and feature sales paper. I really cannot recommend that book for anyone interested in looking just a little big deeper (&quot;Implementing Baan IV&quot; is a lot(!!!) more detailed, and still stays at the surface, so you get the pricture).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, beside that two books, no others exist (as far as I know).<br />

<br />
What do you really want?<br />
<br />
Details on all the various modules available in Baan IV?<br />
An implementation methodology?<br />
Course material?<br />
<br />
You have the possibility to print course material. In the Baan tools section there is a module called Baan Training. If set up the right you can print a lot of material available.<br />
<br />
But a good book you will never find. Probably you will need a good consultant to get you started, who has the experience of implementing Baan and knows most of the pitfalls.<br />
<br />
Its like driving a car, there is no good book how to drive a car, you need to build up experience.<br />
<br />

U can print the documentation in Baan which is more than enough for basic understanding and implementation of the software. Skilled  person having baan technical/ functional knowledge and understanding of company's  business processes will be an added advantage . U may Start with ur  company's core functional reqmt and take up more detailed functionalities in optimization phase.</div></div><hr />
