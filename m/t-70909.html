<br />
We need help with logo.<br />
We implement LN 10.5 but still we use worktop.<br />
We developed reports, such as Purchase Order and Sales Invoice using 4GL.<br />
But with LN UI when we print the Purchase Order and Sales Invoice the logo does not appear.<br />
<br />
We are told that we must use LN studio, but this is a new tool.<br />
We have installed and configured LN studio, but still have problem operating it.<br />
<br />
Need your help how to make logo appears using LN studio.<br />
Or is there any workaround to make logo appear when printing with LN UI.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Hanny</div></div><hr />

Create a font.. assign logo to a letter.. use letter in the report. When printed the letter will be printed as logo. Works in LN.</div></div><hr />

One of the the options is to include a company logo in the report. The logo is to be stored using session ttaad1100s000.<br />
If you have the correct Tools release while printing an option Personalize Reports will show. Starting the print to report will also start the personalize option. Using a company logo in reports is one of the options that is supported.</div></div><hr />
