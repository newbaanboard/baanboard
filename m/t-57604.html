We run in our data center Baan IV b4 for a couple of European companies. Now we´ve got the job to add our small Brazil company in Sao Paulo (warehouse, purchase, production, sales, service, finance). The job is a little bit tricky as we have to cover the local needs by localization elements to be implemented into an existing &quot;European&quot; environment with customized layers. I´m searching for people which already have done that kind of job and could give hints or even could offer a consulting.<br />

It´s hard because legal requirements in Brazil are confused AND numerous. We have a lot of things that not exists in others countries (such fiscal notes, fiscal receipt, a lot of taxes (believe: a LOT of taxes), localizated costs, etc,etc)<br />
<br />
What we do is to adapt the company customizations to work with Brazil localization. If you need I can help you to choose a consulting in Brazil, but I think that Infor can do it for you.</div></div><hr />
