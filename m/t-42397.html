<br />
If you are deleting company that has child / logical companies attached to it, you will need to 1. delete those companies first OR 2. reaccess your decision.<br />
<br />
But, deleting companies just same as deleting all tables + deleting company entry from &quot;Maintain Company&quot; and &quot;User <br />
Data&quot;:<br />
Users might be linked to the company and the tables in authorizations list.<br />
Logical Relationships might be present.<br />
Certain libraries like datecurr, tabledef, user files, etc. will have to be rebuilt...</div></div><hr />
