<br />
Is anyone still running Baan4c4? Are Porting sets, Tools still available for Windows Server 2019 or any latest version if someone wants to upgrade OS to latest version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th June 2023, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The company I retired from is still running 4c4.  Last I heard there was no new porting sets or patches being developed for it.  We ran solaris and Oracle - as a matter of fact the company updated to get to 19c for oracle, ran into issues, the final fix is really not supported by Infor, even though they provided it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vinceco252</div><div class="date">15th June 2023, 16:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, there are portingsets for Baan IVc4 that support Windows and SQL through at least the 2019 versions.  Off the top of my head, I think the last version to support Baan IV is 9.4a - at the very least, they've tied licensing logic into the PS to identify the version of Baan/LN you're running and you have to meet certain things depending on the current lifecycle of that product.<br />
<br />
You will need to be on Infor support to be able to do any of this.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
