<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scough</div><div class="date">31st December 2008, 20:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I am writing SQL code that will pull shipped to addresses from baan tables and put them in our web site database.<br />
<br />
I am running into a problem with direct ship items. Most of our direct shipped items use a delivery address that shows up in ttdpur042600<br />
<br />
Some times the shipment does not going to a specific address, it gets shipped to us first so there is no address in the ttdpur042600 table. The address used comes from one of the ttccom tables.<br />
<br />
I can seem to find a way to tell when I should pull the shipped to address from the ttdpur table or from the ttccom table....<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on the subject for me?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
