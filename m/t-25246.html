<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">serendipityguy</div><div class="date">3rd October 2005, 14:05</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry to ask, but i did look around and could not find any answers, so here is my question...<br />
<br />
Scite will not compile  <br />
&gt;g++ -pedantic -Os -fno-exceptions -c hello.cpp -o hello.o<br />
&gt;The system cannot find the file specified. <br />
<br />
found this in the help file, and still with out a clue   :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
When I try to compile/build/run my [some language] source files, <br />
I get the following error: 'The system cannot find the file specified'.<br />
<br />
Make sure that the path to your compiler is set correctly on your system. <br />
Try to execute from console the same command you get in SciTE and see <br />
if it works. You can also search in your [language].properties for the <br />
compile commands used. If you have a different compiler or use different <br />
arguments, edit the commands to suit your needs. The lines to look for:<br />
command.compile.filepattern=<br />
command.build.filepattern=<br />
command.go.filepattern= <br />
 <br />
I am looking in the cpp.properties at here  :eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
cc=g++ -pedantic -Os -fno-exceptions -c $(FileNameExt) -o $(FileName).o<br />
<br />
make.command=make<br />
command.compile.*.cpp=$(cc)<br />
command.build.*.cpp=$(make.command)<br />
command.go.*.cpp=$(FileName)<br />
# To make the Go command both compile (if needed) and execute, use this setting:<br />
#command.go.needs.*.c=g++ $(FileNameExt) -o $(FileName)<br />
 <br />
<br />
and I am stuck, can some one please tell me where to look or what to do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
here  F.A.Q's (http://www.scintilla.org/SciTEFAQ.html#CannotFindFile) <br />
<br />
and still cant compile, the borland 5.5 works tested on a helloworld.cpp and from a dos prompt got it work, but when I am trying to compile from with in SciTe, this is when I am getting the error message<br />
<br />
&gt;g++ -pedantic -Os -fno-exceptions -c hello.cpp -o hello.o<br />
&gt;The system cannot find the file specified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd October 2005, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Moved to this forum since this is not really related to Baan tools.  Not sure how you found a Baan site while looking for the site editor.  But we do our best.  You may need to be patient and wait for a member with more C experience.<br />
<br />
Have you validated that the compiler is in the path?  What about the directory to where the source code is - is that in the path?  What happens if you put the source into the same directory as the helloworld.cpp?  To me it seems that either the g++(Is that the command that gets typed to compile?) or the hello.cpp file can not be found.  <br />
<br />
Just some wild guesses.</div></div><hr />

Maybe someone else on Baanboard has used the C compiler options for scite and can respond to your problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and explained to him my situation, and he was eeager to look at the machine and fix the problem.<br />
<br />
he spotted the cpp.properties files and found that the code....<br />
<br />
cc=g++ -pedantic -Os -fno-exceptions -c $(FileNameExt) -o $(FileName).o<br />
<br />
neede4d to be changed to <br />
<br />
cc=bcc32 $(FileName)<br />
<br />
and then the puppy was set and fixed.   thanks for all of the members that did offer to contribute to this problem..</div></div><hr />
