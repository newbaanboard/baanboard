<br />
When the configuration is Used as default file, it will not allow the user to connect to Baan. A work around has been to create a dummy default file. This has only been noticed on new Dell Laptops running windows XP.<br />
<br />
Has anyone come across this and is it a known problem with BECS or is it hardware and operating problem?</div></div><hr />

This is very old and may cause your problems. Actual is as far as I know 82. I don't have problems with 73, 79 and 80 on XP/W2000.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neal Matthews</div><div class="date">12th January 2007, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree that using a later client may be the way forward 84 is the latest, I'm just rolling this out over our site as advised by support as part of an upgrade to a later porting set. All porting sets now have a specified minimum bw version.<br />
<br />
It is installing ok on most systems but as a default now installs to directory C:\Program Files\Baan\Baan IV. Some earlier versions installed to a slightly different directory which has caused problems with shortcuts etc and in some instances I have had to reinstall.<br />
<br />
Funnily enough the later clients appear to be less reliable than the earlier ones the last few bw versions are the only ones I've had any issues with in approx 9 years. Maybe related to the move to the MS installer type installs.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">12th January 2007, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">There were definitely problems with old BWclients working properly with XP - they are fixed in newer versions, so you should upgrade.<br />
<br />
Installing to C:\Program Files\Baan\Baan IV makes it easier to have access to Baan4 and Baan5 from the same client - but you can always change the default back to C:\Program Files\Baan if you are only ever using Baan4<br />
<br />
The main problems I've had with newer BWclients is with bwprint sometimes not being there, or being an out-of-date version.  You have to be careful where you get your BWclient from, some of the 'UNIX versions' don't have bwprint.exe on them!<br />
<br />
Don't forget, a newer bwclient means you can play with worktop - which is well worth a try...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now trying to locate/get boss to pay for a newer client ... will keep you posted if this works</div></div><hr />

Beware of 83 I installed this and couldn't get the executable to run at all but this only occured on my laptop. After looking at it for an hour support advised 84 which installed and worked straight away.<br />
<br />
Good point about worktop I'll take a look at it this afternoon.<br />

Cheers<br />
