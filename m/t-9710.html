For Quality purposes, versions have to be maintained for every release/deliverable to the customer. How can this be done in BaaN? Has anybody worked in this direction earlier?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not too functional.<br />
For technical - there is the option of using variants in Baan.  On a small scale, that can be useful to have different versions of the same code.  For full scale development with multiple clients, as is our case as a consulting company, we have different VRC's for each customer.  We have a base VRC with our standard version, and it is copied to the customer VRC's as delivered, allowing for some variance between customers.  Each delivery we make gets backed up on our network under the client.</div></div><hr />

I was talking about the technical deliverables, like sessions, etc. Regarding the script variants, only five variants of any script can be maintained. Though they are enough, but just in case more variants are released (afterall customer is the king!!). And what about forms, functions, report scripts and their formats, etc.!!? Even different VRCs won't be of much help.<br />
Of course all the software dumps can be backed up, but this is outside BaaN!!</div></div><hr />

I don't know of anything available for us humble developers.</div></div><hr />
