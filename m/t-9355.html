Baan wants user groups to unite   Baan Co. NV wants its European and North American user groups to unite, but although the Europeans say they will work together in Europe, they don't want to merge with Baan World Users (BWU), the North American user group. &quot;European user groups are typically organized by country and really have no vehicle for cross-border cooperation,&quot; which means Baan has to deal with each organization separately, Dave Wangler, senior vice president of global marketing at business software vendor Baan said.</div></div><hr />
