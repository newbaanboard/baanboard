<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naIBan</div><div class="date">6th March 2007, 20:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got an issue with a worktop installation. Worktop and BW is installed on a server share with a couple of documents set up for central deployment. Typically this works without any problem.<br />
<br />
Now on a terminal server when Worktop is launched the user is prompted for authentication which they provide and click ok. It looks like a BW shell is kicked off but after a minute or two the connection fails without any error.<br />
<br />
The Worktop documents seem to work fine everywhere else. I'm not sure what has gone wrong with the Worktop on this TS.<br />
<br />
Any Suggestions?<br />
<br />
LN 6 <br />
Worktop 2.4.15 <br />
BECS 8.3a.01.3</div></div><hr />

The above error appears in the wtError.log in the appdata\baan folder</div></div><hr />

I've had this problem on workstations, I removed everything related to baan (worktop, BW, reg keys, folders in profiles...) rebooted a couple of times then it'll start working again, but not on the terminal server. I'm ready to reload a server 'cause worktop is fragged up!<br />
<br />
If anybody has seen the error <br />

Error 003 : Dispatch for Baan Automation could not be created. <br />
<br />
and has any suggestions please reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Still could not find the cause for this.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have a clue?<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naIBan</div><div class="date">17th August 2007, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Applied SP2 for Windows Server 2003 on the TS and the problem went away. I still have the same sort of issue with clients sometimes but we can usually get it working again by deleting the temporary copy of worktop that gets created in the users profile along with everything else related to LN/BW on the machine and rebooting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fmorais</div><div class="date">17th August 2007, 17:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tips.<br />
<br />
Will try them next time I'm at a customer facing that problem.<br />

To solve the problem you must right click over becs.exe and worktop.exe and chose &quot;Run as administrator&quot; (even if you are logged in as a machine administrator) to configure the environment.<br />
After that you can start Worktop normaly without special permissions.<br />

<br />
to inform the worktop running on terminalserver you have to specify the following paramter on the desktop link:<br />
<br />
/ts<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
.../worktop.exe /ts<br />
<br />
64 Bit Terminalserver Windows 2003:<br />
<br />
&quot;.../worktop.exe&quot; &quot;/ts&quot;<br />
<br />
Because of the empty space in the programm path ...&quot;Programms (x86)&quot;.<br />
