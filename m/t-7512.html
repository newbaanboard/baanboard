Version 2 is out (or almost due) and support for version 1 has stopped. Ask your Support Partner for more details.</div></div><hr />

  The problem was related to some service pack installations.We have installed the latest service pack and the Excel integration is working perfectly...Data is extracted from Baan and updated in  Baan using Excel....This functionality looks really good..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acapulco</div><div class="date">2nd January 2003, 07:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I also installed the lastest service pack and is now working fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavrick</div><div class="date">5th March 2003, 13:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Could someone be more specific? Which service pack? 10 or 11? Is Open World required? Is Open World to support the &quot;Intergration Pack&quot; an additional cost?<br />
<br />
I am involved with an implementation that could really benefit from this functionality in the production of product manuals. We have little or no technical support so please remember that you are talking to an old worn out manufacturing slug. Examples (with pictures) of the setup up steps (Generic Automation Server and Office Parameters) would be very helpfull.<br />
<br />
Thanks all,<br />
