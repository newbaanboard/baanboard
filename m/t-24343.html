<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cindy Slye</div><div class="date">20th June 2005, 18:05</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently using an older version of Applix TM1 for our budgeting. We are on Baan IVc4, and the data we duplicate between the two systems is entered manually.  <br />
<br />
We are in the process of putting together a team to identify our requirements and evaluate budgeting software package.  IÂ’m interested in hearing what software packages other companies are using for budgeting, and any info you would be willing to share about what your implementation was like, what approach did you take, how well the system matches your requirements, and how easily it integrates with Baan and other systems, etc.<br />
<br />
Thank, Cindy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jroberts</div><div class="date">21st June 2005, 20:37</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using Prophix (http://www.prophix.com) for our financial budgets.  They are a Canadian company based in Toronto, ON.<br />
<br />
It is working well for us.<br />
We built a simple model and populated it with data in about 1 week.  It took about 2 months in total to get a 'production quality' model up and running.<br />
<br />
We have written Baan programs to extract the Baan trial balance data, and dump it into flat files.  We import these flat files into Prophix a couple of times a month.<br />
<br />
We have tried to forecast sales at the customer \ sku level in Prophix, and it did not work.  However, in our financial model, forecasting sales at the major customer (80 members) by item group (20 members) has worked well.<br />
<br />
Originally we planned to push Prophix out to all the department heads (client server), but that has not happened yet, and the prophix key user is doing most of the data input and analysis.<br />
<br />
They are worth a look.<br />
