Tools-&gt;Application Development -&gt;Chart Manager<br />
You can find more details about &quot;Chart Manager&quot; in &quot;Infor ERP Enterprise Programmers Guide&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for some better reporting tool to represent data graphically, please check &quot;Microsoft Reporting for ERP Enterprise (LN)&quot;, it’s a nice plugin with a cool architecture from Infor.<br />
I would suggest you to check for “Infor LN Reporting Studio” documents on Infor Xtreme.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
from BaaN IV on charts are createt by using the modul ttchm.<br />
<br />
New charts are maintained with ttchm1100m000.<br />
<br />
To programm dynamic charts the two includes are used:<br />
<br />
Systeminclude : bic_chartman<br />
Include : tcmcs0000 (chart main functions)<br />
<br />
<br />
|*Description:<br />
|* This include contains several functions that can be used in a program script<br />
|* to communicate with the chart-manager.<br />
|* These functions all start with &quot;CHART&quot;. They use the basic chart-manager<br />
|* functions that all start with &quot;chm&quot;.<br />
|* The CHART-functions have been created in order to make the interaction<br />
|* between program-script and chart-manager easier.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
function long CHART_OPEN( ... )<br />
function long CHART_DRAW( ... )<br />
function long CHART_DATA_IN(	long	seriesno,<br />
.........<br />
<br />

Also check similar thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=65037) with example</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">22nd August 2015, 04:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to be discouraging, but at least in BAAN IV, it is not very easy to create and thereafter maintain sessions for charts.<br />
<br />
My recommendation would be to write a session that will create output in a CSV format, and then use EXCEL or similar to create the charts. The session can be written in such a way as to move the CSV file directly to the user's computer in (say) the C:\temp folder. From there, the user can device a macro or such to create his charts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">5th September 2015, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I was able to dig up some notes I made in 2001 (and that is not a typo - it was 2001), and polished them up. The attached document is for reference of anyone who still wants to create charts in BAAN - at least to get started. The document is specific to BAAN IVc3 but should be hopefully conceptually applicable to higher versions of BAAN.</div></div><hr />
