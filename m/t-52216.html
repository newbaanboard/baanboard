<br />
we have ERP LN 6.1 FP3 centralised, running with multiple sites in different states.<br />
<br />
Currently, any user in warehouse A can see/modify orders that belong to users in warehouse B. Is there an automatic way for ERP LN to restrict order entry only to specific warehouse users?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check the Authorization sessions in Ln...<br />

No matter what type or what software you apply it on, security always hits your performance. But regarding the system being damn slow, well that depends on how complex your security settings are. <br />
For instance, if you have more than one condition on the warehouse or many a authorization setting for a user on a particular table(s), could lead to a slow down thats noticeable. <br />
