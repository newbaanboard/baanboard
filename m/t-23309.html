<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phat Bastage</div><div class="date">1st March 2005, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Were on ver IVc3 and for the last few weeks our users are getting disconected from baan.<br />
Here's the criteria.<br />
<br />
1.) Does not happen to every user, only a select few. (Approx: 12 users out of 50)<br />
<br />
2.) Does not Kick people out of sessions while they are actively using baan. Only after they have been sitting Idle in a session.<br />
<br />
3.) Nothing has changed on the network as far as switches, cabling etc...<br />
<br />
4.) Only happens to people when the're in baan, and they walk away from there office for an extended period of time.<br />
<br />
5.) It's random as to the amount of time before it decides to kick someone out. Not exactly 20 minutes, or 30 minutes. Sometimes it's 15 minutes sometimes it's 45.<br />
<br />
It's not a licenseing issue, I have had it kick people when there are 10 of 30 licenses in use.<br />
<br />
The system is downed every night for backups so it's cleared regularly.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the parameter: session_timeout<br />
<br />
or it could be in the environment or in their BW configurations<br />
as SESSION_TIMEOUT<br />
