<br />
What we can keep as source code from a customisation partner?<br />
Also the documentation?<br />
<br />
We had some bad experience with previous partner when they deleted the source and left. We could not prove that they deleted.<br />
<br />
Would these changed source would be with baan or any other method of getting it back?<br />
<br />
Also not to repeat in future what measures we need to do for that?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Eric.</div></div><hr />

Please correct me if i am wrong:<br />
you want to recover the sourcecodes of the customized components. the system runs with the implemented objects which were produced by your implementation-partner.<br />
<br />
It depends on the contract to your partner if you can get the sources and documentation from him.not every contract includes the right of getting the sources and documentations after completion of the project. first read the contract to find your rights!<br />
<br />
by the way:<br />
If you have a Backup of the filesystem before deletion you are able to recover the scripts of the modified components but the right of their usage denpends to the contract !</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
But can we insist on future contracts for source and documentation? I mean will baan allow such clause?<br />
<br />
If we could add that right to the contract then we would be happy to do that.<br />
<br />
Previous administrator has not kept a backup safe and it got overwritten sever times and it is not there.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">11th June 2002, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">first of all i assume that you have verified that the source code was deleted, only you can't prove who deleted it. i have a strong suspicion that your source code partner deleted it themselves because your contract say so especially if you expect them to support you afterwards.<br />
that source code will be different from what baan has since it's been customized already. you can compare the object info, date, size if you want. i hope you can recover it from backup. the other way is to approach that implementation partner again and work from that source.<br />
good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PBforBaan</div><div class="date">11th June 2002, 19:05</div></div><div class="posttext">you can add a clause to the contract which gives you the right to get sources and documentations of the NEW programs. in my opinion baan can take control about the standard but has no way to take action about third-party-products. <br />
another point of view appears if you get the sources of baan-standard-programs and integrate your modifications. thats the part i donÂ´t know. may be you can take a look at your baan-license-agreement to find the answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">11th June 2002, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it depends on your contract.  Consultants have the same rules as Baan, you do not automatically receive the source code, you must have a source code agreement, and usually pay extra for it.  They have every right to remove the source code from your system after development if you do not have a source code agreement.<br />
<br />
Even with an agreement, Consulting Companies do NOT have the right to distribute Baan source code, or modified Baan source code, only newly developed source.<br />
<br />
If you and your Consulting Company have a hard break and you need the source code, you may be able to have another Partner obtain the source code and modify for you.   <br />
<br />
If your Consulting Company goes under, they will most likely sell the source to another Company, so you should check with them.  If not, the source may end up with Baan - their partner agreements allow for such things and protect the customer somewhat.   Another reason to stick to Baan Partners.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!  Good luck.</div></div><hr />
