<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phatbastage</div><div class="date">31st August 2005, 18:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Last week we demoted a windows 2000 server from a domain controller to a standard server on our domain. This server used to be the primary DNS server. Shortly after we had 3 PC's in the office that were unable to connect to Baan through the bw client. (Baan server curretly on HP 9000 HPUX /Oracle)<br />
<br />
The exact error message pop up box is User name or password not correct<br />
<br />
<br />
in the background messages box is.<br />
<br />
: rexecd: Couldn't look uip address for your host<br />
: rexec failed host 'xxxxxxx' port 512 username 'xxxx' command '/work/baan/bse<br />
: Error : bw failed to connect to xxxxxxx!bshell<br />
<br />
I have tried everything. Uninstalling the client, upgrading to the newest client. Clearing the bwclient registry entries. Exporting and importing bwclient registry entries from a working pc.<br />
<br />
I actually got one pc fixed but I had to format c: and reload from scratch.<br />
<br />
<br />
What makes me believe this isn't just PC related or OS releated is I can resolve the baan server name from DOS, and connect to baan from DOS, just not from the baan client.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had this issue before? SSA has basically given up trying to help me at this point. They blame it on he PC / OS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phatbastage</div><div class="date">6th September 2005, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I received a message back from SSA on thursday last week so here are the steps I took to fix the problem. <br />
&quot;<br />
SSA posted<br />
run command <br />
<br />
from command line<br />
<br />
rexec hostname -l unixusername ls<br />
enter password when prompted. <br />
<br />
If you cannont get the output, the rexec setting is messed i.e the tcpip <br />
installtion issue<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This has been confirmed over 3 computers now to fix the problem. apparently TCP/IP somehow got corrupted on the PC's when we demoted what used to be the PDC, DNS, DHCP, and WINS server.<br />
<br />
On the PC's <br />
<br />
1.) Installed NetBIOS so that the primary NIC had a protocal to bind with. <br />
(Rebooted)<br />
2.) I uninstalled TCI/IP from the machine for the primary NIC. (Rebooted)<br />
3.) I then uninstalled the NIC. (Rebooted)<br />
4.) The NIC automatically was found and reinstalled on boot up.<br />
5.) Next I reinstalled TCP/IP. (Rebooted)<br />
6.) Went into Advanced Settings for the Local Area Connection and moved TCI/IP <br />
above NetBIOS in the list of protocals.<br />
7.) and Last Uninstalled NetBIOS from the primary NIC.<br />
<br />
Note: Uninstalling TCP/IP from a windows 2000 pro workstation without first <br />
installing another protocal for for the Ethernet card to bind with for some <br />
reason made it near impossible to rebind the Ethernet card to TCP/IP once it <br />
was reinstalled. Hence using NetBIOS to temporarly bind to the network card <br />
seemed to fix the rebinding issue.<br />
<br />
I took notes from similar posts on the web on how to reinstall TCP/IP and added a few steps of my own after trial and error to get it to work again.</div></div><hr />
