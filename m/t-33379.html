<br />
Fax is nothing but a digital picture. One can theoretically use OCR to convert the picture ito words but you can directly forget it concidering the normal fax quality and the fact that a faxed document can have any layout imaginable depending on your customers. Even processing an E-Mail is not going to be easy for similar reasons. That is exactly the reason why people came up with EDI.<br />
<br />
PS: An E-Mail with a standardadized XML attachment (generated say wehen customer enters order details in a web site and presses submit button) would be a solution but which would involve some heavy duty programing.</div></div><hr />

there was a standard sheet with a list of products and boxes to tick, it detected which products had been selected and there were square boxes for each letter when writing details on the sheet that the ocr coverted to text. A template is created that maps the fields on the sheets to the data and this can be used to populate text files databases etc. <br />
