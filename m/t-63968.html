<br />
I'm facing an issue about the number of available licences. We've been audited by Infor. A particular day, their software has found 33 users, but we only have 15 licences. For them, the solution is simple: purchase 18 more licences...<br />
<br />
The fact is that if you have 10 licences, you can have 11 or more people using BaaN if they use the same account... and only 1 licence will be used.<br />
<br />
Do you have information if it's a known software issue? Any information would be welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrinmoygupta</div><div class="date">18th April 2013, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan IV licencing is based on concurrent users and if you have 15 concurrent licences then you can have 15 or less active baan logins at any particular time(less if there are orphan processes running in the background not freeing up licences). It is really other way round from what you said. So if 11 people are logged into baan using the same account concurrently that means you are using up 11 baan licences.<br />
<br />
I believe the audit is more to keep you informed on the adequacy of your licences vs your usage. You need to keep track of your total licences to total  users ratio, usage pattern(what is your usage at any time of the day, how many times you are getting no more licences message, if your key users are being denied logins regularly, is usage only high on a particular day of a week/month say period end etc.). In my organisation I've developed certain analytics to stay in control rather relying on external audit results.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sounds like you have a license for 15 named users, but there are 33 users in &quot;Maintain user data&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I think Infor is right: you have buy more named user licenses or change the 15 from named to concurrent users.<br />

Is there a way how we can monitor the used-up licenses at a specific time?</div></div><hr />
