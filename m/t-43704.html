<br />
We have Quality IDs that are no longer required and I am trying to remove them.   All have been used at some point but are no longer tied to a quality combination.<br />
<br />
Some IDs are readily deletable, others aren't and I can't work out why.<br />
The hitch comes when I try to delete the Test Groups within the Quality ID, LN comes back stating that they are still in use.<br />
<br />
I've run reports on the Quality IDs and Test Groups in use in the Standard and Specific Inspection tables and the Quality IDs in question aren't there, there are no current or planned inspections using these Quality IDs or Test Groups.<br />
<br />
As some ID's are deletable after use I'm nearly certain that it can't be the inspection history that is causing this.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an idea where else the test group information/reference might be held that would potentially prevent deletion?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I had hoped to remove this without having to resort to a table manipulation but I think this is going to be unavoidable - appreciate your help.<br />
