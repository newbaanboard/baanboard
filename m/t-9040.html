Can u be a bit more specific on ur needs... I have worked on OpenWorld, involving barcodes.. but i didn't get what exactly u want to do with OW. If it is simple enough, I may try to advise u to get it done using BCK.<br />
please explain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">10th March 2003, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Baan OW can be used, I know it is starting to be used for Barcoding.  The cheaper and more traditional approach for standard Bar coding needs is the Baan DDC.  The Baan DDC is made to hook up to bar code scanners, etc.<br />
Baan OW offers more for systems integration with Web processes or other 3rd party softwares.  Not sure what your requirements are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wim Kerkhoff</div><div class="date">19th April 2003, 03:06</div></div><div class="posttext">We bought some (well, just the Code128 symbology) from Azalea. They have a UFL for Crystal Reports that works quite nicely:<br />
<br />
http://www.azalea.com/SampleCode/<br />
<br />
This can be used in reports that are printed from Baan to Crystal Enterprise using the CES, or with Crystal Reports that use the Baan native driver for Crystal Reports.<br />
<br />
So there's a lot of ways to integrate it... in some other situations, we use the Crystal RDC API for Visual Basic to load a report, set some parameters, then print it automatically to TEC printers.</div></div><hr />

I was very happy to see your posting that the barcodes are printed from BaaN. I do know that BaaN supports printing of Barcodes using BW client or from unix level. <br />
<br />
I am trying to print the barcode of type 39 on the packing slip. I can able to print the barcode, but it always shows the resolution of 2.5, when checked with barcode verifier. We do changed the resolution by right clicking on the barcode to 3, 4 etc. But the resolution factor remains same. We are struck up here how to increase the resolution for this barcode.<br />
<br />
Also I am thinking of printing labels using Zebra printer. It will be great help, if you cna tell us how to do this. The type of printer device to be used in BaaN, how to pass values from BaaN  to be printed, how to design the label, etc.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for all your help.</div></div><hr />

As well as barcode printing, to which there are a number of solutions that are relatively simple, you also mention 'barcoding operations through baan'.  OW is not the best solution for this, have a look at...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">b.v.dj</div><div class="date">22nd July 2003, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been offline for a while (busy busy busy), but got several questions in my PM about printing to Zebra printers in Baan.<br />
<br />
We print  receive labels in our warehouse on Zebra S600's. (These printers are connected to our network with HP jetdirect boxes.)<br />
For this to work I have taken the following steps:<br />
<br />
1) Create a label with Codesoft in which I have defined the text fields we needed. Then I've printed it to file with the Zebra driver. You get a file with ZPL-code. <br />
<br />
2) In this file I had to modify this file to insert &quot;Fieldmarkers&quot;. This fieldmarkers are used in the Baan report. <br />
<br />
3) The next  thing to do, is sending the file to the flash of the printer.<br />
<br />
The ZPL-file looks like this:<br />
^XA<br />

^PQ1,0,1,Y<br />
^XZ<br />
<br />
4)In Baan I've made a report that generates lines with ZPL-code. This ZPL code calls for the label in the flash memory and passes the values of the fields. The printer then generates the layout and prints (what else).<br />
The Baan output looks like this:<br />
^XA<br />
^XFE:PICK.ZPL^FS<br />
^FN01^FD450.999.00054   ^FS<br />
^FN02^FDIC SMD GS9035ACPJ PLCC-28     ^FS<br />

^FN04^FDGENNUM      ^FS<br />
^FN05^FD                   ^FS<br />
^FN06^FD                           ^FS<br />
^FN07^FD            ^FS<br />

^FN09^FD            ^FS<br />
^FN10^FD          ^FS<br />
^FN11^FD010^FS<br />
^FN12^FD          ^FS<br />
^FN13^FD    78,00^FS<br />
^PQ1,0,1,N<br />
^XZ<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage of this solution is that I don't need BOW and I don't print using BWprint.<br />
<br />
I hope this is of any use.<br />
