Check with your seller/implementation partner/consultant for details.<br />
The support contract should give you a few logins to access the support website. See the thread http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=959&amp;highlight=support for more details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">janus#</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi victor,<br />
what if my available support contract with our local baan center ends.<br />
Because We don't want to make new support contract with them .  But want to get suport from baan support . <br />
Is it possible to get support from baan support without making contract with the locals. <br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
I don't think it will be possible to have a direct support contract with BaaN. You have to go through the local support partners only<br />

<br />
do you have a contract with a Baan Partner? And the contract ends now?<br />
<br />
If so, you are free to have a contract with Baan directly.<br />
<br />
There are many customers that are supported directly by Baan; at least I can tell about my own region (EMEA).<br />
<br />
There are only a few exceptions. e. g. the customers in Eastern Europe get first line support by a partner but they get second line support by the German Support Center.<br />
<br />
Where are you located? If I know where you are I could tell you who you could turn to.<br />
<br />
Bye<br />

<br />
let me guess, is ELAN your local partner?<br />
<br />
Even if you have a worldwide contract with Baan directly, the first level support is done by ELAN.<br />
<br />

<br />
I am afraid but julisb is right. <br />
<br />
Turkey belongs to the Eastern Europe Support Area. And this is one of the few exeptions.<br />
<br />
Sorry <br />
