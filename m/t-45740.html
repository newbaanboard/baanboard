Thank you for your repply, unfortunately I do not use BAAN it is printout that was given to me last year there are other  printouts provided on one set Ach colum which appear to denote days outstanding since invoice was overdue give printout where this colum is ###<br />
while subsequent print of the same point give results as 1473 days outstanding as well as further V03 those are apparently invoices or credits which appear in later printout but the resulting total remind the same.<br />
I posted those on the board and will send them to you if you do'nt mind.<br />
Thanks<br />
Joe<br />
P.S. it is just strange because if you can print this things at will then there can be great potential for misrepresentation.</div></div><hr />
