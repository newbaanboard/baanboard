One version of the device is to pull from tray 3, leagl paper, but I have tried several different hp_lj5si drivers that point to tray 3 but the printer consistently pulls from tray 2-letter paper. Any suggetions?</div></div><hr />

You need to find out what escape sequence you need to send to the printer in order to use a specific tray. As soon as you know (test it with a simple ascii file) than you can apply it to the printer driver.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
create two Drivers in $BSE/lib/printinf with different INIT PCL sequence.<br />
One for BIN 1 and One for BIN 2<br />
<br />
Assign this driver to your BaaN device eg:<br />
<br />
XP6250-B1 for BIN 1<br />
XP6250-B2 for BIN 2<br />
<br />
