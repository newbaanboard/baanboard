An error code was there. But I don't remember now, am at home now.By the way, what you mean by if I have permission to create files on this directory? could you please explain? When I face this same problem three years before, I had created a .batch file to solve it out. Now i forgot that batch file command. please tell me if you know. Is there any other way to solve this issue? Thanks for your help.<br />

My OS is Vista.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
check permission in destination folder.<br />
<br />
2nd : The blank in &quot;program files&quot; maybe cause a problem. BaaN don't like blanks.<br />
Try to write to a dir without blanks in path and filename.<br />
<br />
