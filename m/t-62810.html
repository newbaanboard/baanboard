<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">5th September 2012, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently our organization has several instances of Baan IVc4 installed to support different plant locations in North and South America.  For reporting we use Baan IVc4's native engines for standard and customized reports.<br />
<br />
We have our Baan instances installed on a Windows OS connected to a Windows SQL Server instance.  We do not currently utilize any reporting from Microsoft Reporting Services.<br />
<br />
We will be migrating some of our Baan IVc4 instances to Infor LN relatively soon.  <br />
<br />
On a Infor LN installation (Windows OS/Windows SQL Server) is Microsoft Reporting Services utilized as a reporting service?  I realize that being connected to the database LN uses, reports could be generated using Reporting Services, but is there anything 'native' or 'out of the box' that ERP LN would use Reporting Services for?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any replies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">6th September 2012, 09:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, LN FP7 has an integration with MS Reporting Services. For a number of native reports new MSRS designs are delivered by Infor and creating your own designs is also possible. See for example KB http://www.inforxtreme.com/espublic//EN/AnswerLinkDotNet/Solutions/ViewSolution.aspx?SolutionID=22947060 .<br />
Note that you can also create your own reports directly on the LN database, but then you are missing the business logic that is already in the native reports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">6th September 2012, 16:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I will check out the documentation.  <br />
<br />
Just a general question to LN users... Do you typically use the Native (Baan IVc4/LN) reports or MS Reporting Services when generating new/custom reports?  Does one have an advantage over the other or is more of a preference based on what your developers are comfortable with?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your response!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">6th September 2012, 21:45</div></div><div class="posttext">i create both but probably 75% of the time i use ssrs reports. one big advantage is i can create a report linking all databases in my company, not just the LN database. in fact my LN db is DB2, i link it to sql servers within the org. SSRS also has the so-called subreport where you can drill down from the main report. i can take advantage of colors for status of sales orders for example. logo is easy to implement. one report i have done is for kitting on Production orders. the report will spit out the item numbers including the pictures. the pictures are not stored in LN database but on a separate sql server, i just linked them. SSRS has almost unlimited capability. it can do dynamic sql and if you're handy with VB you can create very complex functionality. i also advise to couple this skill with SSIS (both available from Visual studio) and you almost have unlimited capability in terms of reporting and data transformation. for example i read xml data from slm license server as a graph. this is accomplished through SSIS and read by SSRS.</div></div><hr />

i mean to say advantage of using SSRS over ERPLN<br />
and also objective of using SSRS (their is one main objective which i am not able to find my senior is asking me please share some knowledge)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rwmitchell</div><div class="date">12th December 2013, 02:43</div></div><div class="posttext">1. SSRS gives you an easy to use graphical interface. <br />
2. If you own MS SQL Server 2005 and above, you already own SSRS.(Nothing extra to buy)<br />
3. It greatly simplifies tasks such as drill-down or even including a logo on a report.<br />
4. It integrates with Visual Studio, so it leverages the entire Microsoft Dot Net framework.<br />
5. You can include custom VB code. (No C# yet, but I keep hoping.)</div></div><hr />
