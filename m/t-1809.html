This is a Baan 4 site and they have had it many years and never gotten it to work.  Would appreciate anyone who may have some education, training , manauals or similar white papers, not sales literature, answering.  Do not know anymore about the company or version then posted here.</div></div><hr />

She knew everything and anything to do with MOOPI.  You should be able to track her down.  She was with Baan education but that was the last I heard about her.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />
