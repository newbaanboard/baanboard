<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Question</div><div class="date">11th June 2013, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Can the user copy the text from Excel or Word or other file formats (using Ctrl C) then paste the copied text to Text Editor in Baan?  Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">12th June 2013, 22:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - but it can cause issues.  Word and excel can imbed control characters in it that can cause funny things to happen when printing.  We use notepad in baan for text and the user IS NOT suppose to copy and paste like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">12th June 2013, 23:34</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a mix of users that use the Baan text editor OR notepad.  By far most users use the Baan text editor.  Due to the nature of their job and interaction with Baan, the existing features work best for them as they have 'standard' text which is used on quotes/orders/invoices which they copy from an original text number.<br />
<br />
However, for some of our staff, we have set up the use of customized text fields so that they can copy large blocks of text out of a work instructions/quality documentation and paste them directly into Baan without retyping. <br />
<br />
Mark brings up a very good point regarding the control characters, but I honestly have never come across that issue in our environment.  We are a Microsoft Windows based organization.</div></div><hr />
