Currently we are using Z4000, which I believe are 4 -5 year old technology. Could you share your knowledge about any barcode label printers?<br />
<br />
The 2 companies that I have read about are Zebra and Intermec.<br />

They have a 3400 series printer that has worked well for our clients. They also have portable printers which are quite nice.<br />
<br />
We are an Intermec reseller, so if you'd like more information and/or pricing at any point, let me know. Generally going through a reseller for hardware will save you some $$$ instead of going direct.<br />

<br />
Before purchase any printer please keep in mind how to use the printer. Last 4 years I am working on barcode and I have checked all possible area for barcode through BaaN,Now I am printing barcode through Baan Only . I have use Intermac, seto , argox , Dadamax, Zebra and nornal lazer HP printer also . I have useed all printer. <br />
<br />
Now choice is depend on your work volume. If your want to heavy duty printer then go for &quot;DataMax&quot; Or &quot;Zebra&quot; printers . These two are good one.<br />
Both are fine but Zebra is bit costly.<br />
<br />
Best option is printing through HP printer ,No investment <br />
<br />

<br />
What were your reasons against the other printers. Also what factors influenced you to name the two that you have suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rakesh Khare</div><div class="date">7th February 2005, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
Are there any Barcode Label Printers that are non ribbon based? Ribbon seem to cause lot more problems than help any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Printers are thermal transfer or direct thermal. Thermal transfer labels last longer. Direct thermal labels are affected by sunlight and heat. They fade over time.<br />
<br />
If you do not need a long life on your labels you can choose to use direct thermal labels. The printers that do thermal transfer usually also support direct thermal printing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for Heavy duty printer best is Zebra &amp; datamax .<br />
We produce 14,000 stickers per day and we print 250 stickers at a stretch. For  printing 250 label others printer gives buffer problem it can't print . We explore all type of possibility. Even we print label on A4 sheets, 8X3 = 21 sheets on every pages. <br />
If you print through HP printer it will be very cheap.<br />
<br />
One more things , try to print labels through Baan Only don&#8217;t use any other software for label printing , If you want to use label printing software then go for &quot;BAR TENDER -  SEAGULL SCIENTIFIC&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
With Best Regards<br />

<br />
There is no question about 3400d printer but I can give come comparison between 3400d  with Zebra. Though I am not Barcode printer expert but I use all type of printer as Baan Tools Developer.<br />
<br />
1.  processor of zebra ( Z4m Plus) better then  Intermac 3400d<br />
<br />
2.  Z4m plus body and inside parts are also metallic but in intermac only body is metallic.<br />
<br />
3. In Zebra there is 3 censors which is not in Intermac 3400d<br />
<br />
4. If you give printing for 300 to 400 label at a time in Intermac you face buffer problem but in Zebra you will not face such type of problem.<br />
<br />
5. Which I feel censer of Zebra &amp; Data max is better then others<br />
<br />
6. For direct thermal printing is good but  in this printer s you can print  5ml barcode  ( if u print the barcode that will not be scan able)<br />
<br />
For Barcode all these are depends on what type of work you want to do.<br />
a) How many label you will print per day and at a time<br />
b) What is the size of the sticker?<br />
c) Sticker for short life or u want for long file.<br />
d) In which product u want to apply<br />
e) What is your budget and what is the cost of final product<br />
<br />
