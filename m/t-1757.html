<br />
     I need some help about doing electronic payment system.  Our procedures are as following.<br />
<br />
     1. Accountings user print report that I customized from Baan. <br />
     2. Finances user re-key data from report that customized into electronic payment system. The data all include invoice no.(tax invoice from supplier) ,document no., description, amount, WHT.<br />
     3. Then all data sent to standard chartered bank by modem.<br />
 <br />
    I want to reduce the step re-key data from Baan and pass the data automatically to electronic payment system. Which functions in Baan that we can apply for this procedure?<br />
    I just learn that the Citi bank's customers who using Baan system can somehow transfer or retrieve their data and information regarding payment system to/from Citi bank promptly without any duplicate entry work(re-key data). Would anyone check for us whether we can also using or applying the same system with Standard Chartered Bank as some as the worldwide Baan's customers?<br />
 <br />
Best regards,<br />
Viwat Sumpracha.</div></div><hr />
