<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newbaanbee</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">This may seem like a redundant question to some, BUT does anyone know of a way to copy/cut and paste in Baan IV when editing text. We are soon going &quot;Live&quot; with Baan IV after using Triton 3.1 for the last few years and have been told by our Baan Consultant that there is NOT a way to copy and paste.  I'm hoping she is wrong and someone out there has a magic keystroke we can use.  It is a basic tool that I assumed every program had (until now).  My job relies on this function (as many others do) to cut down on time wasted by retyping text.  thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">14th February 2002, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">If you set up your text groups to use an external editor (see session tttxt1116m000, Maintain Text Groups with External Editor), you can then use notepad to do standard Windows copy/paste.<br />
<br />
There is some copy capability in the built-in editor, but it is more primitive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruskin</div><div class="date">15th March 2002, 04:41</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to use escape keys, such as Escape-U. These are defined in your 'Text Editor Options' (session tttxt2100m000).<br />
<br />
But the copy is very clunky. It expects you to use Escape-( and Escape-) to indicate the start and end of the block you are copying and then Escape-) to paste. To make matters worse, it can often cause errors with your text window, as it puts your text into Read-Only when you do the copy and undoes the Read-Only when you paste. <br />
<br />
As 'evesely' has already stated, it would be recommended to use an external text editor (such as notepad)... (Interesting Baan consultant you must have, I take it they are not technical...).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">15th March 2002, 12:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not encourage my customers to use notepad or any other external editor. It may work when you are using just one language. But as soon as you are using multi-language functionality you get troubles because you have no possibility to switch the language.<br />
<br />
Also, there have been problems with losing texts while using an external editor.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I really wonder why Baan isn't willing or able to produce a simple client side text editor that would support copy and paste with other windows programs and still support the functionality needed by the Baan application (multi-language, de-link text from textfile, link texts etc.) as well. It cannot be too much additional functionality for the Baan client-server-protocol, and the windows text-editing functionality comes out-of-the-box.<br />
<br />
ANY Baan customer want's to have the possibility to copy text from Word into an order text, item text or whatever. So Baan Development, pleeeeeaaaaase.....</div></div><hr />
