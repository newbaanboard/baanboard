Hello,<br />
<br />
for oracle database theres &quot;ora_storage&quot; in $BSE/lib/ora.<br />
Here you define what conpany is in which tablespace, maybe for MS-SQL-Server <br />
you have to define it in a similar way.<br />
<br />

<br />
In addition to above , check weather tables already exists in DB for the company you are trying to create.<br />
<br />
Example :<br />
<br />
Oracle Query - <br />
select * from tab where tname like '%100'<br />
<br />
(i worked with sql 2003)<br />
sp_tables '%100'<br />
or <br />
select * from sysobjects where type = 'U' and name like '%100'<br />
<br />
where 100 is the company number.<br />
<br />

  Please post the error messages you get in the Windows NT Event Viewer at the time of creating tables with details of the error.<br />
<br />
sk<br />
<br />
P.S: Just to make sure this isnt any password related issue, Go to Maintain Database Groups {ttdba0120m000} and enter the password again. You do this by first selecting the &quot;baandb&quot; group in tab Database Groups and then going to the tab Maintain Db Group and click on the password. It will open up a small window for DBA Name and Password. Enter the correct name and password, same as what you entered while you installed baan. After this the system will ask you for the New Password for the baandb group, again enter the password you gave during the installation of baan. Save this record and go back to the previous tab &quot;Database Groups&quot; and then click on Create And Dump button. Do this only if you are sure about what passwords you gave during installation of Baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpchheda</div><div class="date">28th August 2008, 10:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi SK,<br />
I am not sure of the password during installation. As it was done in 1999 by my forefather..who have left the company..in that case what can be done..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">28th August 2008, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">As i had asked in my previous post, show us the details of Windows NT Event Viewer error messages (under application) that got generated when you tried creating the tables. It will reveal more about why you got Error 510 &amp; 1000.<br />
<br />
sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpchheda</div><div class="date">28th August 2008, 12:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your doubt of databse password was right. Just go through the event viewer log<br />
attached.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">28th August 2008, 12:52</div></div><div class="posttext">If anyone over here could vouch that nothing drastic would happen if you were to change the current baandb group password to something new, then you could take that approach. Ideally there shouldnt be a problem in doing so, as its being done through proper channels but then its best you get a second opinion on this approach as well...<br />
<br />
Good Luck!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpchheda</div><div class="date">28th August 2008, 13:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok i will wait for second opinion as suggested by you. Because at the moment (without infor support) i cant take the risk.<br />
