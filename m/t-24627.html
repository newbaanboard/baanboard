I was wondering if anybody is currently using SSA PDM with SolidWorks?  We will also be integrating with BaaN IV later on.  I have questions on how to handle SW template files in PDM and how to deal with configurations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ctefft</div><div class="date">28th October 2008, 01:38</div></div><div class="posttext">We have been using Baan PDM (PLM) system for several years. We are currently on PLM 8.1 using  integration with Solidworks 2008 sp4. I don't know what type of problems you are refering to. We are not having any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zlong11</div><div class="date">28th October 2008, 13:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your info. Personly, I prefer to use Baan PDM because it's inegration (communication) with Baan. However, One car roof company moved to Smarteam from Baan PDM because Baan IV did not integrate with Catia. One PDM vendor also gives a &quot;poor&quot; rate on Baan PDM CAD integration. <br />
Which Baan release do you use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ctefft</div><div class="date">3rd November 2008, 17:51</div></div><div class="posttext">We use BaanIVc4. The cad integration is the best it has ever been. We are pleased with the latest release of SW integration.</div></div><hr />
