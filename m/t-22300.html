Does anybody have any experience with that software solution?  It would be great to talk to someone that has already done it!<br />

<br />
I'm in the middel of an implementation project concerning BIVc4 and WMS4000 (also known as Exe, acquired by SSA last year)<br />
SSA has developped a standard interface with WMS4000 which is part of SP18; I reckon you can use most of the software to talk with other WMS-appl's. It based on Baan open world.</div></div><hr />
