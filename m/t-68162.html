<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanDev14</div><div class="date">21st September 2015, 22:08</div></div><div class="posttext">When we add a new part drawing to our storage they are stored in a place where BaaN users can access them by clicking on the drawings button and that seems to be working fine. Now we are needing to launch a batch file that will be used to serve a drawing via HTTP from our Autodesk Vault. <br />
<br />
When I bring up the Maintain Engineering Item Revisions session and go to Form 3, we have numerous boxes where we can place the path of the drawing. What we want to do is to actually run a batch file with a command line argument that is the file name of the drawing which is stored in our Autodesk Vault server. The command line will look like this:<br />
<br />
   C:\GetVaultDwg.bat 80039<br />
<br />
We can get the batch file to execute but in this process the command line argument gets stripped off. Can anyone enlighten us on this?</div></div><hr />

Can you post your bat file script?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanDev14</div><div class="date">23rd September 2015, 00:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your reply. I have been told from one of our BaaN developers that they were able to get my batch file working. I have not seen the changes they made to the file yet, but I'll try an post that by tomorrow morning. I'm afraid this quick fix they did will not resolve our problem in the long run. But, you never know.</div></div><hr />
