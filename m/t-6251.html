<br />
Basically I have a goods in my GRINYA account, that have already been paid, therefore I should not be accruing for it.<br />
<br />
It was mentioned to me that I should match up the goods received with a dummy invoice in the amount of $0.00.<br />
<br />
Does this sound right.<br />
<br />
If it is correct, can you confirm that when I match the line items, I match them as &quot;PARTIAL&quot;, for the full quanity amount, but for a &quot;$0.00&quot; amount.<br />
<br />
Thank-you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The answer is Yes, qualified by No, If, Maybe.<br />
<br />
You have three issues:<br />
1)	The delivery status of the purchase receipt (pur045) does not indicate that the full qty has been approved. You need to correct this so that the receipt wont appear as open for subsequent AP matches.<br />
2)             The GRINYA account is misstated.<br />
3)	The postings to the general ledger due to the misc invoice [probably] need to be corrected.<br />
<br />
To effectively show the full qty of the receipt in pur045 as matched [Delivery Status=3(All Approved) with remaining qty=0], you merely need to match the full qty to an invoice. Either a partial match of the full qty or a complete match will accomplish that but each choice has a different impact on ledger.<br />
<br />
To correct the ledger postings, you have to review your integration set up, review the postings from the miscellaneous invoice and then decide where the financial transactions from the $0 invoice should post. The following discussion assumes that you are not using lot pricing and that you are using Baan IV (i.e., the same Purchase/Result setup is used for PPV at receipt and PPV at invoice approval).<br />
<br />
When the receipt was entered, Baan credited your GRINYA account (at PO price), debited an inventory account (at std cost) and posted the difference to a PPV account. These postings were correct.<br />
<br />
When the misc invoice was entered, you credited an AP control account and debited one or more manually entered accounts. If the invoice amount and tax was correct, AP control is correct. The offset (debit) accounts are probably wrong.<br />
<br />
If you had correctly entered a purchase invoice linked to a PO and matched the invoice to the receipt, the GRINYA account would have been debited/cleared. Any difference between the invoice amount and GRINYA (PO amount) would have been posted as a Purchase/Result to a PPV account.<br />
<br />
If you now correct by entering a $0.00 invoice matched to the receipt as PARTIAL with the full qty but with $0.00 amount, the GRINYA account will b debited correctly but the full PO amount will be booked (on approval) as a favorable result to the PPV account specified by your integration setup. If the misc invoice was debited to this PPV account, the ledger is correctly stated. If not, you will need to enter a journal voucher to credit the account(s) hit by the misc invoice and debit the PPV account.<br />
<br />
If instead you correct by entering a $0.00 invoice matched to the receipt as COMPLETE, the GRINYA account will b debited correctly and any purchase result will be correctly posted to PPV via integration. You will not be able to approve the invoice until you manually book the unmatched amount ($0.00 less GRINY/PO value). If you book this difference to the account(s) debited by the misc invoice, ledger will be stated correctly. <br />
<br />
Of the two, I would prefer to do a COMPLETE match, manually booking the unmatched amount to offset the misc invoice. That way if you analyze Purchase/Result transactions by item from the integrations table, PPV should still be accurate.<br />

<br />
I agree 100% with Scott - you want to match COMPLETELY with a $0 invoice, and book the variance to the debit account that was affected by your misc. invoice payment.  <br />
<br />
We have had this same situation happen here, and Scott's solution is exactly how we handled ours.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
