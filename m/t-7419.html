via a 3gl/4gl program ?<br />
<br />
The situation I have in mind is when sending faxes and emails on a casual basis (we already do this automatically from specific sessions eg: purchase orders, sales acknowlegement)<br />
<br />
It would be very useful if we could look up adddresses/fax nos for one off reports and then pass this to the programs that we invoke from the print device.<br />
<br />
Hope you can help<br />
<br />
nb: we have 4c4 aix/oracle environment</div></div><hr />

You might like to check out the -<br />
<br />
Spooling overview and synopsis (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_spooling_overview_and_synopsis) <br />
<br />
If this doesnt help you can you please specify more details.</div></div><hr />

I will explain what I have in mind. <br />
<br />
What I would like to be able to do is specify a fax number or an email address when selecting the device.   This is before the print data is sent to the spooler.<br />
<br />
If I could execute a program at this point I could enter (or determine in a program) and pass the email address or fax number to my fax/email program and then be able to email/fax any report without changing the (every)report program.<br />
<br />
Essentially what I am looking for is an exit from ttstpsplopen to get extra inforamtion at the device selection time. When the email device is selected them I want to ask for email address.  This would avoid  lots of work to change manny programs that need to be emailed/faxed only no and again.  Reports that need to be emailed regularly are no problem because the work to change them is justified.<br />

I am not aware if this functionality is available in your Baan Version or not.<br />
<br />
For us, its part of the standard tools so I wouldnt consider the option of reinventing the wheel.<br />
<br />
But just as I suggested you can still use the spool functions. You need to create your program and a new device, which takes the control in a print session and that program gives the user the choice to send to email or fax, after the selection is made you can set the spool.device and spool.report etc variables and processing the info.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps you.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for the screen images.  Unfortunately the BaanIV versions do not have the additional &quot;Send Message&quot; functionality<br />
<br />
In fact what you have shown me is exac tly what I am trying to achive with 4c4.  <br />
<br />
I have attached the 4c4 screen images for you interest<br />

<br />
i would suggest you write your own conversion program.<br />
and you put this session instead of ottstpconv in your printer setup.<br />
so you can easily redirect/modify your printout.<br />
e.g. send it to a fax or pdf or mail etc ...<br />
<br />
you can check the board for some more hints on this issue :)<br />
<br />
Try it,<br />
