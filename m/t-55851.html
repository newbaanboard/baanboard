With reference to above thread....<br />
<br />
I was facing similar problem and after Maintaning Inbound advice, could clear the block. And my inventory got transfer from INSP location to RECEIPT location.<br />
But can anybody throw some light on this, in which conditions, after Maitaining Approavls, the item gets block, and why?<br />
Because this is the not case for each and every items, so want to understand th reason of blocking and not getting tranfer of inventory to Receipt location.<br />
<br />
