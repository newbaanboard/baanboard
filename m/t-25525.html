<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gabymore</div><div class="date">1st November 2005, 23:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 2 sites proposed. It's 2 different manufacturing plants 2 different servers, both in Baan IV c2 MCR and Oracle 9i.<br />
Plant 1 has many companies and among them is the Group Company which sells plant's 1 and 2 products online and in realtime.<br />
<br />
We are having problems sharing tables to the point that when the frame relay connection breaks, all operations are stopped.<br />
<br />
We need intercompany transactions in real time. Baan has forced us to create all user of site 1 in site 2 and viceversa. Otherwise we get error 506 and 512.<br />
<br />
We are considering replication with Oracle, but for a later phase. <br />
<br />
We created a replica of company site 2 on site 1 so when an intercompany records is generated it is routed to the database on site 2.<br />
<br />
Apparently the problem is that Baan checks on each and every company on both sides before actualy saving the info. That could be solved creating all companies on both servers, still, we canÂ´t seem to be able to share master data from the site 1 group company and still be able to function separately in case the connection fails.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts around there?</div></div><hr />
