<br />
I would like to know which command I can use to update a file,<br />
becouse I'm using seq.puts and seq.write but is creating a new line.<br />
<br />
Thank's<br />

How have you written it?  I would think the pointer would determine where in the file the seq.write writes to.  Have you tried opening with 'w+' instead of 'a+'?  This is supposed to start the pointer at the top of the file (a starts at the bottom).  And where does it put the line?</div></div><hr />

The programmer's manual has all the information for seq.open() and it depends on which mode you are opening the file.<br />
openmode<br />
 The mode in which the file must be opened. This can be one of the following options:<br />
<br />
&quot;r&quot; Open for reading. The current file position is placed at the start of the file.<br />
 <br />
&quot;w&quot; Open for writing. The file is created if it does not already exist. The current file position is placed at the start of the file.<br />
 <br />
&quot;a&quot; Open for writing. The file is created if it does not already exist. The current file position is placed at the end of the file. <br />
The file position is placed at end of the file before every write statement, even if the previous file action was a seq.seek(). <br />
 <br />
&quot;x&quot; Open for writing. This is the same as &quot;w&quot;, except that the function fails if the file already exists. <br />
 <br />
&quot;r+&quot; Same as &quot;r&quot;, but the file can also be written to.<br />
 <br />
&quot;w+&quot; Same as &quot;w&quot;, but the file can also be read. <br />
 <br />
&quot;a+&quot; Same as &quot;a&quot;, but the file can also be read.<br />
 <br />
&quot;x+&quot; Same as &quot;x&quot;, but the file can also be read.<br />
 <br />
Use the following modes to indicate whether the file is a binary or a text file. You can combine one of these modes with any one of the previous modes (for example, &quot;rt+&quot;). <br />
 <br />
&quot;b&quot; Use for binary files. This is the default mode and need not be specified. <br />
 <br />
&quot;t&quot; The line separator(s) for text-files are different on Windows NT and UNIX systems. CRLF on the former; LF only on the latter. In addition, a Windows NT text file can include an EOF-character (^Z) that indicates the end of the file. This character should not be returned to a program reading the file.<br />
<br />
So, you must specify the &quot;t&quot; option when reading from or writing to a text file on Windows NT systems (for example, &quot;at+&quot;.) This ensures that line separators and EOF characters are handled correctly. Never use the &quot;t&quot; option when opening a binary file; on Windows NT systems this will corrupt the file data. The &quot;t&quot; option has no effect on UNIX systems. <br />
Post your code for others to review it.</div></div><hr />

This thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=10432&amp;highlight=seq.open) should help.  It appears that there are some questions still around this topic.
