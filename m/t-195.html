I know what some of them do but not the rest.<br />
<br />
Can you also tell me what the bic_xx files are under $BSE/include6.1?<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
I don't know of any particular documents aside from the Baan Technical Manual.<br />
<br />
Which files in particular are you interested in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You going to wish you never asked &quot;What particular files&quot;. I've attached a document showing the ones that I don't know anything about. As it is most of the files in $BSE/bin perhaps you could tell me about the more useful ones to be used in a HPUX\Oracle805\Baan 4c4 combination. Do most of these binaries have an equivalent session in the Baan GUI?<br />
<br />
You also mention the Baan Technical Manual. Should this have been included with our Baan software? IÂ’ve got one CD entitled &quot;Baan IV c4 Documentation CD10&quot; This only has release notes and installation guides no technical manuals. <br />
<br />
Does your technical manual have a Baan ref. number? If so I could ask Baan to send me one.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

Your a Star!!!<br />
<br />
You obviously have an electronic copy of this Tech manual. Any chance of a copy please?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">21st September 2001, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Here you go, a snapshot of all the BaanDOCS taken 1 year ago - most are still valid.<br />
<br />
Use this document to search for a document title and it is a a document with a code other than P or a D (the U's are user documents, so everybody should be able to get these ones).<br />
<br />
[I only looked at English language documents, of course...]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">21st September 2001, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Victor<br />
<br />
There's certainley a lot of Baan documentation out there.<br />
<br />
What are P &amp; D documents?<br />
<br />
Do Baan not produce a generic document CD-ROM available for purchase or is this the KnowledgeQuest CD?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
PJ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">21st September 2001, 14:09</div></div><div class="posttext">D = development (very technical stuff)<br />
P = programming (4GL programming usually)<br />
U = user manual (usage/&quot;technical but not too much&quot;)<br />
<br />
The Knowledge Quest has nothing to do with this documents.<br />
This documents are in .pdf (Adobe Acrobat) format.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pjohns</div><div class="date">21st September 2001, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">So are these documents available on request only or can you buy a cd from Baan that includes them all?<br />
<br />
Are they available on-line anywhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
