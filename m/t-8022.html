Is there someone who knows abouth a solution to access a BISAM- and TBASE database (Baan Triton) with an ODBC solution????<br />
Or perhaps the possibility to establish a table connection in msAccess to the tables in BISAM- and TBASE DATABASE.<br />
<br />
If you do, please let me know.<br />

It might be a solution for you, since it's working with TBase, too. It is offered by the dutch company Quadriceps: www.quadriceps.nl</div></div><hr />

I'm new here and am facing a similar problem. Thanks for the links to the croko reporter program, it looks to be exactly what I need. However, I don't speak German and can't seem to get ahold of any of the German sites you listed. Do you know of any English sites?<br />

Have a look at this member's profile (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/member.php?s=&amp;action=getinfo&amp;userid=79). He works for Quadriceps and has made some posts on Croko Reporter on the board. I am sure he can you get more info iif you email him. You can do this through the board using the link in his profile.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply. <br />
<br />
His email via profile option is turned off, however, I emailed him through his website and also sent him a PM.<br />
<br />
I feel very fortunate to have found such an active board. <br />
<br />
I am basically starting to document our company processes, a big part of which is Baan. We don't have alot of documentation, so my job has become a difficult one.<br />
<br />
If you get a chance, please take a look at my post here. (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12954) <br />

I am afraid I wouldn't be much help for the topics of your post but but I am sure there are members who can and will. With 30000+ posts on this board, there is a vast knowledge repository already available for you to go through :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've tried Croko reporter - doesn't seem to fit our business needs - are there any other ideas or recommendations for accessing the bisam flat files from outside of baan? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">26th September 2003, 21:44</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've been able to gather, not only is it a problem connecting to Baan Triton, but also the problem lies in the non-existent documentation of it's structure (which tables hold which data). <br />
<br />
From another thread, someone posted that there were somewhere around 1,800 tables in Baan Triton. Yes, 1,800. <br />
<br />
All the tables have weird names, and it's seems to be hit or miss on what's in them. <br />
<br />
I believe I looked at Croko reporter, it looked great, but I couldn't swallow the price (small company). Now that brings the question of why the company I work for of about 50 employees ever ended up with Baan in the first place. Overkill. <br />
<br />
There has to be some way to read the Baan tables into another db format. <br />
<br />
I'm sure the new versions of Baan work great, but I'm dealing with Triton and all I get is pain due to a severe lack of documentation and setup. <br />
<br />
If anyone has a line on some way to just do a massive dump of data out of Baan into another db, I'm all for it. <br />
<br />
Also, if anyone has any documentation, I'm up for it. <br />
<br />
Starting with nothing, I might be forced to start documenting one by one, and it looks like it won't be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">26th September 2003, 21:51</div></div><div class="posttext">DonBecker<br />
<br />
In our environment we have around 1900 table files.  the filename structure actually makes sense -<br />
<br />
for example<br />
<br />
ttiitm001100.bdt/bid<br />
Break it down:<br />
<br />
[t] = &quot;table&quot;<br />
[ti] = package<br />
[itm] = module<br />
[001] = item master data<br />
[100] = company number<br />
[bdt / bid] BDT is the table file, BID is the index file...<br />
<br />
It's actually set up very logically - for example, all tables in the package/module ti/itm are typically located in a directory ttiitm.<br />
<br />
You can look at pretty much any table and correspond these files to the table number in GTM.<br />
<br />
I agree, Croko is too expensive for what we'd like to do - extract data on a realtime basis from an external application.  Right now we're batching it.<br />
<br />
I must agree on the lack of documentation - let me know if you find something.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you use the session ttadv4420m000, Print Table Definitions, it will provide you a list of tables with thier names, broken down in groups of &quot;packages&quot;.<br />
<br />
We have the grey binders as well.  I've found that since BaanIV is pretty similar in structure that you can get the Baan IV document on something and use it as a starting point while creating your own version.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the built in help text that Baan has on a subject is actually quite usefull as well.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you need help with the table listing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">26th September 2003, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, that worked. <br />
<br />
45 pages later.....  :)<br />
<br />
Here's a question...<br />
<br />
All of the listings are seperated by package. <br />
<br />
<br />
But not all the packages say Triton.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
:tc Common Baan IV b<br />
:td Distribution Baan IV b<br />
:tf Finance Baan IV b<br />
<br />
I thought I had Baan Triton?<br />
<br />
At least that's what the main menu says. <br />
Sheesh, after all the windows programming I've done, doing something in unix sure makes me feel like a newbie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmarles</div><div class="date">26th September 2003, 22:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Don<br />
<br />
Baan is broken down into packages &amp; modules.  Baan is very structured or modular in this way.<br />
<br />
For example, the TC package is &quot;common&quot; or all of the common data (ie customers, suppliers, etc).  or Distribution is where you would keep track of all your incoming and outgoing supplies, if for example, you purchase/sell stock.<br />
<br />
Each of those packages is what makes up Baan.  You need to have a license for each package you use - so things that you don't use (for example, we don't use the transportation package), you don't need a license for (and it won't work). <br />
<br />
Looking at what you posted though, you said <br />
<br />
&quot;tc Common Baan IV b.&quot;<br />
<br />
Are you actually on IVb? or or 3.1?<br />
<br />
Triton is the interface that Baan employs to layout and access the packages (common, finance, etc) and modules (itm, pcs, etc).<br />
&lt;someone correct me if that's an incorrect statement&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DonBecker</div><div class="date">26th September 2003, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I'm not sure, here's what I do know....<br />
<br />
We use a terminal emulator program called Smarterm Essential, made by a company called Persoft. <br />
<br />
This lets us interface with our Baan Unix server from our Windows 2000 PC's.<br />
<br />
When I login to Baan, I see a main menu. <br />
<br />
At the top it says: &quot;Triton General menu&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I have a number of options, most have 3.1 after them, except for Organizer and enterprise (1.3) and Tools and Exchange (6.1). <br />
<br />
Again the others (Common, finance, mfg, distribution, transportation and service) all have a 3.1 after them. <br />
<br />
But when I did the tables by package printout, at the top it says this:  <br />
<br />
Package     :  tc   Common Baan IV b<br />
<br />
So is that Baan IV?<br />
<br />
I had a thread earlier this month on my version and some people walked me through it and told me I had Triton, but then this IV comes up. click here for the thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12954) <br />
<br />
What do you think? Can you show me a way to determine which version?<br />
<br />
BTW, I have access to an ftp connected to the Unix server, so if there's a file there that could tell me (or a structure, etc.) let me know and I'll look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">27th September 2003, 09:52</div></div><div class="posttext">In all probability the version is 3.1. However u can be sure of that by printing a session info for any session (ttstpsessinfo). The highest pvrc for tt package will indicate ur Baan version.<br />
<br />
U can use P (assuming English language) in the ascii menu to start the session directly without going through normal menu channel.</div></div><hr />

What do you think? Can you show me a way to determine which version<br />
in the thread you connect to lbencic said <br />
You are indeed on Triton 3.1. You can check the exact specifics when you log in. Assuming you type the ba6.1, type ba6.1 -V, which will display your version, porting set, etc<br />
The last porting set version that baan has released for 3.1 is 6.1c.06.07.  <br />
<br />
You are probably on 3.1 - if it *IS* Baan IV, I would have to agree that it would indeed have been a very poor conversion (as per the thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12954) )<br />
<br />
Looking forward to the Triton / 3.1 forum &quot;opportunity next week&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
do the ba6.1 -v from the shell prompt.<br />
<br />
Drop to the shell by using the &quot;&lt;&quot; symbol from the choice prompt.  <br />
<br />
I would suggest using that at the menu choice prompt since it will open a new shell instance instead of locking up the current session you are in when you shell out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To check the derivation of each of your packages, that ttstpsessinfo would help.  Or just open up 'Display Package VRC's' - (Tools / Application Customization / Packages and Modules / Inquiry / Display Package VRC's).<br />
<br />
This session will show the derivation for each package you have.  The lowest level will be the standard - it will say if it is B40b or c or 3.1 something...Maybe post a screen print of the derivation for your question packages like tc for us to review. <br />
<br />
You can't run that for package tt, but running that ttstpsessinfo would help there - from the main menu type 'P' for running a process (if your user is allowed, it will prompt you to type in a process to run).  Type 'ttstpsessinfo', this will hopefully bring up that tools session.  Leave your VRC, and put in a popular session, like tdsls4101m000, choose continue.  If it's the same in Triton as what I see, the first breakdown it gives you is your derivation structure for all packages, including tools.  Maybe post that first derivation breakdown for us to see  (not the whole sessinfo).  If that's what you used to get the Baan IVb derivation you submitted above, it looks different from my ttstpsessinfo results, but still seems to say you are on Baan IVb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">30th September 2003, 00:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, this could easily happen if an upgrade was done without paying attention to that menu.  Maybe the main menu (Triton 3.1) was customized, and copied over during the upgrade to Baan IVb and not changed.   I think that is likely considering all your printouts of derivation say you are on IVb.</div></div><hr />

So as I understand your last post, we could be running Baan IV and still be using the menu from Triton, giving us the impression we're running Baan 3.1?<br />

Thank you SO much for your time, it is greatly appreciated. I'm looking forward to the ability to collaborate on Baan documentation.</div></div><hr />
