<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">26th May 2009, 19:42</div></div><div class="posttext">This is how it works in ERPJewels . This meets ur overall requirement.<br />
<br />
1. There is easy analysis creator which helps user create an analysis in 2 mins <br />
(less setuptime) http://www.erpjewels.com/Easyanalysis.htm<br />
<br />
2. By default , for plain excel , all report output fields with sort fields (whether output or not) are selected by <br />
default. User can add / delete / modify /re-order the same . User can get further add lookups /create any <br />
expressions of it / add UDFs  as analysis fields (http://www.erpjewels.com/udfinbaan.htm)<br />
<br />
3. Boolean UDF will act as further filter on existing report data if that makes any logical sense to user.<br />
(http://www.erpjewels.com/udfinbaan.htm)<br />
<br />
4. Original report output  will remain same . There will be no need to modify the report layouts for Excel.<br />
Authorized users in authorized company will always get excel besides original baan report on specified baan device.<br />
<br />
5. The tool is not output formatting tool . It's realtime data extraction when report is run . Unlike output formatting <br />
approach , this approach has more analytical value adding more value in terms of classification,summarization , <br />
multi-dimesnional formatting . When u need specific format like invoice , Excel VBA can help but not through this tool <br />
(because it's  not output formatting)<br />
<br />
6. It  achieves this by recompiling reports with references to ERPJewels dll. By compiling the report in ttadv3130m000 all these references are removed .No changes are made to tt tables.<br />
For users it is not  important how it's  done. To them more important is  that they get what they want in the manner they want.And that's best accomplished this way.<br />
<br />
<br />
7.When u want all fields of a table , u dont need to right them one by one . By default without any field specification<br />
all table fields will be selected and show in Excel in able field order .</div></div><hr />
