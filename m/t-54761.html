But, I tried your suggestion of &quot;You can use Tools/AppDev/DomainsTables &quot; but I'm really not sure what you mean. I am using SSA worktop 2.4.5 to view the various sessions.  The menu options you specified don't seem to be the same as what I have.<br />
<br />
Warning: I'm very much a newbie to Worktop although expereinced with SQLServer.<br />
<br />
I just need to know the table name in SQLServer so I can link to it. An example would be like &quot;Labor types&quot;. This is session tcppl0130m000  which relates to the table. tcppl030nnn (where nnn is the company number).<br />
<br />
This was easy to find. I simply put &quot;type&quot; in the search feature of Worktop and it listed all the sessions with the word 'type' in it. Opened the session for &quot;Labor Types&quot;, then pressed &lt;SHF&gt;&lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;7&gt; to show the XML tree and was able to find the backend table name.<br />
<br />
But, for the life of me, I have no idea what they would have named the session I am looking for. If I knew that, I think I would be all set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may want to start by looking at tables ttadv400, ttadv401, and ttadv402 for company 000.  Please notice that the package VRC is part of the key of all the tables.  I recommend that you find a way to deal with that in anything you program.<br />

U can use table ttadv112000 for ur package combination and join with related sessions . Maybe this helps .</div></div><hr />

I believe that t_koor an enumerated data type. so the values would not be in a table, but stored in the baan data dictionary.<br />
<br />
I don't have easy access to baan right now, so if someone can verify that it'd be appreciated.<br />

<br />
To the OP, in my experience, these domains change rarely enough that it is usually easier to hardcode the values than to write something to try and look up the values every time.<br />

You can take the file and create a table of your own with which to link to the various Baan tables that use order type.  That is how we've done it with our add-on report writer.</div></div><hr />
