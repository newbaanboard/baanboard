<br />
<br />
We are working on CIV version. I have certain queries regarding the HR Module:<br />
<br />
<br />
Firstly, Can somebody help me out with establishing a date control in HR Module. , while creating a record of the new employee, the joining date has to be specified by the user, however, presently, the software does not validate the date being entered. Joining date can be any date.(past as well as future).<br />
<br />
We want to put a control over the date field, how can it be done?<br />
<br />
Further is there a  provision whereby a range of dates can be specified so that a date beyond the laid down range is not permitted to be entered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, while generating reports, considerable time is taken by the software in generating certain reports for example Income tax calculations, salary sheet etc. What are the possible reasons for  the same. <br />
<br />
Could you please guide us as to which reasons can be controlled.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards</div></div><hr />

If you do not have the code of the session, then try copying the form in your &quot;live&quot; VRC, and make the date field as display type, and set the default value as current system date. If more control is required, including laid down date range, then you have to ask for the code!!<br />
<br />
Q2. Performance.<br />
Again, you have to go through the code, to see why it takes so long!! Is it because of the quality of the code, or the amount of data, or calculations, or whatever...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanx for your prompt reply.....But the thing is i am not from a technical background.....could you please explian me....as to what kind of a session code have you referred to....is there a separate seesion in BaaN for Date Control.....which needs to be activated.<br />
<br />
I checked the report generation response time....and found that ususlly the reports are being generated quite swiftly.....the reports which take time involve certain calculations to be done,...so I guess its because of the calculations only....<br />
<br />
I have another query, as I told you earlier that we are using CIV version in BaaN, the HR module has all the basic common masters like unit master, location master, and division master. however as of now at the time of creating a record, the user has to feed in all the data regaring the unit, location and division, is it possible to create a link whereby upon specifying the unit the software picks up the location and division by itself based on the parameters defined. (in the organisation structure being used by the company, unit represents the lowest unit, locations are cities and divisions are regions)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx and regards<br />

<br />
We have to implement HR Income Tax Module, but we do not have any documentation for it. So we don't know how to start for HR Income Tax Module Implementation. Plese forward the Documentation for HR Income Tax Module Implemetation or any guidelines for the same.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
