Azud - an existing Spanish customer using Baan IV -is one of the world leaders in water treatment systems and engineering. Over the last 5 years, the company's turnover and number of employees have tripled, and today the Company is active in more than 130 countries.  AZUD's solutions are used in: Agriculture, Landscaping, Silviculture, Industrial Water Treatment (waste, industrial, filtration process in general), Desalting sites, Electronics and the Mining Industry.  Baan IV helped Azud implement solid internal business management processes and it then decided to widen its use of applications to offer more services to their Clients.  Azud bought Baan's eSales and SalesPlus solutions, and related services, to create a Customer Portal where key customers can access an electronic catalog and place new orders.  In addition customers will be able to access information on order tracking, stock disposal, invoicing, delivery notes, etc. <br />
<br />
This result has been achieved by consistent work from Jaime Llobet and the presales team.  Further information is available from Jaime Llobet, jllobet@ baan.com</div></div><hr />
