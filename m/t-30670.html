<br />
I have a 3rd party MSWindows bases integration and application development environment and I need to get it to talk to a Baan system running on HPUX 11i.<br />
<br />
A bit of background - I know extremely little about Baan, so I really just need pointing in the right direction. <br />
<br />
Our application will be used to take data and operations from various other systems and web services and then interface with Baan both to extract related data and to perform the customers operations (logging service calls, updating engineer data etc).  <br />
<br />
Can anyone give me any clues on how to do this?  Other ERP systems we've worked with have either accepted formatted XML on a given port, or had a published method of calling their services.  I can't find any way of doing this from the limited Baan documentation I have.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated - thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Lee.</div></div><hr />
