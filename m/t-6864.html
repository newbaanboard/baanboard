<br />
I can order baan manuals as paperbacks, but Baan tells me that for baan IV, these are at version 4b. We are at version 4c. <br />
<br />
Are there acrobat pdf files containing the latest baan 4 documentation. Not just for tools, admin, but for all modules?<br />
<br />
I was reading elsewhere about the ttdllfilehand and other ddl's in this forum.  Are these documented anywhere and are they available for Baan IV?<br />
<br />
Trying to order documentation from Baan via cyberdocs is a most frustrating experience. One has to know the document number before ordering. But there is no catalog for Acrobat file versions.  Is it possible that these versions do not exist?<br />

<br />
Baan Documentation (Cyberdocs) is Available for Customers right now (2002-8-30)<br />
Right now, customers are able to search through the Baan Product Documentation (Cyberdocs). Baan Documentation is available on the customerweb at the Documentation link, and via the Knowledge Base.<br />
<br />
I can search by document code, phrase or words, and download them, are you sure we're takling about the same &quot;cyberdocs&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the page, there was three radio buttons. I really tried all three. <br />
<br />
Is there a table of contents?  That would help me emensly.<br />

It seems it isn't working very well yet. It looks liek it only searches the document titles, and event that  doesn't work very well. <br />
The search for document numbers doesn't either work at all, or not all documents are online yet.<br />
I really hope that will change in the future, because it ablolutely points in the right direction how open Baan should be with documentation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just go to http://www.support.baan.com,and login with your valid permission(ID &amp; Password) given by Baan , then go to the Knowledge base. I think that you should have got the permission. <br />
<br />
At the right &quot;Express box&quot; or &quot;Search Method&quot;, you would find a link to Baan Documentation. <br />
Here you will be able to find most of the informatin you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Hope to help you something:rolleyes: :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried with keywords such as   programming, development, ddl,<br />
distribution, finance, etc. and got useless (to me) documents about baanpdm.  I am trying to get information about the latest functions and/or ddl's that are available for baan 4c4. It must include the name of the function and it's use.<br />
<br />
Even when I tried existing functions, I was met with the expression &quot;No data&quot;<br />
<br />
So, anyone have leads as to where to find the latest 4c4 pdf files about development, distribution, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pit0815</div><div class="date">30th September 2002, 22:16</div></div><div class="posttext">if you have the function or dll name, so just go to the &quot;search for latest solution for a session&quot;. Now, just read the help text below. <br />
In short, you need to enter the desired function/dll at the component field.<br />
<br />
success and have fun<br />

<br />
Re the documentation for functions and dll's. Before one can find the documentation, one must have the function and dll name.<br />
<br />
You peers on this site have made reference to dll's that are not in the standard baan documentation for Baan 4c4.   <br />
<br />
I for one would like to know if there is a location where all the functions/dll's  available for Baan today are listed, along with their descriptions.  <br />
<br />
The baan5 stuff on this site is great, but in Baan4 we do not have dfe, or DALs.  Ergo, are we the children who are going to be kept hungry?<br />
<br />
<br />
The lack of development and other softcopy documentation is keeping me from recommending Baan to others and from doing my job effortlessly.<br />

<br />
I understand your grievances as to the lack of BaanIV documentation. When we put the Programmer's Manual a while ago, it was decided together with Baan Development only to supply the BaanERP version. However we would like to see much more documentation on this site, including BaanIV. But it will take time, there are resources and permissions to contend with. We do our best :)</div></div><hr />

What type of documentation are you looking for.  I have most of the booklets you get from classroom training in electronic format (including the powerpoint presentations).  Let me know what you need and maybe I can be of some help.<br />
