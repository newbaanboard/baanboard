We are currently updating from BaaN IV c4 to SSA ERP LN 6.1 FP2.<br />
<br />
As we haven't used the Proposal/Quotation module in BaaN IV but would like to use the module in ERP LN our sales persons asked about the delivery date.<br />
<br />
As we are manufacturer of e.g. Oil Systems (production time up to 6 months) our sales people don't like to use a specific delivery date in their proposal.<br />
<br />
They would prefer to use something like a timeframe, e.g. &quot;delivery time 12 weeks after order placement&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know that we don't have to print out the delivery date on the report. But our sales people would also like to have some statistical information about their proposals and delivery time.<br />
<br />
How does other SSA ERP LN customers handle this? Is there any add-on available?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much,<br />
best regards,<br />
Oliver</div></div><hr />
