<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">22nd January 2008, 22:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed UltraEdit32 to try as a script editor for Baan IV.  Worked fine when editing then saving one program script at a time.  When having one open, then opening a second, the file for the second is lost in my client's 'baan tmp' folder (XP).  The Baan script is no longer locked, allowing the opening a second time.  The editor posts a warning message that the file is no longer available.<br />
<br />
I messed with the backup (disable) and temp file (disable) settings in uedit32 to see if they were the cause, and found that the Baan files were now created (.CLN), but the 2nd (and on) script edit &quot;lost&quot; connection with the client file/editor, allowing multiple edits and disallowing a save of the script back to the server.<br />
<br />
Is there a setting in Baan and/or UltraEdit32 to allow for multiple Baan scripts (.CLN) files to be edited concurrently?  Version is 13.20.1.1</div></div><hr />

<br />
Setting Multiple Instances might do the trick. Each file opens in it's own Editor.<br />
<br />
Advanced-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Application Layout-&gt;Miscellaneous-&gt;Allow Multiple Instances.</div></div><hr />
