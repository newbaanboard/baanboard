<br />
We are having some issues on new installed pc's with baan. They all have the same symptoms and that is that when you scroll in baan the letters keep being shown as a somewhat light grey print behind the new lines that show up.<br />
<br />
I've attached an image that shows what i mean. Cause it's easier to see it then to explain it :)<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what could be causing this?<br />
The old PC's were win xp SP3 and the new ones are also Win XP with SP3.<br />
Problem occurs also on win 7 pc's<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

All machines have latest drivers.<br />
Windows 7 and Xp also use different drivers so it's not in the display driver region.<br />
That is the first thing we've checked. That's the reason i posted it on this forum, cause we actually have no idea what else it could be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First I would contact infor support.  They might know what it is to start with.  Plus - those latest drivers could be the problem.  Do you all know the differences between the old imaged machines and the new ones?  You might be able to walk the list of differences and see which one might cause the problem.</div></div><hr />

We turned off Clear Type and the problem was solved.<br />
Try this in your system.</div></div><hr />
