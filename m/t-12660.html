<br />
We have been using DEM since 1999. Suddenly, our system starts to give error message, if dem users want to connect to the system.<br />
<br />
Error message:<br />
<br />
Zero pointer: name '' in qss.sort<br />
can not continue in tgbrg5501m000<br />
<br />
use off NULL pointer on ''<br />
can not continue in tgbrg5501m000 in DLL:otgbrgeditordll<br />
<br />
What does it mean this error message?<br />
How can we solve the problem?<br />
<br />
We can use normal baan browser.<br />
<br />
When I wanted to trace tgbrgeditordll, the system gave &quot;can't open input file : ittadv0001&quot; as an error message.<br />
<br />
<br />
I ran create/convert. but I wasn't able to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would like to use DEM again. <br />
<br />
How can we solve the problem?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

BaaN Tools includes/sources are not delivered to customers.<br />
You cannot compile that dll - tgbrgeditordll without having that include source.<br />
<br />
Contact your local BaaN support and get a patch to fix the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">21st August 2003, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">The most probable reason for this would be that someone accidently cleaned the message files located under the $BSE_TMP directory.  In the $BSE_TMP directory, look for subdirectories with the name formatted &lt;vers&gt;_&lt;rele&gt;_&lt;cust&gt;, where these values are fetched from the package tg in the current package combination.  The easiest would be to remove this subdirectory, since it is recreated and filled as soon as the first user starts the DEM browser.<br />
<br />
Hope this solves your problem...</div></div><hr />

Your solution solved my problem. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvanBeest</div><div class="date">21st August 2003, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you should report this to Baan Support as well.  In the DLL they make a small mistake, by not checking the number of lines read from the message files before sorting.  Empty files should not be possible, so they should build in an extra check before calling the qss.sort routine.  If they don't understand, send them to me :D.<br />
<br />
Something else that has been bothering me about your problem, is the compiling.  In the 4c3 version that I have, there is a file tgbrgtools in the update VRC.  This actually replaces the Tools include files.  In the solutions of tgbrgeditordll, solution DF2754 actually describes this change.  This defect was solved on 29-06-1998, so it seems that you have a very old source!</div></div><hr />
