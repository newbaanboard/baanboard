We have a requirement for an 80 character description field<br />
We will be using PDM<br />
We have Baan 5.0c<br />
the BAAN default is 30 characters only<br />
PDM max is 60 characters<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or experiences in this area</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">28th January 2002, 17:50</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a rough guideline, based on what I would do in a BAAN IV environment. I am sure the same will apply to the BAAN ERP (5.x) environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, locate the domain of the description that you want to modify.<br />
<br />
Next: Impact Analysis: At least do it for<br />
- Where-Used Tables<br />
- Where-Used Forms and Reports<br />
- Where-Used Program Scripts (Hopefully none will need to be changed in this special case).<br />
<br />
<br />
Next: Domain Modification<br />
- If the same change to the domain is acceptable for ALL the tables reported in the where used analysis, the next step is to copy the identified domain to the 'current' package VRC, edit the length to what you require, save the change, and run convert to Runtime DD, with Re-Organize tables flag checked. (This may have to be scheduled carefully if there is a lot of data in the tables, as the re-organize may take a long time.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Next: Inspection of Forms and Reports affected<br />
- It is possible that some of the forms and reports may need the description field to be suitably adjusted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next: Inspection of the Program Scripts<br />
- This is to ensure mainly that there are no 'hardcoded' program variables to store description with the old length.<br />
<br />
Next, check if the modifications have taken effect.<br />
<br />
Finally, move the modifications to the 'other' environments. For example, if your set up is 'development' environment, 'testing' environment and 'production' environment, then you would have made all the above modifications in the 'development' environment. You now have to export the modifications and import them into the 'test' and 'production' environments.<br />
<br />
Hope this is enough to get you started thinking of the details.</div></div><hr />
