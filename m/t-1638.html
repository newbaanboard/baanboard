<br />
Dear SupportEye user,<br />
<br />
<br />
We like to inform you that a new version of the iBaan SupportEye portal is<br />
available now. You can download this new version from solution 120511 on the<br />
Baan Online Support website (www.support.baan.com).<br />
<br />
This new version contains enhancements and additions to the scans. For<br />
example, the database scans now include SQL Server. Also known issues have<br />
been solved and the new iBaan SupportEye portal is fully compatible with<br />
Netscape.<br />
<br />
Another enhancement is a change in the licensing of iBaan SupportEye. The<br />
expiry date of the new version of the portal is no longer fixed, but you can<br />
obtain a license file at any time via the Baan Online Support website. This<br />
means that only when major upgrades are issued, you will need to install a<br />
new version of iBaan SupportEye.<br />
<br />
Should you have further questions or need assistance using SupportEye please<br />
read the information provided in solution 120511 or contact your local<br />
support center.</div></div><hr />
