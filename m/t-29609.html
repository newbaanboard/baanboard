<br />
Anyone knows how to configure the F5 key to swap processes in ASCII interface? I am using NETTERM to emulate VT100 term and I cannot start BW due to customer restrictions...<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a look at the definitions in $BSE/lib/terminf/v/vt100 (the terminal) and $BSE/lib/terminf/v/vtansi.fkeys (the key); e.g. pf1=\eOP means &quot;ESC [ O P&quot; or &quot;\033 [ O P &quot; on 7-bit lines, and &quot;\233 O P&quot; on 8-bit lines.<br />
<br />
A bit easier are ku=\e[A (that means key up = ESC [ A), kd (key down), kf and kl.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
to swap processes from BaaN in Ascii interface (ba6.1) the function keys F5 and F10 are used by application.<br />
<br />
It works on all terminal emulations in vt220 mode. WRQ Reflection, Putty (Freeware) a.s.o.<br />
<br />
I've tested with netterm, in vt220 mode the F5 , F6 , F.... keys are working !<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the help, guys... But here is not working yet. Netterm was in VT320 mode, I´ll try VT220.<br />
<br />
I saw the terminal file definition and tried to configure the keys in the same way, but it did not work...<br />
<br />
Thank you again, and excuse me for the poor english :p</div></div><hr />
