<br />
In the enterprise where I work we employ the ERP only as a data base. We want to use it as a real tool. For example to make forecast, to make ABC analysis or more...<br />
<br />
We need some information and we don't know how to find it. If we really want to modify our utilisation we have to know the consequence of a parameter's modification, and how to change some of the functions to obtain the informations automatically...<br />
<br />
Do you know a web site,  a book, a report or something else?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">6th November 2002, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Just go to Baan Support (http://secure2.support.baan.com/asp/default.asp), login, then go to the Documentation (left side).  In Express Box, you should see a link for Baan Documentation.  Once there, choose and search method and enter the search criteria.  The search is quite slow but does work eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">6th November 2002, 17:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe youre company should spend some $$ for the vendor or consulting company to come in and teach how to use the ERP software you have.  I would guess that youre company spent a significant  amount on the actual software, to spend some more to know how to use it properly would be better than using a book or report that you come across...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">7th November 2002, 08:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I can just repeat what Nick already said: Get some consultancy. You will not be able to learn how to really work with Baan just by reading documentation. Baan software is so big that any documentation just touches the surface. There are varoius ways of achieving the same result, and the main task is combining the building blocks that Baan software offers in an efficient way. Consulters have more experience in doing this (at least they should have), and that will save you money at the end of the day.<br />

While we had consultants attempt to teach, they were not worth the money.  I have learned by doing and reading and experimenting.  I feel you will find more value in what you can learn on your own but obviously there are probably better consultants out there.  My point is that you probably don't need them.</div></div><hr />
