<br />
I have a BaanIVc4 sp6 environment running on Windows, portingset 6.1c.07.21.<br />
<br />
The Baan server has been virtualized in 2009. At the moment of virtualization Infor stated that the licence daemon should run on a physical server. So we made a basic install of BaanIV on a physical server. On the virtualized Baan server we specified the name of the physical server in the licence6.1 file<br />
<br />
If this physical server crashes we will have a problem. As far as I know the MAC of the processor is in some way encoded in the validation keys Infor provided.<br />
<br />
Has Infor since 2009 created a solution for this problem? Is it now for example possible to virtualize the server on which the licence daemon is running? Or could this problem be solved using SLM?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your answers ...</div></div><hr />

all of our Baan-Servers are virtualized (hyper-v)<br />
we work with SLM. it works fine (5 Applikation-Servers: 1 Master and 4 for user-login, 1 dev, 1 test)<br />
slm runs on the Master-Server.<br />
all Servers are Windows 2008R2<br />

<br />
When I use the 6.1.3.7 licd.exe (my portingset is in fact 6.1c.07.21!) I guess I will have to regenerate security keys and install the new validation keys. Correct? <br />
<br />
I assume using an old licd.exe will work because in the generated security keys the MAC of the physical server will be encoded. So if this physical server crashes and I copy the virtualized Baan server to a new physical server it will not work. Correct?<br />
<br />
If so SLM seems to be the only remaining solution for my problem. Is there some documentation concerning SLM (installation &amp; explanation of the SLM mechanism so that I will understand why it will work). On baanboard I read that SLM is available starting at portingset 6.1c.08, so first of all I guess I should upgrade my portingset.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your answers ...</div></div><hr />

Only that the newer versions of licd.exe checks for virtual environment and the service fails on start-up saying VM detected. Older versions work fine. SLM is definitely better solution but for my situation that work around worked fine for three years without giving me any grief ever.<br />

Document &quot;U9555B US&quot; (SLM Adoption on Infor ERP Baan IVc) will give you a start. U9200D US is for installation.<br />
