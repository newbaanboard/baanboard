<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tony Curiale</div><div class="date">14th December 2009, 23:49</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using PMC to move solutions from a test machine/environment to 2 production servers. For no reason that I can determine, I have had some (not all) solutions on 2 of the 4 production environments suddenly change status from &quot;Installed&quot; to &quot;Available&quot;. Has this happened to anyone? Is there a reason for this? Would any one happen to have a way to change the status back to &quot;Installed&quot;? I'm afraid that if I actually re-do the &quot;Install Solution&quot; that I will wipe out the current/latest installs. We are running Baan IV c4 on Windows 2003. Thank you in advance for any help that I receive.</div></div><hr />

Someone might have uninstalled that PMC solution. Check the PMC solution history from the specific menu of Procession Solution (ttpms2101m000) or use the session directly - ttpmc2560m000. You have to install the solution to get to the 'Installed' status.</div></div><hr />

I think I have some digging to do. The data on the Print Solution History (ttpmc2460m000) was unexpected and does not match with what I think is the reality. Thank you for suggesting the Print Solution History.</div></div><hr />
