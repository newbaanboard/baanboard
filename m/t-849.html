Don't need the EURO documentation.  Seems that Baan cannot produce this.  :(<br />
<br />
Barring an official document, can anyone list c3 to c4 functional differences that they are aware of? <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give.</div></div><hr />

We are planning our upgrade from c2 to c4 in our european install (we are also installed in usa and in south africa - all on c2). could i trouble you for a set of the documentation you wrote about? we are a process chemical manufacturer - heavily customized. thank you very much.<br />

<br />
If anyone knows of a document for functional differences between c3 and c4, I would love to have a copy.  Or, any general knowledge about functional differences would also be helpful.  I have reviewed the release notes of the service packs, so I have everything after the initial release of c4.<br />
<br />
Can't think of any other way other than walking through the sessions one by one.</div></div><hr />
