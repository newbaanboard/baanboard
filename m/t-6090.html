<br />
What is the very latest version number of Baan available today ? and is this the version that most new users to the software would be implementing ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
The very latest GA version is iBaan ERP 5.2a (internally called &quot;Reger&quot;). However, only two customers are currently running this version. Most customers choosing for Baan 5 choose to go live on iBaan ERP 5.0c (internally called Corelli). This is because several enhancements (integrations, translations) are not available on 5.2a but are on 5.0c. <br />

<br />
many thanks for that. <br />
<br />
I have a futher question that perhaps you or someone can help clarify:<br />
<br />
A key part of our business is Service (as well as manufacturing, distribution, financials etc). We have heard that extensive enhancements have been made to this module (service), but only at 5.2 (ie this is missing from from 5.0c). Is this the case ? <br />
<br />
Andy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not a service expert so you'd better ask somebody else (a Baan service consultant for example). But as far as i know serialized items, depot and contract module has been enhanced in 5.2a. <br />
You could try to get your hand on a 5.2a version definition, this contains all details about the enhancements. <br />
<br />
Although most customers choose for 5.0c, maybe in your case 5.2a may be a better choice. If you don't mind integrations, use US english only and want to have 5.2a service functionality...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">More than three years ago I worked on a portion of the Service package which was being reworked to make it a more robust application for &quot;Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul&quot;. There was supposed to be enough functionality to support maintenance of aircrafts (whew!). So if Baan is indeed rolling out that code atlast then there are a lot of enhancements to the Service package.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">acapulco</div><div class="date">8th August 2002, 03:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Service is a stand alone module that is interfaced with the rest of the system (warehousing, finance, etc)  <br />
<br />
Baan 5c service is very good.  Baan 5.2 is new with few customers live, but they have added some new functionality like Ivo added.<br />
<br />
I would do a little RFI and then decide if you need Baan 5c or Baan 5.2<br />
<br />
