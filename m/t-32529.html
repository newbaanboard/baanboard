<br />
our existing setup - Baan IV C4 upto sp-17 and sql 2000.<br />
We are going to open a new branch office in different location.<br />
<br />
we are thinking of creating an new company in existing baan installation and point this baan company to a separate database which will be on a different server.<br />
<br />
so that this new baan company is used for new branch transactions.new branch will use our existing Baan setup.only diffference would be new baan company and a separate database on different server .<br />
<br />
Would you recommend this scenario and how would it be in terms of performance ?<br />
<br />
Kindly suggest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry, but I can't follow your thoughts here.<br />
When you say <br />
&lt;quote&gt;new branch will use our existing Baan setup.&lt;/quote&gt;<br />
do you mean that they will use your old application server and data for company 000 <br />
or do you mean that they will have a server for themselves containing a copy of your Baan system?<br />
Perhaps we can give you more clues if you answer the following questions:<br />
a) Is there any need that one company (or branch, as you put it) has direct access to the data of the other one?<br />
b) Do you change/modify your system on a regular basis? (Install sp, change forms/reports/sessions)?<br />
c) How many people will work with the new system.<br />
<br />
The number of DB servers is not important, the first question to be answered is the number of application servers needed.<br />
<br />

<br />
Good Morning,<br />
<br />
yes new branch will use old application server and data of company 000.<br />
they will connect to old server using Bw client.<br />
a)they will not have access to other company data.<br />
<br />
b)yes we do modify our system.ie customizations,installation of SP.<br />
<br />
c)on the new system may be less than 10 users.<br />
<br />
Hope my answers are clear.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Rking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or even better, Single Finance / Multi Logistic?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaukul</div><div class="date">25th June 2007, 07:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Please tell us why you need different database for a single company data that will be used by only 10 users. Additional DB server is going to increase your administrative activities...<br />
<br />
If you have enough space and memory available on current DB server, keep the new company data on same DB server. You can create separate tablespace for the new company for better management.<br />
