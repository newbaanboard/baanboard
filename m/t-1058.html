<br />
We have a number of independent Baan instances (different server &amp; BSE -- one per plant) but have some sites that need to access a number of plants.   If we could color code the backgrounds, the users would have an easier time figuring out where they are instead of squnting at company numbers.:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The closest I could get, if using the menu browser, was to change the colour of the menu folder icons. This can be done in tools -&gt; Desktop Management -&gt; Miscellaneous -&gt; Image Editor.<br />
<br />
If you find another way please let me know.<br />

<br />
Refer to the link -<br />

<br />
Also, You can have your own startup menu, on which the system name can be hard coded.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">18th February 2002, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I found some more options which can be used in the BECS -<br />
<br />
-set BAAN_WIN_TITLE=BaaN-5.2 would show the string BaaN-5.2 in the title of all Baan sessions.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, there are some predefined strings that can be used in the window title string.  They are:<br />
<br />
%C	Company Name <br />
%c	Company Number<br />
%h	Host Name<br />
%p	Package Combination<br />
%S	Session Name<br />
%s	Session Code<br />
%u	Userid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 12:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the BW uses hardcoded colors, picked up from the local PC registry settings. That's another story with the BX, where you can define colors for every part of what you see in the screen!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">19th February 2002, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I see color settings (commented out) in the BW.INI file, but enabling and chaning these seems to have no effect.  I wonder why they are even there.</div></div><hr />

I still get the environment name at the bottom of the menu, and the company number in the top of the various session screens as the only indicators of which environment that I am in. :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jebrey</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 02:14</div></div><div class="posttext">My apologies to anyone who tuned into this thread today and got my attempts.  I guess 30 years of green screens make a person permanently HTML challenged.<br />
<br />
I've attached a zip file containing a sample of what I'd really like to see.  Some of the ideas so far are teriffic, but my problem is that users will have the same session open all day from mutliple instances.  Right now, the only thing they have to keep themselves straight is the company number.  The example shows what would make their life easier.<br />
<br />
I found that if I could unzip the file and click on the .HTM file, and it would explode.  If anyone still has problems, you can send me a complaint directly to jack.brey@nav-international.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 12:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Jebrey,<br />
<br />
The borders and window name will always be the Windows setup ones, for the inside of the window, if I recall from my experience of the BX setup, the colour settings were stored by user (or global?, can't remember quite well, but not per company), meaning that if a user has access to 3 companies, they will have the same colour screens.<br />
<br />
Regarding the BW, unless there is something that allows overwridding of the colour picked up by Windows, I think you will be out of luck...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jebrey</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 16:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm getting the same fear -- we may not be able to fix this, short of some future porting set making a background color attribute bit settable in the BW Configuration file.<br />
<br />
I am hoping to make the background instance specific, rather than company specific -- just because we run different plants in different databases/BSEs to prevent one oops from taking down more than one plant.   Others who run multi-site the way Baan intended might want to be capable of making their colors company specific.</div></div><hr />

for development , test , live on different machines<br />
<br />
We already colour the &quot;menu folders&quot; which is very helpful<br />
but most users have &quot; DMBs&quot; so when training or testing problems can occur</div></div><hr />

In LN Tools, the gif files are handled as Additional Files (ttadv2570m000). These are located in $BSE/tools/b[package][module]/b[gif-name].gif or $BSE/application/[package][VRC]/b[package][module]/b[gif-name].gif</div></div><hr />
