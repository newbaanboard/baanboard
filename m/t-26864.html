<br />
Can Anybody tell me the differences between a process industries and discrete industries in terms of SSA <br />
<br />
SSA LX : process industries<br />
<br />
SSA LN : discrete industries<br />
<br />
Now i want to know how can we categorize a company into process industry or a discrete industry <br />
<br />
On what parameters we can decide which SSA version we choose ?? <br />

Emphasis is on continuous or batch mixing, reaction and separation of materials to produce other materials of higher value.<br />
<br />
And the Discrete Company is a manufacturer that adds value to a product through a fabrication, assembly, machining, or molding process, that is typically scheduled in economic order quantities or on a lot-for-lot basis.<br />
Discrete manufacturers emphasize the assembly of high quality engineered components or sub-assemblies into more valuable final product configurations, or the physical manipulation of discrete entities.<br />
<br />
I am not sure whatever I have written is all correct or not but I hope this will give you a bit of idea to prceed in a specific way.<br />
<br />

<br />
Just like to make a comment!<br />
In a world of many terrible and inconsiderate people (as you read the newspapers all over the world), I really find that you guys and gals on baanboard are really wonderful people, people who are helpful and considerate and courteous.<br />
<br />
Keep up the great work, BaanBoard people.<br />
