<br />
I would like to monitor my jobs via SMS-Gateway (I have a Linux-box with the sms_client-tool), so that I receive a message when a job didn't run.<br />
Is ther anyone out there who has expirience with such solutions?<br />
Also I would like to know, if someone has played with netsaint (a nice monitoring-tool) and BaaN? How was the expirience?</div></div><hr />

and accordingly update ur SMS gateway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">11th December 2001, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">More crude of course is to write a combination of shell script and SQL queries to read the job status straight from the database and take action accordingly. It is more work but I think you would have more flexibility as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anyone is interested: <br />
Thats my solution, I came to:<br />
<br />
ttaad5205 (add shellscript) and add a &quot;touch somefile.ko&quot; if the Job didn't work;<br />
on the Linuxbox I added a script witch gets the Files and sends a SMS.<br />
Not the best, but it does it...<br />
<br />
Have a nice Day <br />
