They are working for SSA Global and he wants me to install a software in our network to audit our SSA licensed software.<br />
<br />
Does anybody has experiance with this procedure?</div></div><hr />

<br />
me too. Did you have a look at the kind of software you should install? It scans your whole network in order to find some license relevant information. Who's going to install such kind of software without knowing what's actually scanned and transmitted to SSA?<br />

I also have been contacted by a guy from SLA Management services. Have either of you gone any further in the process, and found out any more about the software that we are asked to run on our network?<br />
Martin, you mentioned in your other post that this is being heavily discussed in Germany. Good, and it should be! Have you gotten any further information?<br />
<br />
We also were told by SLA that &quot;other members of the Baan community have cooperated&quot;, and they can't understand why we <br />
have questions.<br />
Any further info on this would be appreciated. <br />

<br />
It would be interesting to hear if anyone has run the software.</div></div><hr />

Never heard of it eversince</div></div><hr />
