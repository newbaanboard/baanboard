<br />
Everything works well, I can see the file in my local temp and when I run outlook.exe C:\program files\baan\rep.rtf I get the message in my mail but I cannot get it automatically out of BAAN.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong over here??<br />

In the 4GL Programm-field, should that not be filled with a BaaN-to-Email session? For example: we use tccom2email3. So the devices screen for B2Email looks like attached.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure it works this way in every case, but it works for us.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

I think that tccom2email3 might be a part of one of Nazdaq products.</div></div><hr />

My device E-Mail has similar definition as your and it works fine. I don't understand phrase &quot;Bestand herschrijven&quot;, I have &quot;Append to file&quot; and my Argument is &quot;RTF: outlook.exe&quot; (without %s).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Herewith the solution to print an attachment straight to e-mail.<br />
<br />
1) Install BW client local.<br />
2) Set path in systemvariable on local Windows machine (if applicable)<br />
3) Set device.<br />
<br />
I have attached the complete setup in a document to this case</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">8th January 2003, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi pasadena, I looked at your attachment and have a few questions:<br />
<br />
1) in the system part both the BSE and BSE_TMP are defined as path on the &quot;C&quot; drive, but in the BW option only the BSE_TMP is defined using the &quot;set&quot; option, does this mean only the BSE_TMP should be defined in the system part ?? or both.<br />
<br />
1b) Any side affects of re-defining the BSE to the users hard drive ?? in the system part (if indeed you need to as per question 1).<br />
<br />
2) I think the BSE_TMP on the actual server is used to keep track of the running bshells's so that the &quot;licmon6.1&quot; utility works correctly, and also the &quot;tmp&quot; report files are also stored in the BSE_TMP.  Any side affects of re-defining the BSE_TMP to the users hard drive ??</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I had to do to make it work. Please see screenshot below. Please note that the outgoing mail format must be set to HTML in Outlook too<br />
<br />
I couldn't use the RTF format (by setting the BaanERP device and Outlook outgoing format to RTF), because the content becomes attachment instead of becoming the body of the message. Also, I couldn't use the built in Mail API interface in BaanERP since it is rather problematic. Or did I miss something, guys?<br />
<br />
Have a great day!<br />
