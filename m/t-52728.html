<br />
One of our largest customers is demanding we implement B2B with them (which is fair as we have had a while to do it ;-P)<br />
<br />
<br />
Their B2B hub deals in XML only.<br />
<br />
The flow is thus :<br />
<br />
1 - They send us a purchase order<br />
2 - We acknowledge - notifying them of any lines out of stock at the time of reciept<br />
3 - We send them an ASN - notifying of any other out of stocks or changes<br />
4 - We send them an Invoice<br />
<br />
Anyway the question is this -<br />
<br />
1.) Is there any way to automate this (bearing in mind it is XML not EDIFACT) in a vanilla Baan/LN<br />
2.) Can OpenWorld do it ?<br />
3.) Would it be better to get Infor Enterprise Studio ?<br />
4.) What is your understanding of Infor Open SOA ? will it include any simple connectors to get/send XML over the bus ?<br />
5.) If i have missed anything - let me know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
So we can use Baan's EDI functionality to generate or read flat files, and use Softshare to convert them to/from XML data. It will also communicate with the customer.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is better or worse than the other methods you ask about: it is just an alternative to consider. If you already have some EDI software in place, you might want to see it if can handle this or if it can be upgraded. Many traditional EDI vendors have added this functionality to their software.<br />
