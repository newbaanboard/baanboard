Actual we have customized item manufacturing PCS scenario. Suppose: A is made up of B and C. B is Phantom item. B is made up of D and E. D is manufacturing item. D is made up of F and G. Fand G is also a manufacturing item. This is the structure of my BOM. Now my F and G is manufactured by subcontractor. But i dont want to create a production order  of item F and G. and i need  item F and G in stock after subcontracting work completed beacuse item F and G is  to be issued against the Production order of item D. please help on this part. dineshpatel.engineer@gmail.com</div></div><hr />

<br />
In LN subcontracting process is aligned with production order creation so you can't avoid it as it is standard functionality.<br />
<br />
For F &amp; G item make production order with subcontracting operation. When subcontractor returned semi finished items then receive that one in SFC warehouse from where you can use that items in your internal production orders.<br />
<br />
Let me know if any problems.<br />
