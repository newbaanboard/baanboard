Emerging concurrence on BI<br />
<br />
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; There appears to be some concurrence emerging on BI front in the BI community. Such concurrence can be like<br />
  <br />
 <br />
 1. MS office (and MS excel in particular) integration with application is identified as important first &amp; foremost component of BI for large and small enterprise equally.<br />
  <br />
 2. As the company BI requirements grow, people can explore and deep dive into collaborative software Sharepoint , data warehouses , reporting tools and services etc .<br />
  <br />
 <br />
 Here are the links from where above conclusions seems to be emerging.<br />

  <br />
 Even Infor is buddying up with MS . So users may not have to worry for office integration at all and depend on any 3rd party products !!</div></div><hr />
