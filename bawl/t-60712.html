Item Add or Delete Customization<br />
<br />
We ran into an issue where users were adding and deleting items from Items General.  We had auditing turned on but had to be able to find a specific item on a specific day and be able to answer who added or deleted it.  So, we made a customization to insert the item, date, time, and user ID into a custom table everytime an item was changed.  It worked great.  If you are interested in this customization, please let me know.</div></div><hr />
