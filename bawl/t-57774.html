Cancellation of a Production order(fully not delivered) <br />
<br />
We have migrated from BaaN IVc to LN recently.<br />
 We are not able to Cancel any Production orders where full quantity of that Itm code is not delivered.But the Inventory as per estimated materials were released either fully or partially.We  reversed the issued materials by negative entry and thus ensured that all estimated materials to be reelased. <br />
  In BaaN we were able to cancel the Production orders but in LN even after reversing the material issues,we are not able to cancel the Production orders.<br />
 Request solution from Experts how to proceed in Cancellation.<br />
