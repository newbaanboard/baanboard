DBA User<br />
<br />
I am very new in BAAN LN. I have one major problem. I need to know how to create a Database Administrator. Now I only have access to the system as Installation User, but none of os know the DBA user and password after the guy left(crazy one).This is because, I can't change any of the User's role and database permission without the DBA password. Another things is, can any one can explain or screen shot how the customization look like in BAAN? I think our version here is only the Client environment which does not allow programming..(and crapp again). Our version is LN6.1<br />
  <br />
 Thanks guys.<br />
