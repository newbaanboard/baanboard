My experiences at Inforum08<br />
<br />
I was a little skeptical about Infor as a company, looking at the pace they have been acquiring all the companies. It is hard to prioritize the R &amp; D, support and Sales &amp; Marketing of the various software products. This is especially true in times when the competition is tough, customers are unforgiving and the gloomy outlook of the economy-in-general.<br />
  <br />
 Infor's CEO Jim Schaper has differentiated his company from aggregrators by announcing continued commitment and spending on Research &amp; Development to the tune of$325 Million over the next 4 years. These are the dollars that will directly help the customers in not only increasing the usability of the current Infor application that they use but also make it easy to tap in to the functionality of other Infor application relatively easily. This is made possible by the SOA based framework, which is event driven. The framework itself will be delivered free of cost to any Infor user for the number of user licenses that they currently possess. Additional useage licenses can be purchased and integrations to the legacy/other applications can be done by purchasing the Development studio, the price of which is reasonable as well.<br />
 Some of the key improvements announced include Infor MyDay, DEM 2.0, Enterprise SOA framework, MDM. Time permitting I will try to type up some of my notes from attending various sessions for these improvements. I also saw a growing trend of MK and Baan IV users interested in upgrading to Baan ERP Ln. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">exBaanguy</div><div class="date">1st January 2009, 13:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Very interested to read your comments about Inforum. The worrying fact is the $325m over four years (or do you mean $325m per year for four years?).  Given the applications in their portfolio (BPCS, Pegasus, Sun, Mapics, Prism, PRMS, Epiphany, etc etc), their commitment to keep supporting not only all products but also all versions, and their revenue stream ($2.2bn per annum)  this is either R&amp;D spending of 14.7% of revenue (which is at the low end of the spectrum) or 3.7% ! <br />
Do you have any more detail?  Can anyone else comment?</div></div><hr />
