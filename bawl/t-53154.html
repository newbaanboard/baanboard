Use of rate factor in multi-currency<br />
<br />
I need to understand how the rate factor in tcmcr0101m000 in BAAN 4c4 MCR0 is used. Recently our exchange rate to the USD short up to 160million. We cannot enter 160 000 000 in the purchase rate or sales rate field as it exceeds the field size. Now we attempt to use the rate factor as follows. We put 160 000 in the purchase rate and use a rate factor of 1000. My assumption is that this is equivalent to an effective rate of 160 million.<br />
 Now when i do some test transactions, the results are as expected. For transaction done in local currency using the above scenario, the resultant exchange rates is equal to 166,666,666.67 instead of the 160,000,000 i have used above. When converting from foreign currency to the home currency the resultant exchange rate is 160 and not 160 000 000 which i have input above.<br />
 Can someone enlighten me if I am using the rate factor correctly in this instance, if not how can i inpute rates in excess of the fieldsize eg 160 000 000<br />
  <br />
 Thanks in advance<br />
