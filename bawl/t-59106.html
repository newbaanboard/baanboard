Rejected inventory need to bring in the Inspection location<br />
<br />
Hi<br />
First of all the item is a serialized item. We have done the receipts and few units got reject and currently lying in the Rejection location. Now some of the units got rectified and we need to bring in the inspection location and approve to convert the units in the good inventory.<br />
 But when we process the qty in the rejected inventory session , we are getting the error as &quot;Manufacture part no. is required in purchase actual receipts&quot;.<br />
 Please let me know how to overcome this issue.<br />
 <br />
thanks &amp; regds<br />

Since the item is serialized you need to select the serial numbers which must be approved or rejected. In the rejected inventory session, open the line which you want to process and in the specific select &quot;Lots and Serials&quot;. In that select the records to be accepted and then process the line.<br />
