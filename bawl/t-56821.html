You should be able to obtain the current BW Client from the Infor support web site.  Please see KB solution 22881483.  <br />
<br />
There very well could be a link on the Baanboard site to this solution if you were to search.  I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Please note, we have found that printing is an issue as the regedit settings for Baan are different for 64-Bit.  We found three instances of Baan printing information that was required in order for the printing to work on our systems properly. Look under the settings for local machine/software for folder called Wow6432Node.  That is one of them from what I recall.<br />
<br />
We had several fonts we had modified for barcoding and forms created within our Baan system.  So, when switching to Windows 7 64-Bit it appeared all of our settings were lost when we printed reports using the specific fonts.  That is until we figured out what was missing from the PC's regedit data.  I'm not sure if it was just something that happened to us or if it will happen to anyone moving to Windows 7 64-Bit.<br />
<br />
Thanks and good luck!</div></div><hr />

BTW is it legit to download the client from these forums I mean is that client free ware or do I need to purchase the license for it ?<br />
Thanks<br />
