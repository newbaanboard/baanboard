What are the new features or what has been changed on Baanboard since 01-Jun-2008?<br />
<br />
Introduction<br />
<br />
If you are regular baanboard user you will have noticed that since 1st of June 2008 alot of changes and new features have been introduced to the site. This page will try to briefly describes these changes and features. It will link to subsequent pages for more detailed information where necessary.<br />
 <br />
CMS &amp; frontpage<br />
<br />
Baanboard now features a full-fledged CMS system that integrates seamlessly with our existing forum. This CMS is powered by vbDrupal  (http://www.vbdrupal.org)which is adapted version of the very popular Drupal (http://www.drupal.org) CMS that provides bridging to our forum software vBulletin (http://www.vbulletin.com). Some of the most important features that the CMS integration brings to us are:</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those who were running into the following error when submitting a forum search from the frontpage:<br />
<br />
<br />
Your submission could not be processed because a security token was missing or mismatched<br />
<br />
<br />
This is now fixed. Looks like the added CSRF protection in the latest vbulletin was causing this problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it will take some time to explore all the features the new solution offers. I'm a little confused about &quot;Blogs and Web links Forum&quot;. Is it &quot;forum&quot; or &quot;blog&quot; :confused: what is exactly is the intention behind it?<br />
<br />
Great job anyway :)<br />
<br />

<br />
The forums under the 'CMS - Forum Integration' category are meant as a 'container' for comments to content that originates from the CMS. The concept is that the CMS is used for hosting things like blogs, weblinks, jobs, stories etc but that discussions on them (aka comments) are done in the forum. You will notice that most CMS content has a Add new comment link with it. This allows you to post comments to the item in one of these forums. That is also why these forums do not allow new threads to be created in them but only replies.<br />
<br />
Does that make it a bit clearer?<br />
<br />
For example: this thread is gathering all comments to one of our FAQ over at the CMS: http://www.baanboard.com/node/1753.<br />
<br />
When viewing this FAQ you will see that all these forum posts are actually visible there as comments (at the bottom).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">3rd June 2008, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Pat, I'm still confused. <br />
<br />
I can add a comment in the 'CMS' section or either post a reply in the 'Forum' - it seems to make no difference :confused: . Why does the same 'thread' appear in two different places?<br />
<br />
Another strange thin I noticed:<br />
when I try to hit the 'Update your personal blog?' link on the frontpage a password is required - why that? What does that link stand for? My interpretation was to edit my blog.. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Martin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">3rd June 2008, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Martin,<br />
<br />
The concept is that CMS comments are stored as forum posts so yes they show up in both places because they are one and the same thing. This is what links CMS &amp; forum both together. In a standard Drupal site, CMS comments are stored inside the CMS but because comments are de facto &quot;discussions&quot;, vbDrupal (which is the combined CMS+Forum solution) offers the possibility to use our forum as 'commenting engine'. SO in fact we are using the 'best features of both worlds'. Does that make sense?<br />
<br />
Regarding the blog link: that is strange. Can you post me a screenshot of where you see this link?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To ease the burden of new navigation a bit, I added a forum specific menu in the navigation panel. It resembles more the structure of the 'top' menu we used to have on the old site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">3rd June 2008, 22:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you post me a screenshot of where you see this link?<br />
<br />
Here we go..<br />
<br />
It's the 'Update your personal blog?' link. The password dialog is in German - sorry :o .<br />

Okay, found it. I forgot to change the link. It was still pointing at the development site. It is fixed now. Thanks for noticing it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patvdv</div><div class="date">5th June 2008, 10:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Some of the Javascript powered drop-down menus in the forum - such as 'Thread Tools' or 'Search this Forum' - that were not working previously, are now fixed.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Pat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm missing the tools on the forum frontpage - such as 'Mark Forums Read'. It's a tiny little link at the bottom of the page now :( .<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Martin</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's an easier link in the Forum Menu &gt; Quick Links &gt; Mark All Forums Read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Martin Jung</div><div class="date">11th June 2008, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I see, it's in the navigation box on the left now! But why is the submenu not appearing when I highlight the link?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am guessing you are IE 5.5 or 6? In that case you are suffering from the fact your IE is not properly CSS/HTML compliant. I would advise you to use Firefox or IE 7.0. These browsers are much more reliable when it comes to displaying content in compliant &amp; consistent way...<br />
<br />
PS: I will make a FAQ entry about recommended browsers etc.</div></div><hr />
