<br />
Standard all parameter tables are in audit. Additional to that you can specify any other table you want to audit. Some ERP customers want to monitor who changes business partners (bank account info). To have put sales / purchase order in audit has not a reall advantage, you have all ready history, which will show all changes and keep versions of most change made to sales/purchase orders.<br />

<br />
The ERP audit is conducted to evaluate the usage of Functionalities and the optimum utilization of resources.<br />
<br />
There can be different perspective for conducting the audit :<br />
<br />
Management Perspective :<br />
<br />
Are all business processes  mapped in ERP?<br />
How much discipline is followed in making the Entries?<br />
What is the productivity loss in time spend on making data entries in ERP?<br />
Is there need for automation of processes or Barcoding integration for key business process for minimizing the time to enter the data.<br />
What is the authenticity of MIS reports generated from ERP.<br />
How to plan the Roll over activity for branches and other new business expansions.<br />
<br />
Key User Perspective:<br />
Are there any Business Processes, which are still Unmapped in ERP.<br />
How to reduce time in making entries.<br />
What is the authenticity of data entered<br />
Are end users following the correct procedure as defined in mapping documents.<br />
<br />
<br />
