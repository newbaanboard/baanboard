I suppose the report script will be having the totaling logic which is not working. It could be some compilation issue(Not sure) <br />
Try running the report after compiling the report once.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work then check the field names added to the report. If they are input fields check the calculation logic in the UI Script for those fields.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Thanks,<br />
