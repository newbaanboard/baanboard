Bug in Baan while doing Put Away<br />
<br />
Hi Baan Folks,<br />
 Well I can declare that There is Bug in Baan V for Put away process.<br />
 <br />
Well I am facing one serious issue. After creating Receipt for a PO, Processing Put away, Quantity moves for Good Inspection, After clearing  Inspection process.<br />
System will insert a line as soon sa Quantity is approved, Here Item is LOt controlled, Up to Good Inspection I can see the same LOT which got generated during Receipt creation.<br />
 Even I can see same LOT after celaring Goods Inspection process too..But When doing Put Away from &quot;Inspection to Bulk Location&quot;, There It misses this LOT &amp; Inventroy gets corrupted.<br />
 <br />
It seems Put Away process doesn't considers any LOT, I have simulated this on Standard Baan V Environment.<br />
 I just want to know fron where It inserts record for table whinh215, After clearing Put Away process. Specially LOT inserting.<br />
 Appreciate your Quick reply.<br />
 <br />
Best Regards<br />
Praveen </div></div><hr />
