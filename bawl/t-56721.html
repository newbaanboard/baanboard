Problem with reserved stock parent part vs. child (sub item)<br />
<br />
Dear all,<br />
Â I have a problem with the reservation of parent item vs. child (sub item).<br />
Out of an article we make other items our selves. Our database is Dutch, but I made some screen shots and attached them.<br />
Problem is that if we sell a sub article (child) it shows the reserved quantity.<br />
In my oppinion it should reserve stock on the above laying part (parent) as well.<br />
Only in that case I know how many pieces of parent parts I have to buy.<br />
Is it possible to change something in Baan to let it reserve automatically on parent item?<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jeroen</div></div><hr />
