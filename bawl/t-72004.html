Item code conversion - New production unit ( Plant)<br />
<br />
Good morning everyone,<br />
We have an unique situation where we bought another company recently and we use BaaN as well. The issue is that they use different product code from what we have at all other units. The order that comes through our Portal / catalogue has different item codes. We are struggling with converting all the items codes, components and constraints which is not that easy. We have thousands of items codes to be converted.Â <br />
Can someone suggest if we have any third party solutions availble to convert all of their codes to our codes at our headoffice. We spend lots of man power in the conversion of the codes to match with our sister company.<br />
Please advise me.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
