Hello All,<br />
Conceptually Consignment owned and Consignment not owner type of warehouses are understood. Can anyone give me documentation stepwise<br />
1) How Consignment Replenishment Purchase Order is executed in Infor LN FP9?<br />
2) How Consignment Payment Order is executed ?<br />
Giving up the detaiiled steps or any documentation for the same will be of great help.Â </div></div><hr />

1. Purchase Order Type with &quot;Consignment Replenishment&quot; flag set to yes must be used to create a &quot;Consignment Purchase Order&quot;.<br />
2. Receive this inventory in &quot;Consignment Not Owned - Warehouse&quot;<br />
3. Now, When ever you Sell the inventory from &quot;Consignment Not Owned - Warehouse&quot;, a &quot;Consignment Payment Order&quot; will be created.<br />
4. A &quot;Consignment Payment Order&quot; is a Order with a Purchase Order type that has &quot;Consignment Payment&quot;flag set to yes.<br />
<br />
Flow related to use of &quot;Consignment Owned - Warehouse&quot;:<br />
1. Sales Order type with &quot;Consignment Replenishment&quot; flag set to yes should be used to Sale goods on &quot;Consignment Owned&quot; terms.<br />
If this check box is selected, and the sales order is released to Warehousing, a warehousing order of the Transfer type is created. Goods are stored at a business partner's location, and payment is not received until the goods are used or sold.<br />
2. Now whenever the Business Partner consumes inventory from the Consignment Owned Warehouse a &quot;Consignment Invoicing&quot; order is created.<br />
3. A &quot;Consignment Invoicing Order&quot; is a Order with a sales Order type that has &quot;Consignment Invoicing&quot; flag set to yes. <br />
If this check box is selected, sales orders for this order type are used for invoicing consigned inventory that is consumed.<br />
<br />
I hope this information will be enough to work with these functionalities on the system. :)</div></div><hr />
