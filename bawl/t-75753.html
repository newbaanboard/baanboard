<br />
#ConnectwithPraveen: Planning a merger or acquisition of a company can be a complex process, particularly when it comes to mapping the acquired company's systems to your existing Infor LN implementation. Here are the steps you can follow to plan a merger or acquisition with a focus on Infor LN:<br />
1) Evaluate the existing Infor LN implementation of both companies: Before starting the migration process, it's important to evaluate the existing Infor LN implementation of both companies. This includes understanding the current system architecture, the business processes supported, the customizations made, and the integrations with other systems.<br />
2) Identify the key requirements and objectives of the migration: Based on the evaluation of the existing Infor LN implementation, identify the key requirements and objectives of the migration. This includes understanding the scope of the migration, the timeline, the resources required, and the expected outcomes.<br />
3) Plan the migration process: Based on the key requirements and objectives of the migration, plan the migration process. This includes developing a detailed project plan, defining the roles and responsibilities of the team members involved, and establishing a communication plan.<br />
4) Prepare the data for migration: Prepare the data for migration by identifying the data sources, cleansing and transforming the data as necessary, and preparing the data for loading into the target Infor LN system.</div></div><hr />
