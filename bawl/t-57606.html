Fixed Assets Depriciation Issue <br />
<br />
We found our fixed assets calculation is not correct. We have entered initial data upto period 2009/12. System is calculating deprication for those assets too where book value is 1 or those are fully depricated before in previous year/period or going to be fully depriciated in next few more months. Our depreciation calculation method is &quot;Fixed % of base value&quot; with First and Last use date. <br />
 Can any one help us ,how to control this. We need following: <br />
 1. system should not calculate for those assets which are fully depricated and having book value only 1. <br />
 2. system should calculate depreciation for those assets which are going to be fully depriciated in next few months with their respective months of depriciaiton % not with full year amount. <br />
 3. Remaining other assets should have correct calculation in future years too.  <br />
 Awaiting your valueable reply as earliest..<br />
 Thanks, <br />
