In our previous ERP planning tip (http://www.pemeco.com/v1000/resources_center/erp-planning-tip-4-routings-final-data-requirement),  we discussed routings, the final data set-up requirement for making an  item. In this tip, I dig deep into another critical data requirement –  the need to maintain timely and accurate inventory counts and movements.<br />
  <br />
 If inventory counts and movements aren’t accurately reflected in the  planning engine, MRP will issue inaccurate recommendations. This might  mean that replenishment order recommendations are issued to soon – which  could lead to unnecessary increases in operating costs and constraints  to cash flow. It might also mean that replenishment order  recommendations are issued too late – which could create customer churn  caused by avoidable order delays.
