Infor LN Technical EBooks<br />
<br />
We have always in our life right from school days moving towards graduation and finally in our workplace have come across textbooks and/or Ebooks which gives humongous amount of informations but the relevant ones or the ones which is of practical use is quite limited. We have to browse or read through pages after pages and make notes of things relevant to us.<br />
 <br />
We at FULLONBAAN tried to address the above pain areas by preparing EBooks by breaking down in to subtopics and covering information only relevant and of practical use. So instead of one big bulky Ebook, we have prepared mini ebooks for each major topics. So the EBooks are simple to understand, explained in laymen terms and with practical example with screenshots.</div></div><hr />
