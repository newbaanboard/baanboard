online dashboards in Excel<br />
<br />

 <br />
Operational baan reporting supplemented by in-memory data transformation in Excel/Baan and statistical functions in Excel substantially fulfils this need . However dashboards are an area so far unaddressed.  <br />
 For online dashboards also Excel can play a good role. There is a myth that Excel can only be used with MS SQL. But that’s not correct . It can also be used with other databases like Oracle / DB2 which  may be installed on non-windows system through ADO-DB connections .<br />
