You can use &quot;special fields&quot; available in report editor, there you have multiple options including page number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pillai.ganesh</div><div class="date">25th June 2014, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">The solution is to actually run the full report two times. The first time simply does not physically output anything (i.e. we set spool.fileout = &quot;/dev/null&quot;); but is used to get the actual final result. This can be done using the original data as long as the data is not changing during the report.You must also be careful with this solution for reports that update as you must not do so during the first pass (of course the results could then be different as your report may process the resultant records differently after the update).<br />

But this solution will add delay time to the throughput.</div></div><hr />
