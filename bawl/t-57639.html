Estimated materials - Shop floor control<br />
<br />
In LN ''The estimated materials&quot; is frozen when the Production orders becomes 'Active' status and does not allow any items to add or delete in this status.<br />
 Our requirement is we should be able to add or delete some items in Estimated materials of any Production orders in 'Active' status also.Where we have to set the Parameters to enable this option.<br />
 Request the manufacturing consultants to give the solution for this.<br />
  <br />

But these modifications will not get reflected in estimiated materials costs because it has already got frozen based on value of &quot;Moment Freezing Estimates&quot; field maintained in &quot;Default Production Order Data&quot; session tisfc0502m000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saikatpaik</div><div class="date">21st January 2010, 22:48</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not possible to change the estimated materials after the Production Order has got the status Released. Status &quot;Active&quot; means Production process has already started and some of the operation in the routing already completed.<br />
<br />
For your further info, you can execute Reprocess Production Order - tisfc1203m000. This will automatically include changes that are made in basic data such as BOM and routing. The session regenerates the production orders by deleting the existing production order data and hence the BOM and routing data for the new Reference Date are used.<br />
<br />
You can only use this session for production orders whose status is:<br />
Planned<br />
Scheduled<br />
Documents Printed.<br />
