Excel Assisted reporting strategy for Baan customers <br />
<br />
Here is a blog on a reporting strategy for baan complemented with Excel load clients. This blog discusses various approaches to reporting in Excel and ingredients of successful Excel assisted baan reporting.<br />
  <br />
 WHO SHOULD READ THIS   <br />
<br />
 One should read this blog if: <br />
  <br />
 one is very much comfortable with existing authorizations and semantic layer in Baan (Read baan data dictionary ) technically ( table/domain /field codes ) and functionally (descriptions )  and <br />
 one wishes to capitalize on  existing learning and knowledge of existing semantic layer in Baan (technically as well as functionally )  and do not wish to invest (or waste??) in learning / migrating /adopting / translating / maintaining new semantic layer for reporting <br />
 one is very much adept at using Baan reporting and programming for routine documents  and <br />
 one’s users enjoy the freedom, flexibility and functionality of spreadsheets (which may be freeware also) for analytical purposes. <br />
 there are sufficient Office licenses already with company on PCs with high CPU and memory ( far exceeding basic Excel requirements and which have become norm rather than exceptions ) in one’s place and there is high need to optimally utilize  these resources  and to reduce the load on servers .  <br />
 WHO SHOULD NOT READ THIS   <br />
<br />
 One whose objectives are different OR who don’t have any objectives only OR who is extremely satisfied with their current reporting already.</div></div><hr />
