Why do people insist on writing &quot;BaaN&quot; when they should write &quot;Baan&quot;.<br />
 I used to think, when I saw &quot;BaaN&quot; that the person must be new to Baan and not know better but I still see this &quot;BaaN&quot; quite frequrntly and by people with experience.Â  I shouldn't let it get to me but I would much prefer to see just &quot;Baan&quot;.<br />
 Which do you write?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave_23</div><div class="date">28th October 2010, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">BaaN used to be the official branding of the software. I'm not sure why they choose the big N, but that's marketing people for ya. Maybe it was just to distinguish it from Jan Baan's last name.<br />
<br />
So i think it's possibly the opposite, the &quot;BaaN&quot; folks are either old school (or have very old versions of the software). <br />
<br />
I use both, but i do find BaaN a bit annoying to look at.<br />

I guess lots of things can bug us - like people who specify &quot;Baan4&quot; instead of &quot;BaanIV..&quot; or people who say &quot;I'm going to Walmarts&quot;.<br />

Actually it was a kind of logo intially when it was launched, the BaaN was used as a logo on T-shirts, Bags provided by them and since then it is continued, Also that is just for BaaN niether fr SSA ERP or infor LN.</div></div><hr />

You can see both &quot;BaaN&quot; and &quot;Baan&quot; in it :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">29th October 2010, 16:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to correct you, Dave, but BaaN was never the official name. I even remember some letter from Baan like ten years ago which was very precise on it that the correct spelling would be &quot;Baan&quot;. However, the capital N they had in their logo somehow made it into the way the brand was spelled mainly by the Customers. If I had been Baan at that time, I had embraced it - it was sort of a very distinguishing element by that time - Like the ERP LN actually gets a *subscript* LN; excellent idea in my point of view, even if it causes me extra effort while typing my documents<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joepte</div><div class="date">3rd November 2010, 19:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Ulrich is right - I can remember this discussion going on in early 1997 (it actually went on for a while) and it was decided by the Baan company that when written Baan should have a lower case &quot;n&quot; - the capital &quot;N&quot; is from a logo that's all and does not need to be emulated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry if that was unclear.<br />
