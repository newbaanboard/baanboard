Cloud-suite ERP Vendor - Product Company<br />
<br />
After couple of weeks of brainstorming, I am here to find a Cloud-suite ERP partner (First preference will be given to Cloud Suite product company) who can take the ownership from demonstrating Product capabilities till implementing various applications for discrete manufacturing Customer. CIO/ CFO are eager to take it forward, as discussed the deal size will be more than Million dollars. <br />
Note: Only Product companies to come forward with details, in second week of June 2020 would consider Service partners. Executives committee is involved &amp; keeping a closer look, they want top authority of Product company to participate actively in the discussion (No Sales consultant will be entertained). Their Indian CIO would like to have the first meeting; hence Indian stakeholders from respective firms should interact.<br />
First Phase is selection process, As an ERP Advisor I would be involved with Customer in evaluating ERP features. Briefly they are looking to replace on premise ERP with cloud-suite ERP.</div></div><hr />
