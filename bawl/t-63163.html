In Transit Goods From Supplier<br />
<br />
We use Baan IVc but I am not sure which level. How do you handle booking In Transit Inventory from your supplier? We purchase raw material from overseas and there is a 6 to 8 week delivery time from actual shipment date to receipt date. We take ownership fob shipping point. We have been tracking our in transit shipments using Excel and booking reversing journal entries monthly to record the liability. When the shipment arrives, we receive it into our raw material warehouse and adjust our accural.<br />
Can we set up a Goods In Transit warehouse to record the goods when they ship? And when they arrive, receive them into our raw materials warehouse?? Or ...  how do you handle recording your in transit goods from suppliers??? I have looked through Baan Knowledge Quest and internet searches but I have not found much information. We are limited in our IT support on how BAAN actually works and it is almost a trial and error approach in learning and implimenting new concepts and procedures.   many thanks</div></div><hr />
