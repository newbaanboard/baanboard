Reporting tool for Baan 5C<br />
<br />
We're currently using Crystal reports with the Crystal Native driver for Baan with our Baan 5C. But, we recently upgraded to a newer porting set that is the last one that supports Crystal Reporting. We have several projects going on but first we need to find an external reporting tool that will work with Baan 5C. My question is - which reporting tools other companies are using to connect to Baan 5C? How do they accomplish the connection in case of multiple solutions. For example, we do know that we can continue to use Crystal Reports but we'll have to move to either an Native DB ODBC driver or use the Infor ODBC driver.<br />
Thank you,<br />
