How to send a escape sequence from a Baan-report to a printer (Epson TMU-220 if possible)?<br />
<br />
Hello all,<br />
My problem is that when the printer finishes printing the report (that is a ticket from a miniprinter), I should cut the paper after the last line.<br />
maybe I could fix the problem with a escape sequence but I dont know how to do this in Baan. Any Idea?<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">20th January 2009, 11:44</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try at the end of your report:<br />
 <br />
<br />
spool.pr.line = &lt;your printer's escape sequence&gt; | eg. chr$(27) &amp; ...<br />
spool.pr.line()<br />
<br />
 <br />
But normally you should not do such things within your report. Keep in mind, that you will print to the display, then to a lser printer and finally to your specific epson printer.<br />
 <br />
Baan uses printer drivers for that purpose; e.g. in the directory $BSE/print_inf/e you should see a file epson_fx which is the printer driver for an EPSON FX.<br />

If you are printing through bwprint, it will capture all excape sequences going to your printer.  However there is an excape sequence that you can send that will allow the number of characters specified to go through untouched.  If you don't have the bwprint doecumentation, let me know and I will look it up.</div></div><hr />
