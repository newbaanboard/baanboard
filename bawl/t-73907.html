Dear All,<br />
 <br />
 I have achieved a great milestone of completing an exciting Infor Cloud suite implementation (One of the Largest in Infor history).  Let’s work together with Customer to achieve the goal of Digital Transformation. Bring the integrity &amp; honesty to change the mindset for the adoption of Change. No point is changing the Technology If the people are reluctant. Encourage Verticals to address the challenge of preparing Business plan, then go for Technology, SI should also work with sincerity to complete the Project within the stipulated period. Hire well equipped Managers, Consultants who can go beyond to cover the gaps.<br />
During this Journey I have realized that with some key points we can bring enormous transformation.</div></div><hr />
