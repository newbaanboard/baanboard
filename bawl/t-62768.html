Infor Broadens Channel Partner Sales Opportunity; Will Go Head-to-Head Against Own VARs<br />
<br />
Historically, Infor (http://www.infor.com/)  operated a highly restrictive sales channel, limiting its value-added  resellers (a.k.a. VARs and channel partners) to sell into companies that  generate revenues of no more than $100 million per year. With its  August 8th announcement (covered here: Infor Eases Sales Restrictions for Channel Partners (http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/240005154/infor-eases-sales-restrictions-for-channel-partners.htm)), Infor now allows its channel to sell to companies that generate revenues of up to $500 million per year.Â <br />
The old restrictions made it difficult - in some cases near  impossible - for channel partners to generate revenues from the sale of  software licenses. Many of Infor's systems are geared to companies that  generate revenues far in excess of $100 million annually. For example, Infor10 ERP Enterprise (formerly ERP LN and Baan) (http://www.infor.com/product_summary/erp/ln/)  is a feature rich, complex system designed for larger mid-sized and  large enterprise-sized manufacturers of complex, engineer-to-order (ETO)  products. The $100 million cap effectively made the &quot;reseller&quot; title  more theoretical than practical for those firms that only resold Infor10  ERP Enterprise (ERP LN).</div></div><hr />
