Now it is becoming increasingly clear that users need liveliness and interactivity on static data from OLTP. This is possible through multi-dimensional modeling available in free-form pivot table (http://www.erpjewels.com/pivottable.htm) or cube structures. As there are not many cube applications and not many established routines to populate cubes incrementally periodically automatically, report-directly-in-excel is becoming vogue.Â  Though most summarized multi-dimensional modeling cab be done easily with old MS Excel 2003, with excellent enhancement in MS Excel 2007 (http://www.erpjewels.com/excel2007enhancements.htm), scalability and liveliness has increased manifold in pivoting (multi-dimensional modeling using pivot table).<br />
 All that one need is accurate, reliable and relevant figures side-by-side in CSV format for all dimensions / measures to follow report-directly-in-excel-with-data-dict-advantages (http://www.erpjewels.com/nativedatadict.pdf) strategy. For example, here is a baan report which gives all important dimensions/measures related to customer financial behavior. <br />
