Infor ERP LN and Baan Planning Tip #4: Routings - The Final Data Requirement<br />
<br />
In our previous ERP planning tip (http://baanboard.com/node/2916),  we discussed the bill of materials (BOM), which discussion answered the  following questions: which and how many components are needed to  produce an item. This tip deals with routings, the final data set-up  requirement. http://www.pemeco.com/v1000/sites/all/modules/wysiwyg/plugins/break/images/spacer.gif<br />
 Routings<br />
<br />
 Routings  are the – manufacturing methods – the sequence of steps and related  times that are needed to make an item. Production routings specify the  ordered list of tasks used to manufacture a product. In addition to the  standard routing, a product might have alternate routings (the selection  of which depends on the situation). When a production work order is  created to manufacture the product, one of the possible routings is  chosen.<br />
 A typical routing is represented by a series of operation  steps. Each step contains a task, various times related to the task (and  other parameters), as well as the next operation step in the sequence.<br />
