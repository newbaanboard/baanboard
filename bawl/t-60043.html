NEW SERVER NEEDED FOR BAAN IV<br />
<br />
Our (DELL)Server is getting old (10 years) and needs to be replaced by a new one.<br />
Infor told us that we have to buy all the software licenses again to get BAAN IV installed and running on a new server.<br />
Does anyone know a way around this very expensive server exchange?<br />
We have no support contract.<br />
Thanks for your time and possible answer.<br />

<br />
Anyway, I think with NT/Windows Server, Baan 4 is licensed to the network card MAC address. So you could move the software and NIC to the new server.<br />
Or, on some NICs you can change the MAC address - to match your existing one.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as far as I know:<br />
normally, even if you do not have a support contract, the software can be used on new hardware. It has to be validated though, and you need support for this (this is not the &quot;normal&quot; functional support, it's just to validate the software on a new server.<br />
If the version you have doesn't run on current versions of operating system/database, you will need to update to a later version. For this, you will need a support contract. It might be less expensive to buy the software again than to renew the support contract.<br />
<br />
Are you running on Windows or Unix? You might try virtualizing the existing environment, although I'm not sure this will work.</div></div><hr />
