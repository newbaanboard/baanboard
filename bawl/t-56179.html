We, the baan-lovers will be unhappy to c our darling product well behind in niche quadrant . However unavailability of skilled consultants and positioning of other Infor products ahead may be  points where one can take consolation if one wants to .<br />
 Well, this deserves  good reading and understanding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">27th June 2009, 14:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, one could agree with Infor not really being visionary - for me, they focus on technology and still to much on wrong business politics (keeping everything to themselves and not allowing an ecosystem of partners, consultants and third-party-offerings to grow. Result: Lack of consultants.)<br />
<br />
But Microsoft Dynamix as Market leader? A product with so little functionality? IFS as a niche player? <br />
<br />
What I find interesting is that they mention open source ERPs.<br />

If you try to do an automated translation, I'll guess it will be funny, but it won't have to do to much with my text :-)</div></div><hr />
