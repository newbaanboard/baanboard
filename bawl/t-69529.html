<br />
I believe its hard to get a detailed document on MRP Setup. I can help you with the Setup if you are open to WebEx / Team Viewer (I believe it doesn't take much time if you are familiar with LN)<br />
<br />
For Items General Sharing, please refer to U9505GUS - User Guide for Table Sharing. <br />
<br />
The document can be downloaded from InforXtreme (Sharing the document in the public forum is against Infor's Privacy Policy)</div></div><hr />

I agreed with sasikanth, for just setup an environment, that's not so difficult.<br />
The thing is understand the theory and run it in the really world is totally different thing.<br />
That's why the consultant is so important, who will delivery the theory and also to train the user how to run it in the really world.<br />

Yes I fully agree with Jeffers. To set up based on the specific applicable scenarios<br />
for your particular environment , requires expert consulting advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
