Because of issue in standard PO apporval workflow, many POs didn't get process competely. As I need to process PO so I thought of excluding PO approval action in my new deployment squence but when I am trying to activate new sequence of deployment system is not allowing me to do so and giving error of blocking object. It must have been happening because of old imcomplete POs; as this is our test environment so I don't care about those POs I just want to exclude PO approval and actuvate my new deployment sequence. I am wondering if there is any way to achieve this?<br />
<br />
Please suggest.<br />
