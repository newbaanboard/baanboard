If the attached script is used in my std script tcmcs0423m000 to which we attach rush dll as the library it gives the error message &quot;Unable to find parent object&quot;<br />
<br />
Please help !!!<br />

Sounds like it finds it one VRC, but the object is actually in another.</div></div><hr />

The error got resolved.We had commented one  #define in the dll which created the problem.<br />
It works fine now.We managed to change a few std codes with the help of the same.Can u give me any disadvantages of using this freeware compared to the other utilities I mean QKEY and RMCgen?<br />
I know I am asking a person who uses QKEY  :)  so its ok if you dont have a say in this.<br />
