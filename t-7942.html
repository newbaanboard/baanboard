<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isimeon</div><div class="date">4th December 2002, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I created a new session to import and maintain receipts via handheld computer. Now I have to create receipts. ILC and Lot control are implemented. I have read several forum treads about AFS and Maintain Receipts. Obviously there are many problems with zoom sessions, stpapi library versions, patches, etc. <br />
<br />
Can I use Test Function Server session functionality to create receipts? I have the sources and patches for tuddc module. Have anyone made this?<br />
<br />
My idea is to populate table tuddc120 (DDC Error Handling Worktable) and to send and receive bucket messages to function server tdpur4120b000.<br />
<br />
Are there any constraints?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Getting all of the location and lot control pieces in place is complicated, but it can be done.  There are undoubtedly several companies, including mine :), that offer out-of-the-box function servers to accomplish this task through DDC (via Test Function Server or otherwise).<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you need more information.  If you decide to do it yourself, best of luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. Maybe I did not explain the problem well. I created session (not function server), which have to start function server tdpur4120b000. I want to include in my session code &quot;Test Function Server&quot; session's functionality.<br />
<br />
The whole functionality of maintain receipts (with ILC and Lot Control) is very complicated to develop it again.<br />
<br />
I know for your company solutions, but at this stage I will try to solve the problems myself.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
