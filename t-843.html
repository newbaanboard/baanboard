<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joergm</div><div class="date">23rd January 2002, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed iCRM 4.2 on a notebook and updated from<br />
our server database. The following days we did some<br />
synchronizations and updates and everything worked fine.<br />
<br />
But one day the DBsync did not work any longer. It<br />
stopped with Error 12163 (ERROR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED).<br />
DBsync could not get a ftp connection with the ftp server.<br />
But I could do ftp via command line.<br />
We checked the configuration (login, password ...) and everything seemed to be good.<br />
<br />
I reinstalled iCRM and after that DBsync worked without errors.<br />
<br />
Since that problem occurred the first time we had the same error<br />
on 5 other notebooks.<br />
<br />
Knows somebody somewhat about a problem like this?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
It can get tricky when we installed the software for the first time we spent some 10 - 14 hours trying to get the system to work correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joergm</div><div class="date">13th February 2002, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem could not be located in the client<br />
configuration because everything worked.<br />
<br />
The error occured without changing anything. On some<br />
systems even without rebooting. From one sync to another<br />
the ftp connection was broken.<br />
<br />
After changing the option &quot;use batch file&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; I could <br />
sync again. But this workaround doesn't remove the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks Jörg</div></div><hr />
