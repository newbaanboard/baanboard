<br />
According to bug fix 104122 (Example of a function server) I filled in as follows<br />
<br />
Package wh<br />
Module ltc<br />
Session 1500m000<br />
Name of DLL whltcf1500m000<br />
<br />
But I always receive the message &quot;Cannot create file&quot;whenever I run ttstpcreatdll. I run this right at server so there's no file/directory authorisation problem. I even recreated the ltc module directory structure under anything that starts with wh in{BSE$}\application. Our STP for API is up to the latest as of this point, ie bug fix 128850. In fact I tried to do this not only for whltc1500m000, but for several other sessions in different modules as well. Anything I did wrong? Any idea? Thanks, guys &amp; girls<br />

<br />
Go on your form(s) for this session, in maintain forms, then check if there is a Short Description, if there is none, put one.<br />
<br />
For an unknown reason, when I could not create a dll with ttstpcreatdll, it was because one or nore of the form(s) for the given session had no short description (This solution was given to me by Baan support).<br />
<br />
If this does not solve your problem, then it is something else.</div></div><hr />

As per your suggestion, I checked for those but found out that the form tab description (B5 version of short desc) are filled up. Probably I'll follow your example and ask Baan Support about this. I'll let everybody know what BS say. Thanks very much, gous99<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While waiting for BS to reply, anybody else has idea what could I've done wrong? Thank you<br />

<br />
It's solved! Turns out that the way to fill the form is slightly different in B5. This is how it should've been filled<br />
<br />
Package wh<br />
Module ltc<br />
Session 1500m000<br />
Name of DLL f1500m000             &lt;- B5, won't see &quot;whltc&quot; here<br />
<br />
We have B4 sys as well and in B4 we can see the package &amp; module code in the line above, hence more informative.<br />
Thanks gous99 and others for looking into this.<br />
<br />

<br />
Now what was I thinking when I checked BGS first?<br />
<br />
Baanboard rules!</div></div><hr />
