<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I've written DDC function servers for a while.  Now, I thought I'd try using the stpapi calls to do something &quot;simple&quot; like add a lot in the Maintain Lots session (BTW, this is IVc2 sch0).  This is obviously part of a larger program script.<br />
<br />
So, I started created several stpapi.put.field() commands and then used an stpapi.insert().  I found a few things:<br />
[list=1]<br />
 The Maintain Lots session opened up on the screen. I didn't think this was supposed to happen, but maybe I was mistaken.<br />
 The first few fields were blank and the session was waiting at the Lot field.<br />
 When I executed the insert, I received the dreaded &quot;Recursion not yet implemented&quot; error.:eek: <br />
[/list=1] <br />
<br />
If I look at the script for Maintain Lots, it is importing several fields if it is being run in the background.  So, I set the appropriate zoom variables and ran it again.  Items 1 &amp; 3 still happened.  Still, it seems like it defeats the purpose of using an API call if I have to look at the script to figure out which variables need to be imported.<br />
<br />
So.... I'm sure I am missing something HUGE yet fundamental here. :rolleyes:  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

Humbly yours,<br />

(1) I have never seen one of these screens open in the foreground.  So my answer is &quot;NO&quot; that should not happend. Maybe it is a &quot;feature&quot; of 4c2 and not 4c3, which we are running.<br />
<br />
(2) No you should not need the source to find out what the problems are.  This just makes it easier to resolve problems.  We do not own source so I have to work around it.  I believe if you search through some other threads in the tool box you will see how others modified baan source to get their function servers working.<br />
<br />
Sorry this is not much help. I have not written a function server on this session, but will try a quick test.<br />

Everything was perfect. I wonder if it could be your version of the api objects in tools?  I do not know enough about 4c2 or 4c3 to know what to check.  Not much help, but I tried.:(<br />

I figured that part of the problem might be the tools.  I'll see if I can get these updated to something more current and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">12th February 2002, 19:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Patching solved all of the problems.<br />
<br />
BTW, the latest IVc, IVc1, or IVc4 tools patch can be found in solution 122222 on Baan's web site.  It is very recent (8 Feb 2002).</div></div><hr />
