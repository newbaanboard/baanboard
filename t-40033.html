<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klesch</div><div class="date">2nd August 2007, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I have made a short program that handles session tdilc4201m000 and tdilc4202m000 using stpapi.* functions in Baan IV. It works perfectly when a superuser (bsp) runs it. However, if a non-superuser runs it nothing really happens and stpapi.continue.process does not return any message. If this user runs both sessions manually they work OK.<br />

Any ideas or hints? Please, do not hesitate to post. Thank you!</div></div><hr />

Delete any user defaults they may have for these sessions.  How are you handling the reports? Are there any errors in any of the log files?</div></div><hr />

One easy way to check this is to ask the user to perform exactly the same thing as what your API program is doing directly on those sessions. If the same user also can't perform exactly the same task here, then you're sure the user wasn't given sufficient permission<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klesch</div><div class="date">5th August 2007, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for your answers. Actually, it was not a permission or authorisation problem. It was that the user had some default settings stored for this sessions. It was mark_h's &quot;Delete any user defaults they may have for these sessions.&quot; that reminded me that I actually ignored this possibility since I was not setting values for all fields on the form. Thank you again!</div></div><hr />
