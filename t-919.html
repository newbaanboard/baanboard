<br />
It would be good if the tool could also keep a history of system useage statistics for comparison purposes.<br />
<br />
Specifically, this is for a Unix/Informix environment.<br />
<br />
I know there are tools such as licmon, onstat and other unix commands, but what our client would really like is something that combines all of these into an easy to use interface.<br />

We are operating under HPUX 11 and use HP Producct called Glance .within HP Openview . Not cheap but very helpful<br />

<br />
The problem with it is that it does't show things like -<br />
<br />
How many Baan users are on the system<br />
Which sessions users are running<br />
How much of the database resources a baan user is taking<br />
<br />
You have to go though quite a few steps to find this sort of information out, using a command line interface.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just do some scripting, use bshcmd6.1 to get details about running sessions and time consumption within the bshells.<br />
If the customer wants &quot;graphical&quot; output, use php and the intranet to display these gathered information and to communicate with the script.<br />
For the parameters of bshcmd, just enter bshcmd6.1 -U.<br />

Do you have any script to publish these session information that you can share with us ?<br />

Could you educate us what the &quot;performance guide&quot; is and where we can access it ?<br />

<br />
as I am not at a baan box at the moment, I can only give you some clues from memory<br />
<br />
ps -ef | grep bshell | grep -v grep <br />
gives a list of PID's of the running bshells<br />
Let's assume that the 5th column of the output is the PID<br />
(I am not at all sure about this, just try and see which column it is)<br />
so:<br />
ps -ef | grep bshell | grep -v grep | awk '{print $5}' &gt; pidlist<br />
produces a neat file with bshell PID's, which can be processed<br />
suchlike:<br />
<br />
while read mypid<br />
do<br />
rm $BSE_TMP/$mypid.PID       # you have to clean the old files<br />
bshcmd6.1 -p -s -u1 -w1 $mypid &gt; $mypid.log1<br />
done &lt; pidlist<br />
<br />
if you run this script twice (after a minute or so) and produce .log2 files this time, you can evaluate these two logfiles, compare the ticks of the bshell-subprocesses with one another and you have a good clue, which bshell is how active.<br />
<br />
I will start my vacation tommorow, but feel free to ask for more info.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, if you are using BaanERP glance should be able to show all the information you are looking for.<br />
<br />
If you are using Baan4c4, you can still use glance quite nicely by defining application groups. Let's say a group for all bshells, then glance will display the numbers of running bshells and the total CPU consumption and so forth.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JamesV</div><div class="date">29th March 2002, 18:00</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, Glance is a great tool and every HP-UX account should be using either glance (text version) or gpm (X windows) for the analysis of OS resources (CPU, memory, IO) in use.<br />
<br />
Glance also runs on AIX and Solaris.<br />
<br />
For Informix, there are no good tools to tie the UNIX process back to the session.  You have to use the onstat -g ses options, etc. to get this information.<br />
<br />
You can use the bshcmd for Baan processes.  My company, Open Systems Technologies, also markets a new product called uGuage which can be used to run traces, check on licensing, see which sessions are running, etc.  We have not tied this to the database back end processes.  <br />
<br />
I am currently working with another customer to build this three part integration into a system management framework.  But, it is not ready yet.<br />
<br />
BTW -- the ARM reporting in Baan 5, Glance, Measureware and PerfView is really slick and works great.  Unfortunately, Baan has refused to put this in place for Baan IV.<br />

Sorry it took so long to reply.  There are two such guides that I know about.  One is the Rapiditas Performance Guide M2002A US for Baan IV.  It is part of Knowledge Quest and might be obtainable from Baan Support.  The other is M2017B US Application Performance Guide for Baan V and up.  I believe that this was on one of the Baan V documentation CD's but I can not be sure.  This guide is more pratical and easier to read.  Both seem to be a up to date manual of SQL 6.0 Baan released when it introduced SQL into there product.  It has a lot of good tips in it also.</div></div><hr />
