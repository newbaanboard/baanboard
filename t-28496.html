<br />
I have upgraded my test server from sp12 to sp20 and also to the porting set 6.1c.07.11. I have now found that the function stpapi.change.view is acting differently than before and also different than the documentation I have (document U8627A US delivered together with the SP solutions). The documentation says that the return values can be 0, 1 or 2. 1 meaning found, 2 meaning another record found (err.msg not filled) and 0 meaning unsuccessful and err.msg filled. This is according to older documentation and how it used to work.<br />
<br />
In my example I am now working in session tihra1101m000 and setting the values to year, week and employee and then do a stpapi.change.view into a view where there are no records yet. Before the function would return 2 in this situation but now it suddenly returns 0 BUT the err.msg i not filled.<br />
<br />
If I in this situation ignore my error handling and continue with setting data to the different fields and then do the insert I can see that the insert is successful (no error returned) and I can also see in the session manually that the record was indeed successfully inserted.<br />
<br />
So it seems that where I expect the function to return 2 it is now instead returning 0.<br />
<br />
Has anyone verify this behaviour and what did you do about it?</div></div><hr />

I have not seen this problem.  I will go run a couple where one where I know I use the change.view command and see if it has a problem.<br />
<br />
So far the only problem I know that exists is ticst0101m000 gets an error on the first stpapi.put command.  I logged a case with Baan.  I know I can fix the problem if I remove form 2 from the session - I think it is corrupt in some way.</div></div><hr />

Below is part of the code to receive a production order - the stpapi.change.view had a return code of 1 - as I would expect.<br />

	stpapi.handle.subproc(&quot;tdilc4104s000&quot;,&quot;tdilc4515s000&quot;,&quot;add&quot;)<br />

	rc = stpapi.change.view(&quot;tdilc4515s000&quot;,msg)<br />
	if not isspace(msg) or rc&lt;&gt;1 then</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think your situation is a bit different from mine since you are receiving 1 from the function. I think my problem relates to receiving 0 where I used to get 2.<br />
<br />
I can change the error handling functionality to not look at the return value but instead see if err.msg is empty or not. But if nothing else I thought to ask the question and give the warning.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I went out and reviewed all the code I could find and it seems that I never look for 2.  I either look for a 1 or I just check the error message.  Or sometimes both, but never do I look to see if it is 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">25th October 2006, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I had deep problems with change.view in another session (tdrpl0114m000). But in general I'm testing the values &quot;found&quot; against the values &quot;expected&quot;. Maybe that is better than to trust any return values ;-) .<br />
