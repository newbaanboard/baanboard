<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">2nd September 2002, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen some nice things from streamserve (as we sell it ourselves too), and very little hands on experience. Promising tool though, if well utilized it can save lots of Euro's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">2nd September 2002, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">What I personally like is that you keep your logic on your Baan server. This means you don't have to look where the code is. However this can be done also by the push technology of Baan/Crystal.<br />
 <br />
On the other hand you can not use it for quering directly the baan data.<br />
<br />
It's available also on Unix. <br />
<br />
You can use it to mail/print/fax/store your documents in several kind of formats.<br />
<br />
It looks like a strong package to me but it depends on your goal.<br />

It's very cumbersome to use.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Popeye!<br />

 Packs in a lot of punch<br />
 Very fast processing. I have an invoicing process that generates more than 500 pages of output in about 7-8 seconds on a Pentium III class machine.<br />
 Very unwieldy. Like most European products - lots of features - very bad useability :).</div></div><hr />
