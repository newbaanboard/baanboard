<br />
as promised, I can now give you some more information on the partneship between TRANSFLOW, Germany and Baan. They have started marketing COSA Workflow under the product name &quot;Workflow4Baan&quot;.<br />
<br />
The day before yesterday I have held a speech on profitable usage scenarios for workflow in Baan environments - some tipps on project do's and don'ts - and on viable approaches not causing too much start invest.<br />
<br />
You can download the slides on http://www.cbi-network.com (see &quot;knowledge base&quot;) - and you will also find white papers on Baan&amp;Workflow in the &quot;solutions&quot; area of this web site. You might want to select &quot;English&quot; language first. <br />
<br />
Of course I am looking forward to any contact, if I can provide answers or further help.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day,<br />
Peter</div></div><hr />

<br />
we have changed our company name from cbs-network to cbi-network (consulting &amp; business innovation). Otherwise our services stay the same - especially those around workflow and Baan.<br />
<br />
So if you want to find the above mentioned white papers and ppt presentations you can now go to: http://www.cbi-network.com<br />
<br />
In the solutions area you will find white papers for Baan users and partner companies - freely accessible.<br />
<br />
In the download area you will find some interesting presentation slides on ROI potentials of using workflow and document management (in combination with Baan) - entering contact information required before download.<br />
<br />
Kind regards!<br />
Peter</div></div><hr />
