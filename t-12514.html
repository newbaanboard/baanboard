<br />
I saw the report format . We are getting these kinds of reports regularly from Baan (either from a Baan report / Baan table) directly in Excel and that too user does not have to trigger the same (The system uses the Job management and sends an outlook mail to the key user.<br />
<br />
I don't know the functional meaning of the figures. All I know I can such kind of report in Baan report and ERPJewels can extract the figures from any Baan report/ Baan table , prepare graphs/charts in excel u required , highlight exceptions and create an email if required (with XLS attachment and user defined text as email body).<br />
<br />
So the problem I understand is how to create a Baan report giving such numbers. This is farly simple . If u send me an email about functional explanation about the report you wish, I can give some useful hints .</div></div><hr />
