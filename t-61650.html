<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenkR</div><div class="date">18th December 2011, 00:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
as it was said AFS doesn't support MMT. If I copy a session to a new one and change MMT to *dialog*, can I use this session via AFS(I am thinking of using sessions tdpur2100 and tdsls4100 via AFS)?<br />
<br />
Another question. Is it possible to call DLL functions inside LN via COM(BW)? Is there any example of doing this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">19th December 2011, 09:37</div></div><div class="posttext">In my optinion a MMT-session is more or less a bundle or container of normal maintain- or display sessions. So i always check the listed MMT-satellite-sessions. These can be started on their own (at least one can give it a try). Then the satellite-session can be used in AFS. <br />
<br />
(Example: you want to use tdsls4100m900 and read or modify information from or on the first slider &quot;Positions&quot;. This slider is session tdsls4101m000, so you can use tdsls4101m00 in AFS instead of using tdsls4100m900.)<br />
<br />
However, last week i &quot;decoved&quot; the latest AFS-docu on Infor365.com (now called &quot;Infor Integration 6.2 - Developer's Guide for Application Function Server&quot;; Publication date: October 4, 2011; Document code: U8627B US).<br />
<br />
This docu said there's been an solution for ES8.7 to enable AFS-controll of MMT-sessions: &quot;MMT sessions are not supported by Application Function Server. However since ES8.7 Solution 1016219 there is support for MMT sessions in Application Function Server Available.&quot; <br />
<br />
I've checked Infor365.com and there's also an update available: sol. 1052537<br />
<br />
We're still on FP6 so i cant' give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenkR</div><div class="date">20th December 2011, 13:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Does this AFS also work with LN6.1fp3?<br />
<br />
I was thinking of using only a header section of *tdsls4100m900*. This is the only part(session)  where PUR header can be entered into a system. So I was thinking of *deriving* a session (duplicating) into a new one and changing a window type to *dialog*.<br />
So the base question is, is it allowed to use a MMT session to enter header section only (or is it ok if I duplicate session, change names and change window type of attribute). <br />
<br />
I was not thinking of entering data into sateliite sessions via MMT session.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">20th December 2011, 13:36</div></div><div class="posttext">So your're trying to use the MMT-mastersession itself by copying it into an new session? Well, i never tried that one. I'm thinking of using tdsls4100m000 instead (which is the mainsession for the sales-headerdata).<br />
<br />
I see the advantage of an customized version of tdsls4100m900, too. Both sessions tdsls4100m000 and tdsls4100m900 using the same script, so i think it will work, but i never tried it myself. <br />
You may even consider to create a complete new session (with selected fields from tdsls400) and use the given script tdsls4100.<br />
<br />
I've checked my FP6 source of tdsls4100. The script uses hardcoded sessioncodes (ie. prog.name$ = &quot;tdsls4100m900&quot;) in some functions. I've not checked in detail but it may be that some functions will not work when the sessionname changes. You may have to change the script or use the given session tdsls4100m000. I think it will depend on your tests with a derived and modified session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenkR</div><div class="date">20th December 2011, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">If I press *new* in na session tdsls4100m000, session tdsls4100m900 in *insert* mode is opened. There is no *tdsls4100m000* version with active insert button.<br />
Detail View(Ctrl+Shift+D) of a session tdsls4100m000 has *New* button disabled.<br />
If I start tdsls4100m900, immediate tdskls4101m000 is started(first tab in *satellite sessions*).<br />
So a question is, what would be a valid way to add order header to a system wihtout using MMT session?<br />
Is it possible to change *tdsls4100m900* into *no-MMT* session or is it possible to somehow activate *new* action in *tdsls4100m000*, or some totally other way(but using AFS via COM only)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">21st December 2011, 09:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, i missed that. I've tried coping session tdsls4100m000 to new session tdsls4100m001. It opens tdsls4100m900 on &quot;New&quot;, too.<br />
<br />
Then i tried copying tdsls4100m900 into tdsls4100m90t and tdsls4100m00t. During copy i changed their type from MMT to grid-type. Both new sessions didn't start (giving error illegal value for size element).<br />
<br />
I remember there's been a DLL to creatre orders i think. I've checked the quotation process. In FP6 there's a DLL tdsls4321 which replaces the old DLL tdslsdll1234. Maybe you could use one of this given DLLs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FrenkR</div><div class="date">22nd December 2011, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I solved a problem. What I did:<br />
1.) *duplicated* session tdsls4100m000 (new name was tdsls4100mpol)<br />
2.) changed *session sychronization* form tdsls4100m900 to tdsls4100m000 (actually, this change does the trick - avoids of updating a data via MMT session).<br />
<br />
Now it works like a charm :)<br />
<br />
Changing MMT property to *dialog* breaks session. So this was a *stupid* question.<br />
I believe that this kind of solution would work in all MMT sessions. Also I noticed a *bug* inside BW processes treeview. If you have Process... form opened and you close a session via AFS, you will get some *shell* errors. If you close *Processes* form, errors will dissapear. <br />
<br />
Thanks for a help.<br />
