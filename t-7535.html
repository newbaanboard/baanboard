<br />
The poblem is, that the call <br />
&quot;f0130s000.complete.oper.with.commit(error)&quot; doesn't work.<br />
<br />
The other AFS functions, like put values and update, work fine. <br />
<br />
We try the access the session's tisfc0130s000 via tisfc0530m000 and complete operations.<br />
<br />
It looks as so, as if tisfc0130s000 is not entered at all from the above call. We tried that with the debugger.<br />

Have you had a successful try synchronizing using API in B5 in other part of B5 operation before? If this is your first attempt at synchronizing (tisfc0530m000 is synchronized with tisfc0130m000), then seems like your stpapi.synchronize.dialog doesn't work, just like minee. I have a thread on mine in:<br />
stpapi.synchronize.dialog (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7361)<br />
<br />
However, if you've successfully tried sync with API before, I'd like to know whether there's any special recipe to make it work :) . Thanks very much<br />

synchronize seems to work. We get all variables properly back.<br />
<br />
See the attached script in the first posting.<br />

Actually, I just got the sync to work, couple of hours after I posted my first reply in this thread. Found out that it was just silly upper case print in the manual.<br />
<br />
Does your variable error contains anything after f0130s000.complete.oper.with.commit?<br />

Sorry for not seeing this the first time, but doesn't tisfc0130m000 ask series of questions upon updating and completing? You'd have to handle the answering of those questions using stpapi.enum.answer or its equal inside your tisfcf0130m000 DLL.<br />

<br />
the debugger shows, that  &quot;f0130s000.complete.oper.with.commit(error)&quot; never enters tisfc0130s000 ???<br />

In normal operation of the session, after filling all the appropriate fields, you could save first (B5 will ask 2 questions, tisfc01027 and tisfc02029) before declaring the operation as completed. Hence when mimicking this with API, you should<br />
<br />
- update with no saving just like you did. This will execute the field sections of the session and do some processing to get value of other fields that don't need to be specified manually<br />
- save (missing from original script posted!)<br />
- set answer for the 2 questions (missing from original script posted!)<br />
- do a stpapi.form.command on complete.oper.with.commit just like you did<br />
<br />
So, pls make sure that the 2 steps missing above are inserted in the correct place. Also, when I created tisfcf0130s000 I don't get the function f0130s000.complete.oper.with.commit() you used. Instead, I got this function:<br />
<br />
function extern void f0130s000.Complete_Operation( ref string error )<br />
{<br />
DLLUSAGE<br />
	Function to start form command Complete_Operation in session tisfc0130s000<br />
ENDDLLUSAGE<br />
	stpapi.form.command( &quot;tisfc0130s000&quot;, 5, &quot;complete.oper.with.commit&quot;, error )<br />
}<br />
<br />
The function name doesn't matter, as long as the substitution part is correct. Can you pls make sure that your function is substituted correctly in the source code of your tisfcf0130s000 DLL?<br />
<br />
All the best with your tweaking!<br />
<br />

<br />
PS:<br />
In fact, I just finished coding our API for reporting operation completed 2 days ago, but I didn't use DLL and didn't declare the completion using API (The declaration will be performed by office staff directly)</div></div><hr />
