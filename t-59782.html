<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kbarthelt</div><div class="date">3rd January 2011, 18:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are some thoughts from our IT guy:<br />
<br />
Anything in %BSE%\log?, log.ddc_server? <br />
Anything in the event viewer?<br />
Does the DDC Driver write a log file that you can look at? <br />
Is the DDC driver porting set dependent? It may need to be upgraded.<br />
Is there an alternate bshell (rather than ntbshell.exe) specified in the BW configuration? If so, this file would also need to be updated to the latest from the porting set.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
What portingset did you use before, perhaps you can try using a bit older version to see if that still works?<br />

We are using the old bin directory, but with the new informix driver because the update was from 9.4. to 11.1</div></div><hr />

The last PS for 2003 is 6.1c.12.  Not sure this is what caused the DDC error though.</div></div><hr />
