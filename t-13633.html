<br />
Here is what I have found:<br />
<br />
If I include my AFS calls in the after.program portion of the report script, I get a printed Pick List for the last line of the report.<br />
<br />
If I include my AFS calls in the before.layout section of detail.1, I get my Pick List for each line on the Confirmed and Generated Back Orders report; however, the Pick List is merged in with the output from Confirmed and Generated Back Orders.  <br />
<br />
Is there anyway to include AFS calls in a report script so that another report will print separate from the calling report for each occurance of a layout?</div></div><hr />

Then in the after.program, just print that report. The only problem would layouts and page break.  You would need to make sure that the file you created matched the print layout of a printer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">17th November 2003, 23:24</div></div><div class="posttext">The AFS's do have an issue with multiple reports being open - maybe by writing in the report script you are running into that.  Not sure without seeing and playing.  <br />
<br />
Another workaround would be to make your own session as the master with the same input fields as Confirm &amp; Generate Back Orders, then call Confirm &amp; Generate as an AFS, close, then call the Pick List as an AFS.<br />
<br />
Not sure of all the session tie ins, so sorry if it's a simplistic view, but you get the idea.</div></div><hr />
