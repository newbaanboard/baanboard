<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gaurav</div><div class="date">30th September 2001, 13:28</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: hi all<br />
can someone suggest how can i import a flat file using a program script. what i m trying to achieve is that instead of using the Exchange scheme to import the flat through job Management, i want a session should be used which would take the data from the flat file and import the data.<br />

<br />
Importing flat files into Baan is possible.  <br />
<br />
Just format the flat file in the correct way, and use $BSE/bin/bdbpost6.x to post the file into the desired table.  You can first dump the table using bdbpre6.x (use the pipe &quot;|&quot; separator) - this dump file will give you an example of the correct format of the flat file.<br />
<br />
Now, you just need to be careful which table(s) you are updating.  Sometimes references need updating in other tables (eg. tools tables), and information also needs uploading into these tables also.<br />
<br />
So this can be a bit tricky, and in fact probably the reason why the Baan Exchange Modules were developed in the first place.<br />
<br />
Let us know what table you want to update and with what information.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

The coding for this would be more difficult as you'll have to parse each line in the import file, but I've found these quite useful for specific tasks.<br />
<br />
Check Baan's 4GL help for more details...<br />
