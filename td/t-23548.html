<br />
I supposed that the Packign slip should be printed in Business Partner's language as other reports are printed. I dont know why this report only printed in English and French, but not printed in Portuguese language. Any idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

Check whether the report exists in Portugese language. Reports are language dependent components.<br />

<br />
Here is the further detail:<br />
<br />
The actual report is in French language. <br />
The english report is configured, linked to French and working well. <br />
<br />
I have configured Portuguese report using option &quot;copy to other language&quot;, keeping link to report to &quot;French&quot;.<br />
Defined all titles in Portuguese language<br />
Compiled report, without any error.<br />
<br />
Now if I tried to print the report, for a Business partner having language &quot;Portuguese&quot;, the report is printed in English. I checked the report language predefined veraiable (lattr.language$) in report script and it is has value of Portuguese but report printed in English.<br />
<br />
I think now it is clear what has been done. I will be thankful If you can help to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
When you debug the report, Which layout does it take and print in English, check whether that layout is available in portugese.<br />
<br />
Wish you luck.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, the Layout is exists and can edit for the Portugues language. Should I remove the layout and copy again from French layout and try it? May be the report object is not linked properly for the portuguese langauge and thats why its printing report in English. What your idea?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Please delete all the report in portugese and try copying again. Also I would suggest that when you copy again try to go into tools tables and see whether all the layouts etc are properly copied. Debug the report and see whether the right layout is getting picked up, when debugging try to to trace the lattr.language variable.<br />
<br />
If you still dont get it solved we will see some other way.<br />
<br />

<br />
It seems that it is not actually the problem of configuration of report in Portuguese language or picking of right layout etc. <br />
<br />
I noticed one very intresting thing during the test. One of the Business Partner, for which report was printed correctly in French langauge, I changed the language of BP once to english and then to Portuguese, but every time report is printed in French. Report didn't took the effect the change in language of BP. I changed the language for BP of Source and destination. I think there is something else which is missing to configure. <br />
<br />
Have any idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am trying to print a report in Polish language, but English appears instead.<br />
The session contains a version of the english report (language 2) and there is also a polish version (language d).  When I log in as the polish user, the report is printed in english.  These are non-customized versions of the report.  They are B40c4 versions (standard).   Any suggestions?<br />
