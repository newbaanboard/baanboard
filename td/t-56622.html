<br />
Is there a tool which makes it possible to analyze the structure of a Baan source? An example would be the tool Easycase which currently supports programming languages such as C/C++, Cobol, Assembler, ABAP and many others (of course except Baan). The tool reads the source file and generates automatically a graphical view of the programm source. With such a tool analyzing a source is much easier and faster (especially for large source files) than without... <br />
<br />
There are many different tools available, but I haven't found any with Baan support.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

The option is no longer available in LN, I guess they moved it to the new Eclipse Studio model. <br />
<br />
I found one of our old environment to get some screen shots but its quite ancient and not working as expected.<br />
<br />
The program name is - ottidepex</div></div><hr />

As expected it doesn't work in LN... Does somebody know whether such a function is included to Infor's Eclipse plugin or not?<br />
