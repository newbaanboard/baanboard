<br />
I am in the process of improving the performance of certain customised sessions.For this i am using Profiling tool to get a list of functions which are consuming more time.In the profiling report i see lot of entries for ottstpstandard which are taking up a considerable amount of time.Can any one please explain to me what are these entries and is there anything i can do about them.<br />
Also i have observed that sumtimes the 'and' part of the queries hamper the performance while in some cases a query runs faster with 'and' statements.<br />
Can anyone telll me in detail how a Baan SQL query works in background.<br />
<br />
I'll also appreciate some tips for optimisation.<br />
<br />

There is nothing you can do inhere. All actions (written by original and customized software) goes via the standard program to handle all treads to e.g. secure multi-user env., database actions, etc.<br />
Focus on the listed procedures into the customized sessions. Remember that the profiling tool list the time needed to come back with the results, so if the database is slow by itself for whatsoever reason, this is reflected into the profiler too.<br />
Good start is to optimize the database first, for e.g. Oracle first run the Oracle Optimizer before starting profiling the sessions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as you use AND to specify more of a table's index, it will (or might) increase performance. Once you start using AND to fetch additional fields, or to build relationships with other tables, performance will suffer.<br />
<br />
The best tip I can give you is to use BLAT to monitor your queries. It will give you all the data you need to analyze events before and after the DB driver.</div></div><hr />
