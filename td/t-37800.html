<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">20th June 2007, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">We have an instance where one of our companies would like to see a report print landscape on a printer. 99.9% of their duties are portrait so we don't want to set their default printer to landscape.<br />
<br />
By looking through a pile of threads here, I get the impression that it may be possible to script in a spool.paper.type=&quot;LETL&quot; ( L for landscape ) based on our baan configurations. I even changed the report margins etc to landscape, set the default device for the report to Landscape, still nothing ....<br />
<br />
Our other employees simple manually select either LETTER or LETL from the print page in Baan to force it. I am hoping there is a better way ...<br />
<br />
By using get.compnr() I can set an if stmt for this one comapny to call up spool.paper.type=&quot;LETL&quot; but alas, it doesn't seem to have any effect. The current report had no scripting before so maybe I am just not strong enough with my syntax.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Then I set the secondary printer to portrait.  If the report is set up correctly then when the select device comes up it automatically picks landscape.  Not sure if that helps.</div></div><hr />

Use this in conjunction with secondarly device you create with landscape as the default paper type..<br />
 <br />
Hope this helps..<br />

Our Baan b4c4<br />

I try that ttaad3105m000 (Maintain Report Defaults) for one customize report but it is not working. it's need convert to runtime on user ? or just simple add on package and all VRC with report number.<br />
<br />

I am using Baan4c4 as well. I tried it again after seeing your post and it worked like a charm.<br />
You dont have to convert any user to runtime because this only has to do with reports and not user. All you got to take note is that you are defining this default paper type for the same VRC your report is in. Make sure the report is compiled(before setting the default papertype). Save the default setting in the session Maintain Report Defaults {ttaad3105m000} and once you run your report, you could see the change in paper type..<br />
 <br />
Check the VRC of your report and the VRC of your default setting in the above session...<br />

Hmm, secondary printer ?  Is this a config in baan or elsewhere like the server or the users desktop ? ? I think you meant secondary printer you set to landscape, not portrait right ? So far I have set the report default in aad3105 to landscape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd June 2007, 03:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know the session name off hand.  There is session (look in the menu where you setup the user) there is define user device preferences.  In this I mand the portrait printer the first printer, the landscape the second printer.  Then when the user runs a print session, clicks continue, the ttstpsplopen session pops up with a pre-defined printer.  The way this works it uses the defined printer list for the user and selects the one that the report was setup for.  I will get the session name tomorrow.  In effect what you could do is define a portrait, landscape, legal, a4, etc. for a user.  Then depending on the report the ttstpsplopen will select the best printer for it.</div></div><hr />

The user actually didn't have any default. I also heard from a co worker that you can use something called PC$ to assign tray bins in code, but your solution sounds a lot more flexible as we have other users to use printer that don't have more than one tray on their machine and do this all manually ...<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your assistance ! I'll give it a shot ...</div></div><hr />
