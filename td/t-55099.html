<br />
The question is specifically about the domain tieser.a (Effective Unit Series) - at present, this domain has Legal Characters defined as <br />
<br />
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot; &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Due to a business requirement, I am going to remove the contents of the Legal Characters field, so that the domain will allow all characters to be entered.<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
Since the change is relaxing on the validation, is it really necessary to do a &quot;reconfigure tables&quot; for this change, since only the validation has changed? Only future data is going to be 'non-conforming' to the old validation. The reason for this question is that, the reconfigure tables will reconfigure approximately 70 tables, some of which [example, ticst951, tisfc951, tipgc500] are more than half-million records each, and there is no 'quiet time' window available to do this.<br />
<br />
I do realize that there is no 'going back' once this is in place without a lot of pain ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">19th February 2009, 17:35</div></div><div class="posttext">As rightly identified by u , reconfig is not necessary . In many cases , Baan checks on its own about the requirement to do reconfig and avoids reconfig is logical. But I dont know abt this case . On a safe side, u can just do convert to runtime in a test environment . If that too is difficult , u can replace old file with .new file for domain and remove reconfig indicators in ttadv502 (after convert to runtime dd) .<br />
<br />
I  believe u know abt the implications of this. Because all programs using this may have assumpltion of data with legal characters and such program may behave differently when this assumption is violated .</div></div><hr />
