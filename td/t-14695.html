IMHO there are two ways: table field data authorization<br />
or check input in section check.input :)</div></div><hr />

What I try to do is via &quot;Maintain Form Field Data&quot; to create some kind of an input condition so it will be blokked.<br />
<br />
This way I would only need to do it once instead of giving every user table field data authorization.<br />
<br />
The section.input is prob. when I could change the programming of the script? Or am I wrong? (we do not have the scripts for the session)<br />
Otherwise I would like to hear where I could do that.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">This is an example where one of the customization tools such as RMCgen (http://www.rmcis.com/rmcgen2.html) or QKey would be very handy.  You would simply add your own critera to the check.input section for the field.  There is no need to have the standard Baan source.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do not want to change script (Vamsi started a BIG tool called Rush, thanks him) you might change a table :) create new table with allowed cunos and change reference from sales table to yours and from yours to tccom010<br />
<br />
Another way - try to change domain on table field it must look like tccuno but has your limitations. Maybe that will work?<br />
<br />
The problem is that these standart tables is frequently modified by support :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">It's very interesting but it works<br />
<br />
Inp\Ref for xxyyy999.cuno field:<br />
xxyyy999.cuno:=(xxyyy999.cuno(1;1)&lt;&gt;&quot;B&quot;)?&quot;B00000&quot;:xxyyy999.cuno,1<br />
<br />
Check that B00000 client was not in tccom010</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dleijdekkers</div><div class="date">4th March 2004, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">It is definitly very interesting. . and it does the job.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
<br />
Is there anywhere were I could find more information about the possibilities on the things you can put in Inp\Ref.??<br />
<br />

The problem is that this field has length limitation</div></div><hr />
