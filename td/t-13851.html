<br />
      I alway use embedded SQL on program script. but I never use dynamic sql. I think embedded sql is good enough for customization.  <br />
     <br />
      what's advantage about dynamic sql ? and what's case we cannot use embedded sql?<br />
 <br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">5th December 2003, 20:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't believe there is any performance difference between the 2, it's just a matter of syntax.  I do a lot of customization, and yes, 99 % of the time we use embedded SQL.<br />
<br />
You will know when you need dynamic SQL.  The main reason is when you have various syntaxs for your SQL, depending on conditions above.  With dynamic SQL You can write the sql statement into a variable (thus having a different value depending on what your situation dictates).  Then the Main sql can just execute what you structured, whatever that is.<br />
<br />
For (very simple) example.. you want to get the item description.  in Baan IV, the items are stored in the Item Master (tiitm001) and also in the Customized Item Master (tipcs021...i think).   Depending on if you are customized or not, you can fill the sql syntax using sql.parse to read either:<br />
<br />
   &quot;select   tiitm001.dsca:item.dsca<br />
   from     tiitm001<br />
   where  tiitm001._index1 = {:my.item}&quot;<br />
OR<br />
   &quot;select   tipcs021.dsca:item.dsca<br />
   from     tipcs021<br />
   where  tipcs021._index1 = {:my.cprj, :my.item}&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Then, later, you can execute this sql, whichever one it filled, using the sql.exec and related fetch functions.  Either way, your item.dsca will get filled, and you don't have to keep writing those 2 select statements everywhere.  You saw the write-up for the syntax - this is just a general overview.<br />
<br />
This can also be used to determine the syntax of the main SQL of a report or process session, depending on the form fields they have filled out.   For instance, you may want to read by index1 if they have filled out the item range, or by index2 if they have filled out a customer range, etc.  You can set that syntax, and just call the 1 SQL during your process.<br />
<br />
Also, since you store the syntax in a variable, if you have table and field names stored as variables, dynamic SQL will help translate that to actual SQL syntax.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, others may have more to add.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A good example of dynamic SQL in Baan standard  is SQL queries (ttadv3180m000) . <br />
<br />
Similarly we also have developed a tool which uses dynamic SQL substantially.</div></div><hr />
