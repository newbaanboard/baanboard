<br />
I have read here several threads regarding adding the Tab at the end of reading the barcode by setting the scanner to do so. My customer doesn't want to change the scanner as being used for several applications, but still wants to have the TAB at the end of the barcode printed in a report.<br />
<br />
I would like to ask if anybody was able to do it with normal Baan Reports (by useng the Font 19, barcode in my case is 10 (128)).<br />
<br />
I have tried of course to define my string as:<br />
barcode.str = trim$(my.field) &amp; chr$(9) but as also the pther threads are describing, the report spooler ignores the TAB.<br />
<br />
Could anybody give me an ideea how to do it?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
With best regards,<br />

Of course I am using barcode 3 of 9, zebra printers and rmcis label printing software.  Works for me.<br />

	labl.bcit = barcode.the.item(tag.item) &amp; &quot;$I&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
PS = barcode.the.item strips out some characters and changes them, returns the converted item.</div></div><hr />
