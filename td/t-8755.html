<br />
If I insert a new record with the new, baan passes the &quot;choice.add.set / before choice&quot; section. After finishing the maintain session expected to pass the &quot;after.choice&quot; subsection of add.set. But that seems not to be the case.<br />
<br />
Does somebody have any informations about that for me?<br />

Thanks<br />

When debugging, keep in mind that the DAL for the main table may be doing something that is interferring, and may need to be debugged as well.  As far as I know, the choice.add.set/after.choice section is NOT replaced in the DAL, but the before and after save object sections from the DAL would get executed before coming back to your after choice section.<br />
<br />
You may try a simple session without a DAL and see if the section gets called, to see if it is really a bug in calling that section.  You can work up from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
strange, because the session is fully customized, with a fully customized main table. This main table doens't have a DAL.<br />
<br />
At the moment we talk about one special session. But I think I saw this behaviour also in other sessions. Don't remember which ones.<br />
