<br />
I am new to the development world and started to work on the extension Module in 10.5<br />
<br />
We have a requirement where we want control over the Text Editor:<br />
1. No one can go and delete existing text<br />
2. Capture Login ID &amp; Date-Time when a user modifies anything in a text field<br />
<br />
Not Sure if that is possible, but I have seen a similar functionality in the standard session, tsclm1100m000  (Comments Tab on the Service-Call Screen)<br />
<br />
Looking forward for a response<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">13th June 2017, 05:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You can write a Dal Hook for the text field which you dont want anyone to edit. and in the field Hook.. You can check if the Mode type is DAL_UPDATE and the Text field is zero that means there was a previous value and now you are trying to make it to zero, that means to delete the text field, so create a dal message and return Dalhookerror.<br />
<br />
Secondly, there will be two options to capture the date time stamp and the login Id name, you can add a normal Table field or to add a CDF field<br />
<br />
For the first part you can do with<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Syntax:<br />
function long field.check  (long has_changed [, long element])<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
Use this hook to program logical integrity rules for a specified field. The function name is ppmmmvss.bbbb.check(), where pp is the package code, mmm is the module code, vss is the table number, and bbbb is the field name. <br />
<br />
Insert a new object Update an existing object <br />
Does the property check for all fields.<br />
<br />
The has_changed flag is always set to DAL_NEW. Also for fields that are not changed! <br />
 Does the property check for all fields.<br />
<br />
The has_changed flag is only set to DAL_UPDATE for changed fields. For unchanged fields, the flag is cleared. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
Arguments<br />
long has_changed  <br />
[long element]  This is set for array fields only. It indicates the index of the array element that must be checked. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Return values<br />
This hook returns 0 if the value of the field is accepted. It returns a negative value (DALHOOKERROR) if the value is not accepted. <br />
<br />
Context<br />
This function is implemented in the 4GL Engine and can be used in DAL script types. <br />
<br />
See also<br />
Property methods<br />
<br />
Note<br />
With regards to Extended DAL (DAL2) it is advised to replace this property hook by the new DAL2 Field hooks. <br />
<br />
This hook is still supported for backward compatiblity reasons, but the consequence is that the field is not regarded as a DAL2 field. <br />
<br />
Example<br />
A property hook programmed in DLL tdsls040:<br />
function extern long tdsls040.oqua.check(long has_changed)<br />
{<br />
    if has_changed &lt;&gt; 0 and tdsls040.stat = tdsls.stat.invoiced then<br />
        dal.set.error.message(&quot;tdsls44041&quot;)<br />
        | Order is already invoiced, cannot change<br />
        | quantity<br />
        return(DALHOOKERROR)<br />
    endif<br />
    ...<br />
    return(0)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just compare the  has_changed flag to DAL_UPDATE.</div></div><hr />

It is saved with the general information of the text number (not the text field itself).<br />
You'll find the data in tools/text management (tttxt1500m000). The data is stored in table tttxt002.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sahil318</div><div class="date">27th June 2017, 21:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response but I was away on a vacation and did not check anything.<br />
I know I can check if the field becomes zero but it is really easy to fool the system.<br />
<br />
I can erase every thing from the text and leave a random char &quot;z&quot; in the text<br />
<br />
I need users to not delete anything which was entered and allow only append</div></div><hr />
