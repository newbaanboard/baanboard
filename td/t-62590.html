I have a user complaining that there are two sessions missing from one of the menus. I have checked all the rights connected to his role, and also compared it to another user who has these sessions shown in the menu, and as far as I can see the rights should be exactly the same and he should have access. They have the same role, same company, same VRC and same startup menu. <br />
<br />
Then I noticed that also for me with full session and full table access these two sessions are missing, but only from the web interface. When I'm logged in through the client they are there. Could there be some caching going on in the web interface? And if so, how do I get it to refresh the content? Has anybody had this problem before? (Known bug?)<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

On Worktop the menu is cached locally, so the user have to refresh the data.<br />
Simillary on webtop in option/Infor erp options there is a menu item, the first, that states 'memorize menu in cache'. If flagged, every change on menu isnt seen by the user, because is cached. Simply unflag this.</div></div><hr />

Thank you.<br />
But I checked in webtop now, and that menu item isn't there. The first entry in the Infor erp options is &quot;change company&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zardoz</div><div class="date">11th July 2012, 10:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe there in different versions of webtop there is this menu item, in other no.<br />
But try this:<br />
Position the mouse in the menu area, click the right button and choose 'Update' option in contest menu. This will refresh the menu cache.</div></div><hr />

I had tried right clicking and couldn't see anything with refresh on it. But when I right clicked on the little expand icon instead of at the name of the menu the refresh option popped up. Problem solved. :)</div></div><hr />
