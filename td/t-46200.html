After two days hard trying, I know how to add node and leaf by using DsCtree now. In the next step, I want to use image to distinguish different type of node and leaf. The program is, I don't know how to Load the image. Does it a file or  something store in BaaN(like gbf)?<br />
Do you have a sample code? please show me.<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
BTW, can the font in DsCtree be change?</div></div><hr />

It doesn't say how to load the image. It just said use image id, but I don't know how the id come from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">2nd January 2008, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sure you have looked at the 'example' in the link given by mr_suleyman.<br />
<br />
I shows how to read in the image files - the example is not for a tree, but the concept of pulling in an image file is the same.<br />
<br />
I hope you are doing this just for knowledge ... programming in this 'sub-language' of BAAN is like programming in 2.5GL (that's just my opinion)! It is very good, but you have to tell the program do each and everything in very minor details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The image id is the returned value of create.object function when it creates an object of type &quot;DsCpixmap&quot;. You can see an example in the following thread:<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=12892<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />
