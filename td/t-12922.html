Is there any way by which i can set breakpoint in source code so that the execution stops at that point ? I want this because when i am debugging reports initially i have to skip through a lot of standard codes, which is very difficult and time consuming.<br />

should be possible with the Debugger commands (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_debugger_debugger_commands) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">10th September 2003, 17:39</div></div><div class="posttext">You must first compile the report in debugger, as I think you have already done.  2 ways to set the break.  In GUI, find the line you want to stop on and double click.  This sets the break, and highlights the line number.   You can do the same in GUI or ASCII by focusing on that line and pressing 'b' &lt;return&gt;, which will also set the break point and highlight the line.<br />
<br />
One little problem in reports (and exchanges) though, as I think you also see.  When you debug, you see the standard report program, which is more complex, all around your program.  If you do search for your script, and find it, you cannot set your breakpoint on it.  I think this is because it is not part of the current source, which is really the standard program.  What you do instead is set the break point in the standard program, on the call to your section, which is in the form of a function name.  For instance, if you are trying to break on code in the detail.10, before.layout section, search for your code, and you will eventually find it in the function:<br />
<br />
r.s.detail.10.bef.lay()<br />
<br />
If you search around, you will find the call to that function, and you can place a break point on that.<br />
<br />
Edited:  ok 3 ways to set a break - in GUI there is also the break button, which you probably already saw :)</div></div><hr />

Define a variable:<br />
<br />
                long  debug<br />
<br />
in report script : debug = 1<br />
<br />
...........                debug = 2<br />
<br />
............               debug = 3<br />
<br />
in debugger trace on debug.</div></div><hr />
