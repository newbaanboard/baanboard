       Please give me detail whether we can give sessions permission during runtime. My requirement is dat I hv to run AFS for the standard session &amp; during that time only I hv to give permissions so dat AFS can run successfully.<br />
<br />
After completion of process we can withdraw permission,so dat user can't run session directly.<br />
<br />
Its urgent requirement.</div></div><hr />

As it required CRTD procedure after setting permission in session like “Maintain Session Authorizations by User/Session”.<br />
<br />
For which session you want to give permission at runtime?</div></div><hr />

Normally requirement of such kind  are peculiar and best avoided . However u still need , i think it's just one table ttaad999  where records  give permission runtime . U may test the same before using it . Have never used it this way ourself.</div></div><hr />

What we did to solve this issue was to first build our own version of the run program. This run program makes sure the session is in one of their roles - if not it does not let them run it.  This way the only way the user has to run the AFS session to do certain tasks.</div></div><hr />

If you can very clearly identify what kind of entry gets made into this table when permission is given to the session under consideration, you can insert that record programatically into the table at run time and remove it once required processing is done.<br />
<br />
Let me warn you. It is risky if you are not too sure of what you are adding / deleting. Hence, take a second opinion.</div></div><hr />
