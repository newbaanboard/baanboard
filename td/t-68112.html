<br />
Can any one share his knowledge for performing SHA-256 encryption in baan4c4.<br />
<br />
Actually my requirement is to perform SHA-256 encode , which further is converted as base 64 string.<br />
<br />
Is there any function which can be used to have SHA-256(Base 64) encode or can we use any utility to get it perform.<br />
<br />
NOTE: (utility should be accessible from AIX(IBM) Platform)<br />
<br />

<br />
For TIV higher or equal to 2000, there are inbuilt digest.* functions to do it. Other than that, you can create your own utility in any programming language to do the job for you.<br />
<br />
Here's one in Python<br />
<br />
import hashlib<br />
import random<br />
<br />
msg = 'Bhushan'<br />
new_msg = hashlib.sha256(msg.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()<br />
print(new_msg)<br />
<br />
This gives the output - <br />

<br />
This link (http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3675/how-can-i-get-a-base64-encoded-shax-on-the-cli) shows some more ways.<br />
<br />
There's also OpenSSL command line utility which does the job. Either of the solution will work. Else, you can wait for a person who has done this in AIX.</div></div><hr />

   This is example of encryption but how to do decryption for same any example you have for decryption.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SHA256 is Cryptographic(one way) hash (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function). There is no direct way to decode it. The other ways is by guessing which we call Brute-Force.<br />
<br />
The short answer is you cannot 'decrypt' a hash; it is a one way function. There is a major difference between encrypting and hashing.<br />
<br />
Hashing<br />
<br />
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function<br />
<br />
Note: It is possible to 'BREAK' certain hashing algorithms, but this is not decrypting. You'll find more information in the links as well as other algorithms that are also supported by python<br />
<br />
Encryption<br />
<br />
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption<br />
<br />
Example<br />
<br />
A useful example of hashing is storing passwords in a database whereas a useful example of encryption is sending your bank details to an online store to purchase something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there are indeed built in functions you can use! <br />
<br />
Take a look at these Baan built in functions:  base64.encode() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_base64_base64_encode) and base.64.decode() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_base64_base64_decode). <br />
<br />
For latest Information you can take a look at the latest Infor Programmers Guide.</div></div><hr />
