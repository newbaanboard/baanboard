<br />
quick question regarding reference table(mandatory). <br />
<br />
If have table B that refers to table A by primary key(cuno) both(A and B); when navigating on a session where A is the main table and on the form I have fields from table B, I would spect that while navigating on A, B will move as well and values in on form, B will be automatically fetched. Feel like why should I do on before.display read table B? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
A snapshot of the form and the attempted script can explain it. <br />
<br />
You can fetch the required values of table B in before.display. What have you tried so far?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th August 2013, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what he was saying was he should not have to do a fetch - the records should stay in sync because of the reference.  I can't answer the question because I thought it was mainly used to keep referential integrity in the tables, I just never really used these fields to link tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">18th August 2013, 08:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, sorry I didn't understood at first. .<br />
<br />
Well, yes it should work. I have done it in some cases. Say, I have a table A with 2 fields <br />
<br />
1. srno <br />
2. bpid<br />
<br />
Where srno is the primary key (Index).<br />
<br />
I have table B with 2 fields <br />
<br />
1. bpid<br />
2. nama<br />
<br />
Where bpid is the primary key (Index).<br />
<br />
In the table definition of Table A, you can define a reference of Table B for field bpid.<br />
<br />
Now, on your form with main table A, if you include the field nama, it will automatically fetch the values from Table B related to the value in Table A.</div></div><hr />

A --&gt; ( refers ) B....the best example is the purchase order  session in which the main table would be tdpur401 polines and item description.....where you have to just place tcibd001.dsca..on the form to fetch the description....( and mind you... the session should have view on the main table)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">19th August 2013, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I did as I explained in my first post and after well explained by bhushanchanda but, seems that the table B is not fetching values automatically unless I put before.display.<br />
<br />
Parent Table tccom010 :customers, refered field:cuno(primary key)<br />
Child Table tccom956 : Legal, refered field: cuno(primary key) reference table tccom010, mandatory<br />
<br />
I did convert DD for all packages just in case.<br />
<br />
Session Maintain Customers session added field tccom956.blsl. values do not change when navigating on Maintain Customers.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">19th August 2013, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, from your description I guess both the tables have similar index fields names i.e.  cuno. Is it?? Well that might be causing the problem. I will post snapshots of my definitions once I get back on my desk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">19th August 2013, 17:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Check the snapshots.<br />
<br />
I have 2 tables. Table A and Table B.<br />
<br />
Table A has primary key as srno.<br />
Table B has primary key as bpid.<br />
<br />
The reference is added in Table A for Table B.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vamsi_gujjula</div><div class="date">20th August 2013, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Carlos,<br />
<br />
i have a small query,is it that you are adding to an existing session  (i am assuming it that you are on baan iv c ) <br />
<br />
Can you check that on new session (test).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">23rd August 2013, 14:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Vamsi,<br />
<br />
Yes, the new session has no problem table B, when you navigate, fields are fetch with the refered table A. Why doesn't work the other way around?<br />
<br />
Thanks for you help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frank.finke</div><div class="date">24th August 2013, 02:36</div></div><div class="posttext">What's why the maintable of your Session must include the declaration of the reference, wich you want to use. This means: <br />
If the table B, field X has a reference declared to the primary key of table A, the session must have the table B as maintable in order to automatic fetch the data from the other table (A). <br />
For example table tdsls401.item refers to table tcibd001. In a Session tdsls4101m000 with maintable tdsls401 the data from tcibd001 will automatic fetched. But in the other case in the session tcibd0101s000 the data from tdsls401 can't be automatic fetched. Thats why the relation from tcibd001 to tdsls401 is not unique but also why the reference is not declared in tcibd001.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks to all.</div></div><hr />
