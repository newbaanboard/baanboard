<br />
I want to ask something that maybe i'm miss to do it.<br />
i create a new paper type,<br />
i add the new paper type to font by type,<br />
i add the new paper type to device.<br />
<br />
after that i didn't get any change when i'm printing a report using the new paper type.<br />
<br />
The problem is, why the new paper type report result always similary to A4 paper type.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, in this problem, i add A3 rotated paper type.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm very stress out, it's already almost one weeks and my boss always asking me T_T.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also, post the snapshots of your settings. That will help people to understand the issue more clearly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">27th June 2013, 11:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. It worked for me. What I did:-<br />
<br />
1. I went to session Paper Types (ttaad3110m000)<br />
2. Created new paper type &quot;USSTD&quot; with Orientation as &quot;Portrait&quot; &amp; Paper Size as &quot;US Std Fanfold&quot; and saved it.<br />
3. I selected the created paper type and from Menu - &gt; Specific - &gt; I went to Fonts by Paper Type (ttaad3111m000). <br />
4. I selected Font = &quot;Small&quot; and Paper Width = &quot;239&quot; and Height = &quot;63&quot; and saved it.<br />
5. I went to Device, and created New Device With Name Test_New with following properties:-<br />
<br />
Device Name:- Test_New<br />
Description:- Testing Fanfold<br />
Device Type:- Windows Printer<br />
Paper Type:- USSTD<br />
4GL Program:- ttstpconv<br />
<br />
Thats it. It gives me reports in same format. When you print a report using this device, select preview check box and check if you are getting proper output. <br />
<br />
If this doesnt work, may be you need to look your local printer settings.<br />
<br />
Snapshots are attached.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">27th June 2013, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't remember exactly but with the defined paper size bwprint tries to map this to a supported paper size for your printer.<br />
Please have a look at the helpfiles they should give you enough information.</div></div><hr />
