      What i want is for the values which are entered in the sales order to be imported into this session. I found the problem with the contact code.<br />
<br />
say the following contact code was inserted in the field : C0000017, it is saved with this value. After clicking on the import button the value of the contact code changes to C00000009. Now i close this session, the standard functionality should ask me before closing the session whether to save the record or not. First of all it doesn't do that. I confirm that by opening the same record again ... and that value is not changed... i don't understand why being a table field it is not getting saved once i close the session...<br />
<br />
maybe it's not going into the main.table.io session.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
       In the session form commands, for the form command &quot;exec.import_so&quot; can you just remove the flags &quot;Refresh Parent&quot; and &quot;Save before execution&quot;. <br />
<br />
        I hope it could solve your problem.<br />
