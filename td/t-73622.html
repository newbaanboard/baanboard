<br />
We have a requirement to send a freight label request via. API request and we will receive a Json response with the details about the freight and an embedded file (.ZPL or .PDF) for the label to be printed on our end. On success, the response status will be 200 multipart/mixed; boundary=”boundary” (where &quot;boundary&quot; is a unique value per response)<br />
<br />
We are able to handle the API request and even see the response, but we could not find a way to download the embedded label file and send it directly to a printer device for printing.<br />
<br />
I have attached a sample response that we will be receiving from our freight partner with label details. It is a multipart Json response with label details in the first part and other being the Label file.<br />
<br />
Please help us on how we could read the label file and pass it to a printer.<br />
<br />
Thankyou,<br />
Jatin Sanghi</div></div><hr />
