<br />
I am trying to create a ASCII file with the setupshown in attachment. I tried by giving the path of server as &quot;/u01/baan/ach/ACH.txt&quot; ,&quot;\\u01\baan\ach\ACH.txt&quot; , &quot;c:\ach\ACH.txt&quot;. none worked.<br />
<br />
<br />
can you tell me what could be the reason ?  I have got full authorization for file creation.<br />
<br />
any kind of quick suggestion is helpful to me.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

Of course you can write you own version of ttstpconv and run the server2client command to download the file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nansat99</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 21:40</div></div><div class="posttext">my problem is that the file is not written to server..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 21:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess what confused me was that you were putting things like c: in the example.  Since you are on solaris I would expect that you could put fileout in the path and it would create it on the baan server in your home(or default) directory.  So if you wanted to see it in the BSE tmp directory for the path you would use ${BSE}/tmp.</div></div><hr />

my home directory is &quot;u01/baan&quot; , i created another folder called ach .<br />
I tried with &quot;/u01/baan/ach/ACH.Txt&quot; .. Do i need to mention the path (while writing to server) as /u01/baan/ach/ACH.TXt  or \u01\baan\ach\ACH.txt ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nansat99</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt put a &quot;:&quot; (colon) after the arguement ASCII. that was the problem<br />
thanks mark for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th July 2006, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Must be a baan 5 thing - my ASCIF and asciifile devices do not have :'s colons after the word ascii and I know they work.  Glad you found the solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">20th July 2006, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it's not a Baan 5 thing. I run Baan 5, and never heard nor seen of such a thing. I did notice though, that in the attached word-doc the selected device is 'ASCIF', whereas the device settings Nansat attached, are those of device 'FILE'...</div></div><hr />

that was a mistake in attaching the screen shot. I tried with FILE as the device in payment method, still the file was not getting created. Once I put : after ASCII in device data , the file is created.</div></div><hr />
