<br />
the predefined variable &quot;reportgrp&quot; (look in the help under &quot;predefined variables&quot;) controls the reportgroup, which has to be opened or displayed when you click &quot;print&quot;.<br />
When you insert the second report in &quot;Maintain Reports by Session&quot; into reportgroup 2 then you can use the variable in the program script to control which reportgroup should open.<br />
<br />
Simple as long you have just one report per group and don't want the report choice window to open ... ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use brp.open() or spool.open() functions to control this. Check the help file, examples are given quite well.<br />
<br />
Also you can check the following thread :<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NvpBaaN</div><div class="date">30th November 2008, 10:59</div></div><div class="posttext">reportgrp can solve your problem, but it may pose problems since you want to print BOTH the reports under some conditions. <br />
<br />
The easier way is to use the printing commands with proper arguments.<br />
<br />
-- If you are using brp or spool commands for printing, then you can specify mode as 0 when you issue the brp.open command<br />
-- If you are using rprt_open(), then you cannot suppress the report selection window</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litrax</div><div class="date">18th November 2009, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">We often develope new reports in a copy of the original one.<br />
org. reportcode: tdsls010101000<br />
New custom reportcode: tdsls010101010<br />
<br />
The disadvantage of the brp and spool commands is:<br />
First of all you need to know at all that the reportcode is in the program script.<br />
Perhaps you stumble upon if you link the new reportcode in the session and still the old report is printed...<br />
And thats a fact if more than one programmers maintain the system!<br />
<br />
Then you need to find the code where the reportcode is placed and change it.<br />
Of course if you have e.g. more than 1 report in a group or want to print 2 reports at the same time you must use the commands in the scripts. But the other solution is easier to maintain.<br />
