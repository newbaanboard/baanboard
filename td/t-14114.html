<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dnnslbrwn</div><div class="date">8th January 2004, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Years ago I had this requirement and not only that but it had to be secure so only a few folks could do it (it was on a cheque!).<br />
<br />
What we ended doing was sending the signature out to a third party who created a new font on an HP printer font cartridge.  Don't want to get too complicated but they divided the signature into a 4 by 8 grid and assigned each square in the grid a different letter.  So we just printed ABCDEFGH in the new font (required a bit of playing in the printinf folder) and out would pop the top quarter of the signature.  Then continue on the next lines with the remaining sequences of letters for the rest of the signature.<br />
<br />
Gave the cartridge to the controler and when ever anybody needed his signature on a cheque, he would had over his cartridge for use in the printer.  When the cartridge was not it the printer, it would just default back to a standard font and the ABCDEFGH block would print instead.<br />
<br />
I am sorry but this was so long ago, that I do not remember who we used to make the font cartridge... but I am sure that google can help you.<br />
