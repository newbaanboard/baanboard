<br />
I have a problem when I try to compile a script that uses (new) &quot;tcrange&quot; domain (I created this domain before I used it). The compilation error is: &quot;Error: domain 'tcrange' not found in data dictionary&quot; and &quot;Error: possible missing declaration of table or missing program domain&quot;.<br />
<br />
I created this domain in session ttadv4100m000 (Maintain domains). Is an enumerated type , so I added the 9 possible values too. After that, I executed &quot;Convert to runtime data dictionary&quot; with the following options:  <br />
- package combination<br />
- check domains<br />
- check print errors<br />
- package<br />
No message had been showed.<br />
<br />
I tried to compile again the script after logout and login, but I got the same error.<br />
<br />
I found 3 files in the domains data dictionary folder: dtc.pd, dtc.pd.old and dtc.pd.new<br />
In .new file was my new domain, but in the standard it wasn't.<br />
Did the domain data dictionary generation process failed ? <br />
In that case, how could I identify the error source ?<br />
<br />
I tried to create another domains in differents packages, but when I put them in the script it showed the same error (but with another domain, of course).<br />
<br />
Could anyone help me, please? :o</div></div><hr />

Try running a full create runtime data dictionary, it may take longer but I think this should fix your problem.<br />

<br />
thanks for your answers!<br />
<br />
I verified that domain VRC and script VRC are the same with ttadv4401m000 (Print Current Domains for Package VRC). They are in the same VRC.<br />
<br />
I already did the steps that George7a said.<br />
<br />
I tried with Run Convert to runtime (ttadv5215m000) for all domains in package TC but the error persists. I didn't try full, is it necessary???<br />
<br />
I tried Create runtime (ttadv5210m000), and shows this message &quot;Cannot reconfigure files; domain/table definitions must still be converted to runtime dd&quot;. I executed this session with the VRC, domain and print error checked and the package.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas??? :( <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Soledad :p</div></div><hr />

Allow table to be reconfigured if necessary.  Might be better to do this with no users on the system.<br />
<br />
After you have done this - then try running the create runtime again.<br />
<br />
Hope that this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the similar problem some time back, I extended the enum definition for a domain and after that got the same problem what you are getting. I did all what you tried and it was not resolved. Finally I searched and removed the domain and table definition from the shared memory, created runtime DD for domain and then table and loaded object in the shared memory and it get resolved. <br />
I observed that some time it happen that the definition of the loaded objects in the shared memory is not get updated and/or updated objects are not get refreshed in the shared memory. It is better that remove the objects from the shared memory, update the definition, created RDD and then load them again.<br />
<br />
Best of luck<br />
