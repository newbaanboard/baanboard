Baan client is on windows 7 (BW)<br />
<br />
The session has a field called path to enter the file path - C:\Test\file.txt<br />
When in debug mode, the path has extra \ added to it for some reason - C:\\Test\\file.txt<br />
so the file can not be opened.<br />
<br />
any idea?</div></div><hr />

No problem with that. The debugger will show you &quot;\\&quot; for a single &quot;\&quot;<br />
<br />
Check if the folder and file have full permissions for &quot;Everyone&quot; and also check if the file and path exists. Post your code if possible.</div></div><hr />

seq.open.local()<br />
Syntax:<br />
#include &lt;bic_desktop&gt;<br />
<br />
function long seq.open.local  (string filename, string mode(2) [, long remove.after.use])<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
Deprecated. This function is only supported for Baan Windows and its usage is therefore deprecated. Instead you should use functions: server2client() or client2server(). <br />
<br />
This opens a specified file on the client system. It returns a file pointer, which you can use to identify the file in subsequent operations.</div></div><hr />

I think it depends on the version.  This still works for us, but we do not use it.</div></div><hr />

It depends on the version. I have used it before but always thought its better to do a client2server() first and then use seq.* functions to manipulate client files.</div></div><hr />

Then we use the client2server command to transfer it up to the server.  Not really sure why we do that, but we do.</div></div><hr />

Hi, yes I used it to verify the file exists locally. It was an issue that windows put the txt extension on the file I had named already with .txt</div></div><hr />
