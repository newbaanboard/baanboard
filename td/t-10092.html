<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tab0529</div><div class="date">20th May 2003, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I am writing a Baan V look-alike subsession (whwmd2515m100) Inentory by Item and Warehouse which is either started from Baan main session (tisfc0510m000) Estimated Materials via specifc or started as a main session.  My reason for writing this look-alike is that I have a need to pop-up a message when the user is looking at an item which has a particular code from another customized table.<br />
<br />
I do NOT have the code for either Baan session.<br />
<br />
I originally thought that when I select a particular record from the Estimated Materials session, go to specific and select Inventory by Item and Warehouse the session works including the pop-up message as required.  However, it now appears that the item which is displayed in the Inventory session is not the record from the Estimated Materials at all, but rather the last item which was viewed in the Inventory session. <br />
<br />
I have 2 questions.<br />
<br />
1.  Is there a way to tell in the program script via a variable or setting that the session was started as a subsession or a main session?<br />
<br />
2.  How do I pass the selected item from the Estimated Materials session (especially since I do not have the Baan code) so that I can immediately display the information for that record in the Inventory session?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help!<br />

<br />
You can use the predefined variable - background <br />
<br />
 long background   R<br />
 1          current session is modal<br />
 0          current session is modeless</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the answer.  Is there a specific location where the test of variable background should take place?  I put it in before.program, but background has a value of 0 no matter how I start it.  I even changed the session Start Command Type from Specific Start Command to No Start Command which I had found referrenced in an earlier thread.  <br />
<br />
My test  of background looks like that shown in the BaanERP Tools: Programmers Reference under Case 1 of the section Automatic import of variables. <br />
<br />
if background then<br />
     execute(find.data)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Most of the time I have used it in the init.group sections. here is an example-<br />
<br />
group.1:<br />
init.group:<br />
	if background then<br />
		import(&quot;zmmig100.reqid&quot;, reqid.f)<br />
		reqid.t = reqid.f<br />
		import(&quot;zmmig100.pkg&quot;, cpac.f)<br />
		cpac.t = cpac.f<br />
		import(&quot;zmmig100.ver_src&quot;, vers.f)<br />
		vers.t = vers.f<br />
		import(&quot;zmmig100.rls_src&quot;, rele.f)<br />
		rele.t = rele.f<br />
		import(&quot;zmmig100.cust_src&quot;, cust.f)<br />
		cust.t = cust.f<br />
		import(&quot;zmmig100.stat&quot;, stat.f)<br />
		stat.t = stat.f<br />
		import(&quot;zmmig100.reby&quot;, user.f)<br />
		user.t = user.f<br />
		set.mem(bdlid.f, &quot;&quot;)<br />
		set.mem(bdlid.t, &quot;z&quot;)<br />
	else<br />
		get.screen.defaults()<br />
	endif</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the code example.  However, running the program in debug mode, I find that the value for background is always 0.<br />
<br />
Is there some session setting which I am missing?<br />
<br />
If I set the session Specific Start Command to No Specific Start Command, the key to the record is always blank.  If I use Specific Start Command 44, I always get the record last viewed by the user.<br />
<br />
Is the problem in the Specific Start Command?  Any other ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
