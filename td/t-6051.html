<br />
We are in the early stages of investigating a migration from an AS400 based ERP system to the latest iBaan product running on Unix / Oracle.<br />
<br />
I am a developer who will need to x train from OS/400 and RPG to Tools, and am desperate to get hold of any documentation / manuals at this early stage to help in this process and to understand what issues we may have with this migration.<br />
<br />
Does any such documentation exist ? If so where do I look ?, can anybody help ? bearing in mind that we have not jet purchased this product.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Andy.</div></div><hr />

I also took a intro to tools training class, that taught me some of the basics.  Then I learned more from 2 tools consultants than from the training class.  These tools consultants were part of the implementation team and provided by the implementation partner.<br />
<br />
There is a library attached to this forum - have you looked through it?  It is BaanERP documentation and could be helpful.<br />
<br />
I also know that there are some Baan implementation books that are out in circulation.  Check a local library.  Our company purchased several of these for management.<br />
<br />
I have seen you on the board several times recently - only reason I noticed was the logon was all caps and made me think of snap-on tools.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.<br />
