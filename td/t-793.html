<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">15th January 2002, 23:47</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a question that has been stumping us forever.  Is there any way to turn the interactive messages/questions off in Baan while running a session or section of code?    Possibly re-route them (to a variable?  file?) or just supress them?   Take the default answer for all questions and not display messages?<br />
<br />
For example, we have been trying to get an easy method of controlling messages during ddc coding - this will not support interactive questions, and warning messages stop processing too.  Also, looking for a good method to chain sessions together without modifying the source code, but allowing for message capture.   As extra credit, we need solutions that would work prior to the c4 open architecture (boi) changes.<br />
<br />
We have thought about redefining the mess(..) function, even done that in a few places, and it works.  But, we are nervous about overwriting any correct functions that end with mess()...such as clean.up.this.mess(...).</div></div><hr />
