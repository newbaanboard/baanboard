<br />
it was in of the session of business process<br />
when this session was clicked the session did open up but with the error message &quot;line item not found&quot;<br />
the same session in some other co was being opened up without any problem that means there was no problem with database authorisation but something linked to the session in the business process while creating that businesss process.<br />
i tried to export that Business process from the co the user was able to open the session and then import that BP in the co with overwrite command in which the user was not able to open the session<br />

Something that worked for me reacted differently for users with DEM or BSP.  We recently converted from 4c3 to 4c4.  This session checked number of parameters and for some reason DEM users had 2 and I had 1.  Deleting the user defaults seemed to help solve that problem.  The only way I found this was to logon as one of the users and run the session in debug mode.<br />
