<br />
I have made customized session through &quot;generate session&quot; session. Then system made session containing two forms. Here session's performance is very good. Problem seen when i made all fields in single form and second form deleted. Now the problem is when i am finding a data using find data, it is taking too much time. Can anybody suggest what could be the problem. <br />

Is this a display session?  What you can do is regenerate the session - but do not remove form 2.  Add each field to form 1 making sure it is identical to form 2.  After each field you add run the session and use find to make sure it did not impact the session.  If it is a multi-occurence session make sure each field is set accordingly.  I have done this quite a few times without issue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th June 2014, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I can figure is that the first time something got corrupted or moved wrong from form 2 to form 1.  Causing the session to do something in the background to cause a performance hit.  The only thing related to this I have seen is sometimes saving session defaults can cause sessions some problems or to even stop working.</div></div><hr />
