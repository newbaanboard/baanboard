<br />
My first post here :)<br />
<br />
I have created a query that searches through two large tables. This takes a lot of time. <br />
<br />
Is there anyway I can increase the performance of this query? <br />
<br />
select <br />
	tfgld482.idtc, <br />
	tfgld482.leac, <br />
	tfgld482.amnt, <br />
	tfgld483.elva  <br />
from 	tfgld482, tfgld483 <br />
<br />
where <br />
	tfgld482.guid = tfgld483.guid and <br />
	tfgld482.dbcr = tfgld483.dbcr and<br />
	tfgld482.guid = tfgld483.guid and <br />
	tfgld482.idtc = '10061067' and<br />
	tfgld482.fyer = 2014 and <br />
	tfgld482.fprd = 6 and <br />
	tfgld482.dbcr = 2 and<br />
	tfgld483.elcd = '315100000000'<br />
<br />
I've searched the progguide and this forum, and my conculusion is that everybody writes query's different :) I have seen, Refers to, joins, nested querys, and where statements (witch I use in de code below). <br />
<br />
Can someone explain to me in plain english what to use in witch situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">16th July 2014, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes. The first thing you need is to use Index of the tables in your where condition. You can use refers to as well. And, if you are just picking a value from another table you can use Sub-routines i.e. functions. But, its a query so you can't use functions.<br />
<br />
So, you can try one of this:-<br />
<br />
select <br />
	tfgld482.idtc, <br />
	tfgld482.leac, <br />
	tfgld482.amnt, <br />
	tfgld483.elva  <br />
from 	tfgld482, tfgld483 <br />
<br />
where <br />
	tfgld482._index1  = {tfgld483.guid,tfgld483.dbcr} and<br />
	tfgld482.idtc = '10061067' and<br />
	tfgld482.fyer = 2014 and <br />
	tfgld482.fprd = 6 and <br />
	tfgld482.dbcr = 2 and<br />
	tfgld483.elcd = '315100000000'<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
select <br />
	tfgld482.idtc, <br />
	tfgld482.leac, <br />
	tfgld482.amnt, <br />
	tfgld483.elva  <br />
from 	tfgld482, tfgld483 <br />
<br />
where <br />
	tfgld482._index1 refers to tfgld483 and<br />
	tfgld482.idtc = '10061067' and<br />
	tfgld482.fyer = 2014 and <br />
	tfgld482.fprd = 6 and <br />
	tfgld482.dbcr = 2 and<br />
	tfgld483.elcd = '315100000000'</div></div><hr />

The strangest thing happened. The query finished in about 2 seconds. I was expecting that it would run for an hour, maybe more. <br />
<br />
tfgld482 has almost 12 million rows, and tfgld843 has over 60.000 rows. <br />
The result of the query was only one row. This has to be more, in our opinion. <br />
<br />
Can someone explain what went wrong? <br />
<br />
I analyzed the query, multiple times, but I donâ€™t see anything that could go wrong. Only thing I am not  100% sure of if there really is a relation between tfgld482 and tfgld483.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is no relation from tfgld483 to tfgld482 over index in table definition.<br />
<br />
Try to use the relation via fields tfgld482.guid - tfgld483.guid<br />
                                               tfgld482.dbcr - tfgld483.dbcr<br />

At least they have to use one. What I would do for the above query is break it down to see what slows it up.  I recommend using indexes as mentioned.  Since from the query above I do not really see a link between the tables I would break it up.<br />

Select	tfgld483.*<br />

We do not have these tables so it based off speculation.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply! <br />
<br />
If there is no relationship, odds are that the .guid is'nt the same for both tables. Maybe that is why I only get one record. <br />
<br />
tfgld483.elcd does not exists in our db.  <br />
<br />
Can some one tell me if there is a different relation between both tables? Maybe through another extra table?</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
attached the Tabledef and a record from both tables.<br />
<br />
It's a 1:1 relation between the both tables (guid , dbcr), but not with index !<br />
<br />
guid is a GenericUniqueID generatet by LN !<br />
<br />
Hope this Information helps a Little bit !<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">roylansink</div><div class="date">12th August 2014, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you guys for your responses. What ever I tried, I only got one row as result. <br />
<br />
With a colleague I looked further and viewed the data in ERP LN. After viewing the data, the viewed data appeared as results in my query. Strange huh. <br />
<br />
As I can view the data, there must be a relation between them. Maybe ERP LN does something with the data when joining (trimming spaces for example, but this not the case) or it uses a different multi-table relation to show the required data.</div></div><hr />
