Does anybody has a sample code where in a maintain session of course with a main table, when in modify mode, I would like to go and update another record within that same main table. I tried with on.main.table() but the commit and db.retry.point() seems to stop me. The on.main.table() seems to be good when reading another record but not when trying to update another record.</div></div><hr />

It depends on wich event are you programming this update.<br />
I'm not sure if on.main.table is needed if you are not wirting in the main table, but you can use db.retry.point and commit.transaction in 'after.update.db.commit' event, for example. <br />
You can use also main.table.io events or after.save.object method in DAL (if baan V), without db.retry.point and commit.transaction functions.<br />

So, you can use on.main.table for UI events, but if you decide to use DAL 'after.save.object()' method, you will have to use 'with.object.set.do()' function.</div></div><hr />

Well all you should really have to do is find and update the record. I believe the commit and retry will be handled by the maintain session.  At least when I update other tables in on.main.table I do not include the commit and retry point commands.  The problem I see is after the update, you need to go back to the original record - for display purposes.  I guess that would depend on what you really needed.</div></div><hr />
