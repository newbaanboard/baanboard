The FLOAT data type can accept numbers within a certain range of exponents. The maximum and minimum exponent values are different depending on the host operating system (the range is the same as that supported by the C compiler for double values in this host system). In the current statement, a constant number is being converted for storage in a FLOAT variable or column, and the exponent is too large or too small.  <br />
