<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">heidihunter</div><div class="date">4th September 2003, 13:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I am adding sessions to the Special menu of tssma2520m000 Display Contracts. One of these is tssma2582m000 Display Installations by Contract, which I would like to have jump as directly as possible to the results for the contact highlighted in tssma2520m000. I tried changing the start option for tssma2582m000 to def.find to start the session with the find dialog, but I get some strange behavior. When I run it from the Special menu of tssma2520m000 the contract number appears in the Find dialog as I hoped, but on continuing the session does not filter the results but simply displays the list of all installations. However, when running tssma2582m000 independently, it works fine. What could cause this behavior?<br />

<br />
In this case, you can restrict the session &quot;tssma2582m000&quot; display of records by using query extension to the underlying main table to the desired contract numbers...(the ones from previous display session (&quot;tssma2520m000&quot;)...<br />
<br />
There are already lot of threads on query extensions available in the site. You can use the search engine to find that out...for quicker help on query extensions, you can view the help links.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
