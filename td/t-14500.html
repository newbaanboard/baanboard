 <br />
you have to open the report by yourself. Create a report an connect it to the session. enter the following code in the choice section.<br />
<br />
the following code will do so:<br />
<br />
<br />
#include &quot;itccom0010&quot;<br />
<br />
choice.cont.process:<br />
before.choice:<br />
spool.device = &quot;D&quot; |maybe D66 as defined on your system<br />
open.mode = 0<br />
<br />
on.choice:<br />
if open.report(1,spool.device, open.mode, language$,1)<br />
... do your things<br />
else<br />
choice.again()<br />
endif<br />
<br />

1. Created one display session.<br />
2. In that i added the tipcs2451m000 report to the display session.<br />

<br />
you need to enter the code in the script. if you do not have the standard script, you can generate your own display session. the code can then be entered in the script.<br />
of course, you have to programm all the stuff, which is also in the script tipcs2451.<br />
I think the best way would be to get the source.....<br />

any body help me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th February 2004, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">One way to do this is to create a news session.  Use the form from tipcs2451m000.  In the script for this new session what you do is call the tipcs2451m000 using the stpapi commands as described in the AFS forum. And in the new session  the user will not get to select a print device.  You can hard code it to always send the report to the display.  <br />
