<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th September 2007, 23:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a maintain session for a table.  I want the user to be able to hit the save button on the form and have some actions take place - even if they did not change any of the table fields.  So for example - if they start the session and on the first record that comes up they hit the save key, I want to ask them if they want all orders GRP set that way.  Then it calls a routine to adjust the price on all the GRP purchase orders.  So I would like to force this through the save key (for some reason they might change a price and then two days later decide to change all GRP purchase orders to that price).  So far I have not found a method to force the save.  The session is a little more complicated than just the price.  I know I could add a button, but I would like to force a save on the table.</div></div><hr />

How about executing choice(uopdate.db) and you can force the change on any events. I think forcing choice is a better way to do it.<br />

<br />
I tried to mess with the predefined variable &quot;update.status&quot; but I got some BW errors about &quot;g.itab index 0 out of dims&quot;. However, I am thinking instead of trying to hack into those undocumented variables, maybe you can programmatically change any field's value and return it back to it's original value, then the save button will work since a field was &quot;modified&quot;.<br />

The problem is that there were not any events on the session so nothing is activated to call execute(update.db).  Remember they might start the session and click on save.  So I do not even think George's method will work, but I am going to look closer at this.  I think I might have to try something else for them.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions.</div></div><hr />

But as I mentioned before, I got the errors...<br />
<br />
I think there is another variable that should contain if any field was modified or not (other than attr.changed)...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th September 2007, 20:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I was able to modify update.status without an error, but it did not work.  <br />
<br />
Here is a little more background on the session.  The user wanted a version of maintain grp purchase orders driven by pegging.  That way they can then release a purchase order for only 1 project on the distribution list.  Then attached to my session they wanted a button to launch a new maintain grp purchase orders.  In this session they wanted the ability to modify for (all GRP purchase orders) the supplier and price information.  So since I do not own source I cloned everything into a new session.  So basically each of the form fields have a section like this:<br />
<br />
field.tipgc520.amnt:<br />
before.input:<br />
	if tipgc520.pric &lt;&gt; 0.0 then				<br />
		attr.input = false<br />
	endif<br />
	<br />
when.field.changes:<br />
	if update_grp_order_field(&quot;tipgc520.amnt&quot;, str$(tipgc520.amnt)) then<br />
		refresh.curr.occ()<br />
		input.again()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
This runs tipgc5120m000 in the background and updates the fields. The major difference between my session and the baan session is - when they click on save it asks if they want to update all grp orders for that part number. I think I get away with telling them they have to change a field in order to be prompted for the question.  As it is I have a couple of other little bugs to work out.  But I am going to try a couple of options on this to see if I get a work around - but first I have to fix some of the stpapi code (one field does not update).</div></div><hr />

Arvind<br />
(1) Once they make a change I do not have to execute(update.db), the save function works as I expect.<br />
(2) If they do not make a change, and then they push the save button there is not any event which is getting executed - so there is no place to execute(update.db).  Baan code is smart enough to know if it needs to update the database. Below is what I do in the main.table.io.<br />
<br />
before.rewrite:<br />
	refresh.curr.occ()<br />
	if ask.grpitem then<br />
		update.groupitem = ask.enum(&quot;tipgc50002.b&quot;, empty, tipgc520.item )<br />
		if update.groupitem = tcyesno.yes then<br />
			update.group.item() | Function server code to update group item<br />
		endif<br />
		update.allgrps = ask.enum(&quot;tiudi00001&quot;, empty )<br />
		if update.allgrps = tcyesno.yes then<br />
			update.all.grps()  | Function server to find all grp purchase orders and change the price.<br />
		endif<br />
		ask.grpitem = false<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
If you notice the first thing I do on the event is refresh.current.occ() - basically I force it to re-read the record, which clears the update lock.  I do this because when you change the price on my session it calls a function server to update the field.  This means the record changed in the back ground and not through my session.  This prevents the &quot;record modified by another user&quot; error.  Seems kind of weird, but since I don't have source I prefer to use the session in API mode.  <br />
<br />
I have since decided that the user will have to change the price in order to update all the orders to the same price.  I might give them a button, but I have not heard back yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">20th September 2007, 08:25</div></div><div class="posttext">When user marks a reccord , change a value of a main.table field and reset back in do.occ function for actual.occ , execute update.occ() in do.occ , standard program will change the value of update status on this and ur save button will work and ur main.table.io sections will get triggered.<br />
<br />
If user does not mark a record , I dont c a way making update.status true . If 1st record is what u wish to update always , u may write do.occ function in after display of a field and do as aforesaid , probably it may work .</div></div><hr />
