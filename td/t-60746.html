<br />
When I run a session ehich calls this dll, I get a fatal error &quot;Dynamic link faulure&quot; followed by the actual function.  Depending on the session I use, there could be various functions it fails on.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what may be causing this to occur</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is usually caused by the wrong number of expected funtions parameters and is probably means that you have used a wrong script version to implement your changes. It is normal that the number of parameters change or even new functions are added by each new release or even by some new solutions.</div></div><hr />

It is also possible if variables names clashes in DLL, like external variables in DLL and script have same name but different data type</div></div><hr />

What I usually do in such case is try to the test the quality of the programming of DLL's.<br />
<br />
For instance, when you have an issue with tcibddll0001, on the ERP server (needed to run the program in the right context) set the USER=bsp (or USER=baan) variabele (to use package combination to get the right package-VRC / components).<br />
<br />
Then use the ${BSE}/bin/bic_info portingset program:export USER=bsp<br />
${BSE}/bin/bic_info otcibddll0001 -a -qo tcibddll0001.txtIf you are lucky you can find DLL Usage and Function Usage information which explains you what arguments are expected and what they do.</div></div><hr />
