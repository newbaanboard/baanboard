<br />
I need to incorporate a functionality where the user out of 15 occurances will select any number of records ie 5  and do some procedure, update for each record. I.e. I need to get the value of records for all occurences.<br />
<br />
When I try to get the value of marked occurences it only gives value of the first record marked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
use something like the following<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
function select.marked.occs()<br />
{<br />
    long occ.no<br />
<br />
    for occ.no = 1 to filled.occ   |filled.occ is a predefined variable!<br />
          if mark.table(occ.no) then<br />
                  do.occ.without.update(occ.no, do.something)<br />
          endif<br />
    endfor<br />
}<br />
<br />
function  do.something()<br />
{<br />
      |here you have access to the field values of the <br />
      |marked occurence!<br />
       ....<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
You can also use  the function do.occ() which lock the occurence for the duration of the call to our &quot;do.something()&quot;-function above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">19th October 2005, 23:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to customize the Enter Hours Acctg session.  Since we have no code I simply copied the form and I'm trying to put some code to it.  I basically just want to be able to enter records into tihra100 that the Standard session will not allow ie, machine hours on a task that is of non-machine type.<br />
<br />
So I bring up my form and the employee already has records for the given day.  I click the insert button and I have a choice.add.set: before.choice: to go and get the next dsrn value to put in that first field of the next occurrence.  First it is displaying it in the first occurrence.  Also, how do I get the correct next dsrn value?  This is the code I have so far but I know it's incorrect - I'm not sure what to put in my where clause for the values I'm looking for, the BOLD fields, can't select on itself can you?<br />
<br />
select MAX(tihra100.dsrn)<br />
	from tihra100<br />
        where tihra100.emno = tihra100.emno  and<br />
              tihra100.week = tihra100.week  and<br />
              tihra100.dayn = tihra100.dayn  and<br />
              tihra100.year = tihra100.year<br />
        selectdo<br />
	dyserno =  tihra100.dsrn + 1<br />
<br />
any ideas??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">19th October 2005, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to put colons in front of each bolded field.  If you don't, you are basically saying &quot;where true&quot;.  Using the colon makes it use the current field values as fixed values.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tnzabo</div><div class="date">20th October 2005, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, thanks - I did have the colons in before and took them out for some unknown reason.  Do you have any idea on my other question about puttin that next dsern and displaying in the correct occurrence on my form?<br />
