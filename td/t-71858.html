<br />
I have a question about BW Print. I am trying to send a print job to a printer installed on a client PC. Configured Baan device as Device Type Windows printer and defined Device Queue like \\localcomputername\sharedclientprinter<br />
Shared the locally (on PC) installed printer<br />
<br />
Sending a print job to a specific computer works but I would like to make this configuration generic. Unfortunately I cannot install this printer on a Windows print server. Is there a variable in BW Print for local client PC like in Windows %COMPUTERNAME%? Tried to use \\%COMPUTERNAME%\sharedclientprinter but BW Print gives back error \\%COMPUTERNAME%\sharedclientprinter not found ....<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

Are the printers you are trying to sent the reports to the default printers on the client?  Seems to me there is way to do that.  I will look around - we did not use windows printing, but I think we set one up like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th April 2019, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">What I found was a device named Windows, device type of Windows Printer and a paper type of window, with page length of 50.  Everything else was empty.</div></div><hr />

You can also use the local Printer Name in the field where you've entered \\localcomputername\sharedclientprinter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bertwinters</div><div class="date">10th April 2019, 08:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your quick reply. <br />
The printer is not the default printer and cannot be set as the default printer. This printer really is a special printer for which software is installed on the local computer. Printing to this printer results in starting the application ImageQuest from which the Baan report is scanned with OCR and automatically archived on the ImageQuest server so content can be easily accessed in future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">10th April 2019, 10:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Then I would try using the name of the local printer, not the sharing name. It used to work, but I haven't used it for some years. It may be worth trying.<br />
<br />
In the field where you've entered the printers sharing name \\localcomputername\sharedclientprinter enter the name of the printer on the client.<br />
<br />
This will work on every pc if the local driver is installed with the same name.<br />
<br />
Tested it: I used my local printer &quot;PDF24 PDF&quot;, thus typed PDF24 PDF instead of printer sharing name (the name of the local printer). It did open the PDF24 tool, when printing to it from LN. It did work on two PCs (PDF24 is installed remotely on every PC with the same local printer name &quot;PDF24 PDF&quot;). I did test on LN 10.2.1, but I do remember it from BaanIV C4 times. I think it worked on Baan5, too.</div></div><hr />

Probably thinking to complex :) Thank you for your help very happy with such an easy solution!!</div></div><hr />
