<br />
Before posting this post I did some home work and searched topic related to my doubt , but couldn't get the exact solution for which i was looking for.<br />
<br />
My requirement is I have a Maintain session (form Type 1), there r 4 fields on this Order Entry form i.e. tdabc0110m000, and also 1 button on form i.e. Post Lines gainst Order, now when the user clicks on button it activates another sub - session which is Maintain Session ( Form Type 3 ) i.e. 0111s000 in which he is able to post Items and their respective qty to be ordered, price etc.<br />
<br />
Now i have done total for Price field for all the items entered in this sub-session and passed the value back to Main session , but this value doesn't get displayed on the first session on the form, since the 1st session doesn't get refreshed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where should i write event to refresh my Main session screen and what event/function it would be ???<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Well i don't have any zoom fields on these forms....<br />
<br />
i think i am still not able to clear the situation, here is a little more explanation<br />
<br />
I have 2 sessions<br />
<br />
1st session is Main session which has 1 button<br />
when we click this button we open 2nd session which is a sub - session , user enters some items and prices, now he closes the sub-session, goes back to his main session, i want now the values of 2nd session i.e. sub-session should come on first session display fiedl.<br />

<br />
according to me u said tht u have two session one is main session into tht u have one button and by clicking on this button you open another session which is know as ur subsession in ur dev. in ur subsession u enter some of calculated values <br />
ok<br />
but u did not tell is ur field is a variable or a table field i fell it should be a variable<br />
then u also not told wht is ur main session field is it a variable or table field <br />
if it is a table field the u can transfer ur subsession field value to main session field in ur subsession.<br />
<br />
Clearly specify all above things<br />

Thus it is not fired from a field!<br />
<br />
learner, the code you use must be something like:<br />
choice.user.x: |where x is a number in range 0..9<br />
on.choice:<br />
  zoom.to$(...)<br />
  execute(first.set) | or execute(find.data)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just add the execute statement, that should do the trick!<br />
<br />
lbencic, the refresh() unfortunately has nothing to do with the database.  It just copies the screen fields as being held by the bshell to the user interface, without the bshell actually refreshing the data from the database.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See whatever table field or variable you are having just export it from your subsession &amp; import it into main session on after.choice event on your main session &amp; assign this value to any table field or variable. <br />
<br />
Only problem is that while I trying to refresh this screen (i.e. after updating value to a perticular field it is not refreshing) so when I to next or previous record and again comes back to that record then the updated values is getting displayed. So I request baaner to suggest on this.<br />

<br />
Well as Mohan u rightly pointed out <br />
<br />
See whatever table field or variable you are having just export it from your subsession &amp; import it into main session on after.choice event on your main session  &amp; assign this value to any table field or variable.  <br />
<br />
Well the text  in bold i couldn't understand , yaah on both the sessions these r my table fields, passing it to the Main session is also not a problem for me , only problem is when my user closes the sub-sessions, i will export this price value back into my Main session , but this doesn't refreshes.<br />
<br />
what i was thinking was there must be a event which tells which session became current. Currently when my user clicks on Button on Main session , i am calling function activiate() and executing sub-session.<br />
<br />
anyway i will first use this function  ..void refresh.curr.occ() and in case of difficuilty, i will revert back accordingly.<br />
<br />

It seems to be more stable in the BaanIV environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">13th September 2003, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand u have header - lines session and a field in the header session is sum total of  value in the lines session . <br />
<br />
Here is what you should do.<br />
<br />
1. As Nico told use zoom.to$ instead of activate.<br />
2. You should not import the value in parent / header session . Import will try to import the value from the parent of parent which is wrong . Export in child/lines session will export value to it's parent which is correct.<br />
2. refresh.curr.occ() will refresh values existing in database and not the values calculated in other session and exported from other session. So your could look like <br />
<br />
choice.user.0:<br />
on.choice:<br />
	zoom.to$(&quot;lines session&quot;,....) <br />
	| In lines session export the calculated value to the table field of header/parent session<br />
	do.all.occ(update.calc.value)<br />
	execute(update.db)<br />
	exxecute(find.data)<br />
<br />
function update.calc.value()<br />
{<br />
	update.occ()<br />
}<br />
<br />
Please gimme feedback on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">learner</div><div class="date">13th September 2003, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
Yes as u sugessted i tried the same piece of code, i removed the activate() and instead of that inserted zoom.to$<br />
<br />
but the problem is that as soon as the zoom session opens up i.e. sub-sessions opens up this piece of code also executes up...........<br />
<br />
<br />
do.all.occ(update.calc.value)<br />
execute(update.db)<br />
execute(find.data)<br />
<br />
function update.calc.value()<br />
{<br />
update.occ()<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
So if we see the sequence<br />
<br />
user starts inserting or starts modifying the values in the sub - session later on ............ so when he closes back the sub-session the values r not reflected on the main session table field on the form..... then i have to press CTRL + R to refresh Main session form, so that the new values r shown on the form.<br />
<br />
Currently this is the sequence in which it is operating<br />
<br />
a)user clicks on button available on Main session to open sub-session<br />
b)inside click i have written zoom.to$ which opens up sub-session.<br />
c)before he actually modifies / insert any records in sub-session , the below piece of code executed<br />
<br />
<br />
do.all.occ(update.calc.value)<br />
execute(update.db)<br />
execute(find.data)<br />
<br />
function update.calc.value()<br />
{<br />
update.occ()<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
and then when he starts typeing in sub-session the changes r not reflected back.<br />
<br />
One more thing I have exported the total Price of all the Item from the sub-session in after.end.program section<br />
<br />
Now please let me know ehere am i doing mistake ???<br />
<br />
I remember when i use to do coding in vb , i could tell up which form became current with the form name, although the concept of form/ MDI form is little bit diff. with what we see in BaaN.<br />
<br />
Please guide me how can i proceed further.....<br />
<br />
In case u have some session already with u which shows this sort of functionality, can u share that session with me............. because i think i am doing a mistake somewhere or may be there is something missing which i am finding difficuilt to trace.<br />

<br />
you are going right don't expect that board will give you line by line code everytime. you are technically sound then just think of little bit &amp; try to solve it at your end. <br />
<br />
anyway  here I did the same functionality as they way you want.<br />
here are summarised steps.<br />
<br />
1.  on choice of your form button - <br />
                zoom.to$(&quot;session code&quot;) | calling lines session<br />
2.  do calculation or updation whatever you want in this lines<br />
     session.<br />
3.  then in after.choice of your button on main get the updated <br />
    value from your lines table &amp; post it to your main session field <br />
    &amp; do refresh.curr.occ()<br />
     you can do this step in after.rewrite of your lines session.<br />
     you cannot do this in after.program section as mentioned by <br />
     you coz. when users quits the session by clicking [X] button of <br />
     form then this session will not run. <br />
<br />
this is what i did. <br />
<br />
Hope you are cleared up.<br />
post feedback if you are still facing problem.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">15th September 2003, 09:09</div></div><div class="posttext">As  Mohan  pointed out ,  the same can be done in many ways.<br />
<br />
As I understand u write something after.choice section end.program . For end.program , there is no after choice for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
When u press CTRL + R , the value gets refreshed . This means u r  updating table field in subsession only.In that case, all you need is just write execute(find.data) in the code(which does the same thing). In this case, export of value is not needed.<br />
<br />
When you do the zoom.to$ , program should wait for zoomed session to return . This does not happen in you case . You may check the value of zoom type in ttadv2100m000 for the zoom session. It should be a subsession with modal child dialog .</div></div><hr />
