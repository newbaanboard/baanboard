<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marlowe</div><div class="date">17th June 2002, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">The domain tcitem on our system (v4c2) has been set to right aligned. Apparently this was set when the system was first set up. To ensure compatibility with other systems, and to make it easier for users to search using part of a key, we are looking at changing the alignment to left aligned. This appears to be a relatively straight forward change. Before we proceed, are there any other factors that we need to consider?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">18th June 2002, 08:41</div></div><div class="posttext">remember that it will rebuild all tables that have a field with domain tcitem. That could take some hours.<br />
Furthermore check if you don't have stored items in own tables and check the domain definition of that table.<br />
<br />
At last did you do any customisations? Check the code.<br />
<br />
I also want to strongly recommend a test in a test environment and a check of your procedures before doing this in your life environement.</div></div><hr />
