<br />
Im not a tools specialist.<br />
But want to ask about this issue, please forgive if theres any wrong terms of explanation .<br />
<br />
I create Sales Order line (tdsls4101m000) , input an item code then zoom in field effectivity unit (tdsls401.effn) its not directed us to selected item code in session tcuef0502m000.<br />
<br />
Then i compare it when i create wh order line from session whinh2110m000 , input an item code then zoom in field effectivity unit (whinh210.effn) its direct us to selected item code in session tcuef0502m000.<br />
<br />
what is the different between 2 session?<br />
<br />
I want to make the same for Sales Order Session, because when theres so many SO Line, its gonna be a big problem if we have to search manually the effectivity unit  for each line.<br />
<br />
Any one can give some solution to fix this?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Rgrds<br />

So in tdsls4101m000 it needs to set the correct item or zoom field that tcuef0502m000 uses to find the item.  Since this is infor session you might need source code to fix it.  Or maybe an LN expert knows an easier fix.</div></div><hr />

If you have source code it could be fixed.  We have been using 4c4 since 1999 and even today we still have to fix a session on occasion.</div></div><hr />
