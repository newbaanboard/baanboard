<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ken bohnenkamp</div><div class="date">18th February 2004, 15:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a type 3 form (multiple occurrances). When I finish adding the record on the first occurrance and move to the second occurrance I would like to update the record at that time. Right now, I have to fill all occurrances or hit the save button to save the record. I believe I want to use the execute(update.db) function, but I am not sure where I need to put it in my program. Can anyone help?</div></div><hr />

The reason for this was that I needed  to generate a running serial number which works perfectly in all kinds of scenario.<br />
<br />
If you also have the same requirement then I would suggest you use on.main.table and do.all.occ function to accomplish this task.<br />

Good luck.</div></div><hr />
