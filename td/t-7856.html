1) Make a file &lt;&gt; 0 bytes with the name $BSE/application/tdB40U_c4_stnd/ptdpur/ppur41010<br />
- (or your place for updates)<br />
- (add the p for program script, add the 0 for variant 0 = original)<br />
2) Install a solution containing the program source, this will overwrite the dummy script.</div></div><hr />

could you explain the need for the first step?  I've applied patches that have included source and the source found it's way to the patch PVRC without creating a dummy file first.  Is this not always the case?<br />

I do not use PMC and I can &quot;see&quot; the source for all installed solutions (I do not have the original sources)</div></div><hr />

That answers my earlier question... the source that is currently on our system must be from solution installs prior to pmc.  Now I understand the need for the dummy file.<br />

One time I created p files for all of my o files, but still I have a lot of objects where I still have the old dummy script...<br />
<br />
I am not good in scripting, but it is possible to write a script telling what o-files with a similar code as the p-files that have a specific file size (because it is the same dummy script, in my case 252 bytes) are on the system where the date of the o-file is later than the date of the p-file...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once more for my understanding:<br />
<br />
During installation of a SP or solution, Baan updates a lot of &quot;o-files&quot; (objects). But threre are also a lot of this &quot;dummy-scripts&quot; untouched. According to a normal behaviour, source files (our dummy scripts) in the update VRC should be replaced in case, if the related object is also replaced. But this, obviously don't happen all the time.<br />

But this, obviously don't happen all the time.In case the object has to be rebuild because a function (include) is modified, the objects may be delivered without a new program script. In those cases the include files should be delivered (and (dummy) scripts there should be overwritten with newer versions).<br />
<br />
It may well be that Baan decided to make installation of souces conditional... (developers license y/n) that I do not know.</div></div><hr />
