<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">25th February 2003, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes there is a way to code that functionality.  You can use the ottdllbw dll.  There is a function called client2server.<br />
<br />
You can get the usage information from a dll by running bic_info6.1 -eu against a particular dll.  This will list the functions and any usage information that BaaN developers decided to include.<br />
<br />
If you happen to have source code check out how Baan handles the click button event for the drawing button off of Maintain Item Data or any other session with the drawing button.<br />
<br />
You do not need source code in order to use dll's.<br />

Just keep in mind that underneath it does perform an FTP, and any FTP restrictions you have on your users would apply.</div></div><hr />
