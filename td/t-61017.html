<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">19th August 2011, 19:58</div></div><div class="posttext">While it's difficult to tell exact procedure how the sql query is processed by db driver , one can imagine how it would be processing based on the syntax of baan sqls ,  syntax of underlying db and the features of baan db driver. While converting baan sql to db sql , db driver takes care of performance cost optimisations , company numbers , hints , joins , unions , pattern matching conditions etc. Best guide could be baan's manual of baan sql syntax and baan db driver in this regard.</div></div><hr />

But just wanted to know how order by &lt;index name&gt; can improve query performance in baan?<br />
As it wont help in filtering of records!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. Every time you use an order by index the db driver forces the db to use it also for the selection, so, by example, if the better 'search' is by index1 (and you imagine that this lead to a fast index search) and you must also order by index2 this can lead to an implicit full table scan you can be unaware.<br />
Almost this happens in BaanIV and Oracle. In LN you can use the HINT statement to force the use of appropriate index instead.</div></div><hr />
