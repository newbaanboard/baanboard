<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th February 2004, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are just talking about the length of one data field on the report then this should be easy. First copy the report to your test vrc. Then edit the layouts in question.  If necessary resize the layout.  Then just play with the headings and layouts until you get what you want.  Not really a big deal.  So if you are looking at like item desciption and the report only prints 20 out of 30 characters then just play around until you get what you want. Hope this is what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
BUT if you are talking about changing a domain to a larger size then that is a big deal.  Lots to worry about then.  <br />

Use maintain reports (ttadv3130m000) to first copy the report to your dev vrc.  Then you click on special maintain all layouts - just to keep things simple.  Find the layout with the field in it, click on the field.  Then click on form and resize window - you may not need to do this, but I expect you will.  Next move all the fields over far enought to allow the your field to grow.  Next  double click on the field in question and either click on link with domain or change the print format. Click save and exit on the field. Click save and exit on the maintain layouts.  Then compile it.<br />
<br />
Was not really sure what you were looking for so I went through some basics.  So if it was to much detail do not be offended.  It may be that you just needed to know the &quot;click on link to domain&quot; or the &quot;change the print format&quot;.  Just trying to cover all possibilities in one post. :)<br />

The full information on this field will be printed.<br />
Be sure, you have enough space behind the field that schold be longer.<br />
