<br />
I have a report in LN that prints delivery lines for a sales order. However, in many cases due to the nature of how our scanning system ties into LN we have delivery lines that have the same sales order number, position number, and sequence number for many records. The report is already sorted to have these records ordered by order number, position number, sequence number.<br />
<br />
I want to roll up the quantities delivered on these lines based on all 3 of those values changing. Sales order number, position number, sequence number. I know how to do aggregates on a column when the column itself changes, but how do I do it based on whether or not multiple other columns' values have changed instead? Is that even doable?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use a string variable say x. Now, concatenate, all the required field values and store it into x. Now, use <br />
<br />
<br />
on.change.check(x)<br />
selection of data...<br />
if changed(x) then<br />
    print.record...<br />
endif <br />
<br />
So, it's doable, just need to tweak your code to make it happen.</div></div><hr />
