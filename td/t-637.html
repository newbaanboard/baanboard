<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">15th December 2001, 01:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Since there was mention of another editor, I would like to tell you that I have been using the subject editor for baan development for many years.<br />
<br />
The new version of the editor does all that you would expect,  for example<br />
<br />
color matching.<br />
auto indenting and outdenting<br />
templates for easy code writing<br />
begin end matching if/endif, while/endwhile, select with endselect, on case....  &quot;{&quot; with &quot;}&quot; etc....<br />
It even correctly handles matching of nested code.<br />
<br />
They have baan support as a language. The standard editor includes support for a dozen other languages as well.<br />
<br />
Extras include a  programming language with macro processor to extend functionality<br />
<br />
Interface to many source code packages.<br />
Up to infinite undo (You set the level)<br />
<br />
It is a legacy code type of product (very very very clean and error free).<br />
<br />
Go to <br />
www.multiedit.com<br />
for more information<br />
<br />
Leslie<br />
PS. I am only a very satisfied end-user.</div></div><hr />

I have been looking at MultiEdit, but can see no mention of BaaN.<br />
<br />
How does this work with BaaN?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">22nd January 2002, 05:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Multi-edit authors wrote the baan interface. I have a copy and am happy to share the baan.s* files with anyone. I can also share the multi-edit.cfg file that has all the keywords (to baan 5.2) included. That allows for coloring keywords, etc.<br />
<br />
There are also templates.<br />
<br />
So just send me an email.</div></div><hr />
