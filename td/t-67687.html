<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">30th April 2015, 18:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I am being challenged to send email messages from Order entry process given certain conditions.<br />
<br />
I am running in windows / sql which is new for me.<br />
<br />
I wrote vbs script on Baan server.  I created bat files also on baan server which are called within baan script - tdsls4102.<br />
<br />
This worked while in development but now that I have turned it on, sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work.  Seems to be related to user but yesterday, I sat with my system administrator and he confirmed that all users have read and execute privileges in the appropriate directories.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if there are any permissions within baan application that gives permission to the run.prog().<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />

You can try using sql script having sqlmail command instead of a VB Script. Though, what is the email code you are using? Is it using any external application to send emails?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">30th April 2015, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">The vbs code I wrote is attached.<br />
<br />
Since this works for me, I'd rather solve why it is not working for the general user population.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you can try is, if you are to reproduce the problem, you can try to redirect the output to a text file and check if its a permission issue or not.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
run.prog  (&quot;bat_file_name&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;, RP_NOWAIT,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;C:\temp\err.txt&quot;)<br />
<br />
Also, is your SMTP server same as Baan server? If yes, you can try using localhost instead of server name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">30th April 2015, 20:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Email is on same network, different server.  I'll try the error.txt.  Thank you, I was not aware of additional parameters in run.prog()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">1st May 2015, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Update on this, on test server the output in error.txt states<br />
<br />
&quot;The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what this means and I'm not certain it applies to our live environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">1st May 2015, 18:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Are you writing any file and sending it as an attachment? <br />
<br />
Can you try using suspend(1000) right after your run.prog() to make sure the email is sent successfully before starting another instance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">1st May 2015, 21:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Update on this:<br />
<br />
I could use RP_WAIT instead of RP_NOWAIT.  I'll try this.<br />
<br />
I am not sending files, arguments into bat file which are subsequently sent into vbs-script.<br />
<br />
Just received emails from the application in production.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />
