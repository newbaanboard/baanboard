<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">19th May 2005, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I have created a print/update session that is activated from a main session. In the main session I dont have source code so I added my customized session to start by adding it to the choice field in my main session form.<br />
<br />
How can I get my session to continue once the main session is completed.<br />
Currently it completes the main session activity, then my session appears for the user to select continue. I want to bypass the contiue option and just have it activate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 01:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I did something like this once.  Not sure if it will work for you:<br />
<br />
form.1:<br />
init.form:<br />
  if background then<br />
     execute(cont.process)<br />
  endif<br />
<br />
<br />
In my case I knew when I zoomed to(or activated) the session I would be executing the code based on some import parameters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 14:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if I was real clear.  This code would go into your custom session.  I think(but am not positive) that background will be true when your session is activated.  At that point this session would then execute the continue process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">That worked.<br />
Is there a way not to have my form display?<br />
I tried to remove my form, but I get an error that the form is missing.<br />
<br />
I actually want to remove the form and report and just use the program to update a table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 20:07</div></div><div class="posttext">You can make a session with 3-GL attached to it and use activate() or other functions to start the standard session and then do your processing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 20:13</div></div><div class="posttext">As NPR says you could make it a 3GL.  My users like to know what is going on with processing.  I have always left the form visible(with processing messages).  That gives them a warm fuzzy feeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">As Mark said, you can use display fields on form to show what's happening or use progress indicators (search for the other threads on board for your BaaN Version).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">They may not want to make it 3gl - they may want to use the same session / logic that they use as an interactive session.  <br />
<br />
One thing we use in our ddc code is the variable sattr.slave:<br />
<br />
<br />
if background then<br />
    sattr.slave = true<br />
    execute(cont.process)<br />
endif<br />
<br />
<br />
and this seems to make the form not appear.  You can try that, I think it's standard (or we wrote something buried that I am not aware of...)  Let us know if that works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 21:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, sattr.slave should go in the before program, not the init.form section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th May 2005, 22:18</div></div><div class="posttext">None of the help on our systems has that predefined variable.  I did compile a program just see if it worked on our release of 4c4 and it did.  Learned something new today - thanks Lisa.  I can go home and feel like I was successful(for at least one day). :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides 3GL program , u can also write the code to update a table in the before.program of ur 4GL session and exit  the sesison (end() / stop() .. )  in before.program section after table is updated . In this way the form will not be displayed to the user even in 4gl program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">25th May 2005, 23:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I went with a few of the options. I took the sugesstion to run the progess bar on the form for the users &quot;comfort&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have another issues now. When I set my customized session to run from the main session using the choice option in the main session form, once my session has completed its task, if I click with my mouse anywhere on the main sesison form, my session gets activated again. How can I prevent this from happening. <br />
<br />
Is there any way to exit the main session when my session has completed its task? without source code?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LittleJohn</div><div class="date">26th May 2005, 06:24</div></div><div class="posttext">dirty way... but you can. Import the &quot;pid&quot; value of the parent session in your customized session and once the process is completed... kill the parent and then kill your session.<br />
Parent session wont exit &quot;gracefully&quot;...... but you can display a message to the user that the process is terminating.<br />

Add your customized session number in the choice option of the main session form. Make sure you dump the form.</div></div><hr />

How do I get the pid? Is the behaviour normal for the session to activate my customized session by clicking my mouse on any part of the main form?</div></div><hr />
