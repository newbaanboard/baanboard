I have access to all of our VRC's, but I never try to compile in one of the Baan layers. Right offhand I can think of two ways to fix this - do not give anyone permissions to the B40_B VRC or two change the permissions on the directory structures so that compiles can not take place.<br />
On our production system only BSP can compile or make changes in other layers. They did this through the directory structure - only BSP has write access.<br />

At one point in time I was told that all we needed to do was to buy source code and we could compile any of the Baan sessions.  Even though we are on 4c3 A&amp;D some of the session still run from the standard layer. So what exactly is this &quot;developers license&quot;?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Buying source code is almost the same thing. You can buy a single license that allows you to alter the standard ie become a developer. I beleive that you can also buy indiviual source codes to allow you to alter just that session or object. The developers license just allows you to do it to everything. These are normally bought for large scale customisations as its easier to 'mess' about with the code on the system rather than development done off site then moved.<br />
<br />
And you would find that if you had some serious customisations done that you would still have to run them from the standard that was customised to keep functionality upto date. Being on 4c3 I can imagine that you will have to take you customisation into account should you ever consider upgrading!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulrich.fuchs</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">A Developer license will NOT allow you to modify the standard.<br />
If yout want to do development in Baan, you can buy a &quot;Developer License&quot;. This is (was?) licensed seperatly from the main product. It allows you to access the Menu Tools/Development and the sessions within (like Maintain Tables, Maintain Sessions).<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with source code: You can also buy an (extremely expensive) &quot;Source code license&quot; that gives you access to ALL Baan Sources except the Tools sources.<br />
<br />
Without that Source code licence, you normally should be able to purchase single sources via your Baan partner. You need a source if you want to modify that Baan standard session. You don't need a source for doing development (apart from include files). <br />
<br />
Still, even when modifying a standard source, you will not modify the standard, because you are doing the development in a seperate software version, derived from that standard.<br />
<br />
ONLY BAAN DEVELOPMENT may actually modify the Baan &quot;Standard&quot; software versions. Some letters in the Package VRC indicate a standard VRC. <br />
<br />
If you were able to modify the Standard, then either<br />
<br />
- you're on a system that somehow behaves like one of Baan development (don't know why...)<br />
- or probably you didn't really modify the standard, but &quot;overrided&quot; it with a modified standard<br />
- or you have an incorrect PMC setup. I've seen one case, where you could actually modify the software that came within a patch,<br />
because somehow this was not recognized as &quot;standard&quot; software any more.<br />
<br />
Hope that throws some light on the matter of licenses...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">This maybe a matter of language. When I have been dealing with anyone from Baan it has always been called a 'Development License' that allows you to edit the source code and has always been expensive.  But was always under the impression that it allowed you to alter the standard as well. If this is incorrect then I appologise as I was only working on the information given to me as I have never used a system with the license.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">We are talking about an b2 System, which is set up long time ago from somebody else.<br />
<br />
At a normal system it is not possible to switch to a &quot;released&quot; VRC as &quot;B40_b2&quot;. That is also not possible here. But strange if I am in B40C_b2_001 it is possible to compile an edit a &quot;B40_b2&quot; Source.<br />
The structure is something like:<br />
<br />
B40_b<br />
B40_b1<br />
B40_b2<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
B40C_b2_001<br />
B40O_b2_001  <br />
<br />
From B40O_b2_001 it is NOT POSSIBLE to compile and edit the standard, but from B40C_b2_001.<br />
<br />
<br />
About these discussions compiling sources: The (my) normal way is: Buy a source from Baan, put it in the related STANDARD-VRC, copy it to a customisation VRC, compile it!!!<br />
<br />
Ravenscross: Is there any way to check if there are any developer permissions on the system?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenscross</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Not quite sure there is. I think (from information given to me), that you create a user that can only have those authorisations. As this is all what I have been told (and by more than one person!) I cannot say, as I have not used a development/editable system before.<br />
<br />
However you do say that you buy the source which would make it open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">17th April 2002, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">OK let's summarize:<br />
<br />
I have a system where I can compile, modify, copy sources. That is quite normal, because I am working in Baan Tools.<br />
<br />
But it is not normal that it is possible to modify something in a VRC of a &quot;released standard&quot;. Also developer / superuser has normaly no permission to do that. On that system it is possible, somehow. <br />
<br />
Now I will appreciate any hint which helps me find what going wrong, that it is possible to modify the STANDARD<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />

I would check in ttiex3500m000-Display Requested System Configuration, where you should see the &quot;Development Tools&quot; as one of the (Runable) Commercial Functions.    But, I am not quite sure, if this is what you are looking for?<br />

This is not the question. Meanwhile I know that &quot;developer permission&quot; is what I call the &quot;Tools licence&quot;. This has nothing to do with my problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">18th April 2002, 10:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets throw some light into this thread:<br />
<br />
- A normal Baan installation does not include any source code [developer license];<br />
<br />
- You have to buy one or more developer licenses to have access to the source code. The source code is the standard (+updates, see below) for all modules except for the tt (tools), where source code is not available (some partners have it for developing their own tt tools, like Bull);<br />
<br />
- You have to request the source code CD from Baan, this CD needs a key to unencrypt the source dumps (that you request from Baan and they will check if you bought a developer/source license!) to be able to install the sources [thru a normal import];<br />
<br />
- The best way is to determine if you will develop when you buy the Baan software, because you request the CD and install it before you initialize PMC and start installing service packs and so on, so that you update your [installed] sources as well;<br />
<br />
- For the users that will develop (super users type), they must be given grants to the pVRC and modules, using the sessions under Tools -&gt; User Management -&gt; Developers Data (usually bsp is the owner of the password for developer authorizations);<br />
<br />
- Developers can change anything in any layer except the layers that are &quot;standard&quot;, like B40_c4. I noticed that the rule is that it does not allow a change of any layer that does not have a customer extension (if you build your own B40C_c4 it will not allow you to change it because it lacks a customer extension, so be careful with the names of your own layers!)<br />
<br />
- You change [the standard indirectly] by copying the sources to your own layers and change them there. It is not good practice to change anything in the layers where the standard [+updates] are located!<br />
<br />
I'll finish by saying that, related to change directly the sources of the standard layers (but why would you want to do that?), there is a way, of course, to override this rule (check [hidden] session tttadv0102m000 :) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
you may check table ttadv002 with some tool that ignores the Baan access restrictions for that table (ODBC or Crystal, because General Table Maintainance will exit if you try to use it on that table)<br />
<br />
There is a field &quot;upds&quot; indicating if Standard modifications are allowed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ttadv002 seems to be the right place to check. Only I have still the problem to access these table. At the moment I have no tool/expirience/password. I tried some &quot;standard Baan&quot; passwords which all don't work.<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that this system is at it is, for a couple of years I will not spent to much time right now. But I will keep track on this. If I find a possibilty to get access to that table in the near future I will post what I find in this thread.<br />

<br />
As far as i know, if you want to compile something, there should be a package-combination connected on that specific VRC. <br />
If there isn't you'll get an error.<br />
<br />
GN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ClausStr</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been looking at your VRC structure.<br />
<br />
B40_b <br />
B40_b1 <br />
B40_b2 <br />
. <br />
. <br />
B40C_b2_001 <br />
B40O_b2_001 <br />
<br />
The first three VRC are our standard and these should be editable (which they arent), the your B40C_b2_001 is for customersations (according to baan naming conventions the C means customer vrc). Then my guess is that B40O_b2_001 is your operational VRC, which means that your company is linked to this VRC.<br />
<br />
Before being able edit and compile you should also set current package vrc to the vrc your components is in, seems like your current is B40C_b2_001, which is fine, becuse most of your customized sofwarecomponents probably lies here.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a final note, if you look in your baan tools menu theres a submenu called Applications Customization and maybee one called Application Development.<br />
<br />
Applications Customization is allways on your system, if you bought developer rights Application Development is also installed.<br />
<br />
Actually Applications Customization is what you could call a Application Development light menu.<br />

<br />
This is the message I received from our sys admin:<br />
When Mark found that the domain for the contract number had somehow been changed in the base A&amp;D layer of company 555 a few weeks ago, I contacted BaaN to see why we were able to make changes to the base A&amp;D layer.  They told me that our package VRCs were improperly named.  For example, package VRC tiB40C_c3_22b0 is comprised of package &quot;ti,&quot; version B40C, release c3, and customer extension 22b0.  To protect the package VRC from being changed the version should have been &quot;B40 &quot; (no &quot;C&quot;). <br />
