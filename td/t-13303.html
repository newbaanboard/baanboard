<br />
Is it not possible to create a button on a form of &quot;Maintain Session&quot; of Baan?<br />
<br />
I have a main session amsli0102m000 which is a maintain session (form type is 3).<br />
I want to create a button on this form which calls a &quot;Update and Print session i.e. amsli0402m000.<br />
<br />
Hence in the form menu of session amsli0102m000 I have created a link as shown in the attached file. But this only adds to the &quot;Specific&quot; of the main session and not a button as is required.<br />
<br />
Could anyone please through some light on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It shows up in the specific menu in the overview session.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, to create a button you have to use -<br />
<br />
create.extra.toolbar() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_secondary_toolbars_create_extra_toolbar)</div></div><hr />

insert as a Button on Overview Session is possible. I did this several times. All you have to do is inserting a special field including a link to the form command in the form editor at the desired position.<br />

The solution you described is valid for static forms ? I didnt see that option in the dynamic forms (DFE).<br />
<br />
Please clarify ?</div></div><hr />

never worked with DFE till now because almost 99% of all Forms in 5.0c are static.<br />
Had a short look at our Version of DFE and it seems that you are right (No possibility to place a Button in an Overwiew Session).<br />
Have you tried to define the form command whith 'show as a Button' and how will Baan take this?<br />
