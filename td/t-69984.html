<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bloomer822</div><div class="date">2nd May 2017, 07:06</div></div><div class="posttext">I was recently hired by a company which uses Infor LN ERP (v6, I believe).  At my previous employer, I self taught myself and became the &quot;local&quot; expert in developing queries / data extracts from our ERP system (JDE) using Microsoft Access and an ODBC driver.  I was disappointed to learn that I'm unable (to my limited knowledge) to apply this same approach (Access and ODBC).  I was provided this program called &quot;Eclipse&quot; which does offer query writing but not the ability to link local tables/data and incorporate into queries.  <br />
<br />
To get to the point, I'm asking the experts here if it's possible to use Microsoft Access to connect to Infor LN and create queries / extract data?  What information about my company's setup do I need to provide in order for someone to help? I have the support of our IT group, if needed, to help implement changes.<br />
<br />
For example, I frequently analyze finalized GL transactions (tfgld106) and would like to create queries linking fields to other LN tables like sales orders (tdsls401, etc).  <br />
<br />
Can anyone help? <br />
Thanks everyone!</div></div><hr />

I know we have one tool that uses access and I believe ODBC to hook into our Oracle database with read-only type capabilities from what I understand.  But wait for someone with LN knowledge they might offer up better suggestions.</div></div><hr />

If you really want it,create a Slave DB and synchronize between the Master DB and the Slave DB and the SLave DB will be the Microsoft Access DB on which you want to execute your queries.<br />
<br />
This would be an interesting experiment.</div></div><hr />
