I developed a library that allows you to create a file in xlsx format.<br />
This is a first version that is functional but does not include style sheets.<br />
It is quite possible to use it on all versions provided you modify the creation part of a compressed file. I have to use commands specific to ERP LN.<br />
The archive contains the source of the library and a 3GL program that shows the use of the different functions.<br />
<br />

Nice to see a native solution.<br />
May be the thread should be in Code &amp; Utilities SIG.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srivinayak</div><div class="date">19th October 2019, 05:19</div></div><div class="posttext">The attached zip file appears to miss zgcomdll0002 as it is one of the libraries being used. I got compilation errors for zgcomdll0001 for data types such as bctls.styp.string. I tried to use this library in LN 10.2. Please advise if any recommendations</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srivinayak</div><div class="date">19th October 2019, 05:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Sir, very big thanks for your contribution. It is a great script. I replaced the domain with ttadv.type and every thing worked including your 3 GL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srivinayak</div><div class="date">23rd October 2019, 01:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Sir, your code base was very much useful to get the idea. However it was not directly helpful to me as it assumes me to know all the columns count in the very beginning of the library call. My requirement algorithm is as shown below<br />
1. open work sheet<br />
2. fill A1, B1, C1, D1 ....until a specific condition meet<br />
3. switch to next row<br />
4. again fill A1, B1, C1, D1 ....until a specific condition meet<br />
and the flow continues<br />
Hence, I wrote the dll as per my convenience and attached a sample 3GL to demonstrate how to use it.</div></div><hr />
