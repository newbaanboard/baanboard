<br />
I am copying a standard baan form into my dev VRC then I am adding a new field to it .And I am building a logic in the program script to include the [from- to] field into the program script selection (Qkey: query.extension). <br />
However at the execution at the form level the field is not recognised and I get &quot; unknown form field refb.f&quot; and consequently no value is assigned to the field after selecting it in the form. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to make this work?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your Help!<br />

<br />
declaration:<br />
     |#parent<br />
     extern domain tcitem  new.item<br />
<br />
After compiling I should now be able to use new.item on the form.  What I recommend is for you to compile your script in debug mode.  Make sure you see all the qkey components - all the events, etc.</div></div><hr />

To include this [From-To] field into my selection I tried to add it into a Query.extension (programt script-Qkey) and in the report script (new report) in the After.receive.data section. I can see the refb.f and refb.t passed into the report but none of the query.extension or after.receive.data work. They are like invisible to the logic at the execution.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

(1) Declare the fields in the session script.<br />
(2) Add the fields to the form(initialize as needed)<br />
(3) Add the fields to the input fields on the report.<br />
(4) Create(or modify) the report script.  In my case I want to filter the detail records. So in the before layout of the report I do a quick check.<br />
<br />
    if sometable.refb&lt;refb.f or sometable.refb&gt;refb.t then<br />
       lattr.print = false<br />
    endif<br />
<br />
This skips printing the records out side the refb range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That what exactly I have been doing. I tried in the after.receive.data section and this doesn't work then I add it to all my report sections. But still nothing changed, I am getting everyting rather than data between refb.f and refb.t <br />
<br />
before.tdpur040.refb.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
if tdpur040.refb &lt; refb.f or tdpur040.refb &gt; refb.t then<br />
	lattr.print = false<br />
endif	  	<br />
<br />
before.tdpur041.suno.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
if tdpur040.refb &lt; refb.f or tdpur040.refb &gt; refb.t then<br />
	lattr.print = false<br />
endif	  	<br />
<br />
after.tdpur040.refb.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
if tdpur040.refb &lt; refb.f or tdpur040.refb &gt; refb.t then<br />
	lattr.print = false<br />
endif	  	<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th October 2007, 00:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - first is tdpur040.refb populated from the session script or from the report script? Is the table tdpur040 declared in the report script? What are refb.f and refb.t in debug mode?  Which session and report are you working on?</div></div><hr />

Write an Else statement and assign a message or value to check where values are going wrong exactly.</div></div><hr />
