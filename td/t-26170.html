<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I am uncertain about where to post this problem, so I'll let the powers that be move this post if it is deemed inappropriate as a development issue.<br />
<br />
On form6 of the Maintain customer session, the baan application displays Order balance and Invoice balance.  The same information is displayed on session tfacr2521m000 - Display Customer's Sales Invoice.<br />
<br />
We are set up as multi finance, single logistic and we have just migrated from IVc3 to IVc4 and started running new version this past Monday.<br />
<br />
The problem that I am experiencing is that the information on form6 of the Maintain customer session is sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect.  I have researched the incorrect instances and I see for example, the correct invoice balance and order balance in the tccom011 table.  This is correctly displayed on the tfacr2521m000 session but on form6 of the customer master the displayed totals are incorrect.<br />
<br />
I have pondered over the possibility that customizations are the root of this problem, but that does not explain why some of the customer records display the correct numbers and other customers are incorrect.<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced this problem?  What was the fix?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help!</div></div><hr />

I have no knowledge about how these fields are calculated, but my first impression is that you should contact Baan.  I could be totally off base, but we will leave this post here for a day and see if it gets any other hits.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">You mention customizations.  Have you customized the tccom1101 script?  or the form?  The forms should now refer to those fields as 'totl.buor' and 'totl.buin'.  As you noticed, the values of those fields moved from tccom010 to tccom011 when you moved from c3 to c4, so maybe something is still looking the old way.   For why some are correct and some are not, it may be that when you did the migration, the balances were moved to tccom010 and tccom011, and some of them are still the same as when you moved, so the old value is still valid...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 20:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I have checked the variable names.  They are 'totl.buor' and 'totl.buin'.  I considered recompiling but I don't know why that would be useful given that some records are reporting the correct information.<br />
<br />
Also, I have noted the correct data exists in tccom011 table.<br />
<br />
I failed to mention the display session tccom1501m000.  No customizations here!  Some records display the correct order balances and invoice balances and some records are incorrect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th January 2006, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Humhph.  The display and the maintain do call different scripts, so unless you customized both, you are right it's an odd problem.<br />
<br />
Both call a function itccom0004 to get the values, which simply reads tccom011.  The turnover has some period calculations, but buin and buor ar straight from the table.<br />
<br />
It should be straight forward, given the proper scripts.  Try printing the session runtime information (File / Run / ttstpsessinfo ) and see if there is anything in the chain that is customized that you are not expecting.  Like, a form or script object that got copied in the migration...?<br />
<br />
If not, if you are tempted to recompile (you have the current source?), is there a test Company and VRC this shows in and you can try the recompile in?  Should not do that in live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">28th January 2006, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Think recompiling should help . There is a function in com module  which caluclates these values . Probably the program object has include from the c3 version . Just a possibilty . <br />
<br />
Also u may  check establish the error pattern by taking the dump of tccom011 for all respective companies) . <br />
<br />
Also getting latest patches of rebuild order balance / invoice balance too may help .</div></div><hr />

No customizations to the display object.<br />
<br />
I have a new observation to share.  The field storing the year is sometimes populated and sometimes NOT populated.  Since this table is maintained by the application I cannot explain why there is an inconsistancy.  But, on the records where the year is populated, the correct information is being displayed.  Does anyone know why?<br />
<br />
We are multi- finance / single-logistic.  Am I supposed to run the correction program for each finance company?  I have been because in IVc3, this is what I had to do.  But, now I am on IVc4, perhaps the process should be different.</div></div><hr />
