My question is on the forms which appear in the web interface for BaaN. There are some fields on the forms which we'd like to edit, mainly by concatenating some fields together so that the data which appears on the form is more complete.<br />
<br />
Can anyone recommend where I could find information on how to do this if it's even possible?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's a standard session/form you need to copy it into your VRC and then use Dynamic Form Editor(DFE) to edit the form and make the changes.<br />
<br />
If its a customized session/form, directly use DFE to edit the form. In cae of concatenating, you will need to create a new form field using DFE and assign value to it using script or form.<br />
<br />
Also, if you add a new field on the form, you will need to declare it in the script. So, make sure you have access to the script. Or else, you will need a wrapper to do that.</div></div><hr />
