I am facing a problem , When i am trying to print amount field on report with domain as tfgld.amnt which is Double (15by4) using the display format %A095 which is having the format ZZZZZZZZZ9VD99 then the report is printing the amount with thousand sign.<br />
<br />
But when i tried to print the amount with format ZZZZZZZZZZ9VD99 (with 1 additional Z) then it is not printing thousand sign.<br />
<br />
Actual problem is that the amount value is very large and it was getting printed as ####### so I have changed format from %A075(ZZZZZZZZZ9VD99) to %A097 (ZZZZZZZZZZ9VD99) .<br />
<br />
Can you please guide me so that amount will get printed with thousand sign.<br />
<br />
Thanks In Advance<br />
<br />
Sorry to disturb you by sending private message..<br />

Thanks<br />

<br />
You can manually define the Tousand sign in the Format : ZZZTZZZTZZ9VD99. Could be that the new format you chose has no tousand sign defined for the language<br />
