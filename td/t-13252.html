The comma could be anywhere within the string(16).  I want to remove the comma wherever it is.  Can anyone help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th October 2003, 00:02</div></div><div class="posttext">There are lots of ways to do it, but I would not do it with a Baan script.  What I would do is find all the tables with item on them.  Next I would probably find all the items in the item master with commas.  I would take this and create a list of old items and new items.  Then I would give this to my Oracle DBA's and ask them to do some scripts to run in offline mode(baan is down) to do the mass changes. This would only work for a 1 to 1 unique change.  If you had a situation where you had these items &quot;145,jan&quot; and &quot;1,45jan&quot;, then it is another ballgame.  In that case you would have to find each table where Item is part of the key and figure out some logic how you want to change or combine the records.  Doing this on all the tables could make this a very time consuming task, but hey it is possible.  How many parts do you all have?  How many baan tables do you all use that have item on them?  Just some questions and comments.  Maybe others have better ideas, but I really dislike mass changes like this.<br />

I once did this kind of database check and change on company number in multi site test env. I used a script to check database and table definitions on the domain to generate an exchange scheme. That scheme exported all the data. After that, clear the specified tables and import the tabe using the same exchange scheme. While importing specific fields can be checked on values (&quot;,&quot; in item code) and changed before writing to the tables.<br />

Changing the item codes in the tables is not an option.  Among other reasons, there are approx. 4,000+ items per company.  There are 10 companies.  I think I might have it figured out.  If it works, I will share it with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if i understand right and you will only remove commas (or whatever) from the item code in for example a report, then you can use a small piece of code like this in your program or report script.<br />
<br />
<br />
function convert.item.code()<br />
{<br />
        long x,y<br />
<br />
        y = len(strip$(tiitm001.item))<br />
        for x = 1 to y<br />
            if x &lt; y and<br />
               xrep.dsca(x;1) = &quot;,&quot; then<br />
               xrep.dsca(x;1) = &quot; &quot;<br />
            endif<br />
        endfor<br />
}<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">10th October 2003, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Alternatively, you can use the tools function from the library ttdllstring<br />
<br />
search.and.replace<br />
void search.and.replace( ref string line(), const string srch(), <br />
