Please let me know what is the most cost effective solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th April 2005, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I would think exchange would be a good plan in LN.  Exchange can read and write comma delimited files for excel (watch for the problem with leading 0's in strings though, that's an excel issue).  In LN, as in V, you can choose when importing data that it use the DAL validations on your field imports, so when you import through Exchange you will get good field level validations.   If you have need of extra logic you can code them in the conditions.<br />
<br />
Other ideas depend on how handy you are with tools.  You could probably write your own import / export sessions.  For export just read the tables and write comma delimited files out for excel.  For Import, read the files in, and use the DAL2 calls to put the data in.   Not sure of your exact requirements, but from an overview that sounds fine.<br />
<br />
Many ways to do, maybe someone else also has ideas.</div></div><hr />
