I duplicated tibom3400m000 to another session to customize. My form though looks all disabled. The session setting, form setting, form commands all are same as in tibom3400m000. For now, my new session has program script that has same codes as in tibom3400m000. See image attached. (some labels missing in current package but notice that all fields are disabled automatically. <br />
<br />
See image attached. am unable to see similar problem reported along with solution. Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">10th April 2021, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try the following - <br />
<br />
1. If there is any session code dependent code<br />
2. If there is any label dependent code<br />
3. If there are any personalizations/defaults which got messed up. Try clearing them.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to check Program script, DAL(if any), DLL's if any referenced, Functions if any used.<br />
<br />
Could also be due to corrupted form. So try copying the original again with a new session code and see if it helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After many unsuccessful attempts, I did the same in another environment and there the fields were not disabled for the same components and target session/form/script name. I then did an 'export data dictionary' and imported into my required environment and it is now ok. Weird but sometimes such trysts solve issues. <br />
<br />
But thanks Bhushan for your inputs and time!</div></div><hr />
