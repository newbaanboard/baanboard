I have requirement to set Monday as 1st day of week for certain reports. But on company data, Sunday is set as 1st day of week. We cannot change company data, the only workaround we found was to change the variable (1st_dow) defined in user UFile from 1(represents Sunday) to 2(represents Monday).<br />
Just wondering is there any way to do it in a program or during runtime by setting any parameter on BW command.<br />

sprintf() can be helpful to you i guess...</div></div><hr />

BaanERP handles week numbering according to ISO:5601. Week 01 is the week that includes the first Thursday of the year or January 4th. Monday is the first day of the week (that is, day 1). Sunday is the last day of the week (that is, day 7).<br />
In the company-data settings in the data dictionary it is possible to define the first day of the week (that is, day 01) for individual BaanERP users. If a users first day of the week is Monday, then week numbering follows the ISO standard. However, if a users first day of the week is other than Monday (Sunday or Wednesday, for example), the week number is calculated differently. The week number is always the ISO week number of the Monday that occurs in the users week. <br />
<br />
The following diagram illustrates this:<br />
<br />
In the example, the users first day of the week is a Wednesday. The week number of the week beginning Wednesday 9th and ending Tuesday 15th  is the ISO week number for the Monday that occurs in that week. The ISO week number of Monday 14th is week 6, so Wednesday 9th to Tuesday 15th is week 6.<br />
