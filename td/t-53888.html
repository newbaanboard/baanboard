We need to create a direct printer that will print chinese characters<br />
<br />
We print to a print queue on our AIX server where LN runs using the following <br />
<br />
lp -c -dLNV6IN -n %d -s %s<br />
<br />
This works fine for english characters but we need to print chinese characters but the LN drivers in $BSE/lib/printfinf/ strip the chinese characters before it reaches the print queue.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any Unix print drivers that they have already customised  that we could use please?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

On english (or german in my case) it is set to 8859-1. Replacing the codepage with another one for chinese should help.<br />

<br />
Many thanks for your reply - this was indeed part of the answer that we reached late Friday.<br />
<br />
Another part was that we were loading Chinese characters, via Exchange, from Excel - Excel sets the codepage for the text based on the person's codepage who is running the Excel / Exchange upload. What we needed to do was export the text from Access where you can specify the codepage for the text.<br />
<br />
This, in conjunction with your tip resolved the problem  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
