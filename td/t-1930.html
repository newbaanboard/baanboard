I having a problem of slow processing time in my inventory report. Everytime i need to take 3 1/2 hours to print my inventory report (with around 3000 record per time).<br />
<br />
Please guide me if you know the solution of this problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but i have a confuse in the term of &quot;debugger&quot; and &quot;profiler&quot;, where can i get this? from Baan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spartacus</div><div class="date">7th May 2002, 10:24</div></div><div class="posttext">due to your answer I suppose that you are not that much tools expirienced. In that case debugger and profiler will hardly help you.<br />
Anyway: If you &quot;compile&quot; a program in Baan you can do this with &quot;debugger&quot;-option. That means you can walk step by step trough the program and check what it does, line by line. In that way, you can also find out, if there are any certain functions which needs to much time.<br />
<br />
You can also compile with the &quot;profiler&quot;-option. If you do that, you will get a printout after the program (session) finishes. In that printout is the time consumption of the single program parts listed. But it not easy to interpret this list. <br />
You will find this in Maintain Program Scripts, if you have tools or developer permission (don't no if there is a difference between this terms). <br />
But I think you will need a technical consultant for that.<br />
<br />
An other way is perhaps (very simple!):  &quot;A call to Baan&quot;<br />

Hope that helps a little<br />
