<br />
Last week we spent most of our time setting up a 3 in label and it WAS working.  The label is sized to 3&quot;x9&quot; but we were able to print on only 2 1/4 inch of the label. We made a few program tweaks and thought we were done.<br />
<br />
Today my co-worker was testing this and it does not work.  There is a huge margin and when I choose to edit the position, I see the current height of printable area is 1.12222 inches.<br />
<br />
How can I fix this?<br />
<br />
Also, I have spent too much time trying to layout checks.  This is a similar problem.  The form is sized to 7 inches.  When it prints, I get a huge top margin and when I choose to edit the position, I see the current height of the printable area is 5.12222 inches.  I did modify the position to -.5 and this morning I realized that change affected packing lists by not printing the top few lines.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.<br />

I forgot to mention that both of these reports are sent to Okidata Microline 590 printers.  Could this be my problem?  Comments please.</div></div><hr />
