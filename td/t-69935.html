<br />
Under my Super user Login ID, I am trying to enter a TEXT in a customized Form. After typing text in a Note Pad editor and Save &amp; Exit the system does not create a Text number in that session Main Table.<br />
<br />
I see there is a file created under $BSE/tmp folder starts with file name â€œtmp + unique number of 9 digits), and also same name under PC installation folder (AppData\Local\Infor\BW\Baan IV\tmp).<br />
<br />
That strange behavior is only happening on this specific customized Session; any idea what I am missing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: <br />
Entering text is not an issue with my login at any other session (Customized or Standard) object under same environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th April 2017, 18:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Is that text number attached to the session?  Look on maintain sessions and ensure that text field is attached to the session. Make sure that super user has authorizations for that text group.  You might also want to make sure that new text field is associated with the correct text group (Maintain Default text group by text table field).  Those were the first few things I thought of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Link is attached to Session under specific. This might be one of the reason</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe you are asking if TEXT (T) icon on the menu bar is available or not.<br />
Yes, it is available. And also Yes as a super user I have a defaut TEXT group assigned.<br />
<br />
Is there any other thing I need to validate on the Form design buttons, or any defined libraries on the Script ?<br />
<br />

<br />
- What do you mean by &quot;Is there any value under Text Fields by Session?&quot;<br />
- What is the Link attached to Session?<br />
<br />

The issue was in Table ttadv213 - Text Fields by Session<br />
The Text Field was pointing to a different Table Number and Field Name<br />
Fixed using GTM, and Create Runtime DD for the session in question resolved the problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you GURUs for your kind support<br />
