<br />
What i want is when the user clicks on a command button (DsCpushButton) then the purchase order session tdpur4110m000 should start with the selected PO. But, PO session is starting with different order. The code is given below: <br />
<br />
               if evt.button.return(event) = COMMAND.ORNO then<br />
			id = evt.button.id(event) <br />
			get.object(id,DsNstring,filter.orno)<br />
			hold.orno = val(filter.orno)<br />
			tdpur040.orno = hold.orno<br />
			zoom.to$(&quot;tdpur4110m000&quot;, Z.SESSION, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0)<br />
		endif<br />
<br />
Can anybody find what could be the problem ?<br />
<br />
Also, If I want to do the same thing using stpapi.put.field and stpapi.find, then the session tdpur4110m000 starts in background. how can I bring it in foreground. So that when I call the session using zoom.to$, it does not start a separate session.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

In the zoom case you need to debug the code for tdpur4110m000 - it might using something other than tdpur040 for the zoom.  We do not own source so I can't look at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I came across an executable file in /bin folder of Baan application. It does the same thing.<br />
<br />
bic_info &quot;otiitm001&quot; -s (-s for printing symbol table)<br />
<br />
Above is an example where it prints the symbol table of object otiitm001. Using this, anyone can guess the variable name that he needs to declare in his/her script for starting any session with predefined record.<br />

Some of the session start with different modes - refresh, get defaults, etc.  Some of those will not automatically zoom to the record you are looking for.  I ran into this with several sessions that have this issue.  SInce this is a maintain session my suspicion is that it will not execute any find.  On my system tdpur4110m000 actually runs tdpur4101m000.</div></div><hr />
