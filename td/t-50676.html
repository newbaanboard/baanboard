<br />
I am a bit confused with language customizations in reports in LN.<br />
Currently I am working in LN and want to do some report customizations in French.<br />
<br />
When I was working in 5c, I simply copied the report to new language and made modifications there. <br />
<br />
But in LN, I think there would be just one report layout (in English) and only labels would be in new language. And there can be mismatch in length of the labels in 2 languages. So without actually having a layout in French, how can I make language customization? Please correct me if I am wrong here.<br />
<br />
And can anyone suggest the standard steps that should be followed during such language customizations in LN or any such help document available?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />

That is a correct statement. You would have to just create one report and create multi-language labels. But when you create labels, the typical standard is that you create an English label 1.5 times the original length so that it can handle the other language's length. When you design your report layout with a longer English label then it will also handle the other language's properly. <br />
<br />
Also refer to the Latest Design Princinples guide/help:<br />
Labels<br />
<br />
A label is a static text field that identifies a control, such as a text box or a check box<br />
Text box label:  <br />
Check box label:  <br />
<br />
When to use<br />
<br />
Provide a label for each control unless the controls appear in columns and the column heading serves as the label. <br />
Labels must identify the meaning of the controls to the user. <br />
Guidelines<br />
<br />
Labels must be meaningful, short, and informative. <br />
Labels do not contain the word Data. <br />
Do not place a colon (:) after the label. <br />
Avoid abbreviations in labels, because these are often incomprehensible to the user. <br />
Usually labels are left aligned. Exceptions are From-To labels. <br />
The first label on the form is positioned on column four and row four. <br />
The length of the label must be at least 1.5 times its own number of characters in English, because of translation. Recommended label length is twenty positions. <br />
Define label fields with the maximum number of available positions, with at least 1.5 times the number of the English positions. <br />
The maximum height for a label is three lines. <br />
Use the MS Sans Serif, 8pt font.</div></div><hr />
