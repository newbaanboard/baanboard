Something wrong was happened after 142510 solution had been installed<br />
The original device with ttstpconv and rtf parameter works correctly<br />
But with my stpconv where i call the original, the report (for example ttadv343001000) has a lot of pages where most of them are empty?<br />
Bic_info on ttstpconv showed the interesting string:<br />
@(#)DF216494,  2004/03/23: RTF conversion add page breaks <br />
Does anybody know how to disable (or manage) this feature?</div></div><hr />

Then I would contact Baan support.  Not sure if this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=16657&amp;highlight=ttstpconv) or this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=16765&amp;highlight=ttstpconv) help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">17th November 2004, 15:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, Mark, I looked these posts<br />
I have solution 141748, 142500, 142510 installed on test environment. Not sure there is right order ... and ... mmm... maybe installation was in wrong order? I need investigate this situation ... Solutions 141748  and 142500 have no dependencies on each other ... I'll soon be back ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">17th November 2004, 16:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just found last installed solutution which changes the ttstpconv 140168<br />
All other (including 141748, 142500, 142510) solutions in pre-requisite tree and installed earlier too. Maybe this solution has defect or feature? or there are some other solutions that help me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th November 2004, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you just need to re-install 141748, 142500 and 142510?  I guess 140168 could have broken what those three installed.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">18th November 2004, 06:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, how can I re-install these solutions if Solution 140168 requires them to be installed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">malutz</div><div class="date">18th November 2004, 08:32</div></div><div class="posttext">You run &quot;Check to uninstall...&quot; which will set all the solutions that depend on the solution you want to uninstall to status &quot;To Uninstall&quot;. Than you can simply uninstall and re-install them.<br />
<br />
Hope this was not to confusing.<br />
  :D</div></div><hr />
