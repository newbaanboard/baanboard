<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AlluRajasekhar</div><div class="date">4th October 2005, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
I have a problem in creating a sub menu for the main menu. Let me explain in detail. I have created a New session and wanted to add that session to &quot;Reports&quot; sub menu.<br />
<br />
Example:  If &quot;Main Tools&quot; is my main menu then under that I would like to add a sub menu called &quot;Detail Tool&quot;. In this &quot;Detail tool&quot; menu I wanted to have 3 sub menus again. And they would be &quot;Inquiries&quot;, &quot;Maintain&quot; and &quot;reports. I have created menus and linked them as below. But it doesnt work. The system would Show &quot;Main tools&quot; under which it directly shows &quot;New session&quot;.<br />
<br />
Menu - ptcom00000020.<br />
To this I have added the sub menu ptcom000000233(Reports) as a form field. The Sub menu ptcom000000233(Reports) has got Labels at bottom as &quot;Inquiries&quot;, &quot;Maintain&quot; and &quot;Reports&quot; with &quot;Reports not highlighted. <br />
The same has been done for other two sequences which are ptcom000000232(Maintain), ptcom000000231(Inquiries).<br />
<br />
I wanted this structure.<br />
<br />
Main Tools --&gt; Detail Tool --&gt;<br />
Inquiries<br />
                                        Maintain<br />
                                        Reports --&gt; New Session<br />
<br />
<br />
But System does this<br />
Main Tools --&gt; New Session<br />
<br />
Can any one help me in resolving this. Let me know if Iam not clear in any sense.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rita Kotecha</div><div class="date">4th October 2005, 11:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Do it step by step. You have the Main tools. So just create a submenu detail and check, if yes then create another submenu to details &quot;Inquiries&quot; and check.<br />
<br />
Once this tree works then go for the session.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you tell whether your users are using ASCII User interface or a normal Window based. Because i think what you are doing is required to be done for ASCII type of User interface. Or else in Normal window kind of Menu its just Adding Sub menus to your Main menu and Session to your Sub Menu and then do a Menu dump.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards</div></div><hr />

The users use both ACII and Window based menus. In any case I had the same problem. Even while developing menus for GUI, you would still maintain ASCII options like &quot;Choice field&quot; in menu editor.<br />
