<br />
I'm writing a display session where users can mark some records while the ctrl button is pressed..<br />
<br />
My question is, is there a way to be able to know if the ctrl button was pressed or not in the after choice section for choice.mark.occur..<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Hiba</div></div><hr />

I don't think there is a way to know if the ctrl button was pressed. But if you observe, you cannot mark multiple records without pressing ctrl (or shift for marking a range of recs). So if multiple records are marked (which of course you know in after.choice), it means either ctrl or shift was pressed...<br />
Don't know whether this will solve your problem...but try...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiba_t</div><div class="date">17th February 2006, 08:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your suggestion but I'm talking about a 4gl script, how can I catch the event in 4gl so that to call evt.keypress.key and evt.keypress.state ?<br />
<br />
I don't think I can..<br />
<br />
It's just that sometimes the user uses ctrl and sometimes he does not for selection and I need to know when is each case.. Can you help ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">17th February 2006, 11:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiba, You CAN use these event trigger functions in a 4GL script. If you give us more specification as to your exact requirements, I am sure we will be able to help more...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiba_t</div><div class="date">17th February 2006, 11:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I simply need to be able to know each time the user marks a record, if he pressed on ctrl when he chose it or not.. <br />
<br />
Since the code that should run in after.choice for mark.occur choice is different when ctrl is clicked..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th February 2006, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - I am not sure if you can tell when cntl is pressed, but the first thought that jumped into my head is &quot;buttons&quot;.  I have one session where the user marks records - then they have different buttons for what they want to happen(in this case I do not worry how the records got selected).  Not sure if this is an option, but thought I would suggest it.  This would also keep the user from thinking - did I push control or not?.</div></div><hr />
