I edited the report sales order acknowledgement. I deleted some of the labels and fields. I changed all the labels and field font effect to bold. After that I compiled the report then tested it. Before editing, the system prints only one page, but now it prints two pages even if the order line is only one.  What should I do so that the system will only print one page? Please see attachment. <br />

   Please check that any text related field is there in your report. Some times text contains blank data also. Because of that the page may skip to another one.Our reports are layout oriented, if detail or footer related data exceeds then page will skip. Please maintain proper font and restrict the text up to maximum no.of lines.<br />

Hello,<br />
one reason may be the wrong page calculation.<br />
In reportscript of e.g. sales offer, order ack. the lattr.pageno is set to zero e.g. in sales offer in after.qoco.30: -- after.layout: <br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry, I don't understand what you mean. But in the report layout session, I can only see lattr.break, lattr.pageno was not there.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reeyah</div><div class="date">30th September 2010, 13:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to restore the labels and fields (terms of delivery,terms of payment, carrier) that I have deleted at the bottom of the report of sales order acknowledgement. But the system only prints up to terms of delivery only; the terms of payment and carrier fields and labels are not printed in the report. I think the number of lines of report decreases after I edited the report.</div></div><hr />
