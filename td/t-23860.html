<br />
I am in process of developing a cusomized sales related report wherein one of the input criteria is invoice date.<br />
<br />
The following basic query takes approximately 4-5 minutes to fetch the first record,which is very very slow. I checked it through  (-- -set TT_SQL_TRACE=0240 ) option.<br />
All subsequent records are fetched in resonable time. I did not find any index which includeds the item and invoice date fields hence no index is suitable.<br />
<br />
To improve the speed I also optimized tdsls045 and tiitm001 table at database level (in informix) but the time taken to fetch the first record is still very slow.<br />
	select	tdsls045.item, tdsls045.cwar, tdsls045.dqua, tdsls045.pric<br />
 		tiitm001.dsca, tiitm001.copr<br />
	from	tdsls045, tiitm001<br />
	where	tdsls045.item inrange :item.f and :item.t<br />
	and	tdsls045.cwar inrange :warehouse.f and :warehouse.t<br />
	and	tdsls045.invd inrange :desp.date.f and :desp.date.t<br />
 	and	tdsls045.item refers to tiitm001<br />
	order by tdsls045.item<br />
	selectdo<br />
		rprt_send()<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
Any suggestions as to how to speed up the query ....?</div></div><hr />

Try this<br />
<br />
select tdsls045.item, tdsls045.cwar, tdsls045.dqua, tdsls045.pric<br />
tiitm001.dsca, tiitm001.copr<br />
from tdsls045, tiitm001<br />
where tdsls045._index8 inrange {&quot;      &quot;, :item.f} and {&quot;ZZZZZZ&quot;, :item.t}<br />
and tdsls045.cwar inrange :warehouse.f and :warehouse.t<br />
and tdsls045.invd inrange :desp.date.f and :desp.date.t<br />
and tdsls045.item refers to tiitm001<br />
order by tdsls045.item<br />
selectdo<br />
rprt_send()<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
I have modified the item selection  part  by using index 8.<br />

<br />
I have already tried index8 earlier but there is no improvement.<br />
<br />
In general I find that, other than index1 all other indexes are relatively slow.<br />
<br />
Yesterday when I was viewing some records in tdinv700 through ttaad4500, when I used index3 and tried to browse to next record it took almost 10 mins to go to next record.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vineetu1</div><div class="date">25th April 2005, 05:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Would like to add that going to the next record is not much of problem, but going to previous record is very very slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">25th April 2005, 07:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed in GTM , duplicate indices take very high time independent of database driver . However in code if the sql uses duplicate index , it's no problem.<br />
<br />
In ur  case , using index 8 of sls045 may not be helping bcos user must be inputting invoice date leaving from to item global values.<br />
<br />
If u notice almost all indices in Baan standard ar unique indices (with exceptions like tdinv700 3rd index) .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">25th April 2005, 23:32</div></div><div class="posttext">We have added a few extra indices onto tdsls045, one of them being invoice date, to speed up certain reports.<br />
<br />
This has definitely speeded them up.<br />
<br />
Ed<br />
<br />
p.s. our tdsls045 has 150,000 records.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">26th April 2005, 01:44</div></div><div class="posttext">We use the index 5 with ckor = 3 of tdsls051 table to retreive tdsls045 invoiced records.  <br />
<br />
This works very well for us. Our RDBMS is oracle 8 and we have close to 2 mil tdsls045 records and 5 mill tdsls051 records.</div></div><hr />
