<br />
I'm going to make a report that print a pdf file per supplier then i have to send them to the suppliers.<br />
<br />
Now, what i'm planning to do is to create a report to a printer device linked to a pdf writer. One question here is how can i specify the name of the file? i have to create various pdf's<br />
<br />
then i will send the files to the suppliers using outlook (i have found some code for that in the forum that involves outlook.vbs and a class). i haven't make the test yet, so if someone has some thougths on this i will be appreciatted...<br />
<br />

You could do one report per supplier to disk and hand these files off to the PDF creater.  Of course without knowing how your PDF writer works this is all just a guess.  Creating PDFs at our site is - drop a file into the input directory and then go retreive(after the process job runs) the pdf file from the output directory. Something like that, but it is not tied into Baan.<br />
<br />
You probably need to provide more information.  Are there any certain requirements?  I was going to do something like this using HTML report.  The session would run for a range of suppliers and for each supplier it would generate a HTML report which would then be mailed(using UNIX)mailx command.  In my case I just made the html output report a tmp file. Never really finished it because some managers did not like what the reports were saying(they wanted to manually manipulate them :) ).</div></div><hr />
