<br />
I am generating a custom inquiry session for inventory transaction history table (tdinv700) based on the key 2. (i.e. order type, order number).  (Form Type 3)<br />
<br />
Key Sequence is Order type, Order #,Pos#, Trans Dt, Trans Time,<br />
serl#, Item, container, Warehouse<br />
<br />
I want the records to show in the descending order of Transaction Date and Time on the Multi Occurance for every Order type and Order #.<br />
<br />
I have more than 1mil rows in the table.<br />
<br />
Could you please share your wisdom in solving this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I think descending order is going to be the big obstacle for a display seesion (at least for Baan IV).<br />
<br />
Here's one possible poor approach:<br />
Create a new table that contains the primary key fields of tdinv700, plus at least one more additional field that will be used to store the sort sequence per order type / order #.  Create a combined field in the new table related to the primary key fields of tdinv700.  The index of the new table would be order type, order #, sort sequence<br />
<br />
Then whenever this session runs or when doing a display refresh, you will do something along the lines:<br />
clear new table<br />
<br />
<br />
select tdinv700.*<br />
from tdinv700<br />
order by order type, order date, trans date desc,  trans. time desc<br />
selectdo<br />
        |if it's a new order type or order #, set sort sequence field to 1<br />
        |otherwise increment sort sequence field<br />
        |create and insert a record in the new table containing the key values from tdinv700 and the sort sequence<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
Once the new table is loaded properly, the display session should display the transactions in the order you want.<br />
<br />
Due to the large # of records in your tdinv700, it's hard for me to imagine this solution being preferable to a custom print session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">27th March 2002, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Another alternative:<br />
add the sort sequence field to the tdinv700 table<br />
create a new index of order type, order #, sort sequence (don't make it a unique key)<br />
create a display session based on this new index<br />
<br />
Create a new session that calculates/updates the sort sequence field for all tdinv700.<br />
Run the update sort sequence session as a job.<br />
<br />
When new inventory transactions are added to the history, the sort sequence will be 0 so they will appear first, although not in desired order until the job runs.  So you would need to run the job often enough to minimize this inaccuracy.</div></div><hr />
