<br />
I have a session which is not dynamic. I need to use it in other language than english, so I need to copy its form to the other language. How can I do that in LN6 ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Hiba</div></div><hr />

I unfortunately don't know about LN yet, but in Baan V you do this through session ttadv6201s000 which is called from ttadv3500m000 (Forms) -&gt; Specific -&gt; Copy form to other language<br />

It is possible to copy labels to another language but you don't to do it. LN6 can use english labels in other languages.</div></div><hr />

In LN, only Integrated &amp; Dynamic Sessions are developed in &quot;2&quot; English language code.<br />
<br />
You can then create labels in the other languages, make sure to sync up the label's lengths and widths across the languages. <br />
<br />
Copy Labels between Packages (ttadv1240m000)<br />
Use this session to copy labels from one package VRC to another package VRC in the same language.<br />
SSA ERP Tools copies the labels to the current development package VRC. You can specify the package VRC from which you want to copy the labels.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also have to execute - <br />
<br />
Compile Labels (ttadv1243m000)<br />
Use this session to compile and dump the labels for a range of package VRCs.<br />
For each package VRC in your range, SSA ERP Tools creates:<br />
a label dump file &lt;VRC code.lab&gt;, which contains the labels' strings.<br />
a label index file &lt;VRC code.idx&gt;, which is used to locate the correct label string for a session at runtime.<br />
The label dump files and the label index files are located in the directory: $BSE/lib/labels/&lt;package code&gt;/&lt;language code&gt;.&lt;language number&gt;.&lt;version&gt;<br />
At run time, SSA ERP Tools only displays compiled labels.<br />
In a development (English) environment: If you create new labels for a package VRC, you must compile the package VRC's labels so that SSA ERP Tools can display the new labels at run time.<br />
For languages other than English: If you do not translate and import new labels for a package VRC, SSA ERP Tools displays the labels' English versions.<br />
For all languages: If you maintain the existing labels of a package VRC, you must compile the package VRC's labels for your labels' changes to display at run time. If you do not compile the labels, at run time, SSA ERP Tools displays the labels' unmaintained versions.<br />
Note<br />
When you use the Import Language-Dependent Data from XML - Wizard (ttadv8920m000) session to import translated labels into a VRC, SSA ERP Tools automatically compiles the labels. But, if an error occurs during the import process, SSA ERP Tools does not compile the labels, in which case, you can use this session to compile the uncompiled imported labels, without rerunning the SE@ttadv89200m000 session.<br />
<br />
Refer to the translation sessions's help in WebTop.</div></div><hr />

also only dynamics forms exist in LN no other types of forms are present in LN/<br />
So the things which are not present in LN how can u copy.<br />
Even when u will copy forms which are not dynamic (static forms) in baan4 or baan5 when u copy them to LN enviroment they get converted into dynamic on there own possible with lots of misplaced fields and labels.</div></div><hr />

I think you're wrong. I imported a dump from Baan5 to LN that contains a non dynamic session, and it wasn't converted to dynamic. It works correctly with no problems on LN although it's not dynamic.<br />
<br />
So I do have a form which is static and language dependent in LN, it is in language 2 and I need to copy it to other languages.. Isn't it possible ??</div></div><hr />

Dave, the dynamic conversion does not occur automatically and you have to execute the conversion sessions that I mentioned in my previous posting.<br />
<br />

Hiba, I have not tried this but you can test it out with ttadv6265m000.<br />
Also note that, you have to follow the new LN Development Tools guidelines so its better to convert the session/form to dynamic/integrated and just translate the labels.</div></div><hr />

Must be &quot;It is possible to copy labels to another language but you don't need to do it&quot; instead of &quot;It is possible to copy labels to another language but you don't to do it&quot;. Sorry.</div></div><hr />
