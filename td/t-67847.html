<br />
How does Baan filter option works on all sessions.<br />
<br />
If query.extend.where() or query.extension are used in all cases?<br />
<br />
I have a customized session which is based on whinh225.<br />
I have to display the records of whinh225, but there is a filter.<br />
I need to check another table from there based on one field condition (xx1) I'll get all the key fields of whinnh225 and show those records on the session.<br />
<br />
Below is my code, which is working but very slow if records are more that 1-2 lakhs.<br />
<br />
Please check this &amp; suggest me if this query can be optimized to perform faster.<br />
<br />
qury.str = &quot; exists 	(select	whxxx133._index1&quot; &amp; <br />
					&quot;	from	whxxx133&quot; &amp;	<br />
					&quot;	where	whxxx133._index5 = {:xx1,:whinh225.oorg,:whinh225.orno,:whinh225.oset,&quot; &amp;<br />
					&quot;	:whinh225.pono,:whinh225.seqn,:whinh225.sern})&quot;<br />
query.extend.where(qury.str)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

Couldn't you just extend it to where it is equal to those records.  You can search this forum to find other examples of query.extend.where.  Just a shot in the dark here.</div></div><hr />

I got this solved, it's now fast as expected.<br />
<br />
With same code<br />
<br />
Only thing I did, just removed the duplicate indices from the table whxxx133<br />
<br />
Due to duplicate index the table was performing very slow.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th June 2015, 19:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you need them?  Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benito</div><div class="date">26th June 2015, 21:38</div></div><div class="posttext">mark i have to search for what i did because it's been a long time. in my case i just needed more granularity in the query. so for example if the available index is orno,pono then i create another dupl index called orno, pono,seqn. note that all it needs is for 2 consecutive fields to be in the same order as the first to be considered Duplicate. the other reason is the sorting of view in the multi-occurrence dynamic form. as i said i try to avoid this as much as i can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th June 2015, 22:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahhh - now I understand what you mean by duplicate.  I was thinking two identical indexes with the exact same fields - not just two consecutive fields.  Now I get it - thanks.</div></div><hr />
