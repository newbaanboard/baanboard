<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">13th November 2023, 16:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering, in a CDF field I use a list to categorize items in our webshop. The list defined in ttadv4592m000 a bit like:<br />
1 = normal, all shops<br />
2 = attention, all shops<br />
3 = attention, shop 1<br />
4 = attention, shop 2<br />
5 = attention, shop 3<br />
6 = pricereduction, all shops<br />
7 = pricereduction, shop 1<br />
8 = pricereduction, shop 2<br />
9 = pricereduction, shop 3<br />
<br />
Now I want to offer a form.command where all selected items can be assigned a specific (user input) value instead of opening them all one by one.<br />
<br />
So in the before.choice of the form.command I would like to allow users to input the new value from a predefined list as defined in &quot;Lists&quot; [ttadv4592m000] / &quot;List Constants&quot; [tdadv4593m000] and assign this value to a variable, to set the selected items to that value.<br />
<br />
Would the above defined list be a (tx) domain, I would have been able to use it in the ask.enum function to request a new value. With the set.ask.enum.values I could exclude value 5 and 9 (as was done in the CDF hooks tcibd001.cdf_kind.nr5.is.applicable and tcibd001.cdf_kind.nr9.is.applicable both return false) because shop 3 is not live.<br />
<br />
How to achieve this with the &quot;Lists&quot; [ttadv4592m000] / &quot;List Constants&quot; [tdadv4593m000]?</div></div><hr />
