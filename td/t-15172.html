<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">28th April 2004, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi - where is that command defined, the 'send.report.to.client'? Hard to say why from just that description, can you post more of the code?  In debugging, do you see what you think are the correct values for your paths and such?<br />
<br />
Also, complete shot in the dark, but the server2client standard function uses ftp to move the files, it is likely that your 'send.report.to.client' one does too.  I am not an administrator, but you need to make sure your PC has FTP rights to the server.<br />
<br />
You can also check this link, about Windows path and a problem with long path names.  There are other posts that may be of help as well, try searching for 'server2client'<br />
<br />
Post about long path names (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14840&amp;highlight=include) <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know &quot;send.report.to.client&quot; or if there is a single command to copy a file from server to client but i know that the file handling functions can be used for copying files from server to client.<br />
<br />
Server                                      Client<br />
 fp1=seq.open(&quot;..&quot;,&quot;r&quot;)             fp2=seq.open.local(&quot;C:\...&quot;, &quot;w&quot;,1)<br />
 seq.gets(buffer,..,fp1)             seq.write.local(buffer,,fp2)<br />
 seq.close(fp1)                          seq.close.local(fp2)<br />
<br />
For the client functions you need to include the library ottdllbw<br />
<br />
With these commands you use the permissions of you current PC-client.<br />
<br />
Can you pass me any docu regarding &quot;send.report.to.client&quot; ?<br />
<br />
Best Regards,</div></div><hr />
