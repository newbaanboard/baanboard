<br />
I'm having a strange compilation error in tfacp1110 script, seems to be related with the number of the script lines.<br />
<br />
When the total lines beyond 31183, compilation generates the error:<br />
<br />
&quot;ptfacp11100(31086): Error: '-' not expected.&quot;<br />
<br />
does anybody had experienced it before?<br />
<br />
I've had searched in progguide Known Limits but haven't found nothing about.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no idea about the error's reason. <br />
<br />
Here we got the same problem  trying to customize this program. <br />
<br />
The ugly solutions involves a &quot;diet&quot; for the script :D<br />
<br />
starting on changes with the &quot;ifs&quot;(a=b?do.this:do.that) <br />
<br />
I have never seem other program with so many lines...<br />
<br />
ai carai...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th October 2008, 22:17</div></div><div class="posttext">You mean you actually had to reduce the number of lines in the code?  I have never seen a limitation - nor have I ever seen a script so big.  Maybe take some routines and make them dll's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rberti</div><div class="date">31st October 2008, 16:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Use Dll's was my first thought, but I was just curious about the error. Maybe if someone had that before could explain if is realy related with the number of lines or any parameter...<br />
Thanks for the replys guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARijke</div><div class="date">31st October 2008, 17:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I you change the sequence of some functions then another function around line 31000 should give problems if it is about the length of the script. But I also do not know a max length for a script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">günther</div><div class="date">5th November 2008, 11:49</div></div><div class="posttext">I just created some code and tried to compile:<br />
* 100.000 lines just comment -&gt; okay<br />
* 100.000 lines of variable declaration -&gt; Error: '-' not expeced (line 34467)<br />
 <br />
So it's surely a limit!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">5th November 2008, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">In the simple test that I did, by putting a - sign in the script in one of the functions, I get the same message but the line number it gives is the line number in my program script.<br />
<br />
So, my guess is that, by chance, one of the include files has a 'dangling' - sign in them. It could get tedious, but if you can hunt down the - sign, and fix the code surrounding it, may be one way to solve the problem. [If you know any include file that was recently updated in your system, this may help narrow down the search.] <br />
<br />
This in in BAAN IV c3.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, if you are talking about the program script related to the session tfacp1110s000 &quot;Maintain Purchase Invoices&quot;, in our system the program script is only 6,249 lines (in the standard BAAN VRC). The rest of the source code is in include files. So, I am not sure how you get such a large line number in your error message. (After customizations, our script is now 7238 line and compiles o.k. without error.)<br />
<br />
[I do not have it any more, but in my previous company, there used to be a utility (in older BAAN versions) called explode.prog6.1 that would take the script as input and output a source file with all the includes 'pulled' in, and then one could look at the entire source code and investigate.]</div></div><hr />
