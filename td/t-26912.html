<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">20th April 2006, 18:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to compare the contents of two text fields, and I am trying to use a suggestion someone posted a while back.  The function they said would do this is<br />
<br />
long tgbrg0005.text.compare(string language(1), string text1(17), string text2(17))<br />
<br />
I can't get the script to compile using this.  Is there an include that I'm missing or is it because I am using Baan IV?<br />
<br />
Another suggestion was to use text.to.buf() and cmp.mem(), but I'm not sure how to use this to get the results I need.  Could anyone show me an example of how to use one or both of these to compare two text fields? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Check for the library tgbrg0005.<br />

Here is the origial posting - text fields (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9192&amp;highlight=text). Please post your code for others to review.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't thinking.  Thanks for the help.  I had already figured out how to use the text.to.buf and cmp.mem, but the dll function sounds more straight forward.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
