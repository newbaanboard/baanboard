<br />
We have implemented baan . We have done lots of customisation in the aera of Manufaturing.<br />
Now we would like to do proper documentation so that logic can be understood easily by the people <br />
who were not involved in the system.<br />
<br />
Please  advise for the same so that we can also incorporate the best practices.<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance<br />

<br />
Here we let our functional people create the documentation.  Each functional area also created their own training material and also provide the training. During implementation we had each group document what they were doing as they did it.  We did not have any kind of set format, but they did work with some consultant for the final documentation.<br />

We are conveying our peoples to fill this form with the help of keyusers (functional peoples) and submitting us even the changes are small .<br />
We always feels, should maintain DFD's, flow-charts etc. but fact is that, we all are always heavily loaded (identity of best employer). :) <br />
But that all are for system peoples, If you want to aware, your non-system peoples, I think your functional peoples can convey it properly.<br />
Just curious, What type of customisation you did?<br />
