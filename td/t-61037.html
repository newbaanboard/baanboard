<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dhowells</div><div class="date">23rd August 2011, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having problems with tdsls4810s000.  I have custom code that will change tdsls040.pcpr - Customer for Prices/Discount.  When this field changes the lines should get a 27% discount vs the 50% the order was correctly created at.  After the change I set tdsls040.orno and zoom to tdsls4810s000 and it will not recalculate the lines.  Is there something that I need to set to trip the recalc session into looking at the header and all lines?</div></div><hr />

Then you could look at tdsls4810s000 to see what needs to be set to recalc session into looking at the header and lines.  I am not familiar with this session and do not know how it works.  Just making a suggestion since sometimes you have to get the session called correctly.</div></div><hr />
