<br />
We recently upgraded our porting set.  Since doing that we have had a few errors with sessions.  I try to compile a customized program script and I get the error:<br />
<br />
Error SQL: Degree mismatch in reference redicate ('tdsls401')<br />
<br />
This session used to work fine.  I am guessing it not longer like the sql in the script?<br />
<br />
Has anyone had this problem, and could anyone advise me a solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">10th August 2002, 03:14</div></div><div class="posttext">This occurs usually with the 'refers to' sub-clause of the select. The syntax has been tightened up in the new porting set, which is a good thing. The solution is to re-code the clause suitably.<br />
<br />
I am not at work right now so I cannot give a specific example, but here is the concept:<br />
<br />
say a Table A has primary key with FieldA and FieldB.<br />
<br />
and Table B has FieldA and FieldB as attributes.<br />
<br />
Then when we say:<br />
<br />
<br />
select ...<br />
from tableA, tableB<br />
where ...<br />
and tableB.fieldA refers to tableA<br />
<br />
<br />
the compiler will give an error because refers to is intended for entire key.<br />
<br />
One solution to the above would be:<br />
<br />
<br />
select ...<br />
from tableA, tableB<br />
where ...<br />
and tableA._index1 = {tableB.fieldA, tableB.fieldB}</div></div><hr />
