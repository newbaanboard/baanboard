Such as 750 = 3 seconds.<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I've not understood your question completely. The parameter<br />
passed to the suspend 4GL function is meassured in miliseconds<br />
yet, so suspend(750) would detain the current process in 0.75<br />
seconds. Were you asking about the equivalence in cpu time<br />
maybe ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cvertz</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">This function is used with bar code scanning equipment.  If there is an error the code<br />
display(&quot;errror&quot;)<br />
refresh()<br />
suspend(750)<br />
error = &quot;&quot;<br />
display(&quot;error&quot;)<br />
refresh()<br />
<br />
What I am wanting is how long does the error message stay on the scan screen before the error message disappears.  Once I know how long 750 is then I can extend the time so my end users can read the error message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsanchez</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">The the equivalence Mark and I gave you was right. 1000<br />
miliseconds = 1 second or 750 miliseconds = 0.75 seconds<br />
whatever you prefer. Although I fear you're not making a<br />
good use of the suspend function. You'll probably should<br />
use mess or message . With mess a message<br />
from the data dictionary is displayed waiting for the user<br />
to press return if you decide to. Message cold do the trick<br />
too but would make that session language dependent.<br />
<br />
Read you soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cvertz</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you.  I was thinking of using the message instead of suspend as I reading the replies.  I have only been working with baan since 1999, with no training.  Before that a straight cobol programmer from the 70's.  I like to verify and understand what I am seeing in the scripts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th February 2002, 19:22</div></div><div class="posttext">No problem.  Sometimes it is hard to understand a question on the board, until you get a few replies and suggestions. :)<br />
<br />
Also I have used delays before with messages - mostly in mass update function servers. So there is nothing wrong with a delay in certain circumstances, but I do prefer to use the message command.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
