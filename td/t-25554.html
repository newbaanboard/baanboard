<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radhakrishna</div><div class="date">7th November 2005, 04:04</div></div><div class="posttext">We want to run a SQL Server DTS package from within a Baan program. Idea is to trigger this DTS Package which would update a table in Baan and subsequently use the data in this table to print to a report. <br />
Any ideas ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nneilitz</div><div class="date">8th November 2005, 16:30</div></div><div class="posttext">We are interfacing a Document Imaging Package in SQL with BaaN by using ODBC connection.   We use Oracle so simply installed the Oracle Client on the SQL Server and then set up data sources.  From within DTS you can link to an ODBC data source.  Works better than I would have thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th November 2005, 23:18</div></div><div class="posttext">nneilitz - I undeleted your post because I thought it was good info.  No matter what I thought it was a good post(and since I am a moderator I get to win - I think :)). It may not address starting the DTS package within Baan, but it may give Radha some ideas.  Also I am not sure how you would do what is being asked - I can see using some kind of interface, but not directly from Baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shaboo</div><div class="date">9th November 2005, 01:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what your exact requirements are but just throwing an idea:<br />
<br />
1. Schedule your DTS package to run, say every 5 minutes. <br />
2. Your DTS package will look for a file in a particular directory, if it finds it will execute and remove the file, otherwise it will simply exit.<br />
3. Your Baan session will put the file in the directory so that your DTS package can execute.<br />
<br />
Of course you would have to think about different scenarios of multiple sessions putting the file, so on and so forth.</div></div><hr />

The way I would attempt it is to use the SQL dtsrun utility this link gives details on it http://www.sqldts.com/default.aspx?301 <br />
To call that utility I guess you could use the baan run.prog() function to call it.one other thing is that I am assuming that the Baan and sql server are not split between two machines if that is the case I think you would have to install the sql enterprise management tools on the baan server.</div></div><hr />

I think Darren's idea may work better. I will try.</div></div><hr />
