<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">7th April 2004, 20:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Just upgraded to  Porting set 6.1c.07.03 from 6.1c.06.04<br />
Also have the new  BW Client c.74<br />
<br />
Opened Baan case to see if any tools objects needed upgrading, they said NO.<br />
<br />
We have an important interface session that reads an ASCII file and populates some tables. The session has been used for 4 years, after installation of the new porting set 6.1c.07.03 the session no longer works. During debug the problem is identified with the function seq.gets() no longer working as expected.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
first line is read in correctly,<br />
second line is read but the first character is not present.<br />
<br />
example:<br />
<br />
first line is &quot;12345&quot;<br />
second line is &quot;2345&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyone encounter this ? also anyone know what tools component the seq.gets() resides in ??</div></div><hr />

There has been a problem *(not portingset related)* with ASCII files. Search the knowledge base on CLIEOP (ASCII payment files for electronic banking).</div></div><hr />

I have loaded and am running the client without any problems.  I will keep you posted if/when our admin updates the porting set.<br />

I am not sure that is a good idea.  ~Vamsi once told me we need to keep these things in-sync and we haven't.  <br />

Every month we got a new toy/software package that was broken simply due to how new it was.  I feel your pain :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nick_rogers</div><div class="date">3rd May 2004, 22:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally got some answers, there is now a bug on this new version of the porting set and logged as defect #  219566  -  seq.skip function not working per programmers manual.<br />
<br />
Not sure if the seq.skip is used in the Exchange module...is so then Exchange schemes migh not work anymore.</div></div><hr />
