<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tion1976</div><div class="date">9th March 2023, 10:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I wonder what is wrong with a label tfgld005.year that I have customized in RO beside EN<br />
When I run the session with RO the form displays the label in EN<br />
There is something to do with the PVRC and their inheritance but I cannot figure it out<br />
My current VRC is B40Ulrc<br />
I am attaching the screens with the labels and P-VRC <br />
Please help me to understand what I should do to display year in Romanian as 'An financiar'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">9th March 2023, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably there is not enough room on the form to display a label of 14 characters. So, it falls back to the one that fits: the 4 character Year. If you copy the 4 character Year to your VRC and expire it, it will display the 2 character An. But also ensure you dump the form after changing the label.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th March 2023, 14:38</div></div><div class="posttext">If it was me - I would copy the form to the same VRC.  Edit it and make sure enough room for the label on the form.  And then I would, as mentioned, dump the form.   Also you are showing package ti and the form is in tf - so you may want to make sure tf is setup correctly also.<br />
<br />
  I know for a fact we went multiple years without bad VRC/package combination - I think we derived a dev from a standard baan vrc skipping our prd.  It would not find a change I had made - took me a bit to get it fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tion1976</div><div class="date">17th March 2023, 10:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I selected a label of type string(8) and i expected to see Sequence not &quot;Sequence No.&quot; that has 12 chars.<br />
I am attaching the screens now.<br />
The second screen shows that the table's VRC is current and the same as the expected label.<br />
I am still confused.  Please try to clarify more.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

your screenshot shows no labellength maintained.<br />
Only datatyp-length 8 is maintained<br />
Maybe fallback to standard is choosen.<br />
<br />

You are are right on the size. I confused data type length with label type. <br />
However, i do not understand what is fallback to standard means. I mean i have the label defined in the current P-VRC. What else matters in order that the fallback mechanism to find the label in the current P-VRC?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdittmar</div><div class="date">20th March 2023, 16:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
Fallback is used when no proper Label was found in your VRC.<br />
So the Label in standard is used.<br />
<br />
Do you have compiled the labels in your VRC ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Here is the one I mentioned that does not have everything we need to put components in dev. I could put stuff in tg dev all I want and it would never find the components.</div></div><hr />
