Now I want to control whether those user is online or not  in  script. Is there a any useful command to check this state ?  In unix I can check these users that loged on<br />
baan server by using (ps -ef |grep bshell6.1 ) May be we can get  information from that. But How can check it according to user ?<br />

Thanks for your suggestions ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
lets assume you have a file called &quot;users&quot;, containing your users login names.<br />
---start of file users---<br />
Frank<br />
Zappa<br />
bsp<br />
--- End of file users ---<br />
<br />
If you write the following script call chuser.sh<br />
---start of file chuser.sh---<br />
while read name<br />
do<br />
ps -ef | grep bshell | grep $name &gt; /dev/null<br />
echo &quot;$name $?&quot;<br />
done &lt; users<br />
---End of file chuser.sh---<br />
<br />
and start it with sh chuser.sh<br />
you will get the follwing output:<br />
Frank 1<br />
Zappa 1<br />
bsp 0<br />
if neither Frank nor Zappa but bsp has a bshell<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">19th January 2006, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">and I tried your code in my test server. it doesn't works properly or I don't understand your code exactly. For example I created users file. There was only root online.There are no user. When I run your code, I got these<br />
root 0<br />
sozturk 1<br />
test 1<br />
test 1<br />
test 1<br />
xxxx 1<br />
<br />
What does it mean ?   In my system there is no xxxx user . Only I inserted it into users file to test it !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">19th January 2006, 10:39</div></div><div class="posttext">what exactly is it that you don't understand?<br />
Only root has a zero (the grep for bshell AND root was successfull and therefor returned 0), all other names didn't.<br />
If you wish to know what users exist on your baan system, have a look at the contents of $BSE/lib/user. Filter away the filenames that have a '-' at the end (these are kind of backup copies) and voila ... you have a list of all usernames that have been converted to runtime.<br />
You only want to see online users? What about combining the script with a 'grep -v 1'?<br />
<br />
have fun<br />

<br />
You have to create a customised table and a display session on this customised table and in script of display session you have to first create a file which stores currently active users by giving <br />
shell(&quot;licmon6.1 -w &gt; /app/user/poldev/filename&quot;, RP_WAIT)<br />
<br />
which give you following <br />
<br />
Process ID<br />
User ID<br />
Server Name<br />
System Name<br />
Date &amp; Time<br />
<br />
store this information in your customised table and display the records.</div></div><hr />
