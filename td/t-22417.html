<br />
I'm looking for one solution about the following topic:<br />
<br />
I'm trying to develop one sesion in which I can maintain 2 different tables by means two forms.<br />
<br />
in the form1 I should maintain data corresponding to table fst801, but in the same session in the form2 I have to maintain data corresponding to table fst802. In form1 I have a field that contains a string that I have to pass as a parameter to the next form, Obviously the parameter that I will receive in form2 is the table primary key.<br />
<br />
I have declared the export and import in both different maintain sessions, but I realize that it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
How can I do this?<br />
<br />
I appreciate all answers about this.<br />
<br />

Is it possible for you to have 1 maintain session two forms.  In form1 you maintain table fst801 and when you click on form 2 it activates a sub-session (passing this primary key string). You could have the form overlay form 2 of the maintain session - making it look like 1 session with 2 forms, when it really is two sessions.  Or maybe you could do something like Maintain Purchase Order lines or Maintain production orders - in reality on these sessions you have a display at top and a maintain session on the bottom.  I have never really tried to do something like this but it may work for you.<br />
