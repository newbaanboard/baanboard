<br />
I need help from those who have LN systems.<br />
<br />
Previously in Baan4, I create many POs in the Print Purchase Order session. This is because layouts are different when we print to different kinds of printers.<br />
<br />
In Baan4, I could create many POs and then put them into the session. When we click on Print, a list of all the customized POs is show in a small dialog box and user can select the one for their individual printer.<br />
<br />
Now I want to do the same in LN but when I link a new PO with new report name into the session, no small dialog box appear. I can only modify the standard 440101000 report. This is not acceptable because we have several different kinds of printers in the company which we use to print our POs.<br />
<br />
Hope you understand my problem.<br />
<br />
thanks and regards</div></div><hr />

What's your service pack?<br />
Personally I don't think it is because of the installed solutions.<br />
Can you check the printing options in the print po session (tdpur4401m000).<br />
You are sure that you did set the printing options correctly?<br />
May be the order was already printed and you did not set the field Order Line Types to Print correctly?<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Double click your session in ttadv2500m000, changing session to diffrent type e.g. update save &amp; exit and then compile. Then revert back to your orginal setting and compile. It should work, some times I have faced same problem but got through by using this.<br />
<br />
You can link as many no. of reports as u wish this can be done by specific/link report to session.<br />
