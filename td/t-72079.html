<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st August 2019, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure of the question. I typically never created any references between my tables and the baan standard tables. So all I ever had to do was create RDD on my table. But with references and such you could have to all the tables involved - which would impact other users. In those rare cases we would schedule downtime to create them.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply,<br />
For your information,<br />
There is no link between std table and my custom table.<br />
This table is independent table there is no reference or not user anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">2nd August 2019, 10:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally crdd should be done when everybody is logged out because even though if you have put tx in the range done to crdd, standard process will do crdd for other related tables as well, for example if you have put reference in your tx table field to a field of standard table in tc, crdd will affect the standard table too, if you have put text field in your tx table, standard process will affect tttxt010, table too.<br />
<br />
So ideally everybody should be logged out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd August 2019, 14:16</div></div><div class="posttext">As Ajesh says ideally you would have everyone out, but for us If the table is independent of all baan tables - the for us the initial move it would be created without logging out the users.  Otherwise we would wait until afterhours to do crdd.</div></div><hr />
