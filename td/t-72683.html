<br />
we are using Infor LN and the number of extensions is rising constantly.<br />
<br />
When writing code I always comment it. However I sometimes find it hard to figure out what functionality is written e.g. in the table extension of tcibd001 etc.<br />
<br />
How do you organize your extensions?<br />
I thought about always writing a comment in the declarations hook like this:<br />
<br />
|*****************<br />
| functionality: populate cdf's/ calculate price/ etc <br />
| last modified by: xy<br />
| last modification date: 10/02/2020<br />

Your method is nice. Thank you for sharing.<br />
<br />
So, I will share mine too.<br />
<br />
Upon check-in process, there is a textbox requiring the developer to write commit messages similar to modern git. These messages can always be read in Extension History so that other developers can understand what has been going on on this specific extension.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is only a way that I think is usable and worth sharing but I am quite sure that there must be other ways.<br />
<br />
This might be not exactly what you are looking for but, I don't know, I feel like want to share something too. Maybe it is useful more or less.</div></div><hr />

sounds good. Where can I find the extension history?<br />

This you cannot read when using the comment method.<br />
<br />
When changing code, comments are good, but a summary of the main change in the text is crucial.<br />
<br />
It is even possible to &quot;temporarily&quot; go back to an older version, copy that version into a text buffer and revert to the current version.</div></div><hr />
