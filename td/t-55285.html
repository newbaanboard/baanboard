<br />
Trying to learn my way around the system and Ive been able to create a package, session, etc and now Im working on a report. Well I started with input fields, editing scripts, etc. Went to lunch and came back, look liked Baan timed out or crashed, so I restarted. Now when I try to go to the Maintain report and edit script or anything for that matter, i get the &quot;Report is locked by other user!!&quot;. Where in the system can I see whats locked and how can I unlock it? Might be a stupid question but Im on day 3 with Baan and I have NO idea how to unlock myself. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">12th August 2010, 16:26</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I just figured that out, Baan Tools&gt; DB Management&gt; MISC&gt; Remove App Locks &gt; then you can unlock your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GabrielVA</div><div class="date">12th August 2010, 16:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I was able to unlock myself. It appears that when my PC goe to sleep mode it triggers an error in the app and I have to restart itself thus the error. Baan doesnt like to &quot;sleep&quot; like Win 7 does. Ha! <br />
<br />
Ok one additional question, sorry if its stupid, ike I said new to Baan here, I want to create a report based off some table in the system. is this the correct way to do it? <br />

Hello,<br />
this way is possible but,<br />
later you have to link this report to a print session based on the main table.<br />
You can't be sure, that all inputfields of the report are supplied by the printsession.<br />
<br />
I think it's easier to locate an existing report which fulfills the requirement to &gt; 80% and copy this report to a new one.<br />
Afterwards modify the copied report as you want.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ill try to copy an exsiting report and then modify the input fields, layout etc to see if this is going to work.  Ive heard from someone here that I can perform MS SQL queries on data in the Baan system. So far Ive been able to conect to Baan using SQL MGT Studio but it looks like theres a pile of tables in there and I wouldnt know where to start when looking at data in a Baan table. <br />
<br />
So far this site has been insightful and VERY useful.</div></div><hr />

Hello GabrielVA,<br />
never use other tools for data manipulation.<br />
Only use the BaaN application logic.<br />
Simple queries can be done by using BaaN easy SQL in the tools section.<br />
<br />
