<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alex.bonutti</div><div class="date">2nd August 2017, 16:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear all,<br />
is it possible to set conditions on receiving users/e-mail addreses with DOM device? For example: I need to send a document to specific receivers if it is coming from a specific department. Both information is available on my document.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

Depending on the exact requirements you can either implement a custom receiver type 'department', or specify a receiver independent destination in your document type. In the condition for the receiver independent destination you can check whether an email has to be sent for the department and the address can be specified as a variable (e.g. #email#), which must be mapped in the report rule.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply, I managed to do it as explained.<br />
Is it possible to add the operating user in cc, despite the custom receiver type selected?<br />

Using a receiver independent destination it will always be a separate email (with the operating user in &quot;to&quot;).</div></div><hr />
