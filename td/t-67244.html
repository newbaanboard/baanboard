Please tell me how can I use vB code in baan?<br />
<br />
I want to increase font size of perticular field on report from script.<br />
<br />
Size <br />
The  tag allows you to change the size of your text. <br />
Usage [size=Option]value <br />
Example Usage this text is two sizes larger than normal <br />
Example Output this text is two sizes larger than normal <br />
<br />
Any other option please help without changing registry setup &amp; fonts for each client setting etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
There are multiple options to do that-<br />
<br />
1. Check the Font-size in report properties. Also, before printing the report, you can select preview option and set the font size for that report and save it as default whatever you like. <br />
2. Create a report using HTML<br />
3. Create a report using OpenXML<br />
4. Build your own program using IText in Java to print PDF report<br />
5. Create a report using any reporting tool BIRT/SSRS/Crystal<br />
6. If you use it frequently, you can buy a tool like Hidox (http://www.baanboard.com/node/3306)<br />
<br />
Or if you want to go beyond that, create a tool to read a file and design it using any language you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I think if I can create a device to get the output in HTML format &amp; in device script I will edit the HTML file to increase font size.<br />
<br />
I tried this one also but, the barcode is not appearing on the HTML file.<br />
It is appearing as on device &quot;D&quot;.<br />
So any option is there to keep the barcode output as it is on HTML file or I need to create barcode in HTML itself?<br />
<br />
If need to create the please provide a sample script to create barcode in html.<br />
I am using bc$(1005,6,text,...)<br />
i have attached the Baan barcode output, I need similar output.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

Never done that, but you can try using Barcode generators to create one and use that in your HTML report.<br />
<br />
Some threads which might help:-<br />

<br />
If you follow my first suggestion you can do it.<br />
<br />
Set font type as User Defined for those 2 fields. Now, when you print the report on client machine using Device Type as Windows Printer, you can select preview option and set the font size, style etc as needed for those 2 fields i.e. field and barcode. You can save that as default. There is no need of changing the registry.<br />
<br />
I guess, Infor will recommend you the same thing. Other than this, there are number of ways to customize it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Setting the font size &amp; style on preview mode needs to be done on each computer I think.<br />
<br />
If yes, then I can't go with that option to change on every user's system.<br />
<br />

Yes. It needs to be done on each client machine. But aFAIK, that't what standard offers for now. Other than that, you need to create your own tools/device to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vamsi_gujjula</div><div class="date">21st January 2015, 12:04</div></div><div class="posttext">if you are using bwprint  , i think you can set the fonts on report level as large , medium and small ( i dont think this should be done in individual client system  ), if you want that in ERPLN printer than you have to tweak the printer driver on server level ( although i dont know how to do that)<br />
<br />
If you want to toggle between font ( you can do that using to layouts with different fonts)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">21st January 2015, 12:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes,<br />
<br />
LN offers you max 10 characters per inch size. If you can manage with that, you can use the solution Vamsi suggested and it won't require settings at each client. You require individual setup only in case of User Font. But looking at the font size you need 10 cpi might not fit.</div></div><hr />

Is there any way to know which user fonts are already used or which user fonts already used in which report...?<br />

<br />
If you want to know about the fonts used at the report level you can query table ttadv330. If you want to know the fonts used at field level, you can query table ttadv334.</div></div><hr />
