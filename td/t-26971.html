<br />
Now i am using ODM to manager the attachment in baan . <br />
I want to know what's the difference between Area and mount Area ?<br />
Now i can attachment files in the server with session dmdoc4520m002, but in the client , when i click the File browse , it will prompt me :<br />
&quot;there is no approprite mounted area for your file , or the vault server is not running &quot;<br />
<br />
What 's the step to setup it ?<br />
<br />
thank you very much</div></div><hr />

<br />
A mounted area is a work area that is located on another PC than your own. This could be a server or another client. In order to set it up, do the following:<br />
<br />
-  define your own PC as host<br />
-  define the server (or another PC) where you want to locate the work area as host<br />
-  create a directory on the server that will serve as your work area and make sure that you have the correct authorisations for that directory<br />
-  in Baan, define a work area on the server and make sure that the path that you put there is the path as used on the server (e.g. C:\......)<br />
-  define this work area as a mounted area in the session 'mounted areas' and put the path as used from your own PC (= the relative path, e.g. \\server\....)<br />
<br />
Regardless of the correct set-up, I also ran into the same problem during an implementation as the one that you're experiencing (on Ln, FP2). This appeared to be a defect in the software that has now been solved by solution 212305 so also make sure you have that solution installed.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />
