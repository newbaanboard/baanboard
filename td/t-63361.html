I have no experience using the Group By function, although the help text states that it can be used to eliminate duplicates.<br />
I thought perhaps using order by tisfc010.pdno, tisfc010.opno desc and group by tisfc010.pdno, tisfc010.copo that it would do the trick, but I keep getting errors.<br />
<br />
Can someone shed some light on how I can accomplish this?  We have no programmer in house to create a &quot;proper&quot; report session for this.<br />
<br />
The complete query is attached.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">21st January 2013, 15:32</div></div><div class="posttext">What I would do is just select all the records for tisfc001 in the query itself.  Then I would go into the report script and put in the detail before layout section a query for tisfc010.  You would pull in the query tisfc001.mitm, tisfc001.pndo and then put something like in the report.  Of course keep in mind you don't want to keep generating the report.<br />
<br />
select  tisfc010.*<br />
from    tisfc010<br />
where  tisfc010._index1 = {:tisfc001.pdno}<br />
and     tisfc010._copo = tcyesno.yes<br />
order by tisfc010.opno    | I would use desc if I wanted the last count point<br />
as set with 1 rows<br />
selectdo<br />
selectempty<br />
    lattr.print = false       | Skip those without a count point<br />
endselect</div></div><hr />
