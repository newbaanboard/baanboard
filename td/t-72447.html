<br />
We are on Infor Ln 10.4. We use Infor LN classic tools development (No LN Studio and No Reporting Studio).<br />
<br />
We are planning to upgrade from 10.4 to 10.7. I shall appreciate if someone can shed light on following points:<br />
<br />
Can we use classic Tools development approach in 10.7?<br />
Is it necessary to use LNUI? Can we use Worktop in 10.7?<br />
What are the different IDE's available in LN 10.7? (LN Studio, Reporting Studio etc)<br />
Any separate license required for using these IDE's?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Vishal</div></div><hr />

Yes, you can but only if the server is on-premise (not on Infor cloud).<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it necessary to use LNUI? Can we use Worktop in 10.7?<br />
It is not necessary to use LNUI. You can use BECS with an embedded command &quot;-- -set NO_WORKTOP=1&quot; and it will work.<br />
<br />
<br />
What are the different IDE's available in LN 10.7? (LN Studio, Reporting Studio etc)<br />
I only know LN Studio but I have never used it because I still use classic Tools development. For report, I use SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Service) but it is not recommended because Infor is pushing Report Personalization using Report Designer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any separate license required for using these IDE's?<br />
For LN Studio, I think yes but needs more confirmation because, as I mentioned, I have never really used it.<br />
For SSRS, I think it depends on your SQL Server.<br />
For Report Personalization, I don't think you need separate license apart from LN development.<br />
<br />
If any of this information is wrong, feel free to correct me because this is all I know at the moment.<br />
I will be appreciated to know more, especially to know what I currently misunderstand.</div></div><hr />

But haven't been able to work with it yet. Hope to be able to on Monday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did some first things in the LN Studio now and the benefits are obvious. All kind of analysis tools and handy nice-to-haves only a few keystrokes away. <br />
<br />
We ran into some dynamic sessions which insisted the LN Studio to be used to alter the forms (at the risk of losing &quot;some&quot; information).<br />
<br />
I miss my gvim though.</div></div><hr />

After using -- -set NO_WORKTOP=1 in BWConfig, I was able to use Worktop with 10.7. But once again after removing the flag -- -set NO_WORKTOP=1 from BWConfig, when I put it again, i am getting same error.<br />
<br />
Any clue why this is happening?<br />

What is the error?<br />
Maybe there is extra space when you put it back, or maybe other changes you made affect the configuration.</div></div><hr />

Actually first time it worked was with BECS (without worktop). And next time I tried with worktop, where it did not work.<br />
<br />
So, I think when I am starting with BECS and double clicking on configuration file, it works.<br />
<br />
But does that mean Infor 10.7 does not support worktop?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

From what I have tried, I cannot configure Worktop to use LN (I tried 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7). The only method I found is to use BECS with that specific command (the answer I posted earlier). However, to say that Infor LN 10.7 does not support Worktop is too bold for me to say because there may be a solution that it may work, but I may just have not found it yet.<br />
<br />
Let's wait and see if anyone knows such way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">24th December 2019, 14:02</div></div><div class="posttext">When I first heard it, I could not believe it either, because it seemed so odd. Not in line the company did in the past. You could even use the ascii interface using BW (on Triton). And now farewell to a widely spread user interface. I know, the LN UI / Web UI transition would not be fast if the old Worktop ship was not being burnt, but still. We now face a multiple point transition only by upgrading: tools differs, user interface differs: completely different look and feel, the grouped sessions from worktop are not really available (importable in a different look and feel).<br />
<br />
Do get me well, some of these changes are for the better, but I am afraid the UI is not as intuitive and straightforward as the worktop (man in the middle) interface was.<br />
<br />
Probably new winds blow.<br />
<br />
Another (imho) great loss is the fact that there is no derivation structure provided for the extensibilities. I see no way to maintain different extensions for different package-VRC and thus package combinations.</div></div><hr />
