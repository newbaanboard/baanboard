<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">23rd August 2006, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a customized session with a form type 2.  10 occurences show up on the session at a time and there are three fields per occurence which are display and two fields per occurence which are maintainable by the user.  The two maintainable fields belong to the main table associated with the session. <br />
<br />
I have just added two additional form fields which hold variables the user will populate when they start the session (these fields are needed when the user clicks 'continue' and the records are processed by the session script).  The problem I'm having is that the form field order goes in the following order:<br />
<br />
Variable field one {TAB}<br />
Variable field two {TAB}<br />
Occurance 1 field one {TAB}<br />
Occurance 1 field two {TAB}<br />
Variable field one {TAB}<br />
Variable field two {TAB}<br />
Occurance 2 field one {TAB}<br />
Occurance 2 field two {TAB}<br />
<br />
The desired behavior would be the following:<br />
<br />
Variable field one {TAB}<br />
Variable field two {TAB}<br />
Occurance 1 field one {TAB}<br />
Occurance 1 field two {TAB}<br />
Occurance 2 field one {TAB}<br />
Occurance 2 field two {TAB}<br />
<br />
I have tried several different configurations of the field order when maintaining the form and have been unsuccessful.  I have also searched the forums and haven't found anything useful either.  The only thing I did find which I may be able to use is the to.field() function, but the sessions flow is quirky (users would not approve).<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have any suggestions?  Due to the nature of the data I cannot make the two variable fields part of my main table and use a form type 3.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help.</div></div><hr />

Try making it 'Single Occurance' and Field Type = Input Only.  Also check 'mandatory' and will need to fill it before they leave, if you want.  Then, use the command 'input' to get to it on start up.  I used this code<br />
<br />
<br />
form.1:<br />
init.form:<br />
        input(&quot;my.single.occ.variable&quot;)<br />
        execute(modify.set)                       |* takes them to modify the first occ</div></div><hr />

What I did was in the after.input I set a variable to true. Then as long as I was in add.set mode and this variable was true I set attr.input to false.  It took me a while to figure which section to use - then the user decided they want the field for each record.</div></div><hr />

Based on your input here is what I had to do.  This customized session is based on the need for multi-line so I did the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Kept the form at type 2 (multi-occ + main)<br />
 Changed the form types for those two 'variable' fields to &quot;Input Only&quot;<br />
 In the session script under form.1-init.form section:<br />
<br />
 execute(find.data) (so all my occurences and their 'extra' data from other tables displayed first thing)<br />
 input(&quot;single.occ.one&quot;)<br />
 input(&quot;single.occ.two&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything works fine now!  Thank you very much!</div></div><hr />
