<br />
Here I have this script which I put on my report. However I can not get the tot.field increase with each record. When I display the &quot;tot.field&quot; variable in my report it always shows as 1 .<br />
<br />
Any suggestions ? <br />
<br />
I am guessing it is a simple logic problem I have but I seem to get stuck with this for hours.... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dogueke</div><div class="date">23rd December 2003, 16:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only three sections. Header, Detail and After field (rpt.yil)<br />
They all use the layout 1 <br />
<br />
the report uses variables from the session script. So there are no table columns that are printed in the report. This is infact a simplified version of my problem: summing a variable called &quot;rpt.perc.amnt&quot; in the after field rpt.yil of the report.<br />
<br />
Since I ran into problems, I decided to make a report variable and make a running sum of it and display the total in the after.field section ...  <br />
<br />
I tried to use 1.0 but there is no difference :( <br />
<br />
<br />
is there any hope ? you think ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd December 2003, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">There is always hope - just not sure I can find the answer.  First in debug mode does it get to that statement?  Step through the script and see if it hits the statement and that it works.  Then continue stepping until you print the variable to see what it prints.<br />
<br />
Did you add this field as input to the report? I do not do this for variables I calculate in a script. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">23rd December 2003, 17:17</div></div><div class="posttext">As Mark said, try not declaring the variable in the report script.  Just declare it as an input field of the report, it should compile and hopefully not reset like that.  The variables declared as input variables share the declaration with the report script, and don't have that problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dogueke</div><div class="date">23rd December 2003, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Amazingly it worked... I thought I tried that before ?!?? <br />
<br />
thank you for the suggestions. Yes it was the declaration of the variable... I took out the variable from report input variables and now it works fine.<br />
<br />
I think my main problem is that I do not grasp how the algorithm of the report program works... but the debugging is a good way to learn that I guess. A bit late to find that out now but (after 6 months) ...<br />
Thanks for pointing that out Mark :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">just_fro</div><div class="date">27th December 2003, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">When a report is to be printed, a script or query has to collect all data first. <br />
By defining an input field, the report writer assumes the field to be present in the data.pool which is passed to the report.<br />
If the script/query that provides the 'raw' data doesn't hold this variable, it's value is NULL (0, empty, &quot;&quot; whatever).....<br />
<br />
<br />
So in your script this means: tot.field is passed with value 0.0<br />
<br />
before.program resets this to 0.0 (wow!)<br />
detail.1 sets it to 1<br />
next detail gets value 0 from data.pool and sets it to 1 again.....<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides this, why don't you simply use the 'after.field'-sections to get 'Totals' / 'Counts' / 'Sums' (there build for that purpose!)</div></div><hr />
