<br />
I have wrote a script (autoit v3) to pull data from a text file and enter them into baan. <br />
<br />
When various message boxes pops-up, the script identify them with title of the message box and take action. But certain case their is only one title (for example: Data management article) for various messages.<br />
<br />
The script has to identify the messages to take the correct action, like undo an entry or continue input. <br />
<br />
From the message box which pops-up, I can get the title correctly, but the message in the following format:<br />
DsCmwindow-2<br />
DsCmwindow-5<br />
DsCgwindow<br />
DsCrowColumn<br />
<br />
I think they used variables to display. when I try to pull the title and the message from different applications, it works fine. <br />
<br />
Any solutions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

Is it possible to test the data before loading it in Baan to see if it would generate one of these messages?  Then give a warning or error report yourself, or even fix it - whatever you need.  I know in some cases this may not be possible, but it was all I could think of.  I typically try to trap as many messages or errors before loading attempting to load the data. Sometimes I just have to wait for the users to screw up before I can track down what I need to do.<br />
