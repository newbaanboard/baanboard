<br />
I would like to populate the pop-up report menu from a different set of reports other than the current session's reports(the set of reports are from another package, I can't put them in the reports of the session). My session is in ts but my reports belong to td. So when I do execute(print.data), I would like to populate the td reports instead of ts reports. Then I can call my FS with the selected report code.<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to Session - &gt; Specific -&gt; Reports - &gt; Specific - &gt; Link Report To Session <br />
<br />
And select the report you want to link. Module doesn't matter just make sure the VRC's are same.<br />
<br />
Note:- I am not sure about your Version. On LN it works like this.<br />
<br />
Also, you can use brp.* functions to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, I typed module instead of Package(corrected it)! in BaaN IV, you can not enter the package when linking the reports to a session.<br />
<br />
Thanks again in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. You cannot link them. But you can do a work around using brp.* functions to use the reports present in other packages. And the other thing you can do is to copy that report in your package and link it. Depends on how you want to implement it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cherokee</div><div class="date">10th July 2014, 17:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help again.<br />

In brp.* functions, you have to pass/know the report code you want to open before calling the brp.* function. What I want is that the user chooses from some particular reports available in a session then use a FS to pass the report selected.<br />

Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">10th July 2014, 23:08</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know the reports have to be in the same package. So I would probably just copy them across to the package you need them in.  The only other option I can think of is to create a dummy list of reports. This way they can pick them - by the name. But then in the code you have to do all the brp and spool commands to get the right report to run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">11th July 2014, 08:01</div></div><div class="posttext">And as I said it depends on how you implement. You can give drop down option on form to select report and based on that use brp.* functions. And as Mark and I said, if you dont want any script to be written or any form changes; just copy the report in your package.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in baaniv  either 3-gl or creating dummy report () then map the dummy report with the one which you want  in the 4gl script ( although its like a merry go around)<br />
<br />
i feel bhushan's work around  is better one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought about the copy of the reports to the ts package but, I don't like to maintain four reports instead of two. Removed FS and added zoom to td session carring over selection values for printing session.<br />

Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
