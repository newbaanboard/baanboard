<br />
I have a requirement to update the text field on table tcibd001. I used the  standard function TEXT.REWRITE , but I found that the text automatically gets written with a &quot;\n&quot; character after almost 72characters.  <br />
<br />
As I need to see my data as a continuous line , I am currently retreiving the text again from the  tttxt001 table and  doing a search for the new line character and replacing the same. This works fine.  <br />
<br />
But I need to know if there is any other way to prevent this from happening , as i wanted to avoid this extra querying. <br />
Is this part of the standard functionality of the text.rewrite / text.write functions ? Can we disable this in any way from the function parameters ?  <br />
<br />
Looking forward to your help! :)</div></div><hr />

Check the Text Group (tttxt1110m000) which you are using to write to the file. You can try changing the window size.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your reply. <br />
I checked the window size as you  had suggested and YES if i changes this to 100 for eg , the new line character (\n) is added after 100 lines and the window shows the text line by line again , but now each line with max size of 100.<br />
<br />
Anyway this will not solve my problem as I have more than 100 chracters in a line and I need them to be shown as 1 single line :(:(<br />

Thanks for your help..</div></div><hr />

Then do a text.write to a file using that window, then just do a text.rewrite to pull it back in.  No searching for the new line character.  Of course I do not know how many characters you are talking about.</div></div><hr />
