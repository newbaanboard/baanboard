<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy2609</div><div class="date">2nd July 2013, 11:33</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to read a Windows environmental variable (%temp%) in a Baan 4GL script, in order to create a file for editing in Windows.  I can already create a file for editing on a PC, where I can create a directory or where the temporary directory is already known, but I need to do this for a Citrix client setup, where each user has their own temporary folder and no permissions to create a directory.  Therefore, I need the program to read the variable above, in order to allow any user to create the file successfully. Has anyone any thoughts on this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">2nd July 2013, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">SERVER SIDE ENV. VARIABLES:-<br />
<br />
string value(100)<br />
<br />
value = getenv$(&quot;PATH&quot;) | to get the variable value of PATH<br />
<br />
<br />
For getting the list of all the environment variables you can just use:-<br />
<br />
set &gt; file_name<br />
<br />
e.g set &gt; C:\test.txt<br />
<br />
The file will now contain the list of Environment Variables with their value.<br />
<br />
If you want to do this using baan 4GL, just use this function:-<br />
<br />
run.prog(&quot;cmd /c &gt; C:\test.txt&quot;,&quot;&quot;,RP_NOWAIT)<br />
<br />
CLIENT SIDE ENV. VARIABLES:-<br />
<br />
app_start(&quot;cmd /c &gt; C:\test.txt&quot;,&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;)<br />
<br />
Then you can just read this file to get the required info.</div></div><hr />

Han - the 'getenv$()' function retrieves the environmental variables of the Baan O/S OK, but not of the user's client machine O/S, so it's not suitable for my needs.<br />
<br />
Bhushanchanda - it is the process of creating a file that I want to achieve, ultimately.  I did also consider the method you have proposed, but this involves creating a list file in a known location ('C:\', in your example).  On the Citrix client machines, there will not necessarily be a 'C:\' - and if there is, there is no permission to create a file there.  Therefore, I need to know the temporary file location (from %temp%), before creating the file there.<br />
<br />
Essentially, there is a file on the Baan O/S that I want to copy to the client's temporary directory, allow it to be edited and copy it back.  I have achieved this on a PC with no problem, but on the Citrix client, I need to know the (user-specific) temporary file location.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time, both.</div></div><hr />

Try this. I am not sure what the infrastructure is on Citrix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">2nd July 2013, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Alernatively,<br />
<br />
You can maintain a share folder on each client machine with a same name and you can access it using Baan 4GL.<br />
<br />
Just get the host name using hostname$() command and then you can create your files and do the functions required. Again, I am not aware of the infra provided by Citrix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Han Brinkman</div><div class="date">2nd July 2013, 15:25</div></div><div class="posttext">And create.local.file(), according to the manual you should be able to use $BSE_TMP. Not sure if that works with citrix.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps you can use a path that uses the users loginname? E.g. the users home dir?</div></div><hr />

Can you use the temp directory in that location?  I know you can set a variable to be used on the server side in the .bwc file, but I do not know how to set it based off a windows variable.  For example in the command line of the bwc file I can enter -set LTEMP=&quot;c:\temp&quot;.  Then on our baan server I have a unix environment variable called LTEMP.  Now what I do not know how to do is set it to a windows variable that could change depending on the user.</div></div><hr />

<br />
	target = &quot;${BSE_TMP}\&quot; &amp; filename &amp; str$(utc.num())<br />

		|* Error - source file not copied to the destination file<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
We have Citrix VMs too and it works.<br />
<br />
You have to give full write access to the folder (for owners, administrator &amp; users) - <br />
<br />
C:\Users\nprao\AppData\Local\Infor\BW\ERPLN\tmp<br />
<br />
I think they changed the tmp path in between the versions it used to be -<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files (x86)\Infor\BW\ERPLN\tmp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy2609</div><div class="date">3rd July 2013, 14:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all.  Thanks for all your contributions.  In the end, I solved this by trial and error and also by checking other threads:<br />
(http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7329&amp;highlight=temp+path)<br />
<br />
The solution is ridiculously simple.  The client temporary variable '%TEMP% is resolved automatically in the Baan 'server2client' function - something which I originally looked at, but the syntax has to be as below:<br />
ret = server2client(baan.server.path.and.filename, &quot;${TEMP}\&quot; &amp; filename.to.create.in.client.temp.folder, false, false).<br />
<br />
This creates a copy of the file that originates on the Baan O/S in the temporary directory of any user that opens it, irrespective of the location of that directory.  (I then used 'app_start', enabling editing and 'client2server' to copy it back to the Baan O/S.)<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

It operated as expected from the menu browser, but webUI appears to change the &quot;$(TEMP}&quot; to a java-related location, even though the environment variable that LN can read still referred to the non-webUI location.  I haven't tried it on the lastest webUI yet, but versions from late 2012 had this issue.</div></div><hr />
