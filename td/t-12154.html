So I was wondering if anyone can tell me what direction to take.<br />
<br />
Here is the situation:<br />
A user in finance keys in a purchase invoice and zooms to Invoice from business partner (tccom4522m000) and searches for the information by clicking on the find button. Well when she enters in a new invoice for the same bp and zooms for the bp info and clicks on find, it doesn't go to the last record where she left off. She said this was set up that way at the beginning but they changed their mind and now they changed their minds again and want it changed back to the way it was. <br />
<br />
Is there something that has to be changed for the individual user or globally? Any help on this would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />
