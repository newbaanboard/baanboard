<br />
can i ask you a question about Extensions and Customer defined fields?<br />
<br />
My Problem is as follows:<br />
- created a table extension on table tisfc001<br />
- created a customer defined field tisfc001.cdf_sord <br />
that field has to be filled with the order number from tdsls402<br />
<br />
My problem is, i just cannot set the value in the CDF. I can update other standard fields with my extension but i cannot fill the Customer defined Field<br />
<br />
What i already did:<br />
- defined the CDF in Declarations<br />
    extern  domain  ticdf___str030  tisfc001.cdf_sord<br />
<br />
- set the fill of the CDF in Before.Save<br />
        | SLS Number<br />
        select * from tdsls402<br />
        where tdsls402.apdo = :tisfc001.pdno<br />
        as set with 1 rows<br />
        selectdo<br />
                tisfc001.cdf_sord = tdsls402.orno<br />
        endselect<br />
<br />
- set the fill of the CDF in the CDF Field Logic Section in Update<br />
| SLS Number<br />
        select * from tdsls402<br />
        where tdsls402.apdo = :tisfc001.pdno<br />
        as set with 1 rows<br />
        selectdo<br />
                tisfc001.cdf_sord = tdsls402.orno<br />
        endselect<br />
<br />
 I also tried to set the code in every other section possible, it just wont do the trick. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Can you please help a bro out here?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

Use a local variable and explicitly export each CDF in the ‘select’ clause if needed:<br />

You can replace the ‘export’ function with ‘put.var’, which is the longer version of export where you can specify the process id, which is always the current process ID (‘pid’ predefined variable).<br />

<br />
<br />
Plus, in an extension on table extension level, you cannot use commit.transaction as you are already in a transaction. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Try to use 'export' or 'put.var' for loading the CDF field.  Direct assignments don't seem to work when using db.update instead of DAL.<br />
 <br />
Use a local variable and explicitly export each CDF in the ‘select’ clause if needed:<br />
<br />

selectdo<br />
       if (from.date &lt;&gt; to.date) then   | update CDF when date is different<br />
           ret = export(“tsacm101.cdf_rvdt”, to.date)    | put the contents of to.date into the tsacm101.cdf_rvdt field<br />
           db.update(ttsacm101, db.retry)<br />

I removed the declaration but still no luck :(<br />
