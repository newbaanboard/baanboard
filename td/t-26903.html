I need a pointer on this one.  I have a preprinted purchase order form, that has a detail line 10 that contains a text field.  When several POs are sent to the printer at the same time the first PO ignores the page length command and prints too long.  All the others page break properly.<br />
<br />
I have tried to add in an extra line needed fro that detail - no luck.<br />
<br />
I have tried reducing the lage length - no luck.<br />
<br />
Here is the script area for detail 10:<br />
<br />
detail.10:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	if lattr.print and lattr.lineno &gt; 55 then	<br />
		page()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
        if ( line = 1 and prnt.pric = tcyesno.yes ) then<br />
                fill.incl.values()<br />
                update.line.totals.isls0006()<br />
        endif<br />
<br />
Any pointers would be appreciated.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

One thing I recall was that I had to set the device to send form feed after each page on maintain device.  I do not recall the specifics, but I remember some reports would run over the page length.  I am not sure if that is applicable here.  Of course we use Unix based printing so I am not sure if that was part of my issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcropp</div><div class="date">19th April 2006, 21:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks but the device is using a conversion program (ttstpconv) converting the output to ascii.  Therefore it won't allow you to set a form feed.  What has me puzzled as to why this just affects the first page.  If you have a short winded description in the first PO and a long winded one on the second it works fine.  Reverse the situation and it runs over into a preprinted section.<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th April 2006, 03:30</div></div><div class="posttext">What happens if you run it straight to a printer with plain paper?  Does it do the same thing?  Have you put the report in debug mode and tried to trace through what is happening?  I am just wondering if the layouts that get printed are different from the first to the second.</div></div><hr />
