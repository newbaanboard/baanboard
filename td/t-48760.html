you must be maintaining some flag or status field...against that every status is  if (&quot;Invoice to BP&quot; is created) then<br />
field.name = &quot;tccom.itst.doubtful&quot;<br />
endif<br />
<br />
this should work..and if you are not maintaining any flag then you should.</div></div><hr />

Hi Prashant,<br />
<br />
Could you please elaborate your answer? I am not sure if I could understand what you are trying to say.</div></div><hr />

The DALs also could be a good place.<br />
Maybe the default is taken from there.<br />

The only method that would work was using Qkey.  The problem was the session itself set the defaults for some of the fields - changing the form, the database or defaults would not work.  We had to use qkey to trace through each event to find where the field was initialized - then we could override what the script was doing.</div></div><hr />
