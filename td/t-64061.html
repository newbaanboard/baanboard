I have same problem with some reports.<br />
First step I generate XML file with  SSRS design device. In this file some variables are blank. if i print same report with display device and then again with SSRS design, then all of data are correct. Does anyone have any suggestion ?<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Check if all the fields are included in the report input fields. Include it if not exists, compile the report. Delete the existing xml and recreate it. Import it again in SSRS and check if you get them.<br />
<br />
Also check if there are any conditions which are not allowing those fields during generating the xml file.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply.<br />
Report is standard purchase orders. first time i print a PO on SSRS device : some info are blank. Second time i print same PO with display device and ALL info are correct. Third time i print same PO on SSRS device and in this case ALL info are present in xml file. <br />
All info are correct with SSRS if i print BEFORE with display device.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Giuseppe</div></div><hr />

<br />
May be SSRS device is not able to generate the tmp file in the $BSE\tmp folder. Though I am not sure, I ll need to check. <br />
<br />
What you can do is, print a new PO with SSRS device and check if any tmp file is created in $BSE\tmp. If not, then its a file permission issue. You can give full rights to everyone for $BSE\tmp folder then and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggig</div><div class="date">15th January 2014, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I have full permission into LN server.<br />
File is present on BSE\tmp.<br />
Only few data (Always strings : adress,... ) are blank if i don't print before with display device. <br />
Other test : when i change po number same info are blank at first time. after reprint with D, and reprinting with SSRS all is correct.<br />
<br />

<br />
Try deleting the field from SSRS report and adding it again. Try refreshing it. Have you done any additional formatting for those fields?<br />
<br />
There are sometimes uncertain problems with SSRS, you just need to play around and you will find out the exact problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">15th January 2014, 21:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried the same in my 10.2 and 10.2.1 environments, but see no differences after choosing display device.<br />
If you post the files here, I can have a look. Ensure that there is no confidential data in it!<br />
So, perform the following steps:<br />
1. Start tdpur4401m000<br />
2. Select the order to be printed and the options<br />
3. Print to designer device<br />
4. Rename $BSE/tmp/ier_&lt;user&gt;_tdpur440102000.xml to ier_before<br />
5. Print to display<br />
6. Print to designer device<br />
7. Rename $BSE/tmp/ier_&lt;user&gt;_tdpur440102000.xml to ier_after<br />
<br />
Post ier_before and ier_after, or just the differences, here. A screenshot of tdpur4401m000 (with the selected options) may help as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can be a good case for support If it is working fine in SSRS after printing on Display device.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rrocks23</div><div class="date">27th January 2014, 07:42</div></div><div class="posttext">last(variable) or sum(variable) or first(variable) .... etc<br />
<br />
Try any of these on SSRS reporting and you will get the values. It worked for me  hope it works for u too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggig</div><div class="date">27th January 2014, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi rocks23,<br />
I don't understand. Could you explain what you mean with last(variable),.... ?<br />
Giuseppe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rrocks23</div><div class="date">28th January 2014, 12:23</div></div><div class="posttext">In ssrs report design , when you add a field .. you get aggregate option such as sum , add ,last , first ...etc . In that you will get LAST , FIRST ....</div></div><hr />
