U have to configure the IIS smart host to point to ur actual SMTP  and write an asp or VB code to send mail with / without attachment .<br />
<br />
Using Outlook automation also u can send a message . But there it always ask a question to the user whether or not to send the message .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sukesh75</div><div class="date">4th June 2007, 08:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on how one wants to send a mail. If you want to send an output of a report to someone, all you have to do is to have a mail profile created on the machine you want to send to with a valid mail account and at the reporting menu, you just press on the &quot;send&quot; option and it creates a mail message with the report attached to be sent in a .bpf format...You could automate this using some macro applications or even a vb code...<br />
<br />
However, if you want a mail to be sent at the trigger of any event, my best guess is to have a script written within the session which does that. Or if you have the trigger module active, you could try on with that...<br />
<br />
So which way do you want to send the mail? <br />
