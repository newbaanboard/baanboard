<br />
We use the AFS for purchase invoice auto matching with receipts, but we found it was high process speed when less than 500 records, but it is very slowly to process records more than 1000, and even we spent 5 hours to process 3000 records, it effective our progress.<br />
So, my question, its performance relates with AFS buffer size? if yes, what can we adjust to improve? if no, what can we do for performance?<br />
<br />
Thank u very much<br />

You can also look at how you are opening and closing the sessions - I can't remember which sessions it was, but I found it worked consistently if I opened the session, processed a record, closed the session. Rather than open a session, process all the records, then close the session. If I recall correctly after two or three runs it would abort.</div></div><hr />
