<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">8th September 2010, 18:41</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, TFGLD3402m000 Print Trial Balance includes standard reports from Baan such as TFGLD340211000.  User wants to keep this report but make some changes to it and create a new report out of it. Seems fairly straight forward task.<br />
<br />
I copy the 340211000 report AS IS to a new name 340211002 for example, compile it and no errors show up. Add the new report into the session as an additional entry.  I have NOT changed the report in any way at this point ...<br />
<br />
I exit out of Baan, re renter and run the session, choose the new report and it will not work. The last line of values in the report repeats itself in the details section over and over again instead of all the correct details content.<br />
<br />
Rather odd !   Any suggestions ? We do have Development licences.<br />
<br />
I can make changes to the content of the original report and as long as I don't change the name of the report, it is fine.<br />
<br />
Infor suggests a non specific solution which may or may not help but it needs a ton of dependencies so we are leery to install it ....<br />
<br />
Suggestions what we can do here ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th September 2010, 19:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Well for just changing a report you should not even have to exit the session, much less baan.  Have you tried debugging the report?  Do you have the session script?  Sometimes session scripts do different things based off the report selected(report number or name).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaanInOhio</div><div class="date">8th September 2010, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Some sessions use program scripts that have logic dependent on the selected report number and/or group.  This is one of those sessions.  Therefore, if you copied a standard report that is in report group 1 and report number 1 to a different group and/or number, you will have to change the program script to also use the new report number/group where the 1's are checked.  You can find these by looking for predefined variables &quot;reportgrp&quot; and &quot;reportno&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">8th September 2010, 20:17</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I check those things out, thanks. I normally don't exit after creating reports and restarting Baan but when things started looking strange i figured it was worth a shot ....<br />
<br />
I'll take a boo through and see what happens ... thanks for the tips ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">8th September 2010, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Ha, good call guys, thanks for the detail BaaninOhio, I don't do this very much. <br />
<br />
I ended up changing the working report in position 1, 1 to 1,5 and put my non working report into the old 1,1 position and now it works as it should and the original report is now busted. <br />
<br />
So i gotta read up on some debug commands to try and find those reportgrp and reportno fields and see what I can find out and change there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">15th September 2010, 22:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Ended up needing Infor to create a solution patch to fix this one session up ...</div></div><hr />
