<br />
 We are facing issues with IR Report. We created one Push report for Work Order from LN. When we run this report for few Order, we are seeing weird issue as few fields are displayed as Blank for first time but if we are printing same report one more time we are able to see those field on report. When we are pushing data with designer and testing in design we are facing same issues as fields are blank in first run and getting populated from second report.<br />
<br />
When we ran same report with LN with Preview Device, It is printing all data for all orders and all time. Does any one seen this kind of issues in IR Reports<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated and also let me know if more information required. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

So first make sure all the fields passed from the report script to the report are included in the input fields.  Then check any report script fields and make sure they are not on the input fields to the report.  I believe in my case I had included a field from my report script as an input field to the report.  I know it had to do with report input fields - so make sure those are correct.</div></div><hr />

Probably the data you need it not read by the session yet when the session sends the first data to the report. When running the second time, the session has still the values from the previous run and then they are available in the XML.</div></div><hr />

Any Idea how to proceed in this case.</div></div><hr />
