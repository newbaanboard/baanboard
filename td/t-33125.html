Can someone tell me how to write a condition script for text fields? I couldn't just write even a return(&quot;&quot;) statement in the text editor. It comes up with numerous errors.<br />
<br />

Hi Sachin,<br />
<br />
I want to write the current date and time as a text for each record that is imported. Suppose I import new items. If I look at the Item text of any item, I can find out when it was imported or it was overwritten recently etc.<br />
This is the purpose. Hope at least this Sachin does not disappoint me.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
few years ago i have solved this problem creating a new table (with index1 = tiitm001.index1) for extra data for items. in this table you can put fields date, time when item was created and date, time when item was modified, and why not the logname$ for creation or modification.<br />
<br />
hope its help you,<br />
and sorry for my so bad  english:confused: <br />

<br />
You could use the text.write() function to create the text fields<br />
