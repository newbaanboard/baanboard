<br />
I have a requirement to execute a piece of code(3GL Script) after the execution of a standard session 'Change Company'. <br />
I have tried writing the logic in after.command of end.program command in session extension of change company. But the logic is not getting triggered as the after.choice will not trigger for end.program and abort.program.<br />
 Can some one help me in achieving this..<br />
<br />
Thank you in Advance.</div></div><hr />

I would try before.command of end.program and call the command.super() to execute the possible before.choice of the standard session first. But note that Change Company is a rather strange session. It shows ttdsk2007m000, but under the hood it is ttdsk2003m000 (you can see that in the session properties).</div></div><hr />

when we do change company, the Menu Browser will be refreshed based on the Roles for the user.<br />
we have multiple companies, there will be different roles for the user in different companies, So when the users changes the company, I will update the roles (in when.field.changes section of company) from the custom table to the roles table.<br />
But when the change company session ends, I need to update the roles table with the users default company roles(if he restarts he will needs to display the menu based on default companies roles).<br />
<br />
So I need to trigger the insertion logic after the Change Company Session Ends...</div></div><hr />

We always had them log into the only other company we had with production.  We created company logins - we only had 1 other company (not a copy of production, but a simulation company) and not many users.  So they had their production id's like mark_h and another with XXXmark_h. Like I said only 1 other company and only a few users. This way they got different dem flows for the 2 companies.</div></div><hr />
