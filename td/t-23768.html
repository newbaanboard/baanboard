Is there a possibility that someone has developed an extension to the Baan static form to accomodate radio buttons?<br />

Our Baan version is 4c4</div></div><hr />

Square box that is checked rather than round (box) thta has dot in the middle.  Both abot the same size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">18th April 2005, 22:51</div></div><div class="posttext">You can use the domain 'tgyenox' instead of tcyesno.  That uses the checkbox automatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lsatenstein</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 05:13</div></div><div class="posttext">With the tgyenox check box, I have to change all the other entries to NO for the box that is checked as YES. <br />
<br />
True radio buttons would handle that. Most high school graduates and Baan end-users know about radio buttons. <br />
<br />
It is time that the GUI interface, for Baan 4c4 had a facelift, as well as for Baan 5, with its availability of dynamic forms. That facelift should include radio buttons and the ability to use colors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tjbyfield</div><div class="date">19th April 2005, 08:30</div></div><div class="posttext">The face lift is ERP-LN6.1.  <br />
<br />
There will never be a face lift to BaanIV nor is it reasonable to expect one. <br />
<br />
There is the recently announce Browser based product that is applicable to baanIV abd LN6.2. It may have things you like.  <br />
<br />
I think you may be surpprised at the number of users who still like the ASCII interface. The will point to the considerably faster input without the need for silly mouse etc.</div></div><hr />

I still like the ASCII screens, dont have to deal with all those desktop software upgrades, corrupted bwc/wtd's, registries, shortcuts, java version compatibilities with IE or Mozilla etc. The ASCII screens had more colors than the BW  :) <br />
<br />
Most of the late 1990s users are all over-dependent on the mouse  :) <br />
<br />
Reminds me of this cartoon - Revenge of the Mouse</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could, of course, use the Baan GUI objects which have radio-buttons/radio-button groups included (check in your Programmers help to see if these are implemented in 4c4). <br />
<br />
For enums with just two values, it's better to use standard tcyesno (tgyenox pace Lisa) checkboxes; alternatively, for those enums where the number of choices exceeds two, you would normally use dynamically-loaded combo-boxes from the Baan GUI objects palette. See my contribution to the following thread for details:<br />
