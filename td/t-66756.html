We are trying to print a barcode label in a Zebra printer from BW print, but the label does not print completely. The label is printed partly.<br />
<br />
Not sure which settings are going wrong ...<br />
<br />
Found few related threads on baanboard which says about including some commands in report script but not getting an idea what exactly to include ..<br />

I assume you have manuals and all of those pieces.  Maybe if you post your code that you are using to generate the label someone will see something.  It is very easy to make a mistake in the ZPL code and have it not work.  Plus if I recall correctly the barcode type we were using restricted a few characters that could be printed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
please check windows printer setting zebra -&gt; &quot;Advanced&quot; -&gt; &quot;Printing Defaults&quot; ... here you can set the label size and orientation and other dimensions. Additionally you can check &quot;Printer Setting&quot; and set &quot;Always use driver settings&quot; to &quot;yes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Thanks for the replies.<br />
<br />
Just to note we have not included any ZPL codes in our report layout yet.<br />
Its just a standard BAAN layout.<br />
<br />
However the stickers are getting printed on the Zebra printer with the required formatting but there seems to be some issue with size / orientation /paper settings.<br />
<br />
We have tried different orientations / settings but it some how does not printed fully.<br />
<br />
Attaching the snapshot.<br />
<br />
Will check the Printing setting suggested by Kozure ...hopefully should find something.<br />
 <br />
The printer is at a remote location in a different timezone and we cannot simulate the print from here :-(</div></div><hr />

Get them lined up and you might be okay.  From the looks of the picture - you definitely need to move everything on the left side of the label to the right.</div></div><hr />
