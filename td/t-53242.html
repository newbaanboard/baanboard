If you would have multi occ and single occ forms the layout of the form has to fit with the type. And the layout is not a thing, one can just switch. For that you have to work with the form editor.<br />
There maybe further things, in your GUI-Script, which doesn't fit with an other type of layout.<br />
<br />
So I think that is not to say in general how to change a form. May it's a good idea to create an other session with an other layout, maybe there is an other, shorter way.<br />
<br />
So</div></div><hr />
