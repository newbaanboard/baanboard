When I run the session manually, everything works fine.  However, when I launch it in batch, the job crashes immediately giving me the message:<br />
<br />
Fatal error : tdsls045.pmsk index 0 out of dims (1) 20<br />
Fatal error : Can not continue in tdsls4210m100 (&lt;40&gt;)<br />
<br />
The job parameters seem ok.  I can't find details in any log files. <br />
<br />
I scoured this forum and Infor support with no joy, and would appreciate any ideas or clues where to look.  :confused:</div></div><hr />

If users are different, you have to check if they have same package combination and same company and check other settings as well.</div></div><hr />

We normally launch the job through cron which doesn't seem to record any errors.  I only discovered the error when checking the Baan job history report.</div></div><hr />

Many times there is a problem with dates in job. Did you save (if any) fixed dates or &quot;remember differnce between selected date and system date&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">31st July 2008, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me make sure I understand:  Launching the job thru cron works and just activating the job from you logon results in an error.  Is that correct?  If it is the only difference i see is that interactively a session comes up for display.  Have you tried to disable the sequence giving the error and creating a new sequence with the same parameters?  I have seen job information become corrupt, but I am not sure that might be the issue in this case.  Almost sounds like the form is corrupt, but I would not know where that might be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the job has never worked.  I only mentioned cron because that is the way we schedule and launch all our jobs, and that I only realised it wasn't working when I checked the Baan job history report which stated that there had been a failure.  I couldn't see what the error was (by checking all the log files I could think of), so I launched it manually.  At that point I got the error described immediately on the screen.  <br />
I thought about the possibility of a corrupt form, especially as the job fails so quickly,  but that doesn't explain why running the session manually works correctly.</div></div><hr />
