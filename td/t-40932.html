Previously it was printing fine. However I recently changed the OS to XP. I installed a new printer driver compatible with xp. When I take print in preview it shows correctly and then when I print it on the paper through printer the font becomes small as if paper size is changed. This happens on rare occassions but since I take print on cheques it is a big issue. I have to cacel those cheques.  <br />
Please give me some solutions. I have changed my driver still the problem exists.</div></div><hr />

Compare that to the registry of the computer with XP installed. Usually its the font spacing, height and width that has to be checked. Also the bwprint file can be copied from the computer where the cheque prints properly...<br />

What I am saying it prints properly most of the times. improper printing occurs only sometimes. What I thought that it is a driver problem but changing the driver has still not solved the problem.</div></div><hr />

Is the device name same in both Maintain Devices session and in the windows printer section?<br />
