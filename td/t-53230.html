<br />
I want to know how the field name are arranged in the session &quot;Maintain Report Input Fields &quot; (ttadv3132s000). for ex, If I entered tdsls045.odat as ascending in this session as sort mode (Ascending) and next field name AS <br />
tdsls040.odat also as ascending i find that tdsls040.odat will be on top of tdsls045.odat. Can anyone explain me the logic behind this session bcoz i realize this problem in  the session &quot; Maintain Report Layout &quot; (ttadv3131s000).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">6th August 2008, 01:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I would see them in sort order by the sort order preference.  So tdsls045.odat would be 1 (or 1 lower) than tdsls040.odat which would be 2 (or 1 higher).  So after putting in the sort type ascending or descending you give it a sort order like 1,2,3,4.  That is the order I see them - now if I gave two of them the same sort order(which should not happen) then they would come out sorted by field name.  If you notice the other fields on the report are sorted by field name.</div></div><hr />

          I think order of field depends on report script order.I mean if u give ascending order in UI Script and in report layout or in report script ,if u give descending  order then u will see ur output in Descending order.because ur report script executed last after UI script, so whatever u write there u will see ur records in that order...check it and let me know..<br />
