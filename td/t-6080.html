<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">6th August 2002, 23:55</div></div><div class="posttext">I  am wondering if I am interpreting functions that deal with application locks correctly.<br />
<br />
I am interested in checking for an application lock without actually setting an application lock.  For example....<br />
<br />
lock = appl.set(application.name$(32), appl.write)<br />
<br />
Here lock is equal to 2 when an application lock is in place.  <br />
<br />
Or lock is equal to 0 when no application lock is found.  However the function call effectively has set the lock.<br />
<br />
Is there a function that will check for an application lock without setting the lock?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help. - Joy</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe the answer is no. As an alternative you could read the application lock table yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 00:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know of a function that just does a check, but you could easily code one:<br />
<br />
if appl.set(app.name, appl.write) = 0 then<br />
	appl.delete(app.name)<br />
	'Lock wasn't set<br />
else<br />
	'Lock was set or error<br />
endif<br />
<br />
The end result should leave the lock status the same as it was before the call.<br />
<br />
The other way would be to read ttadv998 as Vamsi suggests.  Be sure to do so for company 0, since that is where the locks are stored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vamsi is right and as described in the help manual, you can use this construct -<br />
<br />
<br />
ret = appl.set( &quot;tisfc001&quot; &amp; tisfc001.pdno, APPL.READ) <br />
if ret &gt; 0 then<br />
               |* Lock is already present, give message<br />
endif<br />
if ret = 0 then<br />
               appl.delete( &quot;tisfc001&quot; &amp; tisfc001.pdno )<br />
               |* remove the application lock<br />
endif<br />
<br />
<br />
appl.delete() -<br />
This removes a specified application lock. Only the owner of the lock can delete it. And a lock can be deleted only from within the same process in which it was set.<br />
<br />
This might be a safe option.<br />
<br />
I guess you can ignore my posting... I noticed that Ed posted a solution at the same time I did....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 15:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for everyone's input.  Basically you have confirmed my interpretation.<br />
<br />
Just one more thing to note.  The documentation that I have on appl.delete does not mention that only the owner of a lock can remove a lock.<br />
<br />
It is helpful to know such things. - Joy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Couldn't you use appl.get.user?  It returns 0 when a lock exists and -1 when no locks exist. This would not set a lock. Did I not understand the question? Just curious since no one else mentioned it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joy Conner</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark.  I considered appl.get.user() but according to my documentation, you must send in parameter of process ID of owner.  The process ID of owner will not be known in my application. - Joy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 17:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the sample posted by NPR it would be:<br />
<br />
<br />
rc = appl.get.user(&quot;tisfc001&quot; &amp; tisfc001.pdno,baan.user)<br />
<br />
<br />
But if process id is part of the string name used in the first parameter, then I could see why you could not use it.  I guess I was thinking of a lock you might set - when I used it I used something like NPR posted.   <br />

These days I hardly can get in a word edgewise. So I pounced on this one and gave a real bad reply. But I also seem to have dragged Prashanth and Ed along my line of thinking :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th August 2002, 20:20</div></div><div class="posttext">According to Joys reply I think you all were closer to a answer than me. So you did pounce correctly. :)<br />

However I have had problems with people removing locks and creating headaches for me later.</div></div><hr />
