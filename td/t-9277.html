<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">18th March 2003, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a maintain session with form type 2.<br />
Number of occurences on the form is currently set to 11.<br />
I have 4 fields from the table displayed for maintenance.<br />
<br />
What are the options to:<br />
1. Skip the next field and move to the next record when 'enter' key is pressed after this field<br />
2. To skip to the next record after the last occurence on the<br />
    form when reaching end of occurances(11).<br />
I think in.ret may solve half of my problem<br />
This is on c4.<br />
fields are in this format:<br />
<br />
(field1)  (field2)  field3  field4<br />
<br />
Fields 1 and 2 are display fields. I need to be able to get to <br />
field 3 of next record right after'enter' after the field 3 of<br />
previous record.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, refer to the thread - How can i change the Tab flowing order from a form ? (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=34961#post34961)</div></div><hr />

thing I want to do is pass control when the user presses the<br />
&quot;enter&quot; key.How do I capture this event?in.ret?<br />
<br />
The user should still be able to go to field 4 in case the key stroke is not a enter,but a tab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">18th March 2003, 02:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Please fill up your profile with BaaN/OS/Database info.<br />
<br />
I am assuming you are working in the BaaN-4 series.<br />
<br />
You have to use the predefined variable - in.ret (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_misc_predefined_variables) <br />
<br />
long      in.ret      4R<br />
 Integer value of key pressed on input field. Cursor keys and zoom keys cannot be detected. Valid only in on.input, after.input, and after.field sections.<br />
<br />
<br />
so you have to program it in your script to capture the return values (ascii value of the key) and compare -<br />
<br />
if in.ret = 27 then<br />
...<br />
endif<br />
<br />
I am on the latest BaaN-5.2 I did not find any examples maybe the other guys on the Board who are on the BaaN-4 might post an example code for you.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
   I wanted to confirm if &quot;in.ret&quot; was in fact the best option to<br />
 capture the event.I have already seen a couple of examples<br />
 threads and was curious if there was different approach.<br />
<br />
  My posting at the beginning of the thread has my Baan version<br />
 4c4.I will update my profile anyway.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">18th March 2003, 16:42</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried the in.ret but it does not return any value for 'enter' key.<br />
Any ideas?Any body coded for 'enter' earlier?<br />
<br />
Please note I am getting values for tab and arrow up and down keystrokes. so, there is nothing wrong with the in.ret usage.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I could trap certain keys, but not the enter key.  I figured the something in the 4gl coding or the client was preventing it from making it to the code.  Hopefully someone else has the answer or if you figured it out, please post the answer.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

 Hope somebody has tried it out b4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th March 2003, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll stick out what may be a silly idea, since you don't seem to be able to trap that 'enter' key, you can default a button, like 'continue' to activate when the enter key is pushed.  You could then program some things in the choice.cont.process section...not sure if you would be able to achieve all of your field control stuff there, it would be messy, but probably you could get close.</div></div><hr />

============================<br />
I may not have understood you right,but how can you default<br />
to  anything when you have not yet known the ENTER key is pressed?I mean Reading the keystroke is primary here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th March 2003, 19:53</div></div><div class="posttext">When they hit the enter key, the default button is activated.  Set the default button to 'continue' in Maintain Forms / Buttons button, and the continue (thus choice.cont.process section) will be executed when they hit enter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">20th March 2003, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I have already tried that and need to revisit that option.<br />
If I remeber right,my problem with such an approach is the<br />
control will be transferred to that button and I need to get back the control onto my record each time.Please review my first post <br />
in this thread about the flow.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th March 2003, 20:04</div></div><div class="posttext">O I read - that's why I'm saying it could get messy.  But you have a spot if you want to try.<br />
You can get them back into the fields by playing with the execute(....) functions - execute(add.set) would put them back in add mode, execute(modify.set) would put them back in modify.  You could use the occurance variables to know what occurance you were on...In the add and modify set options you may be able to do more field control...  I agree, may not be the best place for field control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">20th March 2003, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I think this is why you are not getting the return of the enter key for in.ret.  Baan already takes that and keys button logic off of it, so it is probably reset by them so you can't use...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NPRao</div><div class="date">19th April 2003, 00:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you can trap the ENTER/RETURN keys using event handlers.<br />
<br />
Refer to -  Events sample program (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_events_sample_program)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">21st April 2003, 02:51</div></div><div class="posttext">NPR,<br />
 Thanks for the solution.Will try it out this week.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaaNovva</div><div class="date">8th February 2013, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Like in.ret in BaanIV, I am looking for an equivalent in BaanV or InforLN.  On a DFE form when the user tabs from one field to another using keyboard I wanted to trap this TAB keystroke in after.input of the field.  How can I achieve this ? I tried event handlers but next.event() or peer.event() are waiting for input. I don't want to trigger an event. I just wanted to capture the key stroke for a normal Tab field event that just happened. Is this possible with the DFE of Infor  ERPLN ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">23rd February 2013, 07:54</div></div><div class="posttext">The keys which trigger events in BW  are not trappable . It's well documented . So u may not  not  be able to  trap TAB , UP/DOWN arrow etc . Others like CTRL+A etc can be trapped with in.ret or g.in.ret variables .</div></div><hr />
