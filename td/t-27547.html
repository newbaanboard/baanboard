        We have two server here in our company and when any user logs in it is automatically connected to any of the server so we need unix user as well as BaaN user on both the server.<br />
Now the problem is like that we have created all the user in one server but now we need to do the same procedure on the second server as well so could u please suggest what all files we neeed to copy from one server to another one so that we may save our time and labour.<br />
<br />
System Details are as follows:<br />
BaaN 4 c4 sp18 on Unix <br />
DB-INformix<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />

Therefore you should only have to sync the Unix users as both Unix connect to the same Baan environment.  In that case you need to synchronize the /etc/passwd and the corresponding 'shadow' file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You still have to copy the $BSE/lib/user directory to synchronize BaaN users. If you have 2 application servers, which one is the primary/master? which direction would you sync the user info, application DD (where do you execute runtime DD), code changes? If you are having a MAS (master application server setup) then you also have to handle the Remote User Setup for Audit Trails.<br />
<br />
Please answer to bdittmar's questions as your posting isnt clear.</div></div><hr />

Sorry for ambiguous posting !!!!!!!!But ya We have two unix servers and on both the server we have different application and one database server.....<br />
Now here we have sync program for both the application server and we have a load balancer which governs the login for a user (Means which user should login to which server)..........<br />
Yes we have copied the /etc/passwd and it's shadow file which solved the problem.....<br />
So thanks to all for all your suport and co-operation...<br />
