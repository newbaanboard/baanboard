<br />
The question is: assuming a BAAN session is written to produce the chart, is there a way of automating the printing of the chart (for example, when the session is set up as a job)? <br />
<br />
The reason for the automation is: for example, the User creates an efficiency chart for an employee and prints it. Then moves on to the next employee, and so on. The idea is for the BAAN session to accept the range of employees and create the chart one employee at a time and print it automatically.<br />
<br />
From what I have seen so far, the User would have to run the baan session to create and print the chart one employee at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the reports are to be stored somewhere as files offcourse its possible .<br />
there will be one report for every employee and saved in some location and you can put it in job  too .<br />
<br />

<br />
I know you had this issue a couple oh years ago, did you got it, printig chart automatically?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">5th August 2010, 20:05</div></div><div class="posttext">No, did not spend time on this to figure out.<br />
<br />
I do not think there can be a customization solution to this, because the 'logic' that selects the printing is inside the chart manager (which calls ttchm1160m000), which is a TOOLS session, and we cannot customize that.<br />
<br />
But, as I said, did not spend enough time on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rberti</div><div class="date">5th August 2010, 20:18</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, thanks!<br />
<br />
You recommended to use Excel before, I should have listen to you... now I've created the charts, but still couldn't print it automatically or even in landscape, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">5th August 2010, 20:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, most outputs I create for Excel are not for charts, but for users to analyze the data as they need - the outputs are just CSV format files.<br />
<br />
I am sure there must be a way using VBA in Excel to automate printing charts, once the data has been created as a CSV file. I am not much familiar with VBA.<br />
<br />
And yes, BAAN Charts do NOT print in Landscape (again, I have not spent enough time to figure this out either).</div></div><hr />
