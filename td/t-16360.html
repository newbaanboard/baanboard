I want to add a session ttaad4222m000 (count number of records by table) to a job. Problem is that when I run this session and try to add it to the job, it displays only jobs in company 000. My existing company no is say 333. <br />
<br />
How do I add this session to a job in company 333 instead of the standard company 000 ?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<br />
Any reason you dont want the job in company-000 ?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

problem in this. An extra bw connection has to be made and the job daemon <br />
started for company 000 too. I think there should be no problem in this.</div></div><hr />

The reason that I needed the job in another company instead of 000 is that this job was to have a couple of other sessions as well but now I will have to create 2 jobs one in 000 and one in other company.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />
