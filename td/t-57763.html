<br />
I am taking my first steps in Application Studio 8.5 and my first problem is how to configure the connection point for a software project. There must be two connenctions of type BW for each project (development and RunTime). My problem is that in I am presented with an empty list in the bwc configuration file dialog (see attached). Here it is not possible to search for the configuration file. Therefore my question: Where is Application Studio looking for the configuration files?<br />
<br />
PS: Any tips or tricks regarding Application Studio is much appreciated!</div></div><hr />

Also, refer to -<br />

Thanks a lot. That was it. I'm actually on Windows 7 which is as I understand very similar to Vista.</div></div><hr />
