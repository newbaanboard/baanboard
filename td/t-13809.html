<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">2nd December 2003, 21:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a rather large report for our Finance department that calculates inflationary indexes on inventory item values.  <br />
<br />
As part of this calculation I need to trace a specific lot back to the PO line items.  I can see that tdltc001 has the purchase order number and I can get back to that, but is there any way to trace it back to the individual PO line item?  I have instances where multiple PO line items are for the same inventory item and were received on the same day.  Any help would be greatly appreicated!</div></div><hr />
