<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moyra Kelly</div><div class="date">26th February 2019, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.  I've created a multi occurrence form but when the user double clicks, the session zooms to the sub session.  Previous posts have suggested taking off any default button but I've already done this and it's still happening.  I have only one user-defined button, no standard buttons.  Is there a way of stopping this happening or at least testing for the double click in the code?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th February 2019, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">If I double click on one of the multi occurrence records it does launch the default button. I turned it off in a test environment and it still does it.  I know I clear pending events at the start of some programs. I also know that you can use in.ret to check for a single keystroke, but when I tried it in.ret was 0 for both a double click on a record and the same as just clicking my cancel button.  Have to wait to see if someone else has a answer. Will have to poke around more.</div></div><hr />
