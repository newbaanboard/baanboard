What does the authorisation group in form command do? I see some form command with authorisation group of print/display, but when executed they are in full authorisation mode. Thanks very much<br />

Here is some info from my notes-<br />
<br />
Form command authorization level (set by developers when they create the form command) tells the minimum authorization required by the user for the session in order to be able to view the form command in specific option. <br />
<br />
Here is a general rule I follow ...<br />
<br />
- form command updates any table then authorization level for the form command should be atleast modify/print/display<br />
<br />
- form command doesn't update any table but just displays/prints some information, authorization level of the command should be print/display<br />
<br />
This explains how to set the authorisation levels for &quot;SPECIFIC&quot; options in sessions so that it uses the Baan standard User roles to control authorisations.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope it helps you out.</div></div><hr />

Your explanation makes much more sense than that of Baan Support people to whom I logged a case. Thanks. By the way, I don't think I saw this post when I was checking for new posts yesterday. The complicated methodology of determining what's new and what's not may cause new posts not to appear in the new posts list. Should've used posts in the last 24hr instead :)<br />
