Can you please explain the reason for which there is the need to hide the session code.<br />
<br />
May be by knowing the reason someone on the board can suggest some workaround.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />

<br />
Actually, we need to give the users Run Program access for some reason.<br />
<br />
We have a session, for which the user needs to enter a password and it redirects to other session after entering the password.<br />
<br />
Now, if the user knows the session code of the main session he can directly log in to the session using run program.<br />
<br />
I know, there can be way around's for this and we have implemented it too, but you never know, any cookie can crumble in BAAN ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th April 2013, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">We wrote our own version of the run program.  We use DEM flows so the requirement was the main session must be on the DEM flow. If not they cannot run it.  Just using DEM's baan grants a lot of access to sessions, at least in 4c4, so using the baan run program needed to be elminated.  So we wrote our own version.  So if I wanted to I could elminate any program I wanted to from the run program.  The program actually uses a table and you can see what sessions users run and it provides a history for them.  There is a thread on this forum that helped me develope it.  Below is the code that launches the provided session name.<br />
<br />
function run.session()<br />
{<br />
	long	child.pid, old.mwindow, new.mwindow<br />
	<br />
	if not isspace(sess.name) then<br />
		old.mwindow = current.mwindow()<br />
		new.mwindow = create.mwindow(&quot;Run Prog&quot;,DSPIXELBASED,DSNORMALSTATE)<br />
		change.mwindow( new.mwindow )<br />
		child.pid = act.and.sleep( sess.name )<br />
		if child.pid then<br />
			set.pgrp( child.pid, child.pid )<br />
			grab.mwindow( new.mwindow, child.pid )<br />
			reactivate( child.pid )<br />
		endif<br />
		change.mwindow ( old.mwindow )<br />
		destroy.mwindow( new.mwindow )<br />
	endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
Of course there are other routines to validate the session name before running it, but this is the main piece of code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can try creating rectangular object and placing it exactly at the place where session code is displayed. But again you will have to handle conditions when the session is re-sized or maximized.<br />
<br />
I believe that just hiding the session in the status bar will not be sufficient.<br />
Reason: We can have a set command to display the session code in the Window Title. So as far as UI is concerned the status bar and the Window title both should be taken care of.<br />
<br />
Apart from this there are many possibility for the user to know the session id from trace file or any log.<br />
<br />
As per my understanding you are invoking this session once the user enters correct password. Hence the password validation session will always be the parent process, which can be added as validation else quit from the session.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps..<br />
<br />
