<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">25th August 2006, 10:45</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a form type 3 session (display with view field) where the view field is item. On entry I import the item from the calling process. The session has several forms, all displaying data for one item. <br />
<br />
After the init.form, and before the before.form the session resets the imported item and the item always changes to 000001, the first item in the table. Also when forcing it on first form, by again assigning the imported item in the before.form section, it will then reset itself to 000001 when clicking on next form. It seems that before every form the item value is reset to 000001. The view field is always table field tcibd001.item<br />
<br />
This is a puzzle to me, and yet an urgent one, for today a presentation needs te be given including this session!!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any clues</div></div><hr />

I didn't put any execute(find.data) in my program. The program only has queries fetching the data from tables, yet no find.data.. I guess this is the problem. Just have to find the correct way/place to apply the solution. My session can be run stand-alone and as zoom...</div></div><hr />
