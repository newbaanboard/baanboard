<br />
I understand that it is somthing really, really, &quot;tricky&quot;, but did someone ever tried to change the Short Description of a Form Dynamically?<br />
<br />
In better details, I would like to change the Description which appears in form tabs as the data changes.<br />
<br />
For example let's suppose to have a form 1 type session, with 3 or four forms which have no &quot;Short Description&quot; (hence they appear as Form 1, Form 2, etc...).<br />
<br />
Let's suppose that I am displaying Matster Item data (tiitm001) and if the item group changes the descriptions of the form have to change accordingly.<br />
<br />
I could accept to force the value in ttadv300 and dump the form, but of course it works only for the first record (actually neither for the first record because when the record is current the form dump has alrady been loaded...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your help,<br />
