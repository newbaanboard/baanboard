<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 13:09</div></div><div class="posttext">The sort order is an index on the main table of the session. To add an index: use &quot;Maintain Table Definitions&quot; (ttadv4120m000), then go to &quot;Maintain Table Indices&quot; (ttadv4121s000), via the button.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I thought it was to do with table indices, but....<br />
<br />
I checked another session that had been created by a third party. Here the order menu has 7 options to pick from. When I check the table def for this session there is only one index set. Could it be a script thing??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You cannot add a key value via a script, you can switch to different keys with to.key(key_number).</div></div><hr />

I was mis-interrepting the Table Indices screen. <br />
<br />
I was getting the Index Number and Index Parts mixed up. I thought all indices were defined under the same screen (index number) :eek: <br />
<br />
With your guidance I can now go off and do what I need to do.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />

OK I've got my options showing on the Order menu and I can select the options and search by that value but I have one small problem.<br />
<br />
If I change which field to order by and if that field is blank on the form at the time of changing the order, Baan shows the &quot;Find&quot; window but it will not allow me to enter anything into the find box. If the record has data in the &quot;Order by&quot; field then this data will appear in the Find box and Baan will allow you to overtype this and enter your search value.<br />
<br />
Have I left something out?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">23rd April 2002, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">There is some kind of speciality on the way the Find acts on a different index. I vaguely remember to have done some things on that in the past too. But sorry, forgot. <br />
<br />
In the form options I assume you also checked option 6 (Find). Maybe it (ie what I forgot) had to do with form option 14 (Insert) on the main form that had to be checked to be able to do a find and enter data in the search &quot;form&quot; that comes up in case it was empty in the first place. Play around with the form options.<br />
<br />
It could also be that is had to do with the start option of the session... nei, doubt...</div></div><hr />
