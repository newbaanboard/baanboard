<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brad997</div><div class="date">9th November 2005, 03:14</div></div><div class="posttext">My question is:-<br />
In my previous BaanIV, i have a group of users of with almost similar functions but with little differences in sessions.<br />
I can solved it in BaanIV because I use the Authorisation by Module/User.<br />
I just put/group all the similar sessions to the users. Then insert those &quot;differences&quot; of one or two sessions to those users accordingly.<br />
But how to setup in LN in order to achieve that kind of authorisation to those user?<br />
<br />
In LN however, the authorisation by Module/user is not available anymore.<br />
It is replace by Role Data (ttams2100m000) and govern by the functionality as describe by LN help below:-<br />
<br />
In the LN HELP-To define session authorizations<br />
&quot;The authorization that is stated at the most specific level has the highest priority. This is the session authorization per session for a specific company. The lowest priority is the authorization that is stated at the most global level. This is the session authorization per company for all companies.<br />
Besides the already mentioned levels, session authorizations for a user can also be specified in several roles. For example, a user has two roles. If one role states that the user has permission for a session, and the other role states that the user has no permission, the user ultimately has permission for that session.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have tested and confirmed the above LN help statement.<br />
<br />
Best regards...</div></div><hr />
