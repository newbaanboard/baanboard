<br />
When I perform a customization, the dynamic form editor shows form field name as same as the table field name ... so I can't understand which one is a table field and which one is form field name... Can anybody please help to find out whether a particular field is table field or form field if both are same?<br />

<br />
Also in field properties in DFE you can check for one check box form field  in general Tab in DFE ..If its checked then its a form field</div></div><hr />
