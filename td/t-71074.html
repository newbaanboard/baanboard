<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arielcandoit</div><div class="date">10th May 2018, 17:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently we have been getting some fatal errors 107: record is locked coming from many (Ln Fp9 )processes in different modules more often. After a while, the process works normally.  <br />
We can't open an Incident because it's a random process and difficult to reproduce. <br />
<br />
Our system admin does not have any detail about the records in trouble , just a brief description (same as fatal error screen shows up). <br />
It's very uncertain how to trace what the problem is (unless you debug the session,but we don't have source codes).<br />
<br />
Did somebody know about any utility or patch that we can use to figured out what's going on?<br />
Do I need to request a technical consultant to verify this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be better to involve someone from the technical team to set the traces at certain points, trace through the event logs, bshell logs etc to find the root cause. There are several reasons for this error and needs deep dive to pin point the exact reason.</div></div><hr />

The might even be able to provide some addition configuration settings for the database or application that resolve the issue.</div></div><hr />
