<br />
I have a sessionin which the user enters some search fields and upon tabbing the matching records (bp's) are being displayed. The session is a display session with form type 2 (multi-occ + main), with the search fields on top. Every time the user changes one of the search fields, the query.extend.where (Baan V) runs with rebuild.query() and execute(first.set). <br />
<br />
What I want to know is, if it is possible to have all the matching done case INsensitive, i.e. the search arguments are all strings. If I want to enable case insensitive matching now, I have to double my variables, and make each time one with the upper case value, and one with the lower case value, and then stick them all into my query extension. I wonder if there is no easier way....<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

You can either convert the field value in the when.field.changes to upper/lower case. It also depends on the domain conversion type. <br />
<br />
If you are using a different domain for form fields then you have to use tt.align.according.domain() to fit to the table field's domain's format.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">7th April 2005, 09:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Np, I'm not sure if you understood me well. Most of the searched table fields are not case sensitive, i.e. you can insert lower case or upper case values. So for instance if a table field contains &quot;Abc&quot; and I search for &quot;abc&quot; or &quot;ABC&quot;, I will not find anything. So even two fields - one in upper, and one in lower case - wouldn't be enough for me, because the string in the table fields can contain a mix of upper and lower cases! That's why I would like to find a way to search case insensitive.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

I think this issue can be of interest for a lot of our friends on the forum, and too, I would love to find an easy practical solution, so therefor I decided to nudge and post this note, in order to get this post on the top of the list.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">8th April 2005, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy and practical would be nice ;) I only have an idea for the complicate way: You have to define your own searchfield (with index) which is maybe all upper or all lowercase (and without spaces. Sometimes very helpfull) and create your own search function. After the user enters a search you could seach the record after converting to your key with on.maintable in the before choice section of find.data and then populate your shown tablefields with the result of this function... . I think this is in Baan 5 easier then in Baan IV. Your privte searchfield don't need to be on the form for this. <br />
<br />
Yust an idea. Maybe it helps. <br />

<br />
The only thing that came to my mind which can used is using -  expr.compile() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_expressions_runtime_expr_compile) <br />
<br />
[] means one of the characters between [] Â– for example:<br />
<br />
[abcd123] or [a-z] or [a-zA-Z]<br />
<br />
[^] means any character except the characters after ^<br />
<br />
So you can combine the patterns in [] like grep and have case insensitive search.<br />
<br />
Also refer to the thread - wildcards in SQL (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=5905&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15)</div></div><hr />
