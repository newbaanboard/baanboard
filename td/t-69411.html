<br />
I want to do adding calculation from a previous value with the new value.<br />
For example : line# 2 has value 'X' and line#1 has a value 'Y' I want to add both 'X' and 'Y' for more no of lines. How to program the script for this issue?<br />
Value	   Pr.Value + Value                        Final value<br />
1	                      1                                           1<br />
3	                      4                                           1+ 3<br />
5	                      9                                           4 + 5 <br />
6	                     15                                          9 + 6 .......so on</div></div><hr />

I mean you just need to keep track of the last number.  So if you are updating a table, find the records you want. Step thru them 1 at time, on the first record set something like oldvalue to the first record value,  from then on make oldvalue = to new value + oldvalue.  Write the records out.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you explain what exactly you are trying to accomplish someone has a better idea on for a solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For that, you can use report script. Store final value in a variable x. Add that to your report layout. Now, in the before.layout section of the layout you are using do curr.value+x(assuming curr.value holds the current value)<br />
<br />
In your case it will be - <br />
<br />
Say your layout is detail.1 and your value is X. You will do this - <br />
<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
<br />
      final.value = final.value + X | X will be your first column and final.value will be printed as second column <br />
<br />
Not much of a work.</div></div><hr />

They are just values from some table. Though if interested, here are the algorithms which define the two sequences - <br />
<br />
For Value Column (http://oeis.org/search?q=1%2C3%2C5%2C6&amp;language=english&amp;go=Search) and For Final Value Column (http://oeis.org/search?q=1%2C4%2C9%2C15&amp;language=english&amp;go=Search) :)</div></div><hr />

Correct - but the final solution will vary if (a) they are doing it in a table wanting to update, (b) want to do it in a form (c) doing it in a report.  The calculation can be simple like you showed - and I believe it is for all 3 solutions.  Just a little different on where you do the calculation. Now if they give us more details that &quot;being simple&quot; could become complicated. :)</div></div><hr />
