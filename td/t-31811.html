<br />
Has any body already deviced/developed a solution to remove all the orphaned application locks ?<br />
<br />
What I mean by orphaned application locks:<br />
<br />
Suppose a session is opened and application lock is activated for that user-pid-session.. and subsequently the user's login got disconnected (mostly due to time-out)..<br />
<br />
There is no point in that application lock being still active. There should be a session which will fina all the orphaned application locks and delete those...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vineetu1</div><div class="date">28th February 2007, 08:43</div></div><div class="posttext">This application would remove the application locks for even those applications (processes) which are active.. and we don't want that.<br />
<br />
What we want is to identify the orphaned locks and remove those.<br />
<br />
Once the solution is identified, can incorporate it before applying any new lock...<br />
i.e. before applying any new lock, we check whether there is any lock already present for that key ? If yes then we deny to put the lock as it is asumed that somebody is already using that application.<br />
<br />
But in proposed senario, we will check the validity of the lock (whether it is current or orphaned) if it is orphaned the lock will be removed and a fresh lock will be inserted for the new user. (it could be the same user but the PID will change)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is our workaround: Every evening all users are kicked out of the system and all application locks are removed. So we can start on a defined level for the next day.<br />
<br />
If users cannot open their sales order text and all that stuff, they must call the it department.<br />
