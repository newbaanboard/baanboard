When you say &quot;NF&quot; are you referring to a new report? Maybe you are referring to new format for a printer?  You mentioned installing the printer in Baan - maybe you could attach a jpg image of the printer device?  You mention that it does not work right - how?  Not printing at all or printing incorrectly.  Just requesting some more info.  Not sure what languages you speak(sorry to say I only speak english), but you may want to check out the boards other language forums.<br />

Hi Mark,<br />
 I from Brazil and I learning English yet, lets go, when I say NF I want to say &quot;Nota Fiscal&quot; (tdfatL402m000). When I try to print a NF in the win2000 does not print the &quot;after.fields&quot; fo NF, but the same NF no win95 print. How can I to set my printer or how to set a form of the printer, I dont know. <br />

<br />
I'm from Brazil to, only to clarify &quot;Nota Fiscal&quot; is a kind of invoice in Brazil, that is printed in a stationery with a matrix printer, that's rights ?<br />
<br />
I think that you have to configure your printer in win2000 as is configured in win95.<br />

Hi Xikkos,<br />
 I already configured my printer like in the win95 . I created a new form in the win2000 with the same configuration of win95. I dont know what to do. I dont understand how the BaaN send a txt file in the win95 and work , but in the win2000 does not work.<br />
TKS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asprecher</div><div class="date">18th December 2003, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">on BaanERP:<br />
for  W2K Device Queue in Device Data looks like: &quot;\\PrintServer\(P51)HP LaserJet 4000 Series PCL 5e&quot;<br />
<br />
for W98 Device Queue in Devic Data looks like: &quot;PrintServer.p51&quot;<br />
<br />
so you need in Baan two different Printer's, example: Printer1_W2K  and Printer1_W98.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asprecher</div><div class="date">19th December 2003, 14:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the Problem is:<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
To print on a Win98 Client the PrinterDefinition in ttaad3500m000:<br />
<br />
Example:  <br />
Device: P51_W98<br />
Device Queue:  printserver.printer<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
To print on Win2000/XP Client the Printerdefinition in ttaad3500m000:<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Device: P51_XP<br />
Device Queue: \\printserver\printer<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
You see the differenz in Device Queue of ttaad3500m000<br />
<br />
The Win2000/XP Client do not know what is &quot;printserver.printer&quot; he needs &quot;\\printserver\printer&quot; <br />
<br />
hope it helps<br />
<br />
