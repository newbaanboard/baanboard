<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">17th December 2008, 03:59</div></div><div class="posttext">One report output multi-page. But the client wanted to show the former three pages. The report contains detail.10(1 row), detail.20(line between, 3 rows). The program is at the end of the third page, only left 2 rows, one layout the detail.10, another one BAAN default consider to print detail.20. So detail.20 was separated to two parts, one print in 3rd page, and one in 4th page. How can I avoid to print 4th page?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th December 2008, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Typically I am asked to keep the layout together and I just use the need lines on the layout.  The only thing I can recommend is reducing headers or footers - keeping in mind that when you do that you may take another situation that was 4 and 1/2 pages and making it just two lines over.  What you need to do is sit down determine how many lines per page you want and make the report match that - it is not perfect.  I really don't recommend doing something other than what the standard report features allow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">18th December 2008, 03:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for mark_h's reply, Yes, I know I can use lattr.lineno and page() to control print. But I also want to know how is show at the end of current page. Because I had  counted the number of lines per page, then sometimes, the client wants to change the lines per page, I should change specify value of lines in report script. That is so trouble and inadvisable.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th December 2008, 16:16</div></div><div class="posttext">That is what I am saying is that I do not think you can allow the user to randomly change the lines per page.  My recommendation would be to setup devices for the lines/page that they want,  then they can select the device.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">assassinator</div><div class="date">22nd December 2008, 05:37</div></div><div class="posttext">But there are also some problems in it. Because like 'Page Type', 'Font' would cause anisomerous lines. They maybe different in every printed, and maybe different with each Device too. So use lineno control is too hard to solve this problem.</div></div><hr />
