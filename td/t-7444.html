The problem is that after box is checked, it can't be unchecked (move to next field and the check returns).  Any thoughts?  I'm hoping it is something simple:) <br />

<br />
What I can think of is , just check your code written for after.field (after display / or when.field.changes etc) of these check boxes. R you by any chance or reason initializing it back to yes (tcyesno.yes) ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">31st October 2002, 07:34</div></div><div class="posttext">These fields were not check boxes and functioned correctly until I changed them.  Their default value is no (unchecked).  The code is very simple and does not alter them as you have suggested but thanks for the reply.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">3rd November 2002, 21:13</div></div><div class="posttext">This could be rather severe (and maybe you have already tried these by now) , but you could try the following in steps:<br />
<br />
a. Create Runtime DD for the DOMAIN (only) that you are using for the checkbox field and dump the form again.<br />
<br />
b. If that does not resolve the problem by itself, create runtime DD for only the session that uses the form.<br />
<br />
(remember to exit BSHELL each time before trying again (I many times forget and wonder why things do not work)! :)  )<br />
<br />
After that, I am at a loss. Checkboxes do work fine most of the time, although sometimes, when they do not, instead of clicking them, I would have to ask the user to use the SPACEBAR - kind of negates the whole thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">3rd November 2002, 22:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I have already tried this.  Using the spacebar makes no difference.  Also, using a development company/PVRC, I changed the domain in a non-customized table and had the same result.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 00:47</div></div><div class="posttext">This is most likely an issue within the form you changed.<br />
<br />
First and foremost,make sure there is nothing in the default<br />
setting for the form field.(form field properties,default)<br />
May be the previous form field (domain) had it and you did not<br />
delete it.or did not covert after deleting that.<br />
<br />
Program script issue,look under before.program or in<br />
all other sections for any code.<br />
<br />
Make sure the domain you are using for check box has the<br />
default you are expecting it to have.<br />
<br />
Finally,make a new form/copy the form, start with just 1 or 2<br />
of these fields and check out the results.<br />
<br />
DO NOT FORGET TO LOG OUT EACH TIME YOU DUMP/CONVERT<br />
JUST TO BE SURE.<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evertsen</div><div class="date">5th November 2002, 01:20</div></div><div class="posttext">The form in question did not previously contain these fields.  Also, I changed another form in a completely different session/table as a test and got the same result!  This is very frustrating:mad:  There are no defaults set in the form fields.<br />
