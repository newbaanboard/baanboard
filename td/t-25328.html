Tools / Application Development / Domains and Tables / Maintenance<br />

I have never used.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
imho Baan data model is too complex for an ER diagram. The number of tables and most notably the number of fields per table are just more than can be clearly documented on a piece of paper and as far as I know there is no such thing as a 3D ER diagram! The data model for a typical web shop would be just about the right size for an ER diagram. <br />
<br />
After a while a Baan professional tends to develop a &quot;mental&quot; diagram which one can zoom in and out of as needed. I personaly find that printing detailed table definitions in landscape mode for the range of tables I currently work with much more usefull.</div></div><hr />
