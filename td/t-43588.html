<br />
I'm trying to generate a report(report2) from report script of a standard report (report1). I'm using brp functions to generate this second report, however the second report is printed on device selected for report1. The device given by me as default device is ignored by the brp function. Even if i use mode as 1 or 2 in brp.open function (which is supposed to show the device selection dialog box), the dialog box is not shown.<br />
Has any one came across such problem or any clues to solve this issue ?<br />
<br />
Bye</div></div><hr />

Save #2 the device in an external variable, immediately close #2 (sending nothing to it), and pass the external variable device to the report.  Force this into the 'spool.device' for opening #2 in the report script.</div></div><hr />
