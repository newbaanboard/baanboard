<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dmcgrath</div><div class="date">16th May 2003, 13:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently we run MRP as a job. Included in the job after MRP has executed is a shell command that activates a unix script to email the Logistics analysts informing them that MRP has finished. I have recently created the script below which is to be added to the MRP job to email the SCH MRP Exception messages as an attachment.<br />
<br />
#!/bin/sh<br />
uuencode /triappiv/bse/home/tools/schexcep /triappiv/bse/home/tools/schexcep.html | mailx -s &quot;MRP Exception Messages, Please Check&quot; -r darren.mcgrath@intier.com darren.mcgrath@intier.com<br />
<br />
<br />
The above has been tested and works well.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to know is how easy is it to send multiple attachments on the same email?, as we would also like to send all the different MRP Exception/Rescheduling messages (3 reports) to the analysts without having to send multiple emails, each with one report as an attachment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">p.cole</div><div class="date">17th May 2003, 04:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way is to use perl and the MIME::Lite module - very easy to use.<br />
<br />
Yet another way is to use just plain shell, as you are currently using but add the MIME headers and separators manually.  Please remind me on Wednesday and I can attach a script that we used to do this before we found/converted to using perl for all Baan scripts.<br />
<br />
P.S I would recommend the use of pure perl for all external scripts called from Baan.  The use of perl has enabled us to move from a UNIX Baan installation to a Windows 2000 Baan server with minimal changes to the perl scripts - mainly just file paths.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
