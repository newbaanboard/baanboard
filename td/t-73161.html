<br />
I have some issues when trying to do a complex SQL query and I would like you help on creating the following query in BaaN: SELECT a.t_csig <br />
(select b.t_aitc from tiitm012 AS b where b.t_citt = 'PLC' and t_cntr = '' and b.t_item = a.t_item) AS Life_Cycle<br />
(select c.t_aitc from tiitm012 AS c where c.t_citt = 'KBE' and t_cntr = '' and c.t_item = a.t_item) AS Kanban<br />
(select d.t_sipp from ticpr170 AS d where d.t_item = d.t_item and d.t_cpcc = '001') As Simulated_Price<br />
FROM tiitm001 AS a<br />
1) It indeed doesn't seem to accept the SKIP keyword of the refers which is very annoying. I have tried tiitm001 refers to ticpr170.item, tiitm001.item refers to ticpr170 and tiitm001 refers to ticpr170 but either get no data or an index error (even when adding cpcc and cntr fields of the key in the WHERE)…<br />
2) How can I make complex queries like I would do with a WITH out of BaaN in order to have two fields with JOINS with different search criteria on the same table (Life_Cycle and Kanban)?<br />
3) How can I add more fields in than 15 fields to the query? The idea is to extract data in excel but the system complains because the form is full… Can we add some with the code or cheat the system but updating the generated report even if it complains?<br />
4) Selection seems only possible with FROM TO functions on a field. Did you manage to do more complex things in order to add select a given list of items (flat file, etc.)?<br />
Thanks in advance for your help because I'm really stuck.<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
To be honest, I don't understand what you are trying to do. You don't want to write a Baan program, right? <br />
<br />
Since I'm also on Baan IV and Informix (but HP-UX instead of Linux), maybe that might help you:<br />
<br />
<br />
select t_aitc, t_item <br />
from tiitm012<br />
where t_citt = 'PLC' and t_cntr = ''<br />
into temp b with no log;<br />
<br />
create index i_b1 on b (t_item); -- maybe create unique index<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
Next question: Are you using level1 or level2? I,e, do you have those &quot;hash1&quot;, ... fields? If yes, you sould use them!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sdietrich</div><div class="date">13th May 2020, 13:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Günther,<br />
I'm sorry but it doesn't seem to work. I am using SQL queries that can be found in BaaN IV Tools/SQL Queries, not a standard BaaN script or direct SQL server. The idea is here to provide to our users predefined queries with an export in excel for some specific needs they have quite often like items with multiple fields.<br />
I have then tried to put a second query in the tool with an INTO to define a temporary name or even a With kanban(item) AS (select aitc, item from tiitm012 where citt = &quot;KBE&quot; and cntr = &quot;&quot;) but it complains on INTO or second SELECT in same Query.<br />
Does anybody have another clue?<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
Best regards,<br />
Stephane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">13th May 2020, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are using Baan Queries, I am not sure it can handle those kind of complex queries. But, you can definitely use report script to do a lot of things. So, whatever complex logic you want to write, you can utilize report script to do that. Same goes with adding fields. In your report script, you can write logic to send data to a .CSV file directly instead of limited 255 char restricted classic report.<br />
<br />
So, your main query will be a selection on tiitm001 and your report script will fetch values from other tables -  tiitm012 and ticpr170.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">13th May 2020, 15:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally we never did give users access to queries.  But you can do a lot with the reports and report scripts like Bhushan mentioned.  For example you can have different layouts in the report where you pass just the item, but then in the before layout you can get different data from other tables.<br />
<br />
What we did was add reports to the reports sessions. We would clone the standard baan report, then go in and modify it to only have what fields we wanted in a format acceptable to excel.  So our report might just have column headings, field information before it.  For excel we would only print the heading once. And if you play with the settings enough you can even eliminate blank lines.<br />
<br />
We even took this one step farther - we created a device that would look up a report ,download it and then run a macros to format the reports, do charts, sum data, etc.  But there are tools like NAZDAQ and others which will also do this for you also.</div></div><hr />

My idea would be to append to each record some fields from titm001, tiitm012 and ticpr170 but spool.pr.line always seems to be empty. What should I use to access data?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">13th May 2020, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">A simple report will have a Header and Detail layout. Both have a # associated starting from 1.<br />
<br />
Records will be printed in detail layout. So, you will do all the appending inside your detail.1: section<br />
<br />
Sample report script<br />
<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
        do..stuff..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sdietrich</div><div class="date">13th May 2020, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed I managed this afternoon to enrich records with detail.1: before.layout: r_append_line(230, &quot;&quot;, &quot;|Field1|Field2&quot; , &quot;&quot;, REP_FIELD).<br />
It is however not that easy with the header of the columns that are extracted. I think catch it with header.1 but if I try to put my append it modifies the date and page information that is normally not displayed. The &quot;real&quot; header seem to be at lattr.layout.row = 5 of the header but I can't catch it with an if, a definition of the variable or any other trick I tried…<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th May 2020, 15:02</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a lot of information on the board - sample code i used is below for after.receive.data.   Now what you probably can't see is there a &quot;stx&quot; character embedded in the &quot;stx&quot; and on the -tstx on the sort. A consultant helped me write this back in 2000.   There are also posts http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9090.  I think Gunther found a better way to do stuff like this.  <br />
<br />
after.receive.data:<br />
	if(first=0) then<br />
		r.o = seq.open (r.datafile$ &amp; &quot;.tmp&quot;,&quot;w&quot;)<br />
		r.reccount = 0<br />
		while e = 0<br />
			select tipgc001.cplb<br />
			from tipgc001<br />
			where tipgc001._index1 = {:tisfc001.ccot.a,:tisfc001.mitm}<br />
			selectdo<br />
			endselect<br />
			l = seq.puts(concat$(&quot;&quot;,<br />
				tipgc001.cplb,<br />
				tisfc001.pdno,<br />
				tisfc001.ccot.a,<br />
				tisfc001.mitm,<br />
				error.message,r.reccount),r.o)<br />
			r.reccount = r.reccount + 1<br />
			r.read.seq.file()<br />
		endwhile<br />
		l = seq.flush (r.o)<br />
		l = seq.close (r.lfn)<br />
		l = seq.close (r.o)<br />
		l = run.baan.prog( &quot;sort&quot;,&quot;-t +0n -1 +1n -2 &quot; &amp; r.datafile$ &amp; &quot;.tmp -o &quot; &amp; r.datafile$ &amp; &quot;.tmp&quot;, RP_WAIT)<br />
		r.lfn = seq.open (r.datafile$ &amp; &quot;.tmp&quot; ,&quot;a+&quot;)<br />
		r.read.seq.file()<br />
		first = 1<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
after.program:<br />
	l = seq.unlink(r.datafile$ &amp; &quot;.tmp&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sdietrich</div><div class="date">14th May 2020, 16:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks a lot for all your feedbacks, here is finally the easier way I found to replace simply my header:<br />
<br />
header.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	lattr.print = 0<br />
	r_append_line(1, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Article|Libelle|…..&quot;, &quot;&quot;, REP_SPECIAL)<br />
	r_spool_line()<br />
I however keep in mind for a newt time the very good way to replace a function by another but sql queries didn't seem to have a very usable function to replace.<br />
