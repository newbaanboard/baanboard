I meet a problem in Convert to Runtime Data Dictionary. <br />
I add a new field in a table, then i convert table to data dictionary , but i get a error message -- Package Combination record is locked,try again. <br />
I try many times, but it's ineffective. <br />
In this situation, i can't convert any table. How should i resolved this problem?<br />
Thank you very much!!!<br />

<br />
I think application locks are used for this purpose. You you should check the application locks to see who is keeping the record locked. Then make sure this person leaves the session that keeps the table locked and try again. <br />

<br />
The table remains locked in shared memory and this lock goes when shared memory is re-initialized. This lock prevents reconfig of table , re-organize and deletion of table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done this ONE time some years ago (i think it was the ttadv501), because there was always the message &quot;...still has to be converted to runtime&quot; not knowing the background (now i know), afterwards nobody could log in, baan gave a message that there is inconsistence of data and wants a reeboot.<br />
<br />
Please check the oracle database (e.g. with enterprise manager) if there is a lock on the table (even baan gives you the info, there is no lock) with your user? (once i had this strange thing baan shows no lock, but on oracle level there were some locks with my baan user (Version was Oracle 9i).<br />
<br />
Could you please post a picture of the error message?</div></div><hr />
