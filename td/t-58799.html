But lets say index1 has 10 fields in it.  For your query you know fields 1,2 and 5, 6, 7.  Then what you do is :<br />
<br />
where tfgld482._index1 = {:field1, :field2}    &lt;-- This starts it using that index<br />
and    tfgld482.somefield1 = :field5<br />
and    tfgld482.somefield2 = :field6<br />
and    tfgld482.somefield3 = :field7<br />
<br />
That is all their is to it.  Maybe there are better ways in LN, but I don't know.</div></div><hr />
