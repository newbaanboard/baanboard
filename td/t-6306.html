<br />
This is the second time I got this error.<br />
Fatal error: Error 107(Record is locked) on tfgld410( Max retries (10) Exceeded)<br />
Cannot continue in tdpur4121m000in dll: otfglddll4010.<br />
<br />
But there were no locks in the session ttstpdellocks. The system was hanging. I had to stop the database, baan &amp; shut down the server. Even then some internal process was running &amp; the condition of the system was same.<br />
<br />
It took almost 2 hours for it to comeback to its original state. Thats the performance speed.<br />
<br />
Believe in general to a save a line in Maintain Approvals it will not even take 1 second in general condition. But yesterday after 30min it was throwing the above BW message.<br />
<br />
Why does it happen. Why suddenly this type of problems araise. Causing so much of tension in the business peak hours.<br />
<br />
Even now I don't know where exactly the record was locked &amp; why the lock has occured. I trying to understand how this lock has occured,. If anyone can through some light on this, it will be very much helpful to me understand &amp; correct the process.</div></div><hr />

If you do not have sources, look for any patches to the components in question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srkallam</div><div class="date">20th August 2002, 10:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestion......, but most of the discussion has happened on Oracle database. But I am using SQL2K.<br />

...look for any patches to the components in question. <br />
As ~Vamsi said, that could be a bad programming on Baan's part, so look for patches or ask from Baan support. That should have nothing to do with the type of database you're on.</div></div><hr />
