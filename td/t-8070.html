<br />
Reasion for this question: We have a mocc occ with view fields. For that form we have entered a small number for the occ's which should be showen. Now the Session starts, displays our 9 occurences, and leave a big empty space between the last occruence and the bottom of the window?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

If I get your question correctly, then what you'd need to do is invoke the &quot;Form&quot; menu in the form editing screen and choose &quot;Resize window&quot; (same thing as resizing a &quot;layout&quot; in a report)<br />

<br />
think you understand right. I tried this already, but it doesn't help.<br />
<br />
I resized the form - made it smaller- , compieled, but after that action the session appeared in the same size.<br />
<br />

<br />
Are you having problem with the column size? Because I found out that in B5, it will somehow decide on its own how wide a column will be. This sometimes makes the columns overflow to the right side of the window, requiring us to use the horizontal scroll bar to navigate the window. It is pretty apparent with item code field (47 digits in total). No matter how small I tried to make the item field in the form, B5 will make the column wider.<br />
<br />
I don't know the reason for this. Another BB member may know more<br />

When could not find any solution, used table ttadv300 to change the row/column values for that form.<br />
If someone has the solution, please post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">13th December 2002, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been seeing a similar problem for one of my customers. I asked Baan to make a statement on when it would work and when it would not work. They made the statement, see solution 129699.<br />
<br />
This customer however still complains that it does not work, so I think I will need to update some standard components upto portingset. If I found which compontents, I will surely let you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">16th September 2003, 12:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed the problem Paul mentioned on my system several times; namely that when for instance allocating 10 positions in total for 'item' on a form, Baan (5.0b) still allocates a double field with some 47 positions... <br />
<br />
Has anyone found any news / solutions for those issues??<br />
