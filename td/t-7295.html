<br />
I create pdf-files based on Vamsi's program posted on Code and Utilities.<br />
Then I send the pdf-files via microsoft outlook.<br />
It works fine, but now we recognized, that we send orders, or order acknwolegments to suppliers/customers without our logo.<br />
<br />
Now my queston:<br />
Is it possible to merge the ps-file from Baan with another ps-file that contains a letterhead, with ghostscript?<br />
Of course I could insert the logo in the report as described in many other threads.<br />
But that would mean, that I have to customize every report I want to mail.<br />
<br />
My idea is, to add to my ps-pdf-function one more parameter (With or without letterhead).<br />
This would mean, that I can leave all the reports like they are.<br />
<br />
But to do that I have to know something about merging with ghostscript.</div></div><hr />

I have found two programs that can do it www.pdfmachine.com but it doesn't suit printing from Baan very well and http://www.appligent.com/newpages/stamppdf_batch.html<br />
which looks ideal but costs  $2,995.00 (US)</div></div><hr />

I did kind of thing once with RTF output from Baan. Here is the process I adopted.<br />
 First I made a copy of the output from Baan.<br />
 Open this file in Microsoft Word and added a Logo.<br />
 Save this as version 2.<br />
 Diff the first one with the second and bingo, you have the code that is needed to add a logo.<br />
<br />
I did not master RTF specification with this, but golly I was able to print logos on any RTF documents from Baan - totally on the server side.<br />
<br />
So find yourself an editor that can handle Postscript. Open a Baan output in it. Add your logo and see what additional stuff gets added. If you really are going to dig into PS manuals, look to see if they have a concept of overlays (something that gets printed on every page). Then all you will have to do is generate an overlay and merge it with the Baan output. See an implementation of this for PCL in Code &amp; Utilities forum.</div></div><hr />
