<br />
When I try to delete a big list of files from my directory am gettting the error<br />
<br />
ksh: /usr/bin/mv: 0403-027 The parameter list is too long.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I remove part by part I am able to do it<br />
<br />
I am new to Unix. Can anyone help me is there any settings which limits the amount of data in the folder to do this action<br />
<br />
I have this problem even while copying or moving the files from one folder to the other.<br />
<br />
Your quick help is appriciated..as am presently trying get it done with various options..but no success</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">techfan</div><div class="date">9th July 2004, 14:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Try using the xargs command (look it up in your man-pages).<br />
<br />
You could try something like: <br />
<br />
Move all files from directory $1 to directory $2, and echo each move<br />
command just before doing it:<br />
<br />
ls $1 | xargs -i -t mv $1/{} $2/{}<br />
<br />
The above command works on a hp-ux system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ls | while read t<br />
do<br />
rm $t<br />
done<br />
<br />
obviously make sure your in the right directory  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem was a kernel limit regarding the ARG_MAX constant.<br />
The value of the constant ARG_MAX defines how long an argument list your kernel can take on the command line before it chokes<br />
<br />
We increase this constant to a higher value and the problem was solved.<br />

<br />
Juergen can you specify where exactly I can assign value for these constants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juergen</div><div class="date">12th July 2004, 09:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but I think there is no general solution. Tuning of kernel constants differs from unix to unix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">norwim</div><div class="date">15th July 2004, 10:21</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a typical problem that you will run in on any unix system, only the number of args that are valid may differ.<br />
I shouldn't worry about increasing the number of args by tuning the kernel, as there really is no problem dealing with large amounts of files.<br />
What will always help is (something similar was mentioned above, but this is even shorter):<br />
<br />
for i in *pattern* &lt;ENTER&gt;<br />
do&lt;ENTER&gt;<br />
rm $i&lt;ENTER&gt; (or any other command like mv, compress or whatever)<br />
...... [more commands if you like,<br />
....... where $i is one item at a time of the group defined in *pattern*,<br />
....... each command followed by &lt;ENTER&gt; ]<br />
done&lt;ENTER&gt;<br />
With this construction the number of arguments is not relevant.<br />

<br />
the systax is as this:<br />
<br />
find . -name &quot;a*&quot; -exec rm {} \;<br />
<br />
be carefull: all files starting with an a will be removed with this command.<br />
<br />
if all names look the same, there are find parameters to remove based on the date too. see the man find for more info.<br />
<br />
you can test it first with this:<br />
find . -name &quot;a*&quot; -exec ll {} \;<br />
<br />
the {} will be replaced with the found file of the find command each time.<br />
the \; closes the find statement.</div></div><hr />
