<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 22:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all -<br />
I'm having problems joining 2 text fields.  Does anyone have a simple solution?  For lack of, I am trying the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
tmp.file = creat.tmp.file$(bse.tmp.dir$())<br />
ret = text.read(&quot;tihra100.txta&quot;, language$, dummy.str, <br />
     dummy.str, dummy.str,<br />
     dummy.str, dummy.str, dummy.str, tmp.file, 0)<br />
fp = seq.open(tmp.file, &quot;a&quot;)<br />
select	tttxt010.*<br />
from	tttxt010<br />
where	tttxt010._index1 = {:dll.txtn, :language$}<br />
order by tttxt010._index1 <br />
selectdo<br />
	ret = seq.puts(tttxt010.text, fp)<br />
endselect<br />
seq.close(fp)<br />
ret = text.rewrite(&quot;tihra100.txta&quot;,language$, dummy.str, dummy.str, dummy.str, dummy.str,<br />
dummy.str, dummy.str, tmp.file)<br />
<br />
<br />
Which works OK, but seems too complicated.  Also, I am having problems with the creat.tmp.file$ command, as it is always creating a file named &quot;e&quot;, and I while it seems to work, I don't think that is correct either.<br />
<br />
Also, this solution falls apart because of this if I try and do this twice in the same program, because I don't get a unique temporary file name, and the file &quot;e&quot; gets handed to me the second time too, but it already has the values from the first time through.  I would like a second unique temporary file.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's the O/S..?  I am working on NT, Baan IVc4</div></div><hr />

	temp.file = creat.tmp.file$(bse.tmp.dir$())<br />
<br />
<br />
Should always create a unique file name.  I know I have tested this on the system we work on. It is Unix, but I would expect NT to work the same in this case.  So it should create a unique file name.  I do not see why it would create a file called &quot;e&quot;.<br />

Yea...I thought the thing bombed when I checked in debugger and the value for 'tmp.file' was &quot;e&quot; after the creat command, but low and behold, the file &quot;e&quot; is created and used semi-properly.<br />
<br />
This should create the 'TMP###&quot; files, right?  with a unique number?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it should create the tmp######## files - each being unique.  I did a little surfing on the support site and did not see anything specific about this happening. <br />
<br />
Jus thought of this = how is tmp.file declared? Is it like string tmp.file(120).  You might want to check this.  I just did a program the other day when I forgot to put in the (120).  In this case I was getting &quot;a&quot; - the first letter of first directory in the path.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 23:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep..silly.  I was following another post, and declared 'tmp.file' as just string.  Since the tmp directory is located on my e drive, all i got was the 'e'.  When I put the full length, I do get unique temp files.  I'll put a note on that post for anyone else.<br />
<br />
Still...if there is a better way to join 2 texts - append 1 text to another, I would love to see it.  If not, this is working for now, case closed. <br />
<br />
Thanks Mark</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th November 2002, 23:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if this is better, but you could use two temp files to write the text data, execute a cat or whatever the NT equivalent is to concatenate the files, then rewrite the data.  Not sure if this is better, but that is how I would do it using UNIX.<br />

<br />
You can use text.to.buf() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_text_fields_text_to_buf) to get the text from the source text field and then use the seq.puts() to append to the other text field file and do a text rewrite, in this way you can avoid direct selects on tools text tables.</div></div><hr />
