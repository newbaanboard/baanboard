I'm new to LN Programming....<br />
I don't have more knowledge for reports in LN. I have created a standard report with all fields including a table. But I want to know how find the sum of particular field, how to create a new layout and how to use these layout in report script one by one.  Hence can you please give me some ideas about the report customization process in a step by step manner...  Also I want to create a report as like in the attached image.<br />

Hi Pralash,<br />
<br />
It is recommended to have enough tools training before you start working on LN Tools. A basic training is required to go ahead and start developing your own scripts, reports etc. If you get to know the basics, you will figure out the rest easily.<br />
<br />
Coming back to the question - <br />
<br />
You can search the questions on the board and you might find the answers - <br />
<br />
Here's a thread for sum. (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?p=161646)<br />
<br />
Also, you can get the Developers Guide from Infor Xtreme and see if it helps.</div></div><hr />
