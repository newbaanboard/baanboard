I was wondering if it would be possible to have a session that displayed pictures?  For example product labels.  So we could allow users to see what the actual product label looks like.  So in a session it would show the jpeg image and then the description of it?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Yes you can built your own image browser like the display browser, but you have to explore a lot with the Tools. It might be interesting experience to try it out -<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alejandro</div><div class="date">20th June 2002, 02:35</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not an state of the art solution but is simple.<br />
<br />
You have to create a text group with external editor, and attach this to your text table field where you want to link the image.<br />
<br />
You will have users with only read permission and user/s with all rights.<br />
<br />
When you try to introduce a new text, baan will launch notepad. If you want to launch wordpad, you have simply to copy wordpad in notepad path (it is located in win folder), and rename wordpad.exe as notepad.exe. This operation is only needed in user's PC that are going to introduce those images. To introduce your image simply use wordpad's menu option insert object, select insert from file, and look for your jpg or tif file. Then save as selecting RTF format, exit, and nothing more to do.<br />
<br />
When users try to see the text, notepad will be launched and they will recieve a message, 'this file is too long... do you want to launch wordpad to see it? Answer yes and that is all.<br />
<br />
I read how to use wordpad instead notepad in an old BaaNFans message.<br />
<br />
Hope this help you.</div></div><hr />
