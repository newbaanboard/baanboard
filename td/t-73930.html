<br />
I would like to group my sales delivery details based on 1st free numbers.<br />
For example i have series for my sales order;<br />
A01 - SO Alz<br />
A02 - SR Alz<br />
A03 - SO Azt<br />
A04 - SR Azt<br />
<br />
therefore, in details i have done;<br />
model = tcms050.desc (3,10)<br />
so it able to print &quot;Alz&quot; for series that start with A01 and A02 and &quot;Azt&quot; for series A03 and A04 only.<br />
<br />
And then i wanted to group it by model.<br />
I tried to declared &quot;model&quot; as input field and create after.field.model at report layout. but it is not working.<br />
<br />
may i know how?<br />
your advice is much appreciated.<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th July 2021, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't find it, but it seems like I had to do something like this for a seeded baan report.  For what ever reason I had to add some totals on a field I could not sort by.  If I recall correctly what I did was move detail.1 to detail.2.  I added detail.1 to be the new totals (or some other information) - so I ended up adding (or using the existing) report script.  I did something like below.<br />
<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
	domain tccwoc somewc<br />
	domain tchrs  tothrs<br />
<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
	somewc =&quot;&quot;<br />
	tothrs =0<br />
<br />
| Is the summary Detail<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
if somewc &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot; 		  | Skip printing it first time into the layout<br />
   and somewc&lt;&gt;tisfc010.cwoc then | print only when workcenter changes<br />
	lattr.print = true<br />
else<br />
	lattr.print = false<br />
endif<br />
<br />
after.layout:<br />
if somewc&lt;&gt;tisfc010.cwoc then<br />
  tothrs =0	<br />
endif<br />
<br />
| This was the original layout in the report - it printed each details.<br />
detail.2:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	somewc = tisfc010.cwoc<br />
        tothrs = tothrs + tisfc0101.rutm<br />
<br />
<br />
When it came to reports I did a lot of things that could have been done better if we actually owned the code.  I do not know if the above will work for your situation in LN, but it solved what ever it was I needed at the time.</div></div><hr />

then in report<br />

and it resulted, my after.field printed after each detail line.<br />
i wanted to group in model or in tcmcs050.seri. but it don't workout.<br />
tried the proposal, it is also printed in each line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andreas.toepper</div><div class="date">22nd July 2021, 08:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it cannot be done with classic Baan/LN ways. That's because of how the printing works:<br />
The print sessions collects the data and writes all datasets into a ascii or xml file. Then the report is started and the first think the report program does is sorting the data file based on the sorting of the input fields. I think this is still done by calling a sort-program of the porting set. So, we do get a new sorted file.<br />
And this resulting file is opened be the report and the datasets are used in the now given order.<br />
All programming in the report script (die before/after sections) will work on the sorted file.  So, it's too late to sort or group data, when the sorted file is already created.<br />
<br />
But<br />
<br />
This may change, when you are using extensions in LN 10.7. There you can modify the xml file (created by the print session) before it is handed over to the report program. So, you will be able to change the sorting and grouping of a report, I think.<br />
I still have not used that kind of extension, so this is still theoretical knowledge to me. As far as I know this will work with reports only that will use a xml data file (so everything pdf related, like display devices, when the output is a pdf).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd July 2021, 14:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this a session or an easy-sql report?  If it is an easy-sql you are running I would convert it to a session.  Then you can get everything you need for a report in the session and sent it to the report.  Otherwise if it has to stay in the report script you just need to play with keeping your after field layout from printing until the right time. Or change it from after.field to a detail.layout and control how it prints.<br />
<br />
And Andreas you can still add additional sorts to report after the files is created for the report.   One way is http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=9090&amp;highlight=advanced that gunther has posted.  His solution was I think better than mine - in my case I actually added a field to the file, then sorted it using the unix command sort, then re-opened the file for the report.</div></div><hr />
