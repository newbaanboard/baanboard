<br />
I am getting a strange error while I am committing any transaction. <br />
<br />
I my function A its inserting record properly. But in my function B its showing error at the time of commit.transaction().<br />
<br />
Please share the possible issues.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
check your logfiles !<br />
<br />
Oracle error 1536 = space quota exceeded for tablespace <br />
<br />
Give more Information about the structure, please.<br />

(retry point ? ...... ?)<br />

My piece of code is like this<br />
<br />
ret = db.insert(ttdwps202,db.retry)<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	if ret = 0 then<br />
		commit.transaction()<br />
	endif<br />
When it comes to db.insert() its returning zero but at the time of committing its throwing this error.<br />
<br />
And yes I have used db.retry.point()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">21st October 2016, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the following things - <br />
<br />
1. Are both function A and B inserting into same table?<br />
2. Is there any commit after function A?<br />
3. Are you checking for duplicate records? <br />
4. Is the data correct i.e no special characters,etc ?<br />
<br />
As already mentioned by Bernd, 1536 = Oracle DB Error (http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e17766/e1500.htm#sthref841) which could either be related to the permissions on the table, may be data issue or something is not right with the table definition. Check your log files and if possible post your full code.<br />
<br />
It could also be that you have another table in which you already put so much data that you were close to the quota and the create table was just pushing it over the edge.</div></div><hr />

No Record being inserted into different table<br />
2. Is there any commit after function A?<br />
Yes In the function after db.insert() I have used commit.<br />
3. Are you checking for duplicate records? <br />
There is No record presents in my table and I am checking duplicate values too./COLOR]<br />
4. Is the data correct i.e no special characters,etc ?<br />
[COLOR=&quot;RoyalBlue&quot;] No Data is correctl<br />

<br />
Yes 1 thing I forgot to mention that previously I was inserting record into the table and it was getting inserted. But after I modified the table definition(Added a field) and I did CRDD. The table definition is fine, but data is not getting inserted even through GTM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like you have a problem here. What is the table structure? What modifications you did?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srprks</div><div class="date">21st October 2016, 14:04</div></div><div class="posttext">I have added a field only. and that field to the index..<br />
<br />
One more issue. While I am deleting the table its taking huge time. So I terminated it manually. I think there is something which is not allowing to delete the tables too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">21st October 2016, 14:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Was there any data before you changed the index? Stopping the process might have surely impacted the table. If its just a new test table you can try creating a new one instead and delete this one. It might have been corrupted and you will need to go through the recovery process for the table first.<br />
<br />
But well, its not your programming issue but indeed the issue is with the table definition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srprks</div><div class="date">21st October 2016, 14:43</div></div><div class="posttext">okk Thanks<br />
<br />
 I will go with your suggested steps.</div></div><hr />

I checked our system and we do not have a td-wps module. If its your custom code, then post it here so others can review to help you.<br />
<br />
Based on the Oracle error code information -<br />
 ORA-01536: space quota exceeded for tablespace 'string'<br />
    Cause: The space quota for the segment owner in the tablespace has been exhausted and the operation attempted the creation of a new segment extent in the tablespace.<br />
    Action: Either drop unnecessary objects in the tablespace to reclaim space or have a privileged user increase the quota on this tablespace for the segment owner.<br />
Use one of the following scripts to check the table space quota in the DB-<br />
query to check tablespace size and freespace (https://community.oracle.com/thread/507636)<br />
Monitoring Tablespace Usage in Oracle (http://www.databasejournal.com/features/oracle/monitoring-tablespace-usage-in-oracle.html)<br />
Find out free space on tablespace (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7672126/find-out-free-space-on-tablespace)<br />
Oracle tablespace script (http://www.dba-oracle.com/t_tablespace_script.htm)<br />
<br />
If you do not have enough free space then you can set the table space to auto extend or increase the size. Refer to -<br />
Changing Datafile Size (https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28310/dfiles003.htm)<br />

<br />
How many records are in the table?<br />
 One more issue. While I am deleting the table its taking huge time. So I terminated it manually. I think there is something which is not allowing to delete the tables too. <br />
How are you deleting the table? Are you using ttaad4231m000? or any custom code? <br />
Are you using these commands - db.delete() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_db_operations_db_delete) or db.drop.table() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_db_operations_db_drop_table) or db.clear.table() (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_functions_db_operations_db_clear_table)?<br />
How did you terminate it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">21st October 2016, 19:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I thought of it as well. But he mentioned this -<br />
<br />
&quot;There is No record presents in my table and I am checking duplicate values too&quot; and hence I dropped the idea of having huge table size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">srprks</div><div class="date">22nd October 2016, 06:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi NP Rao SIr,<br />
<br />
As Bhusan already mentioned it may not be a programmatic error. Basically its due to the change in table definition.<br />
<br />
It was working fine before I reconfigured the table after adding a field and that field to index.<br />
<br />
I have used the session ttaad4231m000 to delete the table. When I was deleting it,it took long time to delete that table although there are no records in that table. So I used bshell to kill all processes. <br />
<br />
That's it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajesh</div><div class="date">23rd October 2016, 10:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Please post more of your code , the ones which you have posted has minimal information..<br />
<br />
also, are you sure, you are not using just one commit.transaction and two db.retry.points or vice versa?<br />
<br />
Also, just do create runtime of your Table once again, and then log out and try again<br />
<br />
Also, Is your table structure proper? The Field which is being inserted into primary index , Is it really unique?</div></div><hr />
