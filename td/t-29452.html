We use Citrix to access Baan as our Baan servers are located in Europe and Citrix offers better performance.<br />
<br />
However, this also causes us problems in developing sessions which make use of functions such as server2client etc. When using these functions to move files from the Baan server to our client PC's the return values is always negative indicating that the C:\ wasnt found. However, when I run the same session but directly invoking the Baan client on my machine, it works just fine. So this makes me believe that the problem is due to Citrix.<br />
<br />
Not sure if anyone else has faced this problem and has a work around for this.<br />
<br />
FYI - we use Baan IVc4<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">3rd January 2007, 22:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Our citrix machines do not allow writing to their c drives(write protected) and the actual client c drive was not really accessible from Baan through Citrix(granted I never really looked into it).  So what we did was to create a directory on a common network drive.  At all of our sites they logon with a network drive like k:\common.  We just put a directory out there to work with things like server2client. Is there a way to map a drive from the citrix server directly to the PC?  Something that you could get setup for everyone that logs into baan via citrix.  Or maybe even a common drive like we use?</div></div><hr />

Let me make sure I understand what you are trying to say here-<br />
<br />
We have to map some server (say machine xyz and folder &quot;common&quot;) onto the Citrix server as say K: drive. And use K:\common in Baan scripts to use server2client functions. All users will also have to map this server on their individual PC's to access these files?<br />
<br />
That is something I suppose we can look into.<br />
<br />
Will have to check with our team who handle Citrix. - Thanks Mark for your suggestion.<br />
<br />
So the reason that server2client function fails is that the users dont have permissions to the Citrix C:\ ?? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darren Phillips</div><div class="date">4th January 2007, 01:40</div></div><div class="posttext">It is common practice to lock access to the drives on the terminal/citrix server. I normally go a step further and use hidecalc so they cannot even see them. What your citrix admins may also have done which again is comman practice is to use drive letters further up the alphabet to build the citrix servers. so that within published apps the C drive is really the local clients C drive, now to do this citrix is doing some fiddling in the background. The Baan client which isn't aware of this happening is probably not able to deal with it. so my guess would be it is the permissions or the admins have remapped the drive letters on the citrix servers.<br />
