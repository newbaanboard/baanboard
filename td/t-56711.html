<br />
I need your help! When a certain field on form is focused, I need to know if the user focused this field by TAB-key or by mouseclick.<br />
I already tried it with the event functions, but it didn't work and I never used this functions before. So I need some help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th September 2009, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know about LN, but I am not sure you can trap the tab key.  Maybe if you described in more detail what you are trying to accomplish then somebody might have some suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">schreddermaus</div><div class="date">9th September 2009, 09:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a list session with 5 editable fields per row. The user normally has to fill 2 of these fields. So he wants the other 3 fields to be skipped by pressing the TAB key and only reach them by mouseclicking. It means when the user press a key to get to the next input field he just want to input in 2 of 5 fields (and skip the other 3). If he wants to fill one of the 3 fields, he has to focus it by a mouseclick.<br />
<br />
Therefor I need to know if the user did a mouseclick or a keypress to focus a field for input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th September 2009, 14:33</div></div><div class="posttext">You might be able to use the to.field() command - not sure.  I think you might be able to put it in the after.input field of the second input field. This would skip the other three fields - I believe then the user would have to click in the field to provide input.  So check out the help on to.field().</div></div><hr />

Does that mean 1st field in the row of a list field mandatory or it could be any 2  of 5 fields . Also can entry be in more than 2 fields or just 2 fields. Are these fields array on form.</div></div><hr />

It's the first editable field in row an the 4th.<br />
<br />
@mark_h: Does to.field() also work with webtop? It has to work with webtop.</div></div><hr />

I tried it with to.field() but this didn't work in the webtop. If you press the TAB key you skip to any field in another record... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">v_kewl</div><div class="date">20th September 2009, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Whether user want to enter 2 entries or more are based on some coditions ? If yes is ur answer then u can use functions 'inputfield.invisible()' and 'inputfield.visible()' and make unwanted fields invisible. If no then u can still use this, make first two field visible and after input on second field make third visible, if user skip the input on third then 4th and 5th wil remain invisible, means depending upon input on a field its consecutive field wil get visible.<br />
<br />
Its just and Idea nothing compusolry :)<br />
