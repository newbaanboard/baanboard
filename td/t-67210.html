<br />
Whenever assigning &quot;\r&quot; to any variable it is showing &quot;\\r&quot;.<br />
<br />
Even tried with string of length 2 cahracters.<br />
<br />
if use var(1;1) then also it is showing &quot;\\&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also tried with chr$(92) instead of using &quot;\&quot; but same result.<br />
<br />
Why this is hapening ? Any suggestion...?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
What are you trying to do?<br />
<br />
If you just want to write this in a  file, use<br />
<br />
x = chr$(92) &amp; &quot;r&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
e.g<br />
string x(2) <br />
long fp<br />
<br />
fp = seq.open(&quot;test.txt&quot;,&quot;w+&quot;)<br />
x = chr$(92) &amp; &quot;r&quot;<br />
seq.puts(x,fp)<br />
seq.close(fp)<br />
<br />
This will write \r in your text file.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I am trying to send mail from baan application through shell().<br />
I am trying to put the command <br />
<br />
awk 'sub(&quot;$&quot;,&quot;\r&quot;)'<br />
<br />
If you check the variable It's considering awk 'sub(&quot;$&quot;,&quot;\\r&quot;)'<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

If this is causing problems, you can simply write your command to a shell script and execute it from Baan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bpanda</div><div class="date">5th January 2015, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks...<br />
But I want to know the reason of condering &quot;\\r&quot; instead of &quot;\r&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;\&quot; is a escape character in baan script. Baan usually uses &quot;\\&quot; to denote &quot;\&quot;. Same goes with other languages like C# etc.<br />
<br />
It's just an escaped string.  The .Length property should recognize this and only return the proper length of a string.  In other words, &quot;\\&quot; is &quot;\&quot;, it's just represented as two slashes, because &quot;\&quot; is the escape character.  To indicate that you really want a backslash, and don't want to escape the next character, you have to escape the backslash. <br />
<br />
The Length property is unaffected by this, and counts &quot;\\&quot; as one character, the backslash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your reply, I'm sure now this was not the problem.<br />
<br />
I  am facing problem while sending mails (from baan) multiple times.<br />
Out of 40 mails sometimes 4-6 mails are missing or even more.<br />
But in debug if I check, it's executing to send mail and failing.<br />
if I use go to option in debug and execute that once again then it sends again &amp; mail comes.<br />
<br />
I tried with suspend() upto 5 minutes also, but the same result.<br />
In the command there was &quot;\r&quot; which was considering &quot;\\r&quot; by baan.<br />
So I guessed due to &quot;\\r&quot; it might be giving that problem.<br />
<br />
I am working on unix server, Baan 5c<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
