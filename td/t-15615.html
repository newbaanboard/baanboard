<br />
I have one query. <br />
<br />
Lets I start the Sales order (For example) print session to print some sales orders. I provide a range of sales order i.e. SOR000125 to SOR000135 and proceed to print. These selected sales order are belongs to different Business Partners. what will happen that Baan will generate only one report document containing all sales orders for different Business partners, and I cant send this document to any Business partner. <br />
<br />
Is there any possibility to add some parameter in report or device script or somewhere else that Baan generate different report document for each sales order even provide a range of sales order number for printing. Some thing like pre-processing before the Baan generate report in Baan standard binary format.<br />
<br />
The same situation for Purchase order, RFQ, Sales offers and other documents.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

    AFS is known as application function server programming, consists set of in built functions to interact with sessions.  Through these commands you can invoke any session in baan in background and pass values to any form field available on the session.  Try to refer your technical manual on commands that start with stpapi.*.  Here is one link I got when I searched on baanboard.<br />
http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=7251&amp;highlight=AFS<br />

Hope this works for you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks again friend. <br />
<br />
One more thing, What you think this AFS wrapper should be in the same print session script or I can manage it from out side the script, like some where in a 4GL program script attached with a printing device, and on selection of device I use the AFS commands to send the SOR one by one as parameters to the report. <br />
<br />
Actually my idea is not to extend the standard printing sessions, instead I do some thing from one central point for all required reports.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trchandra</div><div class="date">9th June 2004, 18:27</div></div><div class="posttext">This AFS wrapper is another session with form where you enter range of sales orders and inside this program you call all stpapi.* commands to send data to the standard session.  So you dont require to do any modifications to your standard print session.  You can even select the device in this AFS wrapper session and pass the same device to standard session.  If you have not written any AFS in the past, first try few simple examples before you start on SO printing.</div></div><hr />

As trchandra mentioned it would be best to write this as a separate session.  And if you wanted to get real fancy you could write one session that prints various types of orders(Purchase, Sales, Production, etc).  You could have it call different libraries for different reports or Baan sessions.<br />
<br />
I used exactly what he mentioned to allow users to print purchase orders. I cloned the standard Baan session(new session still uses same script), added some extra info to the PO report.  Then my print PO session allows them to put in a range, it then calls the cloned session one order at a time - only printing finalized orders.  This was done to keep non purchasing users out of the Baan print po session, which was one step in finalizing POs.<br />

Mark, I am doing in the same way as you suggested and sent me the sample code, the only difference is you written above logic in cloned session and I am writting in an script. Idea is to use the same script for all other reports.<br />

Thanks for efforts, problem is bit resolved with the session. I created a test session and added the same code in before.program section, its work fine. <br />

<br />
Friends, problem is still there, let me explain the current situation.<br />
<br />
I have added a new device named &quot;D_NAME&quot;, and written the same code that run fine from a session. When I run these stpapi.* commands from session, at following statement <br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;,&quot;orno.f&quot;,&quot;POR000025&quot;)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;,&quot;orno.t&quot;,&quot;POR000025&quot;)<br />
<br />
spool.device = &quot;D&quot;<br />
spool.report = &quot;rtdpur440101000&quot;<br />
stpapi.set.report(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;,spool.report,spool.device,errmsg)<br />
<br />
till here it launch new session (&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;) in background and set the values, and at the next statement <br />
<br />
stpapi.continue.process(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;, errmsg)<br />
<br />
a new job add in Print Queue (session: ttaad3521m000) with status &quot;premature&quot; and at statement <br />
<br />
stpapi.end.session(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;)<br />
<br />
this job executes well and status updated as &quot;done&quot;. There is no problem in this situation. But when I tried the same code from the device script (D_NAME), and tried to set the parameters as<br />
<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;,&quot;orno.f&quot;,&quot;POR000025&quot;)<br />
stpapi.put.field(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;,&quot;orno.t&quot;,&quot;POR000025&quot;)<br />
<br />
spool.device = &quot;D&quot;<br />
spool.report = &quot;rtdpur440101000&quot;<br />
stpapi.set.report(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;,spool.report,spool.device,errmsg)<br />
<br />
it start new session (tdpur4401m000) in backgroud, I found this new session in &quot;ottstpshell&quot; with command &quot;PS&quot;, and set the values. Till here no problem it works same as it work from session, the diference is at the next statement. At statement<br />
<br />
stpapi.continue.process(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;, errmsg)<br />
<br />
no job add in print Queue,  even no error message. Thats why it do not print any report<br />
<br />
What could be reason, and workaround?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I am not sure how to handle that.  Something you could try is to leave the code in the print session and do zoom.to or activate the print session from the device driver.  Maybe then it will activate a new print job and device.  Not sure I have never really tried it.<br />

<br />
Yes mark, you are right, I am trying to to launch another print request with one order number, while I am in the middle of a print request started with the range of order numbers. <br />
<br />
I tried that Activate and zoom.to , but it only activate the requested session for the user action with the passing values. When I proceed by pressing the Print button in the activated session, nothing happen, its remains idle.<br />
<br />
I think problem is that there are more then one instances of same print session in shell and when I try to call <br />
<br />
stpapi.continue.process(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;, errmsg)<br />
<br />
its not identified for which session this statement is requested. Is there any way that I can pass the Process ID (PID) of the session instead of the session code, or some other way, to identify the exact session. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
Mahmood</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd June 2004, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I can not think of anything that would work.  I guess the way that I saw this working would be from a session and not a device script.  This is a simple example of what I thought you would be doing.  <br />
<br />
(1) User would run a session and input order range.<br />
(2) This session would do something like this:<br />
      select tdpur040.*<br />
      from .....<br />
      where....<br />
      group by tdpur040.suno,tdpur040.orno<br />
      selectdo<br />
         **** Here is where the stpapi code goes ****<br />
         **** Orders printed in sequence by supplier ****<br />
      endselect<br />
<br />
So you would have a library for each of the order types you want to print.  So in effect if you really wanted to get fancy in the session you could ask for which type of orders they wanted to print, what order range, and what business partner or supplier(could be a range).  Then call each routine with the appropriate stpapi commands. In this case for the sales orders you mentioned in the first post you would first do a select to get each of the business partners, then call the stpapi subroutine to print each business partner on a different report.  This in effect would give you one session to print all the order information.<br />

How I resolved the problem? only by setting the spool.id = 0 in main function before calling &quot;Print.PurchaseOrder.Main()&quot; method. <br />
<br />
In my openion the &quot;choice.cont.process&quot; section which execute by the statement &quot;stpapi.continue.process(&quot;tdpur4401m000&quot;, errmsg)&quot;, it checks if any spool exists for this process then it not create any new spool and try to use it. That point exactly was the reason of problem, because the spool for that process already has print job request in premature status and its not allowed to change its attributes. <br />
By setting spool.id = 0, it assume that there is not spool available for this process, and it creates a new spool for its print job request.<br />
<br />
<br />
In function &quot;get.OrderNumber.BusinessPartners()&quot;, I just get the order number ( in ORNo.From, ORNo.To variables) and business partner number provided in the print session using get.var()  methods.<br />
<br />
[get.var(&lt;ProcessID&gt;, strip$(&quot;orno.f&quot;), ORNo.From)]<br />
[get.var(&lt;ProcessID&gt;, strip$(&quot;orno.f&quot;), ORNo.To)]<br />
I think the above description give the clear idea.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all of you for efforts<br />
