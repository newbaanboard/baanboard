Here is what I am trying and facing(BaaN V): I go to Sales Order Enrty=&gt;Sales Order Lines Overview (S.O.L.O)=&gt; Go to VIEW menu (from top menus bar with File, Edit, View, Specific etc. menus)=&gt; It locks up as soon as I point the mouse to Sort-by option there. Even it doesn't open/display the Sorting options available in SORT-By. It locks up and can't open anything else in BaaN (Total freeze). The only option to come out of this is killing of bshell using windows task manager. It happens only for 2-3 users, not for all. We have checked the PC and Baan users data setup. There is no problem anywhere. What could be wrong? Any idea? Please suggest.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may try the followings:<br />
The users who are facing the problem login on the other PC where this problem is not occurs with the other user.<br />
Other user who are not facing this problem, login on the PC where this problem is occurs.<br />
This will helps to make it sure that if the problem is actually on the PC configuration or in the Baan user configuration.<br />
If the problem is on PC and client on windows, I suggest check windows updates on the microsft site and run all possible update and service pack on PC.<br />
If problem is in Baan user data, delete the user and then create again, restart the server if server is on windows, some time it work.<br />
You may also check the SQL server log, purge the log and make more space.<br />
<br />
Best of luck<br />

It locks up on other PCs too. It seems something else no the PC specific. Even these users login were created by copying the other users. So the user configuration is same as others. Only 2 users are having this problem. We have had changed their PCs 2 times in the past but it did not make any difference.<br />
Any more inputs or suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try one more thing, I am not sure if this could help you. Are the Baan users are also the DB users? if yes, then delete the user from the Database and then create them again. <br />
<br />
Also, try to create a new user in the Baan and check if the new user have the same problem or not. If the new user can work without error it means the user definition in the Baan has some problem and it is not actually updated by simply delete the user and create them by copying the other user. You can try like, delete the user from baan, convert the runtime DD for the deleted user and logout from baan. Login again and then try to create the same user. <br />
<br />
The last thing, you can simply create a new named user and delete the older one if problem remains unresolved.<br />

Best of luck<br />
