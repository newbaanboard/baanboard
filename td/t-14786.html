<br />
Display session with form type 3 (main+with view).<br />
<br />
When user hits the spyglass on the form to search for a record (choice.def.find) I want to check the input after the user tabs. I tried to do it in the field sections: before.checks, or after.field.changes but the program doesn't hit those at all. Then I tried the zoom section (because user can zoom from the def.find section to select the record, but also this section is not hit by the program when clicking the spyglass. Where can I program this check???<br />

Of course I forgot to mention the obvious... I had indeed tried also the on.choice and after.choice section in choice.def.find yet the on.choice seems not to be hit at all when searching a key-record, and the after.choice is hit only after the records are picked up. I need to check the input of the field entered in the def.find dialog, before it continues to the next field.<br />
<br />
Just for clearity: I want to implement the sort by search argument function based on a comma (,) at the end of the input, for the entered value [group view field is a BP]<br />
<br />
Anyone can help me with this??<br />
