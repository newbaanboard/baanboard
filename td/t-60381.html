N<br />
A50,0,0,1,1,1,N,&quot;Example 1&quot;<br />
P1<br />
But how can I put this in a string?<br />
Any help would be very apreciated.<br />

We use the RMCis product for our labels, but you can send the zebra commands to a report on the printer.  You will need to get the ZPL commands correct.</div></div><hr />

unfortunatly, we have EPL Printer.<br />
Or can I use ZPL for this too?<br />

I can't say for sure, because we converted from jetadmin type connection into using the RMCis label generator product.  Most of ours have been converted to something like ZM4000's(I think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pconde</div><div class="date">13th April 2011, 17:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Here an example how we define a zebra ZPL flow in a report<br />
the field FFFFFFFF are form fields filled by the script.all other are codes interpreted by the zebra printer<br />
<br />
this is ZPL but I think that EPL should follow the same logic<br />

I think we can change the firmware to ZPL.<br />
Will try it tomorrow, maybe it works better.<br />
I do not have to provide special character like chr(..) etc.<br />
Thanks to all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">schweizer</div><div class="date">14th April 2011, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Mike,<br />
actually I did almost the same.<br />
I defined a device like &quot;print to file&quot; and put the printer queue as <br />
output path like \\22.272.32.33\zm400. <br />
But it prints allways the raw data.<br />
Have you something special configured in the zm400 printer settings and <br />
can you confirm the way to cofigure the print device in BAAN? <br />
Thank you very much for your input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">schweizer</div><div class="date">15th April 2011, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mike,<br />
I now defined the device &quot;print to file&quot; and it works.<br />
The most diffecult part was to install the printer, the IP was lost many times, the printer was changing to color ribbon, in short it was pretty confusing.<br />
Again, thanks to all for your help.<br />

<br />
I suppose that when you say &quot;raw data&quot;  you receive the code defined in the report.<br />
This means that the string send to the printer is not interpreted because it is protected. <br />
You didn't describe your system and the printer settings<br />
If it is a windows <br />
- if the printer is defined with the EPL driver (windows setting)  try replacing it with the driver for &quot;generic printer&quot;.<br />
If it is a unix system there are more options: <br />
- windows printer ==&gt; see above<br />
- unix queue: which driver did you use in the ERP LN session &quot;Maintain device&quot; ? I'm not sure that Infor deliver an EPL driver for the Zebra printer. Check the driver used and try with a generic driver (not PCL)<br />
<br />

Downloading a PCX Graphic using EPL<br />
<br />
Use the following steps for downloading a PCX graphic file to a printer with a flash (nonvolatile) memory card installed with DOS operating system commands. This procedure may also be done from within a MSDOS window from a Windows® operating system. See the M, EI, FI, GI &amp; U commands to manage the printer's memory.<br />
1.Generate the PCX graphic file with the following considerations: ◦Black and White (Bitmap) only. <br />
◦Set Dot Density (Resolution) of the bitmap to match the printer's print head resolution. All EPL2 printers have a 203 dpi (dots per inch) resolution except the TLP3642 has a 300 dpi resolution. <br />
◦Crop the image as small as possible to speed printing and maximize memory usage. <br />
◦The file's name should be 1 to 7 characters long followed by the PCX DOS file extension. Examples: zebhead.pcx <br />
◦Graphic file size cannot exceed available printer memory. (See config label for available memory)<br />
<br />
2.Type DIR *.PCX at the DOS prompt (example C:&gt;), in the disk/directory that the PCX graphic file is stored in. Read and record the file size for the file(s) to be downloaded.<br />
<br />
Record file size as: 1908<br />
3.Generate a program (ASCII text) file for each PCX graphic file to be downloaded. (This is configuring the printer to accept the graphic download.) <br />
Example - <br />
<br />
GK&quot;ZEBHEAD&quot;  - This removes any previous download (Quotes are required)<br />
 GM&quot;ZEBHEAD&quot;1908   - This sets the name and block size for the download (Quotes are required)      <br />
<br />
Note: Place your curser after the last numeric digit in the file name data and assure you delete any following characters such as line feeds or carriage returns. For example, in the above, place the curser after 1908 and press &quot;Delete&quot; several times.<br />
<br />
Save the file as a 1-8 character file name and include a .TXT extension. Always save files in ASCII text format.<br />
<br />
Example: zebhead.txt<br />
<br />
4.Verify that printer has memory available to download the graphics. See the M, FI, GI &amp; U commands to verify and manage the printer's memory.<br />
5.Use the DOS COPY command to download the text and graphic files to printer memory. (The /B sets the download to binary)<br />
<br />
Example: COPY zebhead.txt + zebhead.pcx /B LPT1<br />
<br />
6.Repeat process for each PCX graphic.<br />
7.You can send the GI command to assure the graphic has successfully downloaded. See the EPL manual for details.<br />
8.To print the logo, use the GG command to recall and print the logo.<br />
<br />
 Example:<br />
 N<br />
 GG10,10,&quot;ZEBHEAD&quot;<br />
 P1<br />
<br />
 Save the file as a 1-8 character file name and include a .TXT extension.<br />
<br />
 Example: label.txt<br />
9.Use the DOS COPY command to send this file to the printer.<br />
10.The Zebra Logo should print on your label.<br />
<br />
