I have a strange problem. I have a report with the Layouts Before.report, Detail and After.report. In the After.report Layout i have 4 fields where i use the aggregate function (the domain is tc mcs.double and all field settings are the same). 3 of these fields show the correct sum, but one shows a false sum. The sum is almost twice of the amount it should be (but not exactly). Any ideas what the reason could be?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st June 2012, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Just put the report in debug mode and step through it.  But first - I would check that the data is getting to the report correctly.  Make sure there is nothing in the report script that might impact the field.  The run a small amount of data - check what gets read into the field and what happens as you step through the report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you. I found the problem:<br />
<br />
sum.hrea.cost = sum.hrea * (ticpr150.wgrt + ticpr150.mcrt + ticpr150.ohrt)<br />
<br />
aiu = sum.hrea.cost + mitmcost<br />
<br />
if aiu = 0 and aiu.null = tcyesno.no then<br />
	lattr.print = false<br />
endif<br />
<br />
sum.hrea.cost, mitmcost and aiu have value 0 and sum.hrea not. Does that mean when lattr.print = false is used i have to set all values to 0 when i use the aggregate function? With other words the aggregate function will sum the value even the line is not printed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th June 2012, 15:17</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understand correctly then yes when you set lattr.print to false then yes you might need to set the variables to zero.  Since I do not know the report or the script I can't be sure.  Or as Gunther mentioned - maybe add a where clause to the aggregate itself.</div></div><hr />
