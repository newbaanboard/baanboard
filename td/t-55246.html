  <br />
I am working with Infor LN 6.1  <br />
  <br />
Anybody can explain me how to know from where a DAL script is being called?<br />
  <br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

Changes or additions to the default functionality for a session are programmed in a UI-script (for UI specific tasks) and DAL (for Business Logic related tasks)<br />
<br />
Programmers create a user interface (UI) script to change the default behavior of a session and a DAL script to program all the logical integrity rules for a particular table. So the DAL ensures the logical integrity of the database. As in previous versions of the software, the database server ensures the referential integrity of the database.<br />
<br />
The DAL script for a particular table has the same name as that table. It is implemented as a DLL that can be accessed by user interface scripts (via the 4GL engine ) and by other DALs. The following diagram illustrates the overall relationship of these components.<br />

<br />
the whole concept of DAL is that it should not care or know who calls it. A DAL should only care about the object (Table record field values). If your requirement is that the DAL functionality should depend on the Session name then you have to review your concept.</div></div><hr />

  The Concept of DAL is related to the particular table(field/record) as explain by vahdani.<br />
Whenever any session or any code of your script is related to that particular table(means updating the record or inserting the record) and if DAL is there for that table, then DAL gets called automatically.<br />
<br />
for example if your DAL is on table &quot;XYZ&quot;, And from script &quot;abcd&quot; you are updating the record of XYZ then The DAL of XYZ gets called. If you easily trace this by running your code in debug mode.</div></div><hr />

But not in all DALs are specific routines for any operation.<br />
<br />
Also a DAL is called using command dal.start.business.method to call an external function of that DAL. In some scripts the DAL is used as a general library but this is a very bad style.</div></div><hr />
