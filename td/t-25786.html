<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">1st December 2005, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi dear friends,   Nowadays , I have gotton serious critical problems with audit files in our system. WE got Error-254  series.When we get the error but purge operations or other audit file operations get failed to solve it and we had to remove files in audit folder then it worked well. But this is unwanted solution. One day it gives for tiitm  after 20-25 days it gives for tdpur . I don't understand reason of these problems. Now I have a big problem.I must run audit for tiitm. But tiitm audit files got failed 20 days ago. Now I couldn't run audit for 1 month ago. our fabric works full time. Is there anyway to solve it. I don't loguout all user and exchange audit files and run audit for it after that exhange it with updated audit files(last used ). This is very boring !<br />
Do you have any comments for it ?<br />
<br />
Thank you !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">csecgn</div><div class="date">2nd December 2005, 22:59</div></div><div class="posttext">First: look at log.audit. It can be very helpfull. <br />
<br />
We've had problems with audit also. I try to describe what has been the reason and what we've done to solve it:<br />
<br />
Audit uses flatfiles for storing the data. The number of this flatfiles is limited!<br />
Every a time a file is full (approx. 2MB), audit creates a new file and increases the filenumber. If the number of file becomes to large, audit starts again with 0. If the file exists, you get an error and all operations on the audited table crashes.<br />
We've had problems with tdinv001 because the stock data has been in audit and we have very many stocktaking operations (all together approx. &gt; 80.000 changes in tdinv001 per day). <br />
All this actions became audited... . It needed 3 Month to fill the audit files, after this time we had to remove them.<br />
<br />
Our solutions has been to disable audit for the stocktaking fields in the table (its a flag in the table definition).<br />
<br />
After this (and a restart of baan), the growth of the audit files became &quot;normal&quot;. I'm not sure, but I think the problem starts with a new porting set (we didn't recognize it before ?)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
