One easy way is to log into Baan click file/run and in the program field put sh or ksh.  Make sure you click the box for Run external program.<br />

I once had a unix script that searched for all dll's and piped the filenames to bic_info.  I then took the output and created a series of html documents for our developers to use.</div></div><hr />
