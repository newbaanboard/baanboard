<br />
Wish you all a very Happy New Year.<br />
<br />
SERVER : ERP LN 6.1 FP7<br />
OS : Windows 2008<br />
<br />
I have come across a requirement where our client needs one of their material in another unit. We tried to use conversion unit feature but as there is no fixed definition between two inventory units, we couldn't.<br />
<br />
Now, we decided to customize but trying to do it without touching standard functionality.<br />
<br />
We need to implement it at warehouse level ie inbound, outbound, inventory transfer, adjustments.<br />
<br />
For the convenience of the user, we want the field to be available along with with quantity field on all the forms, e.g. <br />
<br />
Received qty (Inventory unit) - 10 kg  -  standard unit <br />
Received qty (second unit) - 1 Roll - custom unit<br />
<br />
Please suggest the ideas\approach through which I can address this issue.<br />
<br />
My approach-<br />
------------<br />
As per my understanding I have made custom tables to store each transaction and summary of the warehouse wise item inventory. <br />
<br />
transaction table : order number, order type, date, line, warehouse, item, qty1, qty2<br />
summary table : warehouse, item, qty1, qty2<br />
<br />
On the quantity field (inventory unit qty) on form, I changed it to zoom field to open a session to enter quantity (second inventory - qty2).<br />
<br />
Here I want to validate:<br />
It should only show the current receipt record not other records.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

The conclusion is that we were wrong, the standard functionality for stock is so complex and it was and still is a pain in the head so your approach is very good don´t put your hands in the standard and keep your second unit in custom tables and show information when necessary. But if you can solved it with standard functionality as mentioned by ssugemura that will be the best solution, perhaps I don´t thing handling unit is what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
I don´t understand what you are trying to validate “It should only show the current receipt record no other record” could you be more specific please.<br />

Good luck</div></div><hr />
