I added the business partner type in form editor(tccom110.cbtp). But it's showing Blank. How to show the type of business partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">17th April 2018, 10:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Create a session extension. Add a table selection for tccom110, select field cbtp and code the where-clause: tccom110.ofbp = tccom100.bpid. Note that this only will work if all your business partners have the sold-to role, otherwise the business partner overview will not show the business partners without sold-to role. If not all business partners have the sold-to role, create instead of the table selection a calculated field of type 'nested select' and code <br />
<br />
select tccom110.cbtp from tccom110 where tccom110.ofbp = tccom100.bpid<br />
<br />
See the Extensions Development Guide for more information.<br />
<br />
There is no need to copy the session to your own VRC and to change the form definition. The field will be automatically added to the overview. With form personalization you can put the field in the desired location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Premahari</div><div class="date">18th April 2018, 07:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I don understand where to write that code. That is standard session where I'm adding tccom110.cbtp in form editor to see the type of business partner in overview session(tccom4500m000). Its showing field with BP Type But no values it was blank. I gave the reference field in form editor for that field as tccom100.bpid,tccom110.ofbp. I think it has multiple reference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">giggty</div><div class="date">18th April 2018, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Premahari, create an extension for business partner overview session in ttext1500m000 (if you have not created any extensions so far, you should initialize it in ttext0200m000 first) and do what JaapJD said. Refer to Infor LN Extensions Development Guide if you are not familiar with Application Extensibility.</div></div><hr />
