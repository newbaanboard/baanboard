<br />
It is possible to reevalute a previous layout within a report script?<br />
For example, I have :<br />
Before.field<br />
Detail<br />
After.field<br />
<br />
I want to reevaluate Before.field layout based on certain conditions met in After.field layout.<br />
<br />
Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot<br />
Bogdan</div></div><hr />

I have used it several times before when I have an array and want to do one detail line for each item in the array.  Try something like this:<br />
before.layout:<br />
      do.your.code()<br />
after.layout:<br />
      if condition.is.ok then<br />
              layout.again()<br />

<br />
I know you can do it like Ed suggested, but I do not think you can call another before.field event. At least I could not figure out how. If you find out how, please the solution here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evesely</div><div class="date">15th February 2002, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry!  I posetd a response to what I wanted to read rather than what you wanted.<br />
<br />
I have never tried it, but if you are feeling adventurous, you could give this a shot.  Let's say field in question is xx.  When you compile the report, Baan creates external functions r.s.before.xx() and r.s.after.xx() (assuming you have before and after layouts for that field) plus external functions like r.s.before.xx.yy.bef.lay() (which is the before.layout code for the before.field.xx.yy layout) for each section of code you write.<br />
<br />
The r.s.before.xx() function will run through all of the before.field layouts for field xx.  So if there was more than one but you only wanted to evaluate one, you could set a flag in the after.field section you discussed and check that flag in the before.layout sections of each of the before.field layouts for that field.  [Does that read as confusing as it sounds typing it :confused: ?)<br />
<br />
For example if field suno had two before layouts (10 and 20) and I only wanted to re-run 10, I could do:<br />
<br />
calling function:<br />
   rerun.flag=1<br />
<br />
before.field.suno.20:<br />
before.layout:<br />
   if rerun.flag = 1 then<br />
      lattr.print = false<br />
   endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, I haven't run this, so I can't say that it will work.  In theory, I think it might ;) .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure your solution will work, but my problem is a litlle bit different:<br />
<br />
I'm testing the condition in After.field and because the Before.field was allready evaluated ....<br />
So I was wondering if it is possible to reevaluate a field allready evaluate and send to &quot;printer&quot;.<br />
<br />
By the way, if I'm not using lattr.print, but a particular variable, I cannot control the printing of a layout. This variable is, of course, present in Output expr. field in Maintain report layouts. The result is something like this:<br />
|**** condition = false (no print)<br />
OK, nothing is sent to printer<br />
|**** condition = true (print)<br />
OK, layout is sent to printer<br />
|**** condition = false (no print)<br />
WRONG, layout IS SENT TO PRINTER<br />
<br />
It looks like the variable has wrong value. Maybe I shoud give a layout.again()? I'll try this.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip with those functions.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Bogdan</div></div><hr />

The current record gets printed, and based on the value of the next record array.frcl(1,q+1)  in the array<br />

<br />
If you have an expression in the &quot;output expression&quot; field of the Maintain Layouts subsession, you can always change it to 1 and bring the actual condition inside your script and set lattr.print based upon that value.  The only real change in doing so is that now your before.layout script will get executed each time.  However, you can easily program around any potential problems that might arise because of that.</div></div><hr />
