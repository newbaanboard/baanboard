<br />
how can you create a form displayed in ascii mode in the gui environment, e.g. to display a baan session in a mobile device to reduce data transfer.<br />
<br />
Only this specific form should be displayed in ascii mode, the other sessions should be displayed in gui style.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
not sure whether I understood your problem to the full, but why use the GUI at all when connecting to Baan from the mobile device?<br />
We have a working solution here, where a mobile device connects to the Baan system via telnet, using vt100 and the ascii interface (ba6.1).<br />
The menues and forms have been created specially to meet the dimension of the mobile devices display (12 rows, 40 columns). The user can scan barcode with his handheld device, macros have been defined on the mobile device to ensure ease of use.<br />
As you are on Baan 4, ba6.1 ist still working, from Baan V upwards only the GUI ist supported. <br />

Reason is:<br />
<br />
Using a Terminal Emulation on mobile device, using a ASCII Form on the normal windows system (GUI), so the users have same handling with the interface both on the mobile as well as the client in the office.<br />

Hi Norbert!<br />
<br />
Can you tell me how to supress the Info-Line which displays 5 fields in the top of the screen in ASCII Mode. It is always 80 characters long an does not fit in the small display of the mobile device.  So the mask becomes warped.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alex</div></div><hr />

<br />
just edit the form.<br />
<br />
Sample enclosed.<br />
<br />
The header line is just the form description.<br />
<br />
Runs on Scanner Clients as telnet session.<br />
<br />
Formsize is: 16 Lines and 22 Rows.<br />
<br />

Thanks for your replies!<br />
<br />
But the form is not my problem. It is the header line above the form, which is displayed also in the scrren shot of bdittmar where he used telnet.<br />
Here the terminal is able to display the full 80 characters, so no problem to fit the header line.<br />
My mobile device uses Putty. The header line will be wraped after 50 columns.<br />
<br />
I hope I could describe my problem clearly enough.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
while using PUTTY, i see your problem.<br />
I don't use PUTTY on the Mobile-Device.<br />
We use the TEKLOGIX telnet application.<br />
<br />
Within this application settup, you're able to specify a display lock.<br />
Putty does'nt have such a feature.<br />
<br />
<br />
6.17.2.8 Anchor View<br />
When enabled (set to Y), this parameter locks the display at a defined location on<br />
the screen, preventing it from shifting when the cursor is moved. The x origin and<br />
y origin coordinates specify where the screen origin, the upper left corner of the<br />
screen, will be fixed.<br />
x origin and y origin<br />
The x origin parameter is used to specify the column to which the upper left<br />
corner of the screen will be anchored. The y origin parameter is used to specify<br />
the row coordinate to which the screen will be anchored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we had exactly the same problem with the &quot;header line&quot; showing the name of the session.<br />
The solution was very simple but hard to find (thanks again to Gerhard :-):<br />
We created a new package, because at this level only you can decide whether the session/menu/form name shall be displayed on top of the screen.<br />
Our package is called xx, all menues, forms and scripts used on the handhelds are in this package and voila .... no more status line:-)<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
meanwhile i found this solution too, but it is defined at the level of modules (check box &quot;status line&quot;), not of package.<br />
As far as I could test this option, just the ascii-mode is affected. Normally we use gui only. So I cleard the check box for tdilc and made some special Sessions for warehouse control used on the mobile devices.<br />
<br />
The solution quoted by bdittmar is interesting too, but is useable for baan on windows server only (I suppose). We use a Unix-Server.<br />
<br />
Another problem I dedected is the usage of ask.enum(), which is located at the last line of the terminal-screen in ascii-mode - out of the visible sector of the small terminal-window on the mobile device.<br />
<br />
Maybe I try to use a &quot;Input only&quot; form field for the answer instead, but available space on the form is very sparely.<br />
Any other suggestions for that problem?<br />
<br />
Buy the way: the usage of function input.string(...) is possible in gui only.<br />
<br />
<br />

Alex</div></div><hr />
