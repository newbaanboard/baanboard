<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">15th January 2010, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Optionally u can ask a question in cont.process with these answers as options and depending on the answer u can call the respective function / choices to do the appopriate task . <br />
<br />
If u want the report like choice only then create dummy reports with appropriate description and and attach it to a new reportgrp (which is set in cont.process for this purpose )  and call choice.print.data . And depending on reportno u can call the respective function / choices to do the appropriate task . Do the reprt_close with right argument so that u dont get any 'no data within selection'</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to do it in LN, then there are functions to create dialog box and in this dialog box you can add listbox specifying your options.<br />
<br />
Refer Programmers Guide for the Following functions:<br />
<br />
dialog.new() : Creates a new dialog. dialog.name will be used for the title bar of the new dialog.<br />
<br />
dialog.add.listbox() : This function creates a dynamic list box (not representing an enum domain) on the dialog. If there is an enum domain, use the function dialog.add.field().<br />
<br />
Refer to example in Programmers Guide, u ll get an idea.<br />
<br />
Thanks And Regards<br />

It was only going to be a matter of time before Client would have asked us to change it.<br />
<br />
MilindV, we are using BaanIV. I would have wanted similar functionality in IV as dialog.add.listbox() . Thanks for the suggestion</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another thing that I can suggest is, create a new small intermediate session like the dialog box just to show the list of your options.<br />
<br />
Not a good solution, but try, till you find any other solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />
