My custom reports are in PROD VRC.  I need to copy them to PRDM VRC.  I have done that but the reports are reading from mcr0 instead.  VRC structure is:<br />
<br />
rtd:${BSE}/application/tdB40U_c4_PRDM:${BSE}/application/tdB40U_c4_mcr0:${BSE}/application/tdB40L_c4_mcr0:${BSE}/application/tdB40U_c4_stnd:${BSE}/application/tdB40_c4:${BSE}/application/tdB40_c3:${BSE}/application/tdB40_c2:${BSE}/application/tdB40_c1<br />
<br />
<br />
The report exists in ${BSE}/application/tdB40U_c4_PRDM</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KimSharp</div><div class="date">14th April 2008, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I did try compiling.  The problem was that there is an MCR version of the report.  I couldn't just copy over the existing standard version of our custom report.  I need to create a new MCR version.  Both invoices and checks that we have customized have MCR versions.  We also have our bill of lading customized and there is no MCR version of that report so copying is possible with it.</div></div><hr />

What VRC are the users logging into?  To me it looks like you are in MCR, but putting the reports in PRDM.</div></div><hr />
