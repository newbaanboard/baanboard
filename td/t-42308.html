<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">28th September 2007, 16:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran across an issue today. I made changes to a report in language 2. I went to copy over report tdsls440201001 langauge 2 with the new report.<br />
<br />
I have to delete the old report first before I can copy over.<br />
<br />
Well, it ended up killing off the language 3 report as well ! (German ....)<br />
<br />
What is the best way to implement a new report without killing off other language specific reports ?  I thought it would only delete the language specific report not all of them !<br />
<br />
Thanks !!</div></div><hr />

This is because of link between language reports. If you break that linking, you can do  deletion on language specific report. That's why  you should look at these relationship between reports before deleting.<br />
<br />
<br />
good Luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">2nd October 2007, 17:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, OK. So, If I see that a German Language 3 report has a link to the language 2 report, I can delete that language 2 link, THEN delete the language 2 report without affecting the German one ...  Good to know ...<br />
<br />
OK, yes, I will have to be more diligent in checking those things  ..<br />
<br />
Thanks ...</div></div><hr />
