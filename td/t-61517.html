I have a requirement to have a check of input of date in a form field so that the user will input a date which is the current date only. Since this is a standard session I would like to know if the field &quot;Input/Ref. Expression&quot; in form editor, has any option by which this can be checked and restricted. Or also let me know if there is any other alternative to acheive this without having the source code for this session. <br />

Expression to 0 and fill the default value with date(). But it could depend on the type of session whether it will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">6th December 2011, 17:46</div></div><div class="posttext">As  explained by Jaap , u can set input / ref to &quot;field.code :=date(),0&quot; and u will have this field always filled with current date .  U may need to c if it helps u in all circumstances .<br />
<br />
Alternatively u can autozoom on the field to a customized session , export / import value of whatever variables u need and end  the customized program in before.program section only  so that nobody ever will notice that a new program was called .</div></div><hr />
