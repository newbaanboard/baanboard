<br />
<br />
i have a question regarding the LN Customer Defined Field,<br />
<br />
we tried to use the CDF to fulfill the cust requirement, and we managed to create one field in tisfc001.<br />
<br />
but....i can't seem to write the script to display the field, i already write some easy sql script, but the session returned message that it can't find the field.<br />
<br />
do you guys/girls know where LN put the field?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
Customer Defined Fields <br />
<br />
Customer Defined Fields (CDF) allow customers to add application fields to the ERP LN applications. It is a matter of configuring additional fields and not doing any application development. This means that no business logic is changed, and no development license is needed to add customer definable fields to the ERPLN Application. <br />
<br />
The following restrictions have been defined: <br />
<br />
- Tools tables (package tt and tl) can not contain CDFs. <br />
- WebTop conditional formatting is not supported for CDFs. <br />
- Easy SQL is not supported for CDFs. <br />
- EDI is not supported for CDFs. <br />
<br />
Except for reporting through the Reporting Studio and the Reporting <br />
Viewer, reporting is not supported for CDFs. <br />
<br />
External integrations, such as Infor Integration, EDI, Exchange, Office <br />
integration, and SOA-based integration, do not support CDFs. <br />
<br />
CDFs are not supported in program scripts. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
i see, do you know how to display it in the report viewer?<br />
<br />
<br />
actually the field is available in the database, but i think it's strange for LN to not able to display it.<br />

<br />
the new ERP LN report viewer only works with Webtop. Worktop users cannot use report viewer enabled reports.<br />
<br />
Please refer to the latest Infor Developers Guide (U8883F - Infor ERP LN Development Tools 8.5) and Infor Webtop 8.5 - Installation and Configuration Guide (U8715 - Infor Webtop 8.5 for ERP LN) for a more and detailed information.<br />
<br />
BTW: Also the CDFs are visible in Webtop.<br />
<br />

<br />
To print a cdf is not a problem, just write a query on the table with the cdf, and fill a var with the cdf and put the var on the layout. <br />
select tisf001.* from tisfc001 where ....<br />
selectdo <br />
  var = tisfc001.cdf_...<br />
endselect <br />
<br />
it's not possible to put the field directly on a layout. <br />
<br />
Regards, Mario</div></div><hr />
