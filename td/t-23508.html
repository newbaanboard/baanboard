The easy answer to your question is that yes it is possible.  However, it opens up a whole can of security worms.  If a user logs into Baan using Rexec, then the username and password is passed unencrypted across the network utilizing tcp/ip and port 512.  Most sysadmins wouldn't appreciate the tools that you would have to put into place to grab the passwords in this manner.<br />
<br />
One method to handle this might be to have the user's enter their password in a form in Baan.  This password wouldn't be stored but would be passed to the external application.  If it becomes too onerous for the users to enter their password everytime, perhaps a table in Baan that would store the user password in an encrypted manner.  Provide a maintian session that would only allow users to modify their own password.  With this type of integration, I would highly suggest bring in any sysadmin and/or information security analyst to make sure that it conforms with any information security plan that may be in place.<br />
