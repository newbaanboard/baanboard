<br />
Does this mean program reserves  5MB for each based variable. So if I have 50 based variables will it reserves 250 MB for these variable. Or memory allocation and resrvation is done as per the usage of such memory . <br />
<br />
e.g. I have single dimension based long variable for which maximum dimension  can be say 100. This means it will occupy (should occupy) at the most 400 bytes of memory .<br />
<br />
I want to get this answer because the number of based variables used by the program are high in number , though each such variable will not require high number of dimension for each variable. <br />
<br />
Has anybody used high number of based variables (let's say more than 50) in a baan script.</div></div><hr />

The only restriction is the available memory space. If there isn't enough memory; the function alloc.mem will return -1.</div></div><hr />
