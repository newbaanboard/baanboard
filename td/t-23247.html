I think I've seen this done in standard Baan sessions, but I'm not sure how they're doing this.  Would I use the db.lock and if so where?  -thanks</div></div><hr />

The reason I ask is that for my maintenance sessions I typically do not do any locking.  This is handled by the session.  Are you have a problem with one of your sessions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">22nd February 2005, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a session that we have created and the users are afraid that two people could be logged on at the same time trying to modify the same record.  Baan will give you a message when you try to save, saying that another user has already modified the record, but then you lose all the changes you have made and whoever saves first has their data written to the table.  They don't want to make several changes only to find out they will have to re-enter them when they try to save.  They want to lock anybody else out of that record to prevent wasted effort.  I was thinking that one of the Baan Sales Order sessions does this, but I may be wrong. -thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd February 2005, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - I see. I do something like this with some of my sessions.  I use application locks, usually I do this with a process button.  I have never tried it with db.lock() - I am not sure if that would interfer with the session and how it works.<br />
<br />
I guess depending on the session you could set an application lock in the before.rewrite section.  Then release after the update and commit.  Not sure if this is workable with your session - it seems the places I use it I have something like order or project to do the application lock.  Just a thought.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Francesco</div><div class="date">22nd February 2005, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">db.lock locks an entire table, not a single record.<br />
A single recod can only be locked through delayed locking (i.e. select for update), but if you are concerned about dirty reads, then you might as well throw an application lock in there.<br />
<br />
I would revisit my requirements though. Being worried about reading old data is soooooo eighties. Either your data changes so fast that current data can only be obtained through frequent refreshes, or it changes so slow that there is no point in locking data from being updated on the odd chance that somebody is reading it.</div></div><hr />
