<br />
We are working in BaanIV C4 , Oracle 9i, W2k server.<br />
We are getting the Index out of Dims error for all sessions which we are generating and reports compilations, form dumps.. everywhere this error is coming from the past one week . By which we are unable to work on Tools. <br />
This problem started after installing BCK (Schedular). <br />
We tried out all the solutions specified above from the past one week  given by Baan BGS. But till now, we could n't able to work on that. <br />
<br />
Could any one pl. help us out in solving this?<br />
<br />

Once all these triggers were compiled fine, we did not see any errors in baan anymore.  I must say we only saw errors in non-tools sessions.<br />
Maybe it is worth checking any triggers that might have been added.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not only compilation error. That error is coming for the new sessions which we are generating and for each and every report we are working on or compliling. We'd done the solutions given by BGS like NLS Settings change etc. But no use. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
