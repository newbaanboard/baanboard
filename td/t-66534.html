<br />
<br />
r.aggr.control() is an internal function which takes care of computation of all the aggregate (sum, count, average ...) variables used on report. This function calculates values for 'total..x' variables.<br />
<br />
You might have over used number of aggregate variables than what is allowed. I'm not sure what is the limit but you might want to remove few and give another try.<br />
<br />
I'll try to look for more details on this but hope above details may give you a start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanhp</div><div class="date">16th June 2014, 13:40</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks a lot for your valuable reply. I am anticipating this. and this was the actual reason. that means its a limitation in BAAN iv c4 or  same constraint is there in ERP LN also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_guru</div><div class="date">16th June 2014, 14:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm glad this helped you, can you tell us what is the max count of aggregate functions with which you could successfully compiled this report?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baanhp</div><div class="date">16th June 2014, 14:59</div></div><div class="posttext">total count I found in my report is 387.<br />
<br />
the standard total aggregate function is called 387 times in report layout.<br />
But I could not say what is the maximum limit for this. as I deleted the old layout which causes the over usage of this standard aggregate function.<br />
<br />
Thanx a lot for your kind help and valuable time.</div></div><hr />
