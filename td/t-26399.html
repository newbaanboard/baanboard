You can always write a program to parse the data dictionary.  You can always try printing the table definition ttadv4420m000 (if available) and working with the table in questions.  I am sure there are probably some 3rd party products to map the tables out, but I am not aware of them.<br />
<br />
To learn the tables I recommend first just printing the table layouts.  Once you have that you can start looking at what links to what.  You can always write a quick query against ttadv422(table fields - what it is called in Baan IV) to get the relationships between the tables. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that not everything is restricted by database rules.  Somethings are enforced in the coding of the programs.</div></div><hr />
