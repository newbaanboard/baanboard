I know that from VB/VC++ we can call Baan DLL methods. Is it possible to call  Win32 or COM DLL methods from a BaanERP script? For example, I have developed some DLLs in VB and VC++, and want to call their functions/methods from BaanERP scripts.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any ideas and hints.<br />

From BW (the baan windows client) to the baan backend (bshell).  I don't think the bshell can directly start a COM object.  Not sure about Openworld, since I've never used it.<br />
<br />
You may be able to work around this by getting the bshell to run a file on the client PC.  Get the bshell to write a vb script, send it to the client PC, then run it on the client PC - that talks to your DLL in written in VB/whatever, the DLL writes out a file to the local machine with the results of its actions.  The bshell then retrieves the file off the local PC and checks its output.  --- Long winded, but doable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. Yes it may be done this way as a workaround. <br />
<br />
But I am wondering is there a direct possibility as I mentioned in the original post?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
