<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Virender</div><div class="date">18th December 2009, 07:32</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using customised invoice printing session.<br />
The sessions asks for inv number, line etc and prints accordingly, we used to print the same on dot matrix printer on pre printed stationary containing 1 original and 3 carbon copies as Transports copy, asses copy, office copy.<br />
<br />
Now sales dept. asking the same to be printed on laser printer.<br />
I have designed the same but I have a problem how to print original on first, Transports on 2nd, asses copy on 3rd and office on 4th copy on a single command of invoice print.<br />
<br />
I tried enumerated field and given a drop down field before print command but that takes long time to print a single invoice, user has to run same print session 4 times to take print of all copies which is not acceptable.<br />
Please suggest what could be the other option.<br />

Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
in BaaN IV standard report for invoices, this is working.<br />
<br />
First Page: Original<br />
2nd Page : Copy 1<br />
3rd Page : Copy 2 aso.<br />
<br />
Have a look at this and implement the logic of reporting in your customization.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosterjr</div><div class="date">19th December 2009, 02:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on the type of printer you are sending the invoice to, you could use the HP PCL and PJL  escape codes to trigger multiple copies and even to pull from different input trays and send to different output trays.  I had to setup sales orders once to simulate multipart forms through an HP laser printer with different color stock in 4 different trays in this manner.<br />
<br />
You do have to watch out though.  Some of the escape sequences are for job level only.  If you print a range of invoices then the escape sequences are applied to the entire job and not on an invoice by invoice basis.<br />
<br />
The link to HP's PCL manual is http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/bpl13205/bpl13205.pdf<br />
<br />
There are other references on how to include escape sequences in Baan reports both here on BB and in Baan Quick Guides.<br />
