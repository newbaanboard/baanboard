<br />
this is my first post in this forum (which is really useful) and I hope somebody can help me little with my problem:<br />
<br />
1st some information about the used sys:<br />
<br />
Infor LN ERP 6.1 with FP3 installed<br />
Tools-Version 7.6 a3<br />
Porting set 8.4a<br />
<br />
2nd the problem:<br />
<br />
After installing FP3 and updating the necessary customizations a fatal error appears when starting the session whinh2100m100 (see attached screenshot). There are not so many differences (customizations) to the standard and we have checked these differences many times and very carefully (the main-session has only an additional field in the form, also two satellite sessions are changed but checked). Did this error already occured to someone? Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thx in advance<br />

SITUATION IDENTIFIED IN:<br />
&quot;4GL Engine&quot; (ttstpstandard)<br />
<br />
SITUATION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The following fatal error can occur in some sessions:<br />
<br />
Fatal error: Dynamic Link failure function 'dal.restore.record'<br />
<br />
This can occur in sessions that use a Data Access Layer (DAL) that:<br />
1. has been compiled using FP4 Tools and<br />
2. that uses the with.old.object.values.do() or with.object.set.do() macros and<br />
3. runs on FP3 (or less) Tools.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION:<br />
The bic_dal include file has been changed in such a way that when a FP3 (or less) DAL is compiled, it will not use the function 'dal.store.record'.</div></div><hr />
