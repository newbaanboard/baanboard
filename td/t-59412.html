<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
be more specific, please.<br />
<br />
Type of barcode ?<br />
Does the scanner support the type of barcode (2D barcode, 1D scanner)?<br />
<br />
As it sounds, you built the Barcode with &quot;winprint&quot;<br />
<br />
Whats the sequence, you built the BC ?<br />
<br />
Provide all details, please.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
What we have done is We have generated the Barcode Through BaaN coding which goes as :<br />
barcode.test = chr$(27) &amp; chr$(22) &amp;  &quot;E#%&quot; &amp; sprintf(&quot;%28s&quot;,item)<br />
where barcode.test is input field in the report section ..<br />
The print is coming ok but its not scannable..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
as i see your coding right, you're building:<br />
<br />
Code93 , Hight = 3 , 5 Characters<br />
<br />
If your variable don't fit in 5 characters, a barcode is printed, but unreadable.<br />
Please try with a 5 character input, or assign another number of characters to fit with the stringlength.<br />
<br />
------------- From Quickguide --------<br />
The 3rd character of the “E#%” must coincide with the input string length, or the barcode won’t print (Not readable).<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

Please guide as I am not getting any solution to solve my problem ...<br />
Below is the barocde code which I have given ..The item is of length 9<br />
barcode.item = chr$(27) &amp; chr$(22) &amp; &quot;E#*&quot; &amp;(sprintf(&quot;%9s&quot;,item))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
E#*<br />
Code 93<br />
High = 3<br />
Number of characters = 10<br />
<br />
For 9 characters in the string item :<br />
<br />
E#) must be used !<br />
<br />
As you see from my post above, the correct number of characters in the string must be used.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richylh</div><div class="date">3rd November 2010, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, make sure your printer supports the barcode fonts. I used to try in the printer type 'direct' and failed all the time because the printer did not support it.<br />
<br />
Try to use bwprint in 'Windows Printer', which normally sounds OK if you use the latest version of bwprint.</div></div><hr />
