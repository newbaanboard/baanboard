<br />
I have to imitate session ttpmc2460m000 - Print solution history because of the custom requirement from user.<br />
<br />
In session ttpmc2460m000, when we zoom from first field to session ttpmc2450s000, select update version (ttpmc240.uver) and click Ok, the rest of the fields on session ttpmc2460m000 (Update release - urel.f, urel.t and Update customer ucus.f,ucus.t) are automatically filled up.<br />
<br />
One thing I know is that values of marked record are stored in some global variable, but dont know which those variables are.<br />
<br />
Can anybody guide how this can be replicated in my session which is exact copy of the session with one additional field?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

This is for IT audit and auditor wants to ensure that the user who installed the solution and the developer are not same.<br />

One thing I know is that values of marked record are stored in some global variable, but dont know which those variables are.<br />
This is a Print Session with zoom fields, so there is no case of marked records.<br />
<br />
Your best option is to write AFS against the session ttpmc2460m000 and put the developer's logon in the User field, unless you want to write custom code to query the tools table and do a match/all display based on your options/report output.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just select in table ttpmc160 with the Solutions and their installed User and its corresponding VRC, (Only select the Solutions with status = Installed) and against that solution go to table ttpmc120(Components by Solution)<br />
<br />
And for each component, just go to corresponding component main table in Tools, For example, FOr sessions go to ttadv200 and so on and get which user has created that component.<br />
<br />
By this way you will get which user has installed which solution and which user has created specific component against that solution..</div></div><hr />
