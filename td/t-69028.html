First of all, excuse me for my poor English,<br />
I have a customized session that reads a table and calls (with zoom.to) another two sessions. When I have processed 257 docs, I receive the message &quot;Error:  index 257 out of dims [1] 256&quot;. I looked up at the log files and did not find anything.<br />
Can anyone help me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th June 2016, 01:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you using some kind of array to pass variables around the session. Looks to me like you are using an array somewhere along the way and it is getting this error.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Known limits<br />
Reports<br />
<br />
sorting doubles correct to 6 decimal places<br />
maximum 255 fields on a report (including array elements)<br />
Bshell<br />
<br />
maximum string buffer size is 4K â€“ be careful when concatenating strings with '&amp;' sign<br />
maximum function stack depth is 500<br />
Bic<br />
<br />
maximum 255 arguments per function<br />
maximum 32K variables per compilation<br />
maximum BRANCH of 32K (BRANCH refers to the amount of generated code per function, including macros etc.)<br />
SQL<br />
<br />
The nesting level of subqueries is limited to 10. The nesting level is defined as follows. The nesting level of the main query is 1. The nesting level of a sub query immediately contained in the main query is 2. The nesting level of a sub query immediately contained in another sub query is the nesting level of that sub query plus 1.<br />
The number of index hints that can be given on a table is limited to 4.<br />
The SQL processor has no limit on the length of string values. However, the databases may impose restrictions on the length of string values. It is advised to keep the length of string values (including string literals and string values resulting from concatenation) below 4K.<br />
Tables<br />
<br />
maximum record length is 3072 bytes (for multi-byte columns take a factor 2 into account. For example, a multi-byte string of 256 characters will be 512 bytes long in a multi-byte environment.)<br />
maximum number of fields is 1024<br />
maximum field length is 3072 bytes<br />
maximum number of indices per table is 20<br />
Indexes<br />
<br />
maximum index length is 500 bytes<br />
maximum number of fields is 24 (no combined fields)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a thought: Too much report input fields ?<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

I do not have any report in the sessions.<br />
About the array, the sessions have a lot of #includes. I will debug them and try to find something about it.<br />
I will be back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gfaquini</div><div class="date">30th June 2016, 21:40</div></div><div class="posttext">I am back... I will try to explain: I have session A with a loop that calls session B at any valid value in the loop. From session A to B are passed five fields. Until the 256th time, it works fine. Just one more and it stops with the message. If I call the session A again, even without aborting the stopped one, it runs with no errors (until the new 257th time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd July 2016, 02:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Are the processes getting cleaned up?  It could very well be something internal to baan that is causing the issue.  Not sure how you can catch that. <br />
<br />
Also is there anyway you can take that second session and make it a subroutine rather than a session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">2nd July 2016, 16:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, if possible, post your code. Might be something related to the domain you are using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gfaquini</div><div class="date">4th July 2016, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your help. The codes are very large. I will try do make the second one as a subroutine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gfaquini</div><div class="date">21st July 2016, 23:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi folks. Thanks for all. The problem is resolved. I created a new function, added the second session in it and the first session just caal the new function. It is allright.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd July 2016, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">That's for the update - is it possible for you to posted the new functions code?  Out of curiosity I would like to see what it looks like. Did you put it in a library or is it still in the main session?</div></div><hr />
