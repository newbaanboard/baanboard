<br />
Given this code --<br />
 <br />
    string    fileout<br />
    string    headerrec<br />
    long      fp<br />
    long      retval<br />
<br />
<br />
    fileout = &quot;/baan/jetform/data/5r2x3.dat&quot;<br />
    headerrec = &quot;^job 5r2x3 -zZebra&quot;<br />
<br />
    fp = seq.open(fileout, &quot;w&quot;)<br />
    retval = seq.puts(headerrec, fp)<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand the -zZebra part of this code. I know it prints to a Zebra printer, but the printer *does not* appear in the Maintan Devices session.<br />
<br />
Where should I look for the Zebra specification? Is it in Baan? <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 01:21</div></div><div class="posttext">How is your Zebra printer attached? To the client or to a server?  In my case our Zebra printers are attached to a unix server.  Each of our tag reports (only 3- that I recall) only as the &quot;^job jobname&quot; at the start.  Each of our Zebra printers are Baan devices.  It seems to me we use a copy command in the device to copy the Baan tmp file to the jetforms data directory.  I can get screen prints tomorrow when I return to work.<br />
<br />
Hmmm - now that I re-read your request I am not sure what your question is really about.  Do you just want to know what the -zZebra does or are you having problems getting them to work?<br />

ps - Just in case congrats to the Vols on their victory. Sigh U of L lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tcrabtree</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 18:07</div></div><div class="posttext">My question was a little vague, mainly because I was not sure what question needed to be asked.<br />
<br />
I do know what the -zZebra is trying to do, which is send the report to a printer called &quot;Zebra&quot;. The problem is that there is no printer in Baan called &quot;Zebra&quot;<br />
<br />
Turns out we are using Jetform to automate report printing. Everyone who was involved with setting this up has left our business, and there was not a shred of documentation!<br />
<br />
I am not sure how Jetform is doing what it does, but at least I better know what is going on.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 20:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you all using Jetforms to print ALL reports? Just curious - we are only using it to do tags.  What platform is it running on?<br />
<br />
Any questions just post them and I'll I see if I can answer them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tcrabtree</div><div class="date">8th March 2002, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently, we are using Jetform to print to some Zebra printers on our receiving dock. That's about to change, once I figure out how to set up more printers and new reports. The big problem is that we had an army of consultants set up much of our initial Baan installation, and their documentation was poor.<br />
<br />
Now, we are a few years removed from the installation, and we want to expand on and change some things they set up. It's a difficult endeavor without any documentation.<br />
<br />
I have a pretty strong Zebra background, so using BAR-ONE to create the label formats is not difficult for me. Where I am running into trouble is with the Jetform set up. For example, I am not really certain which .ini files need to be edited, if any. And the jfserver.jmd file is a little difficult for me to follow.<br />
<br />
As well, the whole process of creating the .mdf file in BAR-ONE and converting it to .tdf and .jbd files is a little unclear. Again, without good documentation on how it was originally done, I feel like I am throwing darts blindfolded.<br />
<br />
I am trying to set up additional Zebra printers, and while doing so on the UNIX side is no problem, knowing how to interface the printer name with the jfserver stuff is intimidating. It's a mission-critical process, and I don't like to monkey around with those until I am certain I know what is going on. You know?<br />
<br />
Do you have experience with Jetform? If so, I would welcome any tips you can offer, as well as any sites or white papers that may help me figure out this whole mess.<br />
<br />
We are running BaanIVc2 on HP-UX 11.00 with an Oracle database. We plan to upgrade to BaanIVc4 in the next few months. Additionally, there are some instances where we'd like to use Jetform outside of the Baan environment. The Zebra printers we use are not actual Baan Devices -- you can't print to them from Baan, except through the sessions which create the Jetform reports.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I believe I have some PDF files that came with my Zebra printers. I think I have one for Jetforms, the Barone software and such.  I can email these to you.  They are too big to attach here.<br />
