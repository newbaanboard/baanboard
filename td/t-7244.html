<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">18th October 2002, 17:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We have used Ghostscript to create reports in a PDF format.  When we are finished processing the report in baan the modified ttstpconv file initiates ghostscript to convert the report to PDF.  The baanscript then copies these reports over into some directories used in our intranet.<br />
<br />
Our problem is that Ghostscript is still converting the document when the copy commands and issued (since they are separate processes).  The result is a corrupted copied file that cannot be opened from our intranet.  We have to manually recopy the file once Ghostscript has finished.  <br />
<br />
We have been putting a suspend() command in but as we move forward each month with more and more data to process we are constantly amending the code to increase the time.  Does anyone have a suggestion as to how we can check to make sure that Ghostscript is finished before continuing our baan script?  Or is there a way to calculate the report's processing time so that we can create a calulated suspend() value that will be proportionate to the report size?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

Put them the same process and wait for each one to complete. If you have run.prog use RP_WAIT and if it is shell I forget the option :).<br />
<br />
Since you are one of the few people who seems to use this solution, could you please troubleshoot Teresa's question in Code &amp; Utilities forum.</div></div><hr />
