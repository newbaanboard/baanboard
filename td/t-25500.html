<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">28th October 2005, 16:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I was required to modify to tccom013 table to allow users to assign one of our salesman to each of the customer delivery addresses.  <br />
<br />
I shut Baan down to the general population, dumped the table and then modified the table definition as follows:<br />
<br />
I added the .crep field to tccom013 with the following details:<br />
<br />
Mandatory Input: Yes<br />
Reference Table: tccom001.emno<br />
Reference Mode: Mandatory unless empty<br />
Check by DBMS: Yes<br />
Delete Mode: Lookup (Restricted)<br />
Update Mode: No Check<br />
<br />
I then reconfigured the table and then ran a sql script to populate the delivery addresses sales rep with the customer master's sales rep.<br />
<br />
I also modified the forms for tccom1102m000 and tccom1102s000 to include the tccom013.crep field and the tccom001.nama (display).  <br />
<br />
If the user goes to tccom1102m000 directly from the Menu Browser everything works fine.  However when the user accesses tccom1102s000 from the Special menu on the Customer Master, they get the following errors:<br />
<br />
Unknown reference from 'tccom013.crep' to 'tccom001'<br />
<br />
I checked thinking that the perhaps this particular customer had no sales rep assigned and that was the problem, but there is a sales rep attached.  I then modified the Customer Master so that you would zoom to the Main session tccom1102m000 just to see if perhaps I set something up differently on the main session than the subsession, but I still received the same error.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I need to check?  Thank you for any assistance.</div></div><hr />

The dictionary file of this table contains a list of table (field) s that refer to tccom001</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't know about the dictionary file... what is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th October 2005, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a directory out there that contains your data dictionary.  Inside is a file for each table.  Inside is file for each table - table fields, references, etc.  On our system it is something like /apps/baan/dict.  Then you can go into the VRC you are working on and cd dtccom.  You can then do a more on dtccom001.  Something like that.</div></div><hr />
