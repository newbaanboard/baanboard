<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracked egg</div><div class="date">14th February 2003, 23:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello. I am having difficulty compiling the field tdpur045.pmsk in a customised script. I have created a new session and report and when I try to add a further filter to the select I am receiving the msg &quot;Table 'tdpur045' not declared for column tdpur045.pmsk&quot;.<br />
I can't understand this as the table is declared and I can select other values from that table successfully (i.e. tdpur045.orno, pono, spur).<br />
Is there something unique about the field tdpur045.pmsk?<br />
here is part of the code:<br />
<br />
|select tdpur045.spur, tdpur045.pmsk<br />
select tdpur045.*<br />
from tdpur045<br />
where tdpur045._index1 = {:tdpur041.orno, :tdpur041.pono}<br />
and tdpur045.spur = 9<br />
| and tdpur045.pmsk(:stno.4423;9)&lt;&gt;&quot;e&quot;<br />
| and tdpur045.pmsk(:stno.4223;1)&lt;&gt;&quot;e&quot;<br />
selectdo<br />
|     if tdpur045.pmsk(:stno.4423;9) = &quot;e&quot; then<br />
|     if tdpur045.pmsk = &quot;e&quot; then<br />
|     if tdpur045.pmsk(:tdsls045.spur;9) = &quot;e&quot; then<br />
      osta.del_lines = true<br />
|       tdpur045.pmsk = &quot;e&quot;<br />
|      endif<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
any mention of tdpur045.pmsk and it won't compile. Is it not just a string like any other string?  Stuff like : |   tdpur045.pmsk = &quot;e&quot; isn't accurate but I still thought it would compile.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sometimes get similar messages when I have forgotten to explicitly declare a table. <br />
<br />
 have you got:-<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
    ......<br />
    ......	<br />
    table	 ttdpur045           | Receipts<br />
<br />
If you do get the table right I think some of the tests you were trying are not correct.  eg:<br />
                          tdsls045.pmsk(:stno.4423;9)&lt;&gt;&quot;e&quot;  <br />
   should be       .......................(:stno.4423;1)&lt;&gt;&quot;e&quot;<br />
   and                 tdsls045.pmsk(:tdsls045.spur;9)=&quot;e&quot; <br />
   should not have the colon before the table name (:tdsls045) and should be testing a length of 1 not 9.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />
<br />
Terry</div></div><hr />

I still get the same 'not declared' message for table tdpur045.<br />
<br />
<br />
select tdpur045.*<br />
from	tdpur045<br />
where	tdpur045._index1 = {:tdpur041.orno, :tdpur041.pono}<br />

	endif<br />

<br />
I can't see why this shouldn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tools123</div><div class="date">18th February 2003, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you restate your problem with the field after<br />
trying these:<br />
<br />
1.Is it the Program script or the report script you are<br />
having problem with?<br />
<br />
2.Have you tried to see if just the field being in the query (minus the string manipulations) works?<br />
 If this worked, relook at your string manipulation code.<br />
 This also checks if you included the tdpur045.pmsk in the<br />
 report input fileds if the problem is in report script.<br />
3.Is the error message complete or does it say, tdpur045 not decalred for tdpur045.pmsk?<br />
I would try and get a simple output first and go about stripping it off.<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">18th February 2003, 02:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible the data dictionary is corrupt?  Do you see the field when using table maintenance?<br />
You might want to try to rebuild the data dictionary for the table in the VRC it is defined in.  Also I did not see where you answered the question by Terry on the following:<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
       table ttdpur045 | Receipts<br />
<br />
<br />
I know you will get an error like you described when you try to use a table field in the if statement if you do not have it declared.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

tools123 - It is a program script. I have tried different ways to incorporate the field into the query just to see if it is ok?<br />
mark_h - I can see and manipulate this field in GTM.  The table has been declared  - otherwise I would not be able to query other fields in it (when all refs to pmsk are commented out).  I agree that the error usually comes from not declaring the table.<br />
<br />
I have changed this script again and I might be getting past the error but I am now getting these 2 errors<br />
&quot;Error: 'stno.4223' not declared<br />
&quot;Error: 'SQL host variable ':stno.4223'  not declared.<br />
<br />
select tdpur045.*<br />
from	tdpur045<br />
where	tdpur045._index1 = {:tdpur041.orno, :tdpur041.pono}<br />

Again, thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the other problem have you included the right include file for the variable - maybe tdpur0004.  Not sure what include file it is in because we do not own source.<br />
