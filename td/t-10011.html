<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">14th May 2003, 15:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You would probably have to do it in the before.layout section of your detail.line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a standard way of printing multiple details if the script only sends 1 record:<br />
<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	rec.counts = count.records.to.be.printed()<br />
	curr.rec = 1<br />
detail.2:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	if curr.rec &lt;= rec.counts then<br />
		select	table<br />
		from	table<br />
		where...<br />
		order by table_index1 asc<br />
		as set with :curr.rec rows<br />
		selectdo<br />
		endselect<br />
|now values are present<br />
	else<br />
		lattr.print = false<br />
	endif<br />
after.layout:<br />
	if curr.rec &lt; rec.counts<br />
		curr.rec = curr.rec + 1<br />
		layout.again()<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Would be easier if you post your code.<br />
