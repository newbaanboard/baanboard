<br />
I want to change the text editor from notepad to wordpad. I have copied wordpad.exe to my window directory and also mentioned the path in developers data(ttadv0110m000) but when I click to edit the script, it does not open, while I use notepad my script gets open in notepad. I am working on window-98 and the server is unix (Sun Solaries)<br />
<br />
If anyone provide me solution I would be very thankful.<br />

1. If you got any error message, please post it or the screenshot.<br />
<br />
2. After the developer's data template was changed for a user, did you make a convert runtime changes from the user data sessions or ttadv0110m000 ? logged out and logged back in for the changes to be effective.</div></div><hr />

I have created a program by which I want to insert object/image through text editor but when I click on text i-con, the default text editor gets open. I want to change that editor to wordpad so that I can insert the object/image.<br />
<br />
How could I achieve the goal.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
Further I understand only notepad is allowed for text entry. Word pad can not be used .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">17th September 2002, 13:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed images in Baan texts are not allowed. The datamodel does not provide a way to save images into the database. Even if the database management system itself allows you to do so.<br />
<br />
So with this knowledge, I assume your need for Wordpad is over now. Wordpad (when used) must safe the files plain text (that is what notepad does by default, so from Baan's perspective defaulting to Notepad is safest).<br />
<br />
There is a way to use wordpad instead: but then you must rename notepad.exe into notepal.exe (or any other name) and copy wordpad.exe into notepad.exe... You can imagine this will be a possible problem with all kind of other programs... I have used my favorite editor for some weeks in a way like this. But I reverted back to notepad. Images are still not done then.</div></div><hr />

Yes its possible to have BaaN kind-of photo editor.<br />
<br />
You have to build you own photo browser like the display browser, have a table with the names and paths of the pictures, add more functionality to add, delete, modify the pictures.<br />

Search for more info at the board here -<br />
