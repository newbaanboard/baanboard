    Everytime I get some 205 (out of range) errors, it is very hard to figure out where the problem unless you see the error message written to event viewer (on Windows and I dont know where these messages are written on Unix) on server.  Especially when you are dealing with Function Servers and if some data is not according to domain, all you get the message is error 205.  So I am wondering if there is a way to capture these error messages from event viewer, they can be communicated to user.  Any help in this regard is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

Then you may be able to trap additional errors.  Still I do not see a way to trap all errors.  I had the same type problem you mentioned last week with reference errors on one of our tables.  None of the logs files told me which table still had a reference. The indexes were corrupt and re-config on the table solved it.  Not sure how you could trap something like that a give the user a more useful error.  And yes I know I could trap the error, but I do not think it is worth all the extra coding.  Maybe someone else knows a solution for your problem, but I do not see a simple answer.<br />

I checked all files in the log directory for errors - no such luck.  Usually an error would appear in the oracle log about this, but since it was a corrupt index nothing showed up in any log file other than the bshell log file.  Traces, debugs and such just did not work.<br />

<br />
    I can understand your problem as we have faced and overcome this problem because our servers are kept on different plants and entire setup is scattered. It is very difficult to check event viewers for all the servers of some specific type of errors, if seating arrangements are at different plants.<br />
    I have automated this, Now I am able to see event viewers/errors into my inbox daily couple of times for all the servers are of some specific type (See attached file), I found it very useful.<br />
    Here are the steps :<br />
    1. Download psloglist.exe from   http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/f...e/pstools.shtml    <br />
    2. Download sendEmail.exe from net (search into google otherwise give me your email ID)<br />
    3. Create a batch file, contents are :<br />
     @echo off<br />
       cls<br />
      psloglist \\baanerp -d 1 application -f isfw &gt; alert.txt<br />
    sendemail -f alert@mycompany.co.in -t suhas@mycompany.co.in -u Good-morning -m Please-take-some-action -s <br />
           192.168.1.100:25 -a alert.txt -q -l sendlog.txt<br />
<br />
    4. Configure outlook express for ID &quot;alert&quot; connecting POP3 server.<br />
    5. Create two windows schedulars for running batch file.<br />
<br />
    Already /? is provided with both exe's for more info. You can change it as per your requirements also you can make Job into BaaN, for running it or you can make a session which will run batch file and explicitely sends you current event viewer contents. Hope this helps. <br />

    Thanks for the info.  This is very useful for Admin to look at what is happening in the server event viewers.  But I was looking for trapping baan error messages as it occurs and displaying them as a message to the user.  It is more synchronous than batch process.  If you have window 2000, you can directly connect to the server event viewers from your desktop event viewer as shown in the attached pic.<br />
<br />
    Once you open the event viewer, you can connect to the other servers by right clicking on &quot;Event Viewer (Local) as long as they are in the network.</div></div><hr />
