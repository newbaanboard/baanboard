<br />
<br />
i'm having a problem with the development on LNFP5 with BIRT reporting tools.<br />
<br />
i've created a report with the BIRT and at last managed to export it into PDF too, but there's something that bothering me in the report, and that is the INFOR logo and the Header of the report that's keep diplaying each time i print the report.<br />
<br />
i'm not saying INFOR logo is ugly or so, but the logo keeps displaying whenever i tried to print the RPT report, and it consumes a space in the header.<br />
<br />
do you guys/girls know how to disable the logo and the header?<br />
<br />
i'll post my RPTdesign and the PDF result.(i'll make the rptdesign file ex .txt you can change it back after downloading it)<br />
<br />
<br />
Salute,<br />
<br />

i just had a look on the design file, and it seems that the Infor Logo is located in Master Page Setup.<br />
In the Report Designer you can switch to the Master Page tab to edit.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />
Andreas</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to enlarge the Header in the master page first, just add the height of the header, and it should be visible.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
