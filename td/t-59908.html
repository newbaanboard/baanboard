<br />
I currently do not program in 4GL but I think it shouldn't be that hard to write a function that looks up part numbers from a table filtered by arguments in the function call.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any simple examples so I can get started?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Search this forums for sample scripts and sql - you should find a lot of threads around coding.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">25th January 2011, 11:41</div></div><div class="posttext">example 1: Calling a Baan dll  tc.mcs.dll9988c (maintained in ttadv2131m000)<br />
<br />
!#pragma used dll otcmcsdll9988c<br />
!table ttipcf500<br />
!table ttccom010<br />
!import(&quot;tipcf500.cuno&quot;, tipcf500.cuno)<br />
!if (tcmcs.dll9988c.read.customer.master(tipcf500.cuno) ) then<br />
!  [custname] = tccom010.cuno(3;4)<br />
!endif<br />
<br />
this reads the customer account number and then places part of it in a feature<br />
You don't have to use a dll as you could write the sql in the constraint (the dll function is shown below).<br />
<br />
function extern domain tcbool<br />
	tcmcs.dll9988c.read.customer.master(<br />
	domain  tccuno pcuno<br />
	)<br />
{<br />
	select tccom010.cuno,<br />
		tccom010.nama,<br />
		tccom010.ccty,<br />
		tccom010.ccur,<br />
		tccom010.cbrn,	<br />
		tccom010.crat	<br />
	from tccom010<br />
	where tccom010._index1 = {:pcuno}<br />
	as set with 1 rows<br />
	selectdo<br />
		return ( true )<br />
	endselect<br />
	return ( false )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scough</div><div class="date">31st January 2011, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">The syntax for what I am trying to do does not appear to be as easy to find as I had hoped.<br />
<br />
I am trying to add a part number to the BOM based on three parameters:<br />
<br />
P1 (has 8 options)<br />
P2 (has 2 options)<br />
P2 (has 2 options)<br />
<br />
I have a custom table tipcf900 having 4 fields (P1,P2,P3,PartNumber)<br />
<br />
Given the current number of options there will be 32 rows in the table. Can anyone provide and example how how I can pull the PartNumber from this table and place it in the BOM?<br />
<br />
Oh and if possible I would rather it not use an external dll at this point. I would like to use those later when I am more versed in programming 4GL.<br />
<br />
<br />
The three parameters to be used in the SQL statement will come from user data entered into product feature fields ( i used Px here for simplicity. The product features are not really named Px)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">31st January 2011, 22:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming the unique key index on this table is p1,p2 and p3.  Which means you get a unique part number for the query.  <br />
<br />
select tipcf900.*<br />
from tipcf900<br />
where tipcf900._index1 = {:p1,:p2,:p3}<br />
selectdo<br />
endselect<br />
<br />
Without really knowing more it is too hard to really write a good query.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scough</div><div class="date">1st February 2011, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.. I thought I posted a reply but its not showing so I will try again.<br />
<br />
There are some nuances to the select statment that I need to know as you have shown in that example. <br />
<br />
However, I am hoping someone my have a full example of how they query a table using parameter's pulled from user entered data into product feature fields and then use the results of that query to put the partnumber on the bill of materials.</div></div><hr />

You might try searching this forum for some of the PCF tables to see if there are any examples.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">1st February 2011, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">placed above Mark's example code, it would be something like:<br />
<br />
string p1 global<br />
string p2 global<br />
string p3 global<br />
(assuming p1 to p3 are strings)<br />
<br />
p1 = [feature1]<br />
p2 = [feature2]<br />
p3 = [feature3]<br />
<br />
the square brackets refer in the constraint code to a name of a feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scough</div><div class="date">2nd February 2011, 01:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... now given a set of parameters, the sql would return on of the 32 partnumbers from the table.<br />
<br />
Do I access that returned partnumber in the following way: tipcf900.PartNumber<br />
<br />
Now, this is where I am a little confused. The Generic BOM lists all of the 32 different part numbers, each having the ability to have its own constraint.<br />
<br />
I am not sure where I need to create the substitution constraint. I would assume when I know where to create it, I would use &quot;Item Code&quot; and I would assign item_data = tipcf900.PartNumber<br />
<br />
Is this correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">2nd February 2011, 11:10</div></div><div class="posttext">So in your Generic BOM you have 32 items.<br />
Against each one you can have the same constraint ID as it is having to go through the same process.<br />
<br />
In the Validation section of that constraint ID, you will need to get validate = true for the actual item that you want.<br />
<br />
So you could put validate = true after the selectdo and then add 2 lines below:<br />
<br />
selectempty<br />
validate = false<br />
<br />
and then endselect<br />
<br />
The effect of this is to only validate the item component that you need.</div></div><hr />
