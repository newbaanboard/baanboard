So if you select one of them in your report your custom font will not show up. In your report make sure you use a &quot;user defined&quot; font - say something like font 16. Recompile and try.</div></div><hr />

In some versions of Windows 2000, the registry entries are read-only. Can you get to the custom font that you have created in M$ Word or M$ Wordpad?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Vamsi</div><div class="date">18th July 2002, 00:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Follow these steps if you have not already:[list=1]<br />
 Create a Print expression on your report with contents &quot;A&quot; (you will not need either program script or report script changes)<br />
 Choose a single character domain for this (tcmcs.str1 perhaps)<br />
 There is nothing to declare in the input field<br />
 Choose a user font for this expression (User 16 is a good choice)<br />
 Print to BWPRINT with Preview option checked. You should see your &quot;A&quot; (without the quotes)<br />
 Right click on this character (I have had to right click a few pixels away to get the correct menu a few time :(). Go to fonts...change font and change it to the user defined font. I know you are having a problem at this stage. You mentioned something about having made changes to the registry. You do *not* have to manually make any registry changes. When you follow the step of changing the font using Bwprint, it will automatically change the registry for you.<br />
 I hope you have seen the ppt file by dbclark79 elsewhere on this site.<br />
 If this does not help, I will have to give up :).<br />
[/list=1]Should I use this variable only oin column 1 of the layout? It should not matter.</div></div><hr />
