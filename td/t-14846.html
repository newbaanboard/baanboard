<br />
Average purchase price is only updated when purchase invoice is matched and approved. But at the year end, the goods have been received and purchase invoices not received yet, I want to update the average price when the goods are received. <br />
<br />
Any idea in doing this?<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />
