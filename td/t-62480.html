<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gordonr</div><div class="date">14th June 2012, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
can anyone tell me how I can use a refers clause with multiple fields in EasySQL?<br />
<br />
For example, what I want to write is something like the following:<br />
<br />
where {tdpur413.orno, tdpur413.pono, tdpur413.sqnb} refers to tdpur401<br />
<br />
But that syntax gives an error when I try to run it.<br />
<br />
Is this possible in EasySQL, and if so how?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th June 2012, 15:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there an index on tdpur401?  Never done this myself, but found this code:<br />
<br />
		select	tdinv001.stoc:itm.stoc, tdinv001.ordr:itm.ordr,<br />
			tdinv001.allo:itm.allo<br />
		from	tdinv001<br />
		where	{:tdpur041.cwar,<br />
			 :tdpur041.item, :tdpur041.cntr} refers to<br />
			tdinv001._index1<br />
		endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
But to me this is the same as &quot;table._index1 = {:x,:y,:z}&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example, the Purchase Order Activities table (tdpur413) and the Purchase Order Lines table (tdpur401) both have a combo (index) field defined as cmba and it includes orno, pono and sqnb.<br />
<br />
The following EasySQL Query prints all the Purchase Order Activities for Open Purchase Orders ... <br />
<br />
select<br />
       tdpur401.orno,         | Purchase Order<br />
       tdpur401.pono,         | Position<br />
       tdpur401.item,         | Item<br />
       tdpur413.acti          | Activity <br />
from<br />
       tdpur400,              | Purchase Orders<br />
       tdpur401,              | Purchase Order Lines<br />
       tdpur413               | Purchase Order Activities<br />
where<br />
       tdpur413.cmba REFERS TO tdpur401.cmba and<br />
       tdpur401.orno REFERS TO tdpur400.orno and<br />
       tdpur400.hdst &lt;&gt; tdpur.hdst.closed    and<br />
       tdpur400.hdst &lt;&gt; tdpur.hdst.cancelled<br />
order by<br />
       tdpur401.orno,<br />
       tdpur401.pono <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
thanks, but what I am looking for is how to do it when there is not a combined or index field you can use. Maybe the example I gave wasn't a good one....<br />
<br />
Let's assume I want to lookup information from cprao020, and I have tcibd001.<br />
<br />
What I want to be able to do is something like:<br />
<br />
where {&quot;ACT&quot;,10,tcibd001.item} refers to cprao020._index4<br />
<br />
but can you? And if so how, as the above doesn't work!<br />
<br />
(Still not necessarily a logical example I know, but hopefully you get the gist)<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
The<br />
where {tdpur413.orno, tdpur413.pono, tdpur413.sqnb} refers to tdpur401<br />
and<br />
where {&quot;ACT&quot;,10,tcibd001.item} refers to cprao020._index4<br />
will not work in EasySQL.<br />
<br />
However, something like this will:<br />
<br />
where tdpur413.orno REFERS TO tdpur401.orno and<br />
         tdpur413.pono REFERS TO tdpur401.pono and<br />
         tdpur413.sqnb REFERS TO tdpur401.sqnb</div></div><hr />

Why can't you just say cprao020._index4 = {&quot;ACT&quot;,10,tcibd001.item}?  is there some reason you can't just reverse it - it is the same thing.  I must be missing something on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gordonr</div><div class="date">20th June 2012, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
you need the refers because otherwise you will get no data if there is no match, whereas what you want is blanks (unref clear)<br />
<br />
Does that explain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gordonr</div><div class="date">20th June 2012, 19:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
if I try this, I get the error &quot;Reference allowed for index only&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th June 2012, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">It makes sense now.  Of couse then what you can do is the basic part to get the records in the easy sql statements.  Then in the report you do the find for additional data using something like a detail layout.<br />
<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
    tiitm001.desc = &quot;&quot;  | Desc is blank if they send the wrong item to report<br />
    select tiitm001.desc<br />
    from tiitm001<br />
    where tiitm001._index1 = {:some.detail.item}<br />
    selectdo<br />
    endselect<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you see what I am saying?  Basically you simulate the unref clear piece of it - get basic record in easysql, get addition info (if it exists) in report.</div></div><hr />
