<br />
I am facing a problem while trasferring a baan report to excel. While transferring the baan report to excel, excel removes leading zero's from the bank a/c field and also the bank a/c number appears in scientific notation.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to display the bank a/c number as it is stored in baan. Please advice.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'd guess that the problem isn't the export from Baan but the import into excel. Try to specify the column as &quot;text&quot;, then leading zeros won't be removed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sushil</div><div class="date">1st July 2009, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Try specifying a ' character as prefix while importing into excel.<br />
excel understands the data following ' char as text.<br />
<br />
Or you can also use &quot; &quot; in text.<br />
try importing the attached file into excel ( delimiter = |)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st July 2009, 23:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on how you are doing this there are two fixes as mentioned above by others:<br />
(1) Modify the report add quote characters.<br />
(2) On import into excel use text for the field.  Then use the text to column features using this.<br />
<br />
Now at our site last year when running to excel it would not bring the file in as delimited.  See this post (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=52787) if that is the problem you are having.  There for a while when we run a report to excel, the first thing we have taught our users is to close the file.  Then use the File and select the first from the history list.  This is the temp file just downloaded.  Then step thru the import wizard and select text for the appropriate fields.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
The report is exported directly to Excel using the ERPJewels tool.<br />

All u need to write in UDF  text is the following code .<br />
<br />
<br />
return (&quot;'&quot; &amp; F420)<br />
<br />
And use this udf in query fields as against original bankac . U dont need to change the original report for this .</div></div><hr />

Yes Hitesh Sir,<br />
Using UDF it works. Also, concatenating (&quot;'&quot; &amp; tccom025.bano) in the session script also works.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />
