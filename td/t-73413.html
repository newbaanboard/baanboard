<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmannais</div><div class="date">7th September 2020, 08:00</div></div><div class="posttext">In Billable Line session (cisli8110m000), there is a button called &quot;Create Invoice&quot;.<br />
The button, when clicked, will do its standard process and print out the standard invoice report without having a print session or any reports attached to the session itself.<br />
The question is how can I add reports to that particular process of the button.<br />
The desired result is that when user clicks the button it will show report selection rather than directly print out the standard invoice report.</div></div><hr />

In that hook you can use session (extension) fields to determine the report the user wants to print. So, no report selection from a list, but a field in the form that indicates the report to print.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your reply JaapJD.<br />
It can be a workaround for most of the cases. However, the user wants to have a list of reports to choose from in this particular case.</div></div><hr />

Put a field on the form (with session extension) with that domain, and the user can select the report he wants. Use that field value in Get Alternative Report hook in a case statement to return the correct report code.</div></div><hr />

Wow! Just wow.<br />
That is genius.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
I think that is the closest possible of what we need.</div></div><hr />
