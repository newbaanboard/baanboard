<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">30th August 2006, 23:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't you just send the total to the report?  Then order by the total.  You can do this even if you still need the details.  Just with each detail record you have the customer and the customer total.  Then in the after field of customer you print the field(note that you do not use total).<br />
<br />
There is a way to do it only with the report, but it is much more complicated and does basically the same thing.  The only difference is that you would do the totaling and sorting in the report script.</div></div><hr />
