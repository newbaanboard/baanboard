<br />
There is a standard session that I do not have the source code.<br />
When a user prints from that session, there will be a list of reports to select.<br />
When a specific report is selected to print, it must automatically print another report with it using the same set of data that the selected report is printed.<br />
Is it possible?<br />
<br />
I have tried <br />
- brp.open()<br />
- spool.open()<br />
- AFS<br />
for both the report script, session extension, and report extension.<br />
None of them works.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Thana</div></div><hr />

Anyone got a suggestion?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried it. When the report is printed, it prints alternative report instead, which is not what I am looking for.<br />
I want to print both the selected report and another report.</div></div><hr />

I mean you run one session and get a report, and then run a second session to get another report.  Of course I am assuming they are different scripts that actually generate report data - just happens to be the same data.<br />
<br />
Now if you are running the first report and then want to use the data actually in that report to send to another report that is different.  What I would do - is run the report to disc, then run it again to printer.  Then I would have my own script to read in the disc version of the report, format or create variables, etc. then feed what I read into another report.<br />
<br />
What I actually did once was run a series of reports to disc via over night jobs.  These were all Work center related reports.  Then a user could come in the next morning, put in his/her work center in a session, click continune.  I would then read thru those 4 or 5 reports and only pull the information for their workcenter.  Now mine was easy cause I had to do was read the header records, fine the work center - then just straight up print that page.  My report was a single layout with one field - like a 188 character field.  That kept the page break correct even with all the blank lines.</div></div><hr />
