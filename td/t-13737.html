<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">26th November 2003, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have a question about the functionality of function double.cmp().<br />
What I know about this function is that you give 3 arguments as follows:<br />
1) first double<br />
2) second double<br />
3) the tolerated difference in order to still be considered equal<br />
<br />
I know that in many standard Baan scripts this function is used when checking values of doubles, even without comparing. For instance:<br />
to check if a 'double'-amount is &gt; 0, you will call double.cmp(amount, 0.0, 0.000), so then basically the amount is compared with the value 0.0, and the tolerance is 0.000, so if the amount is &gt; 0, the return value of the function should be 1.<br />
<br />
My questions:<br />
1)  When I applied this, I found that even when the amounts were 0, the result of the function was 1, i.e. that the amount is higher than 0..!! How come?? Am I doing something wrong??<br />
2)  Is it risky to check just simply like:<br />
if amount &gt; 0 and amount2 = 0 and amount3 &lt; 0 then etc.?<br />
<br />
<br />
Would appreciate if anyone could shed some light...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th November 2003, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I never use zero tolerance.  I know that sometimes with double types a 0 is not really a &quot;0&quot;. This has to with how the double types are stored.  I remember from my HP days a double 0 could sometimes be stored as .99E-99 - well something like that. So when we converted to Baan and I used the double.cmp command I set the tolerance to 0.0001 or 0.00001.  I never really checked to see how Baan and Oracle stored some of these values.<br />

<br />
1)0 returns  if the difference is less than the tolerance. 0 is not less 0.000.<br />
<br />
use double.cmp(amount, 0.0, 0.00000001)</div></div><hr />

Indeed the tolerance should not be 0. I tested this using 0.00000001 for the tolerance, and now the results are correct.<br />
