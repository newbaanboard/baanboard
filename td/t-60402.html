<br />
I would like to use &quot;start.application.local&quot; in Baan IV. I have porting set 6.1c.06.04 running under Sun Solaris<br />
The function seems to be in &quot;ttdllbw&quot;. How can I update my Baan IV so I can use start.application.local?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">19th April 2011, 16:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure I understand the question.  I am on 4c4 and I see start.application.local in ttdllbw.  To use it all I would need to do is include the ottdllbw library in the source code for the session.  I have never used it in production, but I know I tested it once using this code:<br />
<br />
	#pragma	used	dll	ottdllbw<br />
	 long e<br />
	start.application.local(&quot;notepad.exe c:\temp\tt.txt&quot;,true,e)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sawell</div><div class="date">19th April 2011, 17:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Mark, you did understand my question correctly (and I got start.application.local working without any problems in baan V and LN).<br />
<br />
I am also on 4c4. It seems that the last ServicePack that was installed is version 6 (not really sure about that).<br />
But I took a look into &quot;odllw&quot; in the directory &quot;/baan/bse/tools/ttB40_c4/ottdll&quot; with a hex editor: &quot;start.application.local&quot; does'nt exist (i can find for example &quot;create.local.directory&quot;). The date of the file is 3. September 2002 (all files in this directory have that date).<br />
Maybe I can just use a newer &quot;odllbw&quot;? Where can I get that file from to test it?</div></div><hr />

My recommendation is that you request from Infor the file.  But they might require an update.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your help!<br />
I will do that and report back here<br />

<br />
It seems that one need to install a complete Service Pack to get this function included.</div></div><hr />
