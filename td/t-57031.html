<br />
<br />
i'm having difficulties again on  the BIRT reporting tools, and i'm sure you guys/girls can help me:).<br />
<br />
i wan't to make a footer on the master page of the RPTdesign report of LNFP5, i already convert it into xml report, export it into .rptdesign and edit it on the BIRT.<br />
<br />
but, when i tried to edit the master page and insert a field from the layout field, the result is blank, eventhough i already copy paste the attribute and it's the same field(except the name of course).<br />
<br />
and the strange thing i found is, the after.layout field and footer field on the BIRT report doesn't appear on the LN, and i can't find the setting.<br />
<br />
i'll attach the rptdesign file for you guys, maybe you can find something.<br />
<br />
meanwhile i'll search the BIRT manual and INFOR manual too:)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this mean that there is no Data in the after.layout and the footer Layout if you print the report 'normally' (e.g. not through Birt)?<br />
<br />
The Flow when printing Baan Reports with Birt is the following:<br />
The Report Design File is based on the Baan Report Layout. When you print a report it is processed by Baan and a flat file with the Data is created which serves as the Data Source for Birt.<br />
Maybe you can have a look in this Datafile if it actually contains the Data you expect to see.<br />

<br />
<br />
the report works fine in the BW and the display of 4gl report,<br />
<br />
the problem only happened in BIRT report, where the layout isn't the same as the BW/Display.<br />
<br />
by the way, how do you see the datafile?is it the same as the dataset on BIRT?<br />
<br />
i'll try to post the result of the report tomorrow, maybe it will explain more.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Attached is the report result in BW and in RPT.<br />
<br />
but for the BW print report, i think you have to convert it again to .BPF, i can't upload the .BPF file here.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
i already found why the data doesn't appear on the master page now, the reason is because the column binding is only available in the table, not on the grid, and the master page of the BIRT isn't available for grid.<br />
<br />
now, only the detail layout problem exist, how to set it so the detail can be printed at the fix amount of times.<br />

does the problem with the not printed Details only exist if you export the report to pdf or also when viewing report as html?<br />
<br />
I know of several problems with the PDF Emitter specially on the older Versions of BIRT (Infor uses a 2.1 i think/ the actual Version is 2.5.1).<br />
<br />
I think you should change the layout in the Report Designer to adapt an A4 or letter paper size (what you need) for the pdf output.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that's not to confusing,<br />

<br />
<br />
yes, i understand what you're saying, and i read in the web that the problem did exist with the older BIRT.<br />
<br />
the problem exist also when i view it on the HTML, and also in PDF.<br />
<br />
i already changed the paper size to PDF, but it still not appearing.<br />
<br />
i think the problem is on the hide element, because when i disabled the hide element, the field is printed, but it's printed in all of the layout section.<br />
<br />
and the problem i don't know why the LN generates expression like <br />
<br />
row[&quot;footer.11.1&quot;]!=&quot;footer.11.1&quot;<br />
<br />
in BIRT.<br />
<br />
i hope that's not too confusing too, because i'm ran out of word to explain it actually ^^<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
