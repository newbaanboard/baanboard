<br />
Does anyone know how to select records ordered by an expression?<br />
For example:<br />
select  table1.*<br />
from    table1<br />
where  table1.field1 = 1<br />
order by table1.field1 - table1.field2 + table1.field3<br />
I tried both embedded and dynamic sql. <br />
Embedded will not compile &quot;Syntax error: '+' not expected&quot;<br />
Dynamic crashes on sql.parse &quot;Error 302 (SQL syntax not correct) on SELECT&quot;<br />
<br />
Oracle sqlplus accepts this without any problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Maybe with a little more info someone can suggest another solution.  So what exactly are you trying to accomplish - the more info the better.</div></div><hr />

I was afraid this was the case. <br />
I do have a couple of other ideas but I thought I would try the simplest one first. For example I could do one of the following:<br />
1. Cycle through all records (there are never more than 4), collect those calculated values and store them in an array. Then, sort the array (this might be tricky). Then select every record one by one using a &quot;for&quot; loop. This, as you might imagine, would be inefficient and complicated.<br />
2. Add a new field to the table and store the result of the calculation in it. Then I would just order by the new field.<br />
I think I will go with #2 unless anyone has a better suggestion.<br />
I am modifying part of a custom written session which updates raw and finished good inventories and prints shipping barcodes on the shop floor. Code is quite complex and messy, so I would like to minimize the amount of changes required to accomplish the task. Getting at the records ordered by the expression will allow that.<br />

Thanks,<br />
