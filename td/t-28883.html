<br />
I'm working on LN webtop.. <br />
I'm developing a dynamic session that one of it's fields has the zoom option to a menu (that contains some sessions that I wrote). When the user zooms to one of these sessions he chooses a value and this session exports this value to the original session.. The goal is that each value returned from the zoom to be concatenated to the previous content of the text field.<br />
<br />
The problem is if I go to this text field and type a value then I click on zoom to choose another value.. The new value replaces the old one instead of being concatenated to it. (in before.zoom section the text field value is empty!!)<br />
<br />
But if I run the same session and do the same in worktop it works, meaning the new value returned from the zoom is concatenated to the previous one.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
field.temp:<br />
before.zoom:<br />
   zoom_val = &quot;&quot;<br />
after.zoom:<br />
   temp = temp&amp;&quot; &quot;&amp;zoom_val<br />
<br />
The problem is that if I write a value in the field temp and then zoom (without clicking on tab) the return value from zoom is not concatenated to the value that I wrote before the zoom, instead it replaces it.<br />
<br />
This problem occurs on webtop only.<br />
