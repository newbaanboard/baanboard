<br />
I am developing a editable multioccurence session with one view field. i have three fields that the user can edit out of which one is a yes/no check box. the user can check it and tab to the next record. suppose after checking 3 or 4 records, the user made a mistake on the  first record by checking the yes/no field.  now he wants to uncheck it, how do I fire the check that was originally there when the user started to check. in my case the below condition is getting fired even though i have not saved the record yet.<br />
 <br />
By the way there a condition on which the user can uncheck it( i am checking the inventory on the item  and if the invenory is there the user is not allowed to uncheck it.).<br />
can anybody help me with this????<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

The check.input subsection should use the current row's record values in doing its checks.  Perhaps you can explain what problem you are seeing in the validation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">24th May 2002, 06:50</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understand correctly, you do not want the user to be able to change the field if there is inventory available on hand.<br />
<br />
So, in the before.input event, set the field to 'checked' and the attr.input to false if inventory is available.<br />
<br />
Thereafter, all other validation can be done in the check.input event.</div></div><hr />
