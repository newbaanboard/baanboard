<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mast_aadmi</div><div class="date">19th November 2009, 11:06</div></div><div class="posttext">i want to transfer control from after printing a layout one time to another layout. Is this possible by using a command that is inbuilt in the script.<br />
<br />
This is what i want to do:-<br />
<br />
Once a layout is printed then i have to move to the next layout of my choice.<br />
after this layout is printed then i have to pass control back to the starting layout.<br />
<br />
I'm asking for an inbuilt command in baan to transfer control from one part of the script to another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Hitesh Shah on this.  You can put the report in debug mode to find the routines to call, but I strongly recommend agains this as he has mentioned.<br />
<br />
My thought is to use the output expressions to trigger which layout gets printed when.  I use this for my excel devices so the header only gets printed once.  So for this you could have detail.1 and detail.2.  Then in the report script when a certain condition is met detail.2's output expression is set, causing the layout to print.  Then in the after.layout event you could set it back to false.<br />
<br />
I also use session scripts to toggle layouts based off the data.  So I might have 3 detail layouts, each layout triggered by the &quot;kind.of.item&quot;. This toggles them on and off as needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now i will give u a brief description of my problem, please tell me a way of solving this:-<br />
<br />
The layout i'm trying to print consists of the following things:-<br />
FF          FFFFF                    FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF <br />
----------------------------------------------------------(graphical line)<br />
<br />
The fields are called repititevely to print the footer text entered in the session. Now i want that say 5 lines to be printed (only the fields), not the graphical line. After the five lines are printed then i need to print the graphical line. This can go on any no of times. The no of times the either the field or the graphical line is printed is not fixed.<br />
<br />
Pl solve this issue. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
put the graphical line in a seperate layout.<br />
Use a counter and printcondition for this seperate layout depending on the<br />
layout before.<br />
Increase the counter to the value you need, set the print condition = true and reset the counter.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">25th November 2009, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Now take what bernd showed you and you can make it a variable number of times.  Using an edit check.  Here is another way to do this leaving the output expression as 1.<br />
<br />
| Detail.1 contains graphical line<br />
detail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
    if tisfc001.kowc = tckowc.main.wc then<br />
       lattr.print = true         | Print when main wc passed<br />
    else<br />
       lattr.print =false         | Don't print when not main<br />
    endif<br />
detail.2:<br />
before.layout:<br />
       | always print detail 2 cause it contains info on the workcenter<br />
<br />
<br />
You can reverse this and play with turning on and off layouts.  All you really need to do in the code is include the conditions to trigger the graphical line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mast_aadmi</div><div class="date">2nd December 2009, 08:32</div></div><div class="posttext">I have attached the report. What i want in that report is that the terms and conditions, delivery, validity etc should come in a box. <br />
<br />
As you can see it is printed only at the very end and not on each time. All the text that is printed is taken from the footer text field that is entered in the quotation session. Is there any way to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
All this is printed by repetitively calling an after field layout repetitatively till the entire text entered in the footer text is printed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd December 2009, 15:27</div></div><div class="posttext">In the report editor just make the layout big enough and then draw a box around it.  Under the edit command you will see draw box.</div></div><hr />
