<br />
When testing the barcode in Word it gives exactly the right code.<br />
When scanning in worktop or webtop reading give an unpredictable results as several characters and tabs keep missing randomly.:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andy..</div><div class="date">16th March 2009, 11:43</div></div><div class="posttext">this is a very common problem when using keyboard wedge scanners with Windows.  The scanner is 'typing too fast', passing the data too quickly.  This is not a problem when filling a single field, however as soon as you tab to different fields various things from the App and OS can interrupt/divert the flow of the keyboard buffer for brief moments.<br />
<br />
There is no simple solution to this, you can try and slow down the data rate of the scanner but you are still likely to find the problem is only reduced.<br />
<br />
If this is a one-off session requirement you could try and make a combined field to scan all the data then populate the rest of the fields.<br />
<br />
The only proper solution is to move to an ASCII interface using a barcode data capture solution like the one found at http://www.arcgateway.com</div></div><hr />
