In C3 the BW client was of version 45. and in C4 I installed client of version 65.<br />
<br />
Now while testing reports on preprinted stationary like purchase orders/ cheque etc. The font which gets printed is not same as it was in C3 environment. All fonts are enlarged.<br />
<br />
Even I tried to take a preview and then changed the font and the font size but it is not working.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plese let me know where I am going woring.<br />

<br />
First of all, pls. update your O.S., D.B.type etc.<br />
<br />
Probably you also updated the portingset, i suppose, and you did some changes in the printdrivers of the 'old' portingset.<br />
If you use the files from $BSE/lib/printinf for printing, make a copy from your 'old' protingset and replace the ones in the new portingset by the 'old' ones.<br />
I hope your problem has been solved then.<br />

<br />
Pls. be so kind to Edit your profile by UserControlPanel =&gt; Edit Profile and update this one with the figures you just replied. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Now your problem:<br />
Are you printing by Device Type: 'DIRECT'?<br />
If so then the $BSE/printinf-files are used. See my message  before.<br />
