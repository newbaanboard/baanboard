 <br />
I wonder if anyone has any experience adding an index to tdpur045 to sort it by the invoice number (tdpur045.invn).<br />
 <br />
I've inherited our Baan IV customizations from previous developers, who I cannot contact, and before I rush ahead and change their code, I'm try to figure out why they made some of the choices they did.<br />
 <br />
In this case I need a session that displays receipts (tdpur045) sortable and searchable by invoice number (tdpur045.invn). <br />
 <br />
The previous developers had no problem adding indexes to tables. They added an index to tdpur045. But for some reason they chose not to create an index for invoice number. Instead, they created a secondary table, which contains many of the fields from tdpur045 and indexes by invoice number.  The table is updated when purchase invoices are printed. <br />
 <br />
I can't think of why they would have done this unless there is some good reason not to index by tdpur045.invn. Does anyone have any experience with creating an index for this field?<br />
 <br />
Thanks,<br />
Rob</div></div><hr />

in my opinion there is no technical reason not to index tdpur045.invn.<br />

You only should always add tdpur045.orno, pono and serb also to the index (or with other words the whole primary key so you can create the index with duplicate = NO. Duplicate values can slow down you dramatically especially with ttaad4100/ttaad4500).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, tdpur045 is not a historical table and you or some other  will delete the old records if it becomes to large. I think thats why they used an additonal table for a history of tdpur045.invn. <br />

Well I do the same thing in some cases, but I am tracking stuff that is not normally tracked within standard baan.  My tables may contain standard baan fields(other than the key), but they also contain information not in standard baan.  As for creating an index on the table - I have no problem with doing that, but you have to check each service pack to make sure Baan does not create an index that would replace your index.  So it is just a matter of maintenance.</div></div><hr />
