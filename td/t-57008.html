I have searched the forum but unfortunately didn't find a real solution. Is it possible to place an image inside a LN report (as a field)? I have heard that there is a quite simple workaround but unfortunately never found the instructions again.<br />
<br />
So, how can I place an gif image in a LN report? Modifying the clients is not really a sulution for me (fonts etc.)...<br />
<br />
Thx in advance<br />

<br />
do a search for &quot;overlay&quot; - there is a very detailed thread describing how to do that (send overlay data with graphic images to a printer).<br />
Fortunately you are using a unix platform, as the solution doesn`t work for M$ systems.<br />
<br />
good luck<br />

Thanks for the &quot;hint&quot; to have to look for overlay. The procedures (overlay for unix and fonts for windows) seem to be quite complicated. According to my colleagues there should also a workaround exist, where a gif image can be simply linked to a field in the report. Any ideas?<br />

sorry for the late response.<br />
As I wrote in the thread about overlay technique, I found it rather simple to get it to run.<br />
One has to fiddle around a bit, but thanks to vamsis excellent explanation it is not too difficult.<br />
There may be other commercial solutions available, but since you are on a unix machine, using overlays is the cheapest method.<br />
Once installed it has been running for years now without ever giving any problems.<br />
If you run into problems following the procedure decribed by vamsi, feel free to give me an E-Mail or a phone call.<br />
<br />
good luck <br />
