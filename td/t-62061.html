<br />
In our company I made a small module in BaanIV where sales reps can plan and enter their visits to customers (a kind of mini-crm).<br />
<br />
I would like to add the planned visits of this mini-crm automatically as an appointment in outlook. Once these appointments are in Outlook, it should be traceable if changes are made to them (e.g. change of date).<br />
<br />
Has anyone built/used such an interface to exchange/outlook, perhaps with the help oh 3rd-party software?<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />
Frank</div></div><hr />
