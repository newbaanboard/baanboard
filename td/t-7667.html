<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 15:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to write a report similar to tipcs8410m000 (Print Financial Project Transactions).  My biggest problem (before I even write any code) is to figure out how all the financial integration tables (tfgld410, 417, 418) match and link up.  Does anyone have sample code they could provide so I can see how to query these tables?<br />
<br />
I'd look at the session script for tipcs8410m000, but I don't have the source.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eddie Monster</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 16:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark, you've come through again (as always)!<br />
<br />
I thought that the select statements would have used the tfgld418.tmpk and tfgld410.tmpk somehow...<br />
<br />
I am now assuming that I would initially select my data from the 418 table and in that selectdo section would have the code you posted. <br />
<br />
Once I get something togther, I'll let you know how it worked!<br />
<br />
Thanks again oh oracle of Baan knowledge!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">It just so happens that I am trying to create a report on the tfglg410 table. So I just did a grep for some of the tables you are working.  A return favor may be do if I can not figure out when a credit is a credit and when a credit is a debit and so on and so fourth. :)  My user is trying to keep the rules a secret and will not write them down for me.  So I do a little guessing and coding .  When I get tired of this I may send you a PM.  But the last check on the code he gave me 99.9% complete. Oh yeah. :)<br />

<br />
Do you mean just identifying debits from credits or are you getting confused with negative numbers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th November 2002, 23:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually it would have been trying to figure out the costs on transfers.  It turns out that some of our tfgld410 transactions are in-correct.  Only a few on 1 project for make parts.  My user had me trying to program exceptions to the rules of calculating the total amount.  So I was trying to figure out when a debit was really a debit.  After a week of going back and fourth he finally accepted that I can not program for these exceptions.  <br />
<br />
We are getting ready to do a Baan finance install, so I may post some questions about it - eventually.<br />

Thanks<br />
