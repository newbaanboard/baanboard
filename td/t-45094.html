<br />
I am devloping a customisation with the purpose to attach a document-file to an e-item, using the odm subapplication (package dm). <br />
 <br />
Deep down in dmdocdlladd, a file should be copied to the tmp-directory. Copied over a just created one. But it fails.<br />
Variables:<br />
areapath = &quot;c:\erpln\odm\dgf\test103.txt&quot; (the file to copy)<br />
file1= &quot;c:/erpln/tmp/tmp097439002&quot; (recently created empty to-file)<br />
<br />
I put in for test purposes:<br />
i1 = seq.open(areapath, &quot;r&quot;)<br />
i2 = seq.open(file1, &quot;w&quot;)<br />
<br />
i1 and i2 shows that this is without problems<br />
<br />
Then comes the <br />
ret = client2server(areapath, file1, false, false)<br />
<br />
and ret = -32 and nothing has happened.<br />
<br />
?????????????<br />
<br />
I can mention that I am running the user interface directly on the server.<br />
<br />
When running this normally, through the LN User interface, from the eitem, and pressing the paper-clip-key, it works. But now I made a customisation so I invoke the dm-session dmdoc4540m002 (supposed to handle the documents and connect to the eitem) from my program directly and it doesn't work. Can the application and possibly some authorisation rules controll the functionality of client2server.</div></div><hr />

I think client2server expects you to be running the client software so a connection can be made from the client to the server.  If you are running directly on the server there is no client for the connection request.  I could be wrong, but I would not expect client2server to work without the client connection made.  Then again I know nothing about LN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I know sometimes it stuck because of a wrong path. I see you have a wrong slash in file1's path.<br />
Also check this link:<br />

I hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">28th November 2007, 11:09</div></div><div class="posttext">It was like this. I had opened the file, with seq.open,  much earlier, just as a check that the file existed. So it was open when trying the client2server. When I added a seq.close after my seq.open, it all worked.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pellus</div><div class="date">29th November 2007, 10:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. Case closed. As I said, the problem was that the from-file was opened with seq.open (and not seq.close-d again), in an earlier stage.</div></div><hr />
