<br />
I am Baan newbie and I am currently working on an Web Interface as a replacement for the Baan Session and I came to know that Baan has the concept of Application locks which helps prevent multiple users from accessing the same record/field.<br />
<br />
I was researching that I read somewhere that some the Baan functionality can be exposed as a COM DLL.<br />
<br />
In my usecase, I want to play nice with Baan so that other sessions which might be using the record that I am editing using the Web interface follows the same Baan rules.<br />
<br />
Essentially, I would to expose certain Baan internal programming API via a Helper COM Dll that I can use in my .NET application to perform the same locking that would happen as if I was coding in the Baan session.<br />
<br />
The ones that I am interested in are:<br />
appl.delete	<br />
appl.get.user	<br />
appl.modify	<br />
appl.set	<br />
<br />
Is this even possible or am I missing something very basic?:confused:<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">16th January 2015, 00:19</div></div><div class="posttext">First thought - if you are creating an application lock that a baan standard session will lock for then the lock needs to be created just like the standard baan session does.  Of course we don't own source so I could not check how sessions do it.  It would probably be easy to just check what was created.<br />
<br />
Since I am not a .net application I can't say for sure you can't use the commands themselves.  What I know you can do - is create a baan dll that you pass the parameters to - and have it create the lock for you.  You can search for like ole and excel, maybe vb.net.  You should find threads on how people solve items like this.<br />
<br />
You could also probably just write the record directly to the oracle table that the locks are stored in - my system I think it is ttadv998 for company 000.  I am just not sure what all the fields are or how they should be filled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baannoob</div><div class="date">16th January 2015, 02:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mark. I think you cleared my doubt. I am pretty close to creating a DLL which exposes standard Application lock functionality so that I can call it directly from my C# program.<br />
<br />
You are correct, TRITON.TTTADV998000 is the table and I have already verified  that and as you said, I am not exactly sure what goes into all these columns highlighted in my attachment. (Please see attachment)<br />
<br />
When I tried a simple code, I was expecting an error (Please see attachment) on saying that the BaanDLL is not valid but I got an connection error. By any chance do you know what's going on?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">16th January 2015, 11:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
If you want a session to have a Web interface and have application lock, you can write a few lines of code in that session. I guess you do not need an additional DLL to apply application locks.<br />
<br />
You can use this function in your session:-<br />
<br />
function domain tcbool set.appli.lock()<br />
{<br />
        long ret<br />
	ret = appl.set(&quot;appln_lock_name&quot;, APPL.EXCL)<br />
<br />
	if (ret = -1) or (ret &gt; 0) then<br />
		ret = appl.get.user(&quot;appln_lock_name&quot;,a.user)<br />
		message(&quot;User %s is currently using session&quot;,<br />
			a.user)<br />
<br />
		return(false)<br />
	else<br />
		if ret = -3 then<br />
			message(&quot;Not able to set application lock.&quot;)<br />
			return(false)<br />
		endif<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
	return(true)<br />
}				<br />
<br />
About the error, I am not sure about you calls, but here's a way I did in VB (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?p=182493#post182493)</div></div><hr />

But for me to call Baan code from an external program, I thought I have to compile it as a DLL (C Library).<br />
<br />
Am I missing something here?<br />

<br />
What I meant is, you can write a single DLL having logic to set and check application locks as well in addition to your logic for handling data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th January 2015, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Follow the link bhushan posted.  It shows how to setup a connect to baan  using the createobject.  Looks like from you screen shots you need that.  The other thing is I am not sure how you would fill some of those fields.</div></div><hr />

When I try to connection from the VB example, I get the following error. <br />
<br />
ActiveX component can't create object or return reference to this object (Error 429)<br />
<br />
Ref:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa231060(v=vs.60).aspx<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I am including my username and password inside the .bwc file and set ShowLoginDialog = NO. I hope thats not messing with what I am trying to do.<br />
<br />
Am I doing something incorrect?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">22nd January 2015, 10:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I guess you don't need to set ShowLoginDialog = NO Keep it as it is. Also, can you please post your code. One can try it out. Also, I am assuming you are using proper object name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baannoob</div><div class="date">22nd January 2015, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Bhushan.<br />
<br />
Actually the problem was that I actually didn't configure a default BWC. So I open the BWC and clicked on making it the default and the VB code actually started working.<br />
<br />
But since I had ShowLoginDialog =YES, it brought up the Baan login screen and after I put in the username and password, it worked.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for the VB DLL code. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">23rd January 2015, 10:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad that you managed to solve it. You can click on save password for the bwc configuration and you won't see the dialog as well. Thanks for sharing your solution.</div></div><hr />

I think I am still missing something. Our Baan developers wrote the code and compiled it into a DLL and when I tried to invoke it, I got the attached error messages.<br />
<br />
Is there a special way to compile these DLL's.? Also do we need to put these DLL's in a specific directory for my login to be able to invoke it?<br />
<br />
Please help! Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see #include&lt;stdio.h&gt; <br />
<br />
Please remove that. It is not present in Baan but in C. <br />
<br />
Also, if that works, I guess you need to have one more function to check if there is already an application lock. I guess your developers know that.<br />
<br />
Please try to remove that header and try again. Make sure your Baan Dev compiles it without any errors. <br />
<br />
Note- All headers need to be under declaration: section. Not sure how they compiled the DLL successfully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baannoob</div><div class="date">12th February 2015, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Bhushan,<br />
<br />
If you notice the code carefully, that &lt;stdio.h&gt; reference is commented out with the pipe symbol so I don't believe that the error is coming from the Baan code.<br />
<br />
Do you think the error is coming from the C output file which is compiled? Maybe the DLL is being placed in a directory which does not have access to the standard C libraries? Do you think that might be the reason.<br />
<br />
Also, I am assuming that the Baan Code must first be converted to a C DLL using the following commands. If my understanding is incorrect, please let me know<br />
<br />
Convert a baan dll to a C lib.<br />
<br />
bic_cstub6.1 –s –a –d oisslsdllc001 –o baanlib.c<br />
-s – Single bit code<br />
-a    ANSI-C  source<br />
-d   Baan Dll<br />
-o   C lib.  (Source code)<br />
<br />
cc –c  –I baanlib.c  -o baanlib.o<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And then I believe we have to put that DLL somewhere (I don't know exactly where that location is  :(). Maybe that's where the problem is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another question that I had is, whether you can share the steps that you took to compile your code and expose it to be accessed by VB through excel.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your guidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">12th February 2015, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I am not a C# expert so can't really help with that part. Also, I am not sure why you need to provide full path.<br />
<br />
One more thing what I noticed is, you are not prefixing the DLL with &quot;o&quot;. You can try to change that odll_name<br />
<br />
Here is the Thread (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?p=182493#post182493) again and attached are my DLL &amp; VB Scripts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Can you please share the commands and steps that you took to convert Baan Code to a DLL?<br />
<br />
2) Is the DLL a C object file (ending with extension &quot;.o&quot;)?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">13th February 2015, 23:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
In Baan/LN, when you create a script, you have to mention the type of script.<br />
<br />
To create a DLL, select script type as DLL and create it.<br />
<br />
I guess you developer might have used some other script type and hence it might be showing that error.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your response. We are on Baan 4.2b not on Baan LN. Not sure whether that makes a difference.:confused:<br />
<br />
