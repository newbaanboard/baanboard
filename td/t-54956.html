  <br />
I am working with LN 6.1  <br />
  <br />
I have a big problem, because I am changing a standard report and I need to add more input fields to this report, but when I compile I get one error, I was looking for on the forums and I found that the  input fields reports cannot have a long more than 255, but I need  some way to add more inputs fields on the report.  <br />
  <br />
I have thinking in import and export functions.  <br />
  <br />
Anybody can tell me if  another better way exists?  <br />
  <br />
Thank you....</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
youre right,<br />
the number of input fields in reports are limited.<br />
<br />
You can write the data (fields) to a ASCII-file instead by using seq functions.<br />
<br />

It appears you need to add more report input fields, put the number of fields that you can pass to your report is limited to 255.<br />
<br />
First check the list for unused fields by checking the layouts of used fields, and in the report script if it exists.  Many times the report input list has all the fields of a table to be available for report customization.  If they are not used, remove them.<br />
<br />
Some of the fields like item descriptions or customer name and address can be removed if you place a sql statement in the report script and look it up at the time of printing. <br />
<br />
If some of these new fields that you want to add can be looked up with an sql statement in the report script, you can add them that way too.  When adding the fields on the layout, you may get an error that says the field is not defined, but it will let you continue.  Verify the field when the report prints out for the correct values.</div></div><hr />
