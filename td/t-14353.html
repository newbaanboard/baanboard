 We have developed a Barcode system in Visual Basic and linked with BaaN IV . but when we are useing VB system it use Directly Data base server and update BaaN database ( we are useing SQL 2000 in Back end we have 3 tier application,database &amp; clint  ). Everything is fine but question is when we use VB system for barcode total system is slow down and processor of database server shows 100% utilization. At this time it is very difficult to work on Baan system.we scan 14000 finish goods in 24 hours, no down time . Now we are looking for a solution. any body useing barcode system and  Can u give your code for barcode system and guide us to implement this system through BaaN only. When we use visual basic system then we cannot use the index of the table.<br />

Updating Baan tables directly from VB is not recommended practice, to Update Baan tables you can use DDC or AFS so that all the Baan Functionality and integration with finance will be very smooth.  Hope you are reporting production order completion thru barcoding application.<br />

thanks</div></div><hr />

thanks for quick reply and thanks for helping. But it matter is not clear . We upload the data for operation completed . You r right and pin point the problem. Please give details idea what we should do. Last few days it is very difficult for us to work on Baan System . We are help less now .  What is DDC &amp; AFS . Please give details idea. One more thing is it against board rule to ask source code. <br />

<br />
AFS Means Application function server, and this will meets your requirement.<br />
<br />
AFS manual and alot of threads related to AFS is avaiable in Baan board.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

See how are you reading Database or updating database in VB. It could be problem in VB code especially if you are using Microsoft Jet enigne. Also try giving right for that particular table, sometime it takes long time for going to actual table. Your problem defintely lies in VB script. You may not have expericned this problem earlier, but may be be because of number of records have increased in the table, it may be causing a problem now.<br />

<br />
you may need to integrate your barcode activity to baan using AFS functionality. direct updation of baan table is not recommanded. there are many threads on AFS on board. Go through it &amp; explore.<br />
