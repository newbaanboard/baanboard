I have made sure the printer I'm printing to is set to A4.<br />

If at all possible, I would rather not write code to count line numbers and then page break.  Theoretically, the paper type setting should solve this problem.<br />

Any ideas?<br />

A printer can only use one kind of paper, ie A4 or letter. Within the paper/fonts you define the number of lines that can be printed.</div></div><hr />

On XP for HP printers there is a paper setting under General, Printing Preferences as well as device settings.<br />
<br />
May be worth double checking the print driver just in case there are two settings.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />
