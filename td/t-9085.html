<br />
I need a report that print all kinds of requirement because of a sales order line (tdsls041). The item at the sls order line can be both a standard item and a customized item, and it can also be a phantom.<br />
The report shall print:<br />
1) Inventory on hand/ economic stock for the sls order line item and planned production orders for the item(all production orders where the status is Planned - Active). If (economic stock is &lt;0 and it is a manufactured item) or the item is a phantom, go to step 2,<br />
2) Go to the next level in the BOM for the sls order line item, print Inventory on Hand and econ. stock for all items at this level, if there is Planned Inventory Transactions for these items and the item is a manufactured item, print the planned production orders (positve transactions, from e.q. tdinv150 and/or corresponding pcs table).<br />
3) Make a new &quot;loop&quot; , go to the next level in the BOM for the manufactured items printed at step 2, print Inventory on Hand and econ. stock for all items at this level, if there is Planned Inventory Transactions for this items and the item is a manufactured item, print the planned production orders (positive transactions, from e.q. tdinv150 and/or corresponding pcs table).<br />
4) New loop, aso.<br />
<br />
The total number of levels in the BOM is maximum 8.<br />
<br />
The intention of the report is to make sure that a sales order line is ready to be delivered, and if not, where is the constraints.<br />
<br />
If anyone have made something like this or have ideas about how to make the report, I would be pleased:D  to get some help.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EdHubbard</div><div class="date">3rd March 2003, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a requirement for something which I think is along the same lines as yours - view inventory,view delivery &amp; invoice details and view (some) variant options which we feel would have been too slow to try to select in real time.<br />
The compromise is that it is up to 24 hours out of date.<br />
<br />
What we did was to create a custom table and a session which displayed the contents of that table per customer.<br />
The table is populated each night by another customer session with details from the following tables:<br />
tdsls040<br />
tdsls041<br />
tdsls045<br />
tipcf520<br />
tiitm001<br />
tipcs021<br />
tccom010<br />
and a custom table extending customer details<br />
tipcs020<br />
tcmcs018<br />
<br />
Although the exact requirement is not the same as yours, it may be that for performance you may need to consider something similar. Using a custom table also allowed us to have custom indexes (example, reverse order date).</div></div><hr />
