<br />
I have a form with a list view. The user would like a button on the form that when clicked, a window appears asking for a new effective date. The user can then enter a date on this popup window. Then the user should click OK to have all the dates on the form change to this new date, or CANCEL to not do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 17:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Not too difficult, but I cannot directly think of a way to handle this in one session. What you can do, is <br />
<br />
a) Create a new session which will be activated when hitting the 'select date' button. In the new session you enter the date and when hitting 'ok' your session aborts and the selected date is entered in all relevant fields.<br />
<br />
Or <br />
<br />
b) Can you not just have a date-field on the form of your existing session, with for instance a 'update' button next to which activates a function to update all relevant dates? Will user not be happy with this? This will give the same result, but saves you the work of a new session...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 17:58</div></div><div class="posttext">En hit exactly how I do it with method (a).  I found that it confused my users to have extra info on a form and they would update by mistake.  With a new session they new that when it popped up they would be updating the complete table.  It also gave them an opportunity to cancel the action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">en@frrom</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 18:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Mark, I agree that it is maybe the MOST neat solution, but I personally would still rather opt for my option b). The issues you mentioned (users not knowing it's updating the table, and no cancel button) can be easily solved by prompting with a message like &quot;this will update all the date-fields. Are you sure you want to proceed?&quot; upon hitting the 'update' button, with a 'yes' and 'cancel' button... <br />
<br />
It just saves work, AND reduces the amount of customized sessions (3 objects: form, script, session) by 1. The latter is for me also to be taken into consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">17th July 2006, 19:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - I agree.  My users (and me) just did not like the extra fields on an already complicated form.  And they really dis-liked the idea of a second form.  We settled on the new session.</div></div><hr />
