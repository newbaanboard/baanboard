I am having a problem with report formating. I have written a script which uses ttstpconv to convert report to RTF (using a template with preset margins, logo etc). The script is associated with a new device. I have used a non proportional font (courier new) in the template (so that each character is of exactly the same size). By setting appropriate margins and font size in the template, I figured out that 75 lines per page can be printed. That I set in the &quot;Page Length&quot; of the device and that works very well on most of the reports i.e contents for each page are placed on individual pages with correct placement of reports header and footer. Some reports however, are not doing well and their footer is moved to next page (one of these reports is &quot;Shipment Instructions&quot;). This report is have instructions which may be different (in number of lines and text per instruction) for differnt lines and business parteners, etc. <br />
<br />
I think ttstpconv outputs lines in RTF (couting the lines internally) , and when lines equal to &quot;page length -1&quot; have been output, it writes footer, and then outputs the remaining lines till the next page length is reached, and so on. <br />
<br />
Based on this logic, when the report in question (shipment instrcutons)  is printed, some fields perhaps have multiple lines (as instruction text may be of multiple lines), but ttstpconv considers the field value as one line, and hence line count is distrubed. This causes report footer to be printed beyond the set  page kength, and thus all next pages are also effected. <br />
<br />
I tried to associate a paper type (ttaad3110m000) with the report in device parameters, but  those are selectable ONLY when device type is a windows printer, otherwise (which is the case), I have to specify page length on the device setup session (ttaad3500m000).  Setting reports defaults (ttaad3105m00) has also no result.<br />
<br />
The question is: How # of lines per page can be specified for reports when using RTF output, so that report footer is placed appropriately? and which will work for all reports.<br />
<br />
I will appreciate any ideas/workarounds regarding this issue and .<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I found solution 142500, on SSA global support site which sounds releveant. The curretly installed ttstpconv deos not inserts page breaks, thats why I had to set margins appropriately, so that given number of lines may fit on a page. With the solution 142500, If page breaks are inserted by ttstpconv, then I can set page length in device setting so that it leaves room to accomodate additional lines in that case. <br />
<br />
I have not tried installing the update yet. I found another thread, which said about updating ttstpconv, and the script stopped working properly. Is any one any one has idea how this kind of update should be installed, and what steps to take, incase if we need to restore the previous ttstpconv script?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
