<br />
In the session Maintain Chart Manager Application Data (ttchm1100s000) there is the option Application Options (ttchm1120s000) where option could be defined and used in programing. The help for this session ttchm1120s000 says that the options defined could be used for Starting a Session or some other action that can be progarmmed.<br />
<br />
I have defined this option and also available in the Chart Manager, but where do i have to write the program? Is it in choice section of the script. Suppose i want to start a session from this option, how can i program it?<br />
<br />
If anybody can help me......<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
John.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have another problem which is after producing the chart on screen i am not able to print the same on the printer. The only option now is to take a screen shot and put it in MS Power Point slide for printing. Can i get this done directly from Baan. What are the pre-requisites for printing? Are there any hardware requirement to set this up?<br />
<br />
Anyone can help.....<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klixy23</div><div class="date">5th July 2004, 09:22</div></div><div class="posttext">For printing charts you have to install a postscript printer  and driver. I've done this with the Quick guide 1305, which I have only as fax print.<br />
<br />
I just looked in the script and there are no definitions or code for printing. It seems it is standard functionality.<br />
<br />
After pressing the printer button the session ttchm1160m000 pops up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks a million. We followed your instructions and tried the set up in Baan and we have the graph printing directly from Baan. It is a great help and thanks for sharing knowledge.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
It has been long time since I left the customer site where we had developed a lot of graphs in Baan IV c4 and they were awesome. Hence, I am not able to send you a document with the procedure. However, there is a file which me, which was a simple example for the top 10 customers which I had got from one of the members on this forum and I have attached the same with this thread.<br />
<br />
Try this simple example to produce graph of Top 10 customers in Baan and then if you require help in improving your code for other graphs, let me know and I will surely help you on this.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
