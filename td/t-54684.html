I've seen this forum that it's possible to call a client side software and set the baan's report as the input file, so I'm wondering if there's a way to pre-format this report with another external software (for example, some java software at server-side) and then pass it as a input file to the client side software (for example.. scalc.exe, excel.exe).<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avpatil</div><div class="date">9th January 2009, 08:50</div></div><div class="posttext">one easy way to do is create a batch file in the program and then do run.prog. In that batch file you can define all other things like the external program, file name etc....<br />

I used a ttstpconv like program found in this forum to try it . It's a mark_h's script that he uses as a 4GL program to a device. I created a new script/library and could compiled it fine, but when i try to use that output device i get this error message:<br />
process 19 - Error : Can't read session or object (bttstconv2)<br />
How do i make this object visible to the Device ?</div></div><hr />
