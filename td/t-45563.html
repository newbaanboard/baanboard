I have searched on baan board for my specific requirement but havnt been able to find a concrete solution. I'll appreciate if anyone can guide me in doing this:<br />
<br />
I want to create a session in which I can search for business partners based on multiple parameters such as BP Name, Address, Telephone Etc. The session should be activated by clicking the zoom button. The searched BP should then be returned to the original session (session from which zoom button was clicked). <br />
<br />
I have been successful in writing a session that searches for a bussiness partners based on multiple parameters. But the problem is that the results of the search are displayed in a another session. I want to display the results of the search in the same session (session where I enter search parameters) so that I can return the value to the original session (session from which zoom button was clicked).<br />

<br />
Here are the steps you need:<br />
<br />
1) Open Maintain Sessions<br />
2) Go to the Original session that should activate (zoom to) the new session. Make sure you are in the current VRC.<br />
3) Click on Edit (form editor should open)<br />
4) Go to the field that you want to zoom from and edit it.<br />
5) Go to the zoom tab and fill in the name of the session and returned field (see attached image).<br />
6) Save &amp; compile.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps,<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply. You have misinterpretted my problem.<br />
<br />
I am displaying the results of the search in a seperate session. I am not able to figure out a way to display the results of the search in the session in which I enter the search parameters.</div></div><hr />
