As the title says, how to have some conditions for Additional Information to be read-only?<br />
For example, I have an Additional Information field that must not be editable after a certain data is changed to a specific state (status).<br />
I tried looking in the Application Extensibility -&gt; Extension, which I have been using it to customize many components nowadays but it does not seem to have a functionality to do this kind of customization.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">6th February 2018, 10:14</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do that by creating a table extension for tcstl210. Of course you need to check the context of the additional info (e.g. sales orders), but then you can prevent the modification of additional info field.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for your solution. I have one problem according to this.<br />
How can I check the context of the current session that this extension is running on e.g. Sales Order Line. I understand the rest of your point that I have to put the conditions in one of the hooks in the Extension Modeler to make it as required. Please elaborate how can I determine which context it is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">6th February 2018, 10:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You could for example check the main.table$ variable. Note that it is prefixed with a &quot;t&quot;. So you need to do something like:<br />
<br />
if main.table$ = &quot;ttdsls401&quot; then<br />
      ....<br />
endif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you again for your help.<br />
It works well for the requirement I have but there is another extra thing that might cause a problem.<br />
It is the [EXTENDED FIELDS] button after the Additional Information field.<br />
Even though the field is read-only now by the help of Extension so the field cannot be edited via the field itself, but when clicking the button that I mentioned earlier to go inside and modify the field in that specific place, the user can change the value of the Additional Information field remotely.<br />
Any advice?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">6th February 2018, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case main.table$ has another value (ttcstl210). You need to import the main table of the calling session and check that one.</div></div><hr />

I don't quite understand what you explained. Could you kindly provide me with more details please? I am a beginner at this. I am very sorry.<br />

To know whether you should make things readonly, you must check values of the parent session. You can import those values.</div></div><hr />
