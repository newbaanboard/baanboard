<br />
Can you provide some more information, like how many times the control goes in selectdo and how many time function rprt_send is called. Only one record is printed then which record is getting printed, the first or the last?<br />
<br />
Also can you cross check how many records are present in the table. Because as per the query you mentioned, there is no where condition, it means it will print all the records in the table.<br />
<br />
In this case the best practice according to me would be inserting required table fields in detail layout and them printing the report.<br />
<br />

2. defined  field wise  , but same result<br />
3. no conditions  define ( where condition)<br />
4. in table 15 records available<br />
5. in detail layout defined required fileds only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">9th August 2011, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Post the actual code and maybe a screen shot of the layouts and the fields.  Does the selectdo look 15 times? You can put it in debug and check that.  Maybe even add a message to see which item(or key field) it is processing.  If it is looping 15 times then the problem is in the report - check the output expression and make sure it is reading in all 15 records.  You can put the report in debug mode and even go out and check the temp file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello,<br />
as Mark suggest post your code and reportlayout.<br />
<br />
Sortfields at report ?<br />
Before fields ?<br />
<br />
aso.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan999</div><div class="date">15th August 2011, 07:58</div></div><div class="posttext">header and detail only defined in report layout. no before /after field . no questions of sort .<br />
<br />
simple drag and drop from the table field</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">15th August 2011, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay the report script is looping, now debug the report.  It should read all the records and print them.  Other than that without posting some screen shots of the report layouts and such there is not much more we can do.</div></div><hr />
