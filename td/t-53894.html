tdlit130.cart which is a date field and i'm trying to get the default set to current system date.  Should I try and set this in the script editor or in the table tdlit130?  Also how would I do this?  I've tried utc.date() and a few other things but nothing is working.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

Sorry for the silly questions but i've basically been thrown into baan programming with no erp experience whatsoever.  It's a whole new world.  I keep getting error when I try to use date() function saying im not referencing it.  Since i'm not familiar with baan I don't know how to fix this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you go to form editor select the date field from the layout which should open the session ttadv3101s000, check the default field and type the value date. This should show you the default date as today's date. You can also store the current date in the script using date.num().<br />

Did you type &quot;date&quot; in the form editor after checking the default field?<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
in form editor :<br />
<br />
If the field is of type DATE the default value can be:   <br />
                                                                         <br />
          date(YYYY,MM,DD) : to have a specific date as default.    <br />
          date()           : to have the current date as default.         <br />
          date +n          : to have the current date + n as default.   <br />
          date -n          : to have the current date - n as default.    <br />
<br />
Zoom             : No                    Default         : Yes    date()<br />
