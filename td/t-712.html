<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">outra9e</div><div class="date">7th January 2002, 12:36</div></div><div class="posttext">We are creating two new tables for BaaN, of which there will be the relevant sessions generated.<br />
<br />
I have a question about thye naming conventions for both the tables and sessions.<br />
<br />
The tables are to be for the service module under service and maintanence.<br />
<br />
I have had a look at the tables and established in my mind that the names for the tables should be tssma330b40oliv0 and tssma331b40oliv0.<br />
<br />
Will naming them this cause any problems and are there any issues I need to consider for naming the sessions?  Should I name the sessions the same as the tables?<br />
<br />
The naming convention that I have used is the standard BaaN naming convention but I would like to have this confirmed before I go ahead with creating the table definitions.<br />
<br />
Cheers guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">7th January 2002, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always used the following naming convention for tables:<br />
<br />
tt xxx 000<br />
<br />
tt = the package such as tc or ts<br />
xxx = the module such as com or sma<br />
000 = a sequential number <br />
<br />
I have alway set my table numbering starting from 900 eg. tssma900 so that it will not interfere with any tables baan may introduce.  <br />
<br />
As for session naming, this works as follows:<br />
<br />
tt xxx 9y99m000<br />
<br />
tt = package<br />
xxx = module<br />
y = session type = 4 for print session, 5 for display session<br />
999 = the table number<br />
000 = sequence number<br />
<br />
if your table is tssma905 and you are creating a display session the your session code will be tssma9505m000.  Another display session for the same table will be tssma9505m001<br />
<br />
A good way to distinguish customised session from standard baan sessions is to do add a c in the first character of the sequnce number in the session code eg.<br />
<br />
tssma9505mc00<br />
tssma9505mc01<br />
<br />
If have also seen this done:<br />
<br />
tssmac505m000<br />
<br />
I hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariaC</div><div class="date">7th January 2002, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">That should be fine, you could maybe try using the 800 range instead if you like.  It's up to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">outra9e</div><div class="date">7th January 2002, 16:40</div></div><div class="posttext">i have tried to use the domain tt yeno but it has given me an error saying no integration with package tt!!<br />

Help!!  any ideas...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">francishsu</div><div class="date">7th January 2002, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Excerpt from the Baan IV Development 1 Training manual:<br />
<br />
Coding of tables:<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Ranges for customization types:<br />
c (customization by dealer) 901-935<br />
l (localization) 936-950<br />
b (business-specific version) 951-965<br />
d (dealier-specific version) 966-980<br />
j (junior compact version) 981-985<br />
o (own development by customer) 986-995<br />
<br />
So if you're developing customizations for your own company, it's recommended to use the 986-995 range, if possible.  Also, Baan is not violating their own recommended standard by ending a table in 999, since only 901-995 are reserved for other parties.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">toolswizard</div><div class="date">11th January 2002, 21:09</div></div><div class="posttext">In your original post you table names are to long.  I can only assume that this was either the package VRC or session name that you were trying to create.<br />
<br />
If it is the vrc you should really have the release in the middle like B40Oc3liv0.<br />
<br />
If it is sessions that you are creating for a NEW table it should be as stated in the Software Coding STandards.<br />
<br />
pp = package code<br />
<br />
mmm = module code<br />
<br />
s = submodule code.  This is the first character of the table.  It is called submodule to group like tables/functions together.  Like all sales order tables could start with 4 and all commision tables/sessions start with 1.  So when you go to move objects they can be grouped.<br />
<br />
f = function code.<br />
  1 = maintenance (and display baan v)<br />
  2 = processing<br />
  3 = reserved<br />
  4 = print<br />
  5 = display only<br />
  6 = reserved<br />
  7 = graph<br />
  8 = auxilary<br />
  9 = conversion<br />
<br />
o = type of process<br />
  m = main baan iv, multi line baan v<br />
  s  = sub baan iv, single baan v<br />
<br />
y = session session number;  if more than one session is present for the same main table, this sequence number can be used to define the different sessions, starting with 0.  Usually baan assigned.<br />
<br />
cc = customixation type.  This would be used when you are customizing a standard baan session, that you were going to use along with baan standard sessions.  IE if you were going to split some functionality out from the standard, or were going to add a new session for additional functionality, that following standards would be named the same as a standard baan program.  If you are customizing a standard program, and would not need to run the standard. you would not have to rename it.  After all that is what VRC's are for, to store your customizations.</div></div><hr />
