I want to add attacment to my form. I think that How can I construct it ?<br />
I find some ways, but I am not sure about it. I imagine that I should create a shared directory on fileserver for attachment files.(it shouldn't be Baan server because of disk space)  Then I should use run.program()  function in my program. after that I should read from remote fileserver where files are.<br />
These files can be doc,jpg,xls,cad drawing files and like that. Which command should I use to open them. <br />
<br />
This is my thinking to achieve ATTACHMENT on FORM. Is there anyone to know how I can find myway ? Is my opinion correct ?<br />
<br />
Thank you ALL for your suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">27th January 2006, 05:27</div></div><div class="posttext">That is how I would do it.  I would put everything in a common directory. Actually I think if you define on the client which program to run with something like .jpg then you can just run the file itself.  My other thought is if you know which program has which attachment then you can just launch the program with the file.  For example: In Maintain BOM which user clicks attachment it would run program autocad partnumber.cad.  Where part number is which ever make part they are editing.  Then if they are in the item master and they click attachment it would run program photoshop partnumber.jpg.  Just a thought or two.</div></div><hr />

you can built your own application based on your it-infrastructure.<br />
I have done it for documents to our BaaN items.<br />
<br />
Take a MS-Based Serverdirectorystructure to save the documents.<br />
Built a BaaN application to define the date stored for a item.<br />
<br />
Starting with the graphical bom it ends of showing a pdf, jpg, doc to the user.<br />
<br />
Some screenshots i've attached.<br />
<br />
Otherwise use a document managment system.<br />
<br />

Thanks for your suggestions.</div></div><hr />
