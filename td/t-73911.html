I want to filter out 0 value invoices in the range of Invoices which are currently getting printed. I dont want to print invoice with 0 value. Is there any way? I tried to end program in after.receive.data section of report script, but it works fine only for 1 record selected and printed, not for range. I tried to set a rule in DOCMAN, but again it fails for range. In DOCMAN I have set up 2 rules - if invoice value is 0 then report is not sent to any email, if it has value, read the logic and sent mail. But it is not called for each record in range. <br />
<br />
1 more query - can we add filter to existing print sessions through extensibility? How do we filter data in report extension based on new calculated fields added to session extension? <br />
Note: I do not have standard source code.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th June 2021, 21:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably a better way to do this - but before.layout of each section you could test if the invoice value is 0 and just skip that layout.  Something like this in the report script - probably better methods for ln, but I did this in a few 4c4 reports to get them to print the way we wanted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Header.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
    if inv.amnt = 0 then<br />
       attr.print =false<br />
    endif<br />
<br />
datail.1:<br />
before.layout:<br />
    if inv.amnt = 0 then<br />
       attr.print =false<br />
    endif</div></div><hr />

Hii,<br />
<br />
One easiest solution is, You can use this condition in Output Expression of Report Layout (Report layout -&gt; Detail -&gt; Output Expression)<br />
Value &lt;&gt; 0<br />
<br />
On above expression, Only those lines will display who has not equal to Zero value.<br />
