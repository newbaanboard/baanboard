<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jens Herbers</div><div class="date">19th August 2020, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I found a statement in the Infor Dev Guide 10.7.<br />
Explains that we are avoid using select on index like “where tdsls401._index1 = {:rep.orno, :rep.pono}“.<br />
<br />
I’m interested what you think about these Infor statement.<br />
<br />
Here the statement.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Publication Information<br />
Release: Infor LN 10.7.x<br />
Publication Date: July 16, 2020<br />
Document code: ln_10.7.x_lnstudextdg__en-us<br />
<br />
Best practices:<br />
To reduce the risk that your extensions are not compatible with newer versions of LN, we recommend<br />
that you comply with the rules.<br />
<br />
Database<br />
Queries<br />
The LN development team has the responsibility to keep the data model compatible. Sometimes it is<br />
required to change indexes. We recommend that you do not refer to indexes, but to the fields directly.<br />
See these code examples:<br />
• This syntax is incorrect because it refers to an index:<br />
<br />
function extern void tdsls401.read()<br />
{<br />
 select tdsls401.*<br />
 from tdsls401<br />
 where tdsls401._index1 = {:rep.orno, :rep.pono}<br />
 selectdo<br />
 endselect<br />
}<br />
<br />
• Instead, use this syntax, which refers to the fields directly:<br />
<br />
function extern void tdsls401.read()<br />
{<br />
 select tdsls401.*<br />
 from tdsls401<br />
 where tdsls401.orno = :rep.orno<br />
 and tdsls401.pono = :rep.pono<br />
 selectdo<br />
 endselect<br />
}</div></div><hr />

So from then I on (until we quit using baan) I always tried to use the _index if I had the information.  What I can't remember if was where the break down was - but with the _index in the query it was forcing it to use the correct index.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th August 2020, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">As a matter of fact - on the infor site I would look for some optimization and performance guides.  The ones I have are very dated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">martin.f</div><div class="date">4th December 2020, 14:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Mark,<br />
so what is best pratice. Using the index if possible or just always adressing the column directly?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Martin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">4th December 2020, 15:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure about LN - and our 4c4 is not used much anymore.  I still believe using the index helps.  I still mostly recall the issue - we had a query that called for 2 fields, those 2 fields were in an index as position 1 and 2.  To fix the performance issue we did _index = {:field1,:field2}.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhushanchanda</div><div class="date">4th December 2020, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to avoid any confusions, the guide you are referring to is &quot;Infor LN Extensions Development Guide&quot;, so this recommendation is only for extension development and not for overall LN development practice. It's always better to use Indexes. If there are any changes to table indexes, a good practice is to make the code changes wherever needed.</div></div><hr />
