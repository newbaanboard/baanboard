I know this must be easy but....<br />
<br />
I have a custom session that we use for tracking projects.  Tab 1 is a maintenance screen for the project.  On tab 2 I want to link a Sales Order display session.  On that screen (The Sales Order Display) is an edit button that will allow maintenance of some custom fields in tdsls040. <br />
<br />
Both the display session and edit session were created using start option 7 and they work together.  The problem is I have been unsuccessful in getting the main session call the second one and then allow the edit button to work without opening new session windows.  Also once closed the tab functionality stops working.<br />
<br />
How is the best way to create the links?<br />
<br />
Thanks,:confused:</div></div><hr />

What do you mean &quot;Also once closed the tab functionality stops working.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you mean that the first form is not accessible once second form is clicked?<br />
<br />
In that case click on the &quot;standard options&quot; of form and make sure you have ticked option choice nos 26 27 28 &amp; 29 (First , Next , Previous ,Last)<br />

With a little bit of tweaking it will work for me.  I don't think my endusers will pick up on the hocus-pocus!<br />
