<br />
From the Form fields you can get the information of the zoomed sessions calles from here, but what about the ones called by the program? or Option Buttons?<br />
<br />
Is there any way to get all this information from one place (report or table)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help on the subject!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

Refer to - Pragma codes (preprocessor) (http://www.baanboard.com/programmers_manual_baanerp_help_3gl_features_pragma_codes_preprocessor)<br />
<br />
Where-used list<br />
<br />
In some cases the where-used list is not updated automatically. For example, when a session code is entered but not expected:<br />
<br />
message(&quot;ttadv2130m000&quot;)<br />
      or<br />
      bms.send(&quot;command&quot;, event, &quot;ttaad3100m000&quot;, pr.id)<br />
<br />
To put this session code into the where-used list, enter the following command line:<br />
<br />
#pragma used session      ttadv2130m000<br />
<br />
The following example illustrates the pragma codes to update the where-used list:<br />
<br />
#pragma used include    &lt;file&gt;<br />
#pragma used table      &lt;table code&gt;<br />
#pragma used field      &lt;field code&gt;<br />
#pragma used domain     &lt;domain code&gt;<br />
#pragma used message    &lt;message code&gt;<br />
#pragma used question   &lt;question code&gt;<br />
#pragma used session    &lt;session code&gt;<br />
#pragma used menu       &lt;menu code&gt;<br />
#pragma used dll        &lt;dll objectname&gt;<br />
#pragma used chart      &lt;chart code&gt;<br />
<br />
Usually the where-used list is updated. In the case of functions, the where-used list is updated if the function call contains the string value. For example:<br />
<br />
mess(&quot;ttadvs0000&quot;, 1)      | Where-used list will be updated<br />
<br />
str = &quot;ttadvs0000&quot;<br />
mess(str, 1)                       | Where-used list will not be updated<br />
<br />
#pragma used message ttadvs0000</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me that in somecases even Baan does not follow this structure.  I know I only do it in my API sessions.  I do it there so when the DEM flows are generated they get permissions to the session.  There have been a couple of cases on my QKEY sessions where I have to go in and manually add a pragma used session. Again this is for the DEM flow generator.  With Qkey it auto generates all of the pragma statements from ttadv237 - and some are missing for whatever reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baan_user</div><div class="date">3rd May 2007, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a similar requirement (for SOX audit). It is surprising that baan does not have a standard report listing subsessions for a main session. <br />
<br />
I have logged a case with baan and no one in baan knows the answer to this basic requirement. <br />
<br />
The baan support response was &quot;You can use the so called where-used tables with are ttadv237, ttadv238, ttadv244, this tables are used for subsession authorization and from those you can generate the report.&quot;</div></div><hr />
