While executing any session in the debug mode, there is a warning in the debug box -<br />
<br />
WARNING: Source file &quot;&lt;program script&gt;&quot; more recent than object file.<br />
<br />
This message is always there, ir-respective of the creation date of program script.<br />
<br />
Any idea, why this message appears!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesnt depend on the creation date/time.<br />
<br />
you get that error when the last modified time of script &gt; than the last modified time of the object. That means there was a source change and the script wasnt compiled.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I did not mean creation date/time. I meant modification date/time.<br />
And this is not an error, just a warning message, and APPEARS in every script executed in the debug mode!! Even if the script is changed AND compiled, this DOES appear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">9th April 2003, 12:30</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this also has to do with the caching under NT / Windows...<br />
<br />
If you change the script, compile in debug (A), run in debug, change the script, recompile in debug (B), run in debug, at that time you may well discover that you run object (A) instead of object (B) the second time, this was cached by the ntbshell. Restart ntbshell (logoff and login again) and run again to obtain object (B). If the object (A) is cached in shared mem too, then you must restart shared mem too, if object (A) is cached in OS read cache, then reboot the server.</div></div><hr />

There could be a possibility of such case. But, I have checked the scripts in the debug mode, both before making the changes and after making the changes. There is no case of caching.<br />
Also, currently I am working on NT platform, but when I worked on UNIX platform, I think (I am not sure!!) I did see this warning there too!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">9th April 2003, 13:39</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the (exact) FileSystem date of program script and object?<br />
What is the message you get when you modify the object date to a later time than the program script?<br />
<br />
If the timestamps are equal you may get the message, if they are different then there should be only a message if the pfile is newer then the o file.<br />
<br />
The warning indeed is not of high importance, may be discarded. But it is annoying if it is given when you did nothing wrong :-)</div></div><hr />
