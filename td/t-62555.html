<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anant desai</div><div class="date">26th June 2012, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the following piece of code:<br />
<br />
Select tdsls045.orno,tdsls045.ssls<br />
from tdsls045<br />

group by tdsls045.orno,tdsls045.ssls<br />
order by  tdsls045.orno,tdsls045.ssls<br />
<br />
The code works when I run it as a Query<br />
but not in the program script.<br />
What am I doing wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">26th June 2012, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Does your code have a selectdo and endselect in the script?<br />

If it does is there another error message from compiling?  Can you post the whole script?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The field tdsls045.orno will be having an unique value. There wont be any repeatation to the value, so Group by for that field is not need.<br />
<br />
And for tdsls045.ssls gives the value '1' as you mentioned as condition, so it will return only the value '1'. so Group by for that field too not need. <br />
<br />
You can give tdsls045.orno in Order by, order by for ssls is also not need.<br />
<br />
I guess SQL can manage all these things and gives some value which baansql doesnt.<br />
<br />
Check by giving the following query in script,<br />
<br />
           select tdsls045.orno,tdsls045.ssls<br />
           from tdsls045<br />
           where tdsls045.ssls = 1<br />
           order by  tdsls045.orno<br />
<br />

Hello,<br />
i've done something like yours in BIV :<br />
<br />
<br />
	select	tdsls045.*, tdsls040.refb, tdsls041.*, tccom010.nama,<br />
		tcmcs023.dsca, tdsls040.refa, tdsls040.eono<br />
	from	tdsls045, tdsls040, tdsls041, tccom010<br />
	Where	tdsls045._index2 inrange {:ssls.f, :cuno.f, :orno.f} and<br />
					{:ssls.t, :cuno.t, :orno.t} and<br />
		tdsls045.item between :item.f and :item.t and<br />
		tdsls045.ddat between :ddat.f and :ddat.t and<br />
		tdsls041.citg between :citg.f and :citg.t and<br />
		tdsls041.ddta between :ddta.f and :ddta.t and<br />
		tdsls040.refb between :emno.f and :emno.t and<br />
		tdsls045.orno refers to tdsls040 and<br />
		tdsls045.cmba refers to tdsls041 and<br />
		tdsls045.cuno refers to tccom010 and<br />
		tdsls041.citg refers to tcmcs023  |and<br />
	order by	tdsls045.ssls,tdsls041.citg,tdsls041.ddta,<br />
			tdsls045.cuno,tdsls045.item,tdsls045.orno<br />
	selectdo	<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">28th June 2012, 00:58</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with jaapjd - this is weird.  What kind of session and script is this?  Can you attach the complete script.  There could be other queries involved or something in the report causing the issue.  Assuming this is a report the first thing I would do is comment out everything, but this and run it in debug mode until I got this piece working:<br />
<br />
select tdsls045.orno,tdsls045.ssls<br />
from tdsls045<br />
where tdsls045.ssls = 1<br />
<br />
because until you get this working the rest will not work.  Unless there is something wrong with the data, which you will have to confirm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anant desai</div><div class="date">28th June 2012, 06:05</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the script working fine and selecting only<br />
records with tdsls045.ssls = 1. The problem is<br />
the type of session - Display Session. The form<br />
type is 2 (multi-occurence) and main table is<br />
tdsls040. I tried display.curr.occ() but that didn't<br />
seem to help. It returns all records in the main table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaapJD</div><div class="date">28th June 2012, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">In a type-2 session you should not use queries to filter the records being displayed. Use query.extension.</div></div><hr />
