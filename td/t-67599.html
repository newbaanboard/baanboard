I would like to change the capital size to have bigger letters. So I've found that I must Change the cpi vom 17,1 to 12 for example. So I've changed this value in the report property in the register &quot;special&quot; for the font Option: small (cgi 17,1) to middle (cgi 12).<br />
 But it doesn't works. <br />
 Next was, I reduced the number of columns from 215 to 150 for the Report layouts with the Output Expression = 1.<br />
 But this additional Change also doesn't helps.<br />
 What can I do next or how can I resize the font?<br />
<br />
 Best Regards<br />

I do not know anything about your version, so wait for someone that does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in Infor 10.2.1 the Display-Printer is a PDF-Format. So changing cpi from 17,1 to 12 has no effect. But when I reduced the column number from 215 to 178 the printing was automatically resized to the full paper. But I also have to do this for the not displayed section which have the &quot;Output Expression = 0&quot;. If one section with Output Expression = 0 is still 215 col wide then it does not work.<br />
<br />
How it will work on a real Printer is not clear, but I only develop for the pdf-printing. So I must'n care about nothing else.<br />
