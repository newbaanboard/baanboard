<br />
I just recently joined the forum and i need some help from you all,<br />
<br />
here's the case:<br />
<br />
system : LN 6.1 FP3<br />
<br />
i want to make a report with the SQL queries thru the ttadv3580m000, i already made the layout and the data is correct.<br />
<br />
but there's one problem, there are no zooming in my report parameter, if there's no zooming in my report it means that the user need to know each of the order number that he/she wants to print.<br />
<br />
so, is there any way for me to edit the form? it seems i can't edit the tools session, or is there any way for me to add the zoom in the sql report?<br />
<br />
any suggestion and links will be a great help.<br />
<br />
Cheers and regards,<br />
<br />
Roy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to add a zoom field in print session then,<br />
<br />
You can edit the form and add &quot;to&quot; and &quot;from&quot; table fields and you hav to write sql in program script of that print session inorder to force the report to read the data from corresponding fields.<br />
This is one of the solutions.<br />
try it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't get it clear either. Is the zoom fields you want related to the print session? Zoom comes in the session not in the report. in the report you can get the zoomed-to values from the session.<br />
<br />
Can you post a screen shot of the print session you are talking about and mention the fields that you need. Also if you have written any code, we would like to see it.<br />

<br />
<br />
Thank you for the fast reply,<br />
<br />
before i tried with the sql data session i already tried with the session and programming script, but the result is very strange, the only record that correct is the first record, the other is either zero for number and blank for item, so i think i want to try with the sql queries, because i'm more familiar with sql language than the 4gl baan script.<br />
<br />
i already read the programming guide but perhaps i missed something<br />
<br />
this is the report script,<br />
<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
	table 	twhinh200<br />
	table 	twhinh220<br />
	table 	ttccom130<br />
	table 	ttcibd001<br />
	extern domain tcsern	sernc<br />
	extern domain tcitem	itemc<br />
	extern domain tcpono	ponoc<br />
	extern domain tcmcs.str100m lncus<br />
	extern domain tcdsca	dscac<br />
<br />
header.10:<br />
before.layout:<br />
	select whinh220.oset:sernc,whinh220.item:itemc,whinh220.pono:ponoc<br />
	from whinh220<br />
	left outer join whinh200<br />
	on whinh220.oorg =:whinh200.orno and whinh220.orno =:whinh200.orno and whinh220.oset =:whinh200.oset<br />
	selectdo<br />
	endselect<br />
<br />
i think the problem is either on the queries relation or the report layout.<br />
<br />
<br />
any suggestion is a grand^^.<br />

<br />
My bad with words i think^^,<br />
<br />
what i meant with sql data is the ttadv3580m000 and after i created the report i'm using the specific-&gt;run query, the session that appeared seems to be default and i can't change it.<br />
<br />
correction will be honored^^,<br />

It is not hard.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you already have a relevant session or do you need a new one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elrodyn</div><div class="date">17th October 2008, 18:16</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i will try again to use the session.<br />
<br />
by the way, how's my syntax? i'm not sure about the table relation one....i still can't understand the difference between table a = table b and table a =:table b<br />
