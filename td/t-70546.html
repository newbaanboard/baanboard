<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st November 2017, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">We just setup a new company with a new porting sent and license manager on Solaris 11.  When we try to compile a program we get an  &quot;Fatal error cannot open pacc fd file for b40c_prd&quot;.  We checked the fd6.1 files out in $BSE/lib and they are wide open right now (more so that our normal test companies).  We get nothing in any of the log files. All of the directory structures are open also to the BSP user and group.  Any clue what else we can check?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you could try logging from bw configuration:<br />
-- -keeplog -logfile /tmp/files.log -dbgfdev -dbgfile<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd November 2017, 13:47</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a good idea.  Going to have to look for some other options to try to set with that.  It logs a lot of stuff but nothing with an error in it - seems to be a whole bunch of this.  I almost think he needs to rebuild the DD, but that worries me since he has always been a file edit type of admin.<br />

<br />
another idea: Are you able to compile from command line?<br />
e.g. bic6.1 test.bc -o test.obj<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">2nd November 2017, 15:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually what I just did for a test was copy the fd6.1.B40C_prd file to fd6.2.B40C_prd - the compile actually tried to work.  So I poked around some more and I see in $BSE/lib bic6.2 - I do not even see bic6.1.  So when I compile it shows up as bic6.1, but in $BSE/lib I see nothing but 6.2 objects.  I included a screen shot of the last compile that almost worked.<br />
<br />
I am beginning to think the company is only half way converted to the new licensing manager and porting set.  I actually think the compile would have worked if he gave me prd permission to the test compile object.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">7th November 2017, 23:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually günther I was able to compile just using the &quot;real&quot; 6.2 binary.  And trying what you recommended got us pointed to what I actually think is the problem - qkey installed in the environment.  Waiting to get that removed so I can try normal compiles.  And then see if we can find a solution for our qkey sessions for that portingset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">14th December 2017, 00:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - long story short.  We had in-install qkey and then install a patch (not sure which one) that updated all the include files.  Once that was done we could compile normally with out qkey.  Then when we put qkey back in it broke the compile again with the same error message.  Then I fixed it (I guess you could say) by just copying the fd6.1 b40c_prd file to fd6.2 b40c_prd.  Note sure (nor would I recommend) I like the solution.  But we only have to last another year (so they say) on baan.</div></div><hr />
