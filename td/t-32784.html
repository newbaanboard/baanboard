<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metropoj</div><div class="date">15th March 2007, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read that adding colours to baan session is nearly impossiblw ( without the Nazdaq solution ). <br />
<br />
The icons on Baan session for Searching, Saving/Exit, right and left arrow, etc, are they editable at all ?<br />
<br />
I have changed all the menu gifs to Red but would like to highlight something in a session for the same thing ...<br />
<br />
<br />
We have a scenario where one of our companies uses an older baan system and occasionally has the old server and the new server up on the screen at the same time. I was hoping to change these icons in paint to make sure they don't mess up  :) ...<br />
<br />
Thoughts ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have changed most to RED from the original and it shows up nicely ...  Hopefully the user will also notice it and not enter data into historical  :) ...<br />
<br />
Now, If only I could get Baan to read in a folder location depending on what company is active at the time, i would be all set. Each company on same server would have a different colour set of icons in different folders ( selectable by company ) without the add on packages ...  :) ..<br />
<br />
Oh well, baby steps ..  :) ...</div></div><hr />
