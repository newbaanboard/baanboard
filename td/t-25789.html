It looks like you are trying to write directly to /home and not your home directy.  Not sure if the {}'s are needed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st December 2005, 18:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay - the attached created a file called hollanma.csv in my home directory.  We are on Baan 4c4 using sun solaris boxes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you help me out ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">1st December 2005, 19:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Notice that my &quot;LOGNAME&quot; is in caps.  When I used ${logname}.csv it created a file called $logname.csv.  Check and make sure you have permissions to create files in your home directory.  I am not seeing anything else that could be causing the problem - maybe it could be something in 5c or the tools version.  Also try removing the : after ascii - don't think that is it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use a specific device for opening my document with word. <br />
<br />
4GL : ttstpconv<br />
argument : RTF:winword.exe<br />
path : ??? I know ${LOGNAME} but another parameters exists ? and where I will find them ?<br />
<br />
I would like knowing wich parameters the path is able to read in Maintain data device (ttaad3100m000) ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">23rd February 2006, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">When I see ${} I think of my UNIX shell environment variables.  I just run csh and do setenv and view them.  You can actually create your own environment variables with your BWC login.  We use -- -set SITE=comp# to tell our exchange schemes were the data files are located - the path has ${SITE}.  So I assume NT has something equivalent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe its much clearer to use the term &quot;environment variables&quot; instead of &quot;parameters&quot;? UNIX enivironment is case sensitive, i.e. $HOME is different to $home (which is quite unusual).<br />
<br />
To see the defined environment variables, you can use a UNIX window an use the command 'env'. You can also run the baan terminal emulator (e.g. from the menu browser, use File / Run Program ... / Program Session = &quot;sh&quot;, Run External Program [x]) as well.<br />
<br />
To define additional environment variables, you can use &quot;-- -set VARIABLE=VALUE&quot; from bw client; and you can also setup additional variables on the server side.<br />
