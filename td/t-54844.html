<br />
We are on BAAN IV c4 in5 SP21. We would like to know the functions to be used and the method for developing a session which could display multi company reports related to stocks, sales and purchase for users who do not have multi-company access, i.e. they have got access to single companies only.<br />
<br />
Any one having a sample script and willing to share can post the copy on baanboard and / or send a copy of the same to kvarma-icc@modi.com or k_varma@sify.com.<br />

But it's  not at all difficult from within baan. U need to add ._Compnr conditions in the select clause like <br />
<br />
<br />
	select	tfgld106.*<br />
	from	tfgld106<br />
	where   tfgld106._index3 = {:tmpleac}<br />
	and 	tfgld106.oyer = :year.f<br />
	and 	tfgld106.fprd between :prd.f and :prd.t<br />
	and 	tfgld106._compnr = :company.number<br />
	order by tfgld106._index3<br />
<br />
<br />
U can get all group companies from tfgld001 . <br />
<br />
Beware,u should select only companies with same package combination. Further there are some logical limitations on use of ._compnr clause in select . Please go through baan help for the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for your feed-back. Basically we are looking to develop a session using which we are able to provide multi-logistic company report related to Sales / Purchase and Inventory. But the user would be having access to a single company only. Will the script take care of this issue also. We have tried to make a data consolidation program using the compnr function, but it is not able to access the data from Companies for which the user has not been given access to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">27th January 2009, 14:47</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the way the company authorizations works and u too dont want user to access unauthorized companies. Either make the user super user or  give him/her  that company authorization . Then only program will select records across companies .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prashant</div><div class="date">3rd February 2009, 08:37</div></div><div class="posttext">hi...<br />
You may also use <br />
switch.to.company()<br />
for example<br />
switched.comp = switch.to.company(company)<br />
<br />
Hope this will help u.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume  switch.to.company() needs company permission also.<br />
<br />
Workaround : Try this,<br />
1.Set user default company - in maintain user data<br />
2.Remove Change company session permission.<br />
3.Then try switch.to.company() in Program scripts.<br />
<br />
Hitesh's Logic must work for you.!! (that worked for me).<br />
