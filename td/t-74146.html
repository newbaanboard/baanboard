 I created a library in IVc4. During normal compilation, there is no error message. But when selecting &quot;Compile + Debug&quot;, this kind of error occurred:<br />
<br />
Fatal Error ： Function 'XXXXXXX' too large.<br />
<br />
I searched the forum, but did not see anything similar to mine.I checked the &quot;known limits&quot; section in ivc4 manual, and I don't know if the &quot;maximum branch of BIC.&quot; limit has been exceeded. It says this: <br />
<br />
-  maximum BRANCH of 32K <br />
   BRANCH means the part of generated object code per function,including macros etc.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, then I don't understand why the error is reported only when &quot;Compile + Debug&quot;, but everything is normal when compiling.<br />
If debugging is not possible, the library cannot be used. So how should I solve this problem? Split this function?<br />
<br />
    Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Probably what I would do is first comment out the function and try compile + debug again.  See if I got a new error.  Then I would probably start looking at the function and maybe just commenting out pieces of it.  I am not sure what maybe the cause of the error.  Maybe post the function here and maybe someone can see something wrong with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alibaba</div><div class="date">19th December 2021, 18:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for your suggestion Mark. and sorry that my code is too long to post on the forum. My function is a CASE structure with 20 branches. After adding a new branch today, the aforementioned error occurred.<br />
As you said, if I comment out the newly added part of the code, no error will be reported when compile + debug. I think may have reached the memory limit of a single function base on current BIC. Now I split the function and moved some processing units out of the function. Now I no longer report errors when compile + debug. Thank you again for your timely help every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fatal error: Function '&lt;function&gt;' too large - when compiling in Debugger<br />
Functions have the following constraints: Maximum 255 arguments per function <br />
Maximum 32K variables per compilation <br />
Maximum BRANCH of 32K (BRANCH refers...function (branch)....<br />
The 32k branch limit is what is encountered in this case. <br />
Compiling in debug mode adds extra information<br />
