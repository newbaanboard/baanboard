<br />
hope some one can guide me.<br />
<br />
presently we have a facility where all the lines present in the form  are printed. now, the user wants to print only selected lines in the form.<br />
how can we sent only selected data to report?<br />
Are there any specific commands for this purpose?<br />
<br />
Thanking you in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi Hitesh,<br />
<br />
Thank you, i have am able to select the records. But if my records are more in number i am not able to select first &amp; last record at the same time.<br />
<br />
For example if i have 48 data records, the form is able to accomodate only 38 out of 48(after expanding the form). in this case if i am using mark.table i am unable to select records present in different pages. Is there any way around or is it a limitation of mark.table?<br />
<br />
Thanking you in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
I once had came across similar requiremnt.<br />
<br />
In this case I made it up by declaring a dynamic array and storing the key values of the selected record in the array field as soon as the record is selected.<br />
<br />
And then scanned the complete array when reported was needed to be printed. At the same time also initialized the array to blank values.<br />
<br />
I also tried to find out some other option to achieve the reqired output, but was not able to find any.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Other multiple selections running into multiple screen can be done by dynamic array or updating  the same in a temp table. Using dynamic array is a better and speedy way to do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MilindV</div><div class="date">26th April 2011, 20:26</div></div><div class="posttext">One things that needs to be taken care with dynamic array is, when user wants to unselects records. Say user has selected 40-50 records, now he has to unselect 10-15, then you need to remove those records from dynamic array. For this have to traverse entire array for for every record unselected.<br />
<br />
If possible, add a field(tgyenox/tcyesno) in table, show it on session. let user check this field for printing the record. If not, then use dynamic array keeping mind above condition.</div></div><hr />

:) I think this is the best alternative to use check box for each of the reacord. You can use it as a multioccurance field. It will be easier with check box to select / unselect records to be printed. But here the drawback is that you can not select multiple check boxes at a time. eg. If you want to select 1 to 10 records then you need to select checkbox for 10 times which is quite iritating.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitesh Shah</div><div class="date">27th April 2011, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally multi-select is required on dimensions / fields which are part of baan standard . In that case modifying standard tables for enabling tcyesno/tgyenox is not an advisable option.<br />
<br />
Further editing yesno / yenox fields also are cumbersome .<br />
<br />
We have 1 single table created for such  custom selections user wise with user +  field + serial in index . A front end session is created which displays all available  fields and on marking /unmarking , selections are inserted /deleted in custom table . Marking as compared to editing is mre comfortable to users.<br />
<br />
Further even with dynamic array de-selections  can be done by re-assigning de-selected array value min/max value , re-sorting the and re-allocating the array with 1 less element. <br />
<br />
Further my own remark that dynamic array method will be fast is misleading and is influenced by other fact that in-memory transformation using array far more faster that disk based data transformation . Such multi-selects are normally used to run query on transactions table . And running same query with different element values is  a good disk based overhead on overall program trhoughput . Instead custom table based selections can easily be joined in transaction table reducing the sql query  parse/exec overhead to  one number only as against multiple  number  as may be required . In baan sql arrays can not be used except other wise in IN clause in dynamic query and that too may be for somewhat limited set of  values . So custom table based multi-select also can give good throughput in many situations in view of this . We use multi-select substantially  on many fields based on custom table  and not  arrays since many years though we use arrays extensively for data summarization.</div></div><hr />
