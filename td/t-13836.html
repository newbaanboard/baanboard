        Today we had a strange problem starting some sessions in baan. &quot;Maintain Item data&quot; for example, if you double click on that session it would hand right at the little window that pops up before the session actually opened. Most of other session were working fine. What we found out that, when we started a session (&quot;Maintain Item data&quot; in this example), the license of that user was getting terminated. In other words, when I login to baan I could see that I am logged in using licmon6.1 -w | grep &lt;user_name&gt;. When I start other sessions (that did not hang), I could still see my license but when I start the &quot;Maintain Item data&quot; session, session would hang and <br />
licmon6.1 -w | grep &lt;user_name&gt; would not show anything. Also, the log.licd6.1 show that user has been unregistered. <br />
<br />
Once we rebooted the server everything seems to working fine.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what might have happened?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

Only difference was that this time the session did not hang but the whole connection was terminated. Only log file that was getting update was the log.bshell with a CORE DUMPED message. The strange thing is that, this seems to happen with some sessions at random. We could open some session with out any problem but as soon as we start Maintain Item data for example, it would terminate the login and a dump a CORE file in the users home directory.<br />
<br />
	Again, we rebooted and everything started working.<br />
<br />
	Any ideas? Appreciate your help.<br />

I never faced this problem but once I came to know this matter in my training session. When we use baan, some sessions occupy some license (some internal purpose) and after using that session it is automatically close the license. Suppose you have 50 license and you are using 48, there is no problem but if you that particular session you will face the same problem, which you are facing. But it is confirm some session internally use some license.<br />
