<br />
I'm trying to write 4gl program that will be used as a device of type rewrite file. Which will use the bpf file output which is given as argv$(1) for the device.<br />
<br />
I noticed that for some reports when printed to windows printer with preview, the report looks a bit different from the one that is generated for my device..<br />
<br />
What's wrong ? Why is there a difference there ? How can my device get the same bpf file as the one printed for windows printer device ?<br />
<br />
I have faced this problem in baan4c4 and ERP LN 6.1<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

If you change printer after getting report then you may get different preview. Second point is printer settings. You should check printer default settings. That's all about it !<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiba_t</div><div class="date">15th August 2006, 12:21</div></div><div class="posttext">So you're saying that the generation of the bpf file depends on the device type ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mr_suleyman</div><div class="date">15th August 2006, 12:41</div></div><div class="posttext">sure! and depends on printer settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiba_t</div><div class="date">15th August 2006, 13:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a way to have the bpf generated for my rewrite device just as the one generated for the windows printer ??</div></div><hr />

<br />
This problem is back again on Baan4c!!<br />
<br />
Does anyone have more information on this case? <br />
<br />
I print my report on a device of type windows printer and get output A then I print the same report on a device of type rewrite file and I get output B.<br />
<br />
When I open output A and output B on my PC with bwprint, I get A in small font size and B in a large font size.<br />
<br />
The question is where are the report font sizes defined? Where can I find these definitions?<br />
<br />
How come when I print the same report on different devices on the same PC I get different outputs??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
