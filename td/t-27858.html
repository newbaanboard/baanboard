<br />
Hello,<br />
i think the biggest advantage is, if you have only the object, you'll see the &quot;ident&quot; in ttstpsessinfo.<br />
<br />

<br />
on unix systems you can use &quot;what&quot; command.<br />
<br />
The shell (e.g. bash) displays you all ident lines, so you can check the version of the object / script.<br />
<br />

Marking changes in scripts<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
During development of new scripts or a complete redesign, the number of changes will be large and there is probably not a need to indicate individual changes. In this case tracing changes via the checkin/checkout mechanism can be sufficient.<br />
<br />
The decision to mark changes is more or less decided per project based on the following reasons: <br />
<br />
Planned merge activities to other package VRCs in a parallel project environment, so the individual changes have to be interpreted individually <br />
Requirement changes <br />
Customer calls, e.g. Product Maintenance <br />
Below the markings for functional adjustments and error solutions will be explained.<br />
<br />
In the lifecycle of a script multiple ways of codes for marking can be used: <br />
<br />
During development topic code, Business Requirement number, TCS call number etc. <br />
During maintenance, the (Scopus) solution number <br />
A defect solution or a brief topic description requires text at the end of the program script header. When SCM is used and the same text is entered with SCM revision text, this will be done automatically. In maintenance mode the PMC tool is used for checking in.<br />
<br />
For instance (maintenance example):<br />
|* SOL10017, T. Developer, 1996-08-07<br />
|* 1. Lot codes by Unit is not possible, lot codes by Batch not needed (DF12345)<br />
|*     So added Lot codes by Unit functionality and removed Lot codes by Batch functionality.<br />
|* 2. Lot codes are not generated correctly (DF23145)<br />
<br />
For error solutions add the ident to identify the error solution in the script of DLLs (including Integration DLLs, DALs) and includes. Idents are visible in the object as ASCII text. Idents are either generated by the system itself (BaanERP and beyond), or added manually (Baan IV, earlier) <br />
<br />
A example of a manual added example in Baan IV:<br />
<br />
#ident @(#)SOL10017, T. Developer, 1996-08-07, B40_c5<br />
<br />
Do not change automatically generated ident lines.<br />
<br />
Adjusted lines must be marked. This implies that the previous (erroneous) program lines have to remain in the program script!<br />
<br />
Erroneous lines on position 1 are preceded by a pipe line | (except for DllUsage and FunctionUsage which is comment).<br />
<br />
A the end of such a line the |# is appended followed by the call number or textual identification, followed by .o (means old) or .n (means new).<br />
<br />
The identifications are needed because we do not have a revision control system over package VRC's and releases. Source analyzing tools recognize the | character, and distinguish the difference between obsolete and documentend lines for script statistics (e.g. changed code).<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
function extern generate.lotcodes()<br />
{<br />
&lt;DllUsage omitted&gt;<br />
      domain            whclot  lot.code<br />
<br />
      disable.commands(&quot;generate.lotcodes&quot;)<br />
 <br />
      if lotcode.allowed then<br />
            db.retry.point()<br />
            if not tcibd.dll0401.generate.item.number(<br />
                                 tisfc001.mitm,<br />
                                 tisfc001.pdno,<br />
|                                tckltc.batch,            |#10017.o<br />
                                 tckltc.unit,             |#10017.n<br />
                                 lot.code,<br />
                                 false) then                                                          <br />
	          abort.transaction()<br />
                  mess(&quot;tisfc01204&quot;, 1)                   |* generation of lot code is not possible<br />
                  return<br />
            endif<br />
            commit.transaction()<br />
      endif<br />
}<br />
<br />
If multiple defects are solved in one solution, and the defects should be identified, the solution number may be extended with a sequence number &quot;10017-1.n&quot; related to the sequence of defect numbers in the check-in text and ident string.<br />
<br />
If more than one line has been changed, lines must be marked successively. The following construction can be applied where the start is identified by s(= start of marked lines) or the end by e (= end of marked lines). In this example marking during development is done via a topic code.<br />
<br />
choice.mark.occur:<br />
after.choice:<br />
      if check.order.status.valid() then<br />
            enable.commands(MODIFY.SET, DUPL.OCCUR,<br />
            MARK.DELETE, GLOBAL.DELETE, GLOBAL.COPY)<br />
      else<br />
            disable.commands(MODIFY.SET, DUPL.OCCUR,<br />
            MARK.DELETE, GLOBAL.DELETE, GLOBAL.COPY)<br />
      endif<br />
      if tcibd001.unef = tcyesno.yes then                      |#SER_ITEM.sn<br />
            enable.commands(&quot;ticst0508m000&quot;)<br />
      else<br />
            disable.commands(&quot;ticst0508m000&quot;)<br />
      endif                                                    |#SER_ITEM.en</div></div><hr />

NAME<br />
	what - get SCCS identification information<br />
SYNOPSIS<br />
	what [-s] file ...<br />
DESCRIPTION<br />
	The what command searches the given files for all occurrences of the<br />
	pattern that get(1) substitutes for %Z% (currently @(#) at this<br />
	printing) and prints out what follows until the first &quot;, &gt;, new-line,<br />
	\, or null character.  For example, if the C program in file f.c<br />
	contains<br />
		char ident[] = &quot;@(#)identification information&quot;;<br />
		and f.c is compiled to yield f.o and a.out, the command<br />
		what f.c f.o a.out<br />
		prints<br />
		f.c:           identification information<br />
		f.o:           identification information<br />
		a.out:         identification information</div></div><hr />
