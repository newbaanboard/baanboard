I know from prevouis BaaN use that there can be a link between BP and pricebooks :) <br />
we have created the pricebooks but for some reason even dow we tried to set up the price def &amp; matrix it still does not work.  :confused: <br />
it ios beneficial for accouting  if we use the correct pricebook per vendor, less errors in pricing and better matching.<br />
We use BaaN V.<br />
Can anyone give a suggestion,<br />
thanks<br />

Can you be more precise?<br />
Are you using Sales / Purchase Price Lists?</div></div><hr />

I thought that price book values came first and foremost, but look it up.<br />
<br />
My point is that there are different levels of prices and which one is used depends on what conditions you set.<br />
<br />
Regardless, this question belongs on the distribution folder, where you will get a much better response anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">santickle</div><div class="date">6th April 2005, 10:13</div></div><div class="posttext">All, I am using the price book , can be found in order management, pricing control and there is  price books were you put your data or load diff. prices per vendor. What we want and I have seen it work  in BaaN is when you create a PO you can choose your price book of a vendor e.g. .:price book BaaN USD, BaaN euro. When you create a PO you can then choose your price book depending on what e.g.: Baan has stated for you<br />
We do use sales price books also this has been set up with a previous employee, it works only nobody knows how he did it!<br />
thx!<br />
