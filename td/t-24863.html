In the main.table.io section I have put in the code to skip.io if the record is released.  This does suppress the lines or children records, but the parent or index fields still appear.  Is there any way to suppress the entire record on a multi-occurrence form?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">18th August 2005, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Use query extensions instead.  These add to the sessions base sql statement, so the records are never selected, so the view is never formed.<br />
<br />
query.extensions are in the Baan IV programming manual, search for additional help on these boards.  Note that Baan IV has the query.extension() function only, and you can only extend the where clause.  In Baan V+, you have the query.extend.where, and other query.extend.* functions where you can do more.<br />
<br />
Basic Baan IV example, for a session with a main table of tihra100:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
     query.extension = &quot;tihra100.htpr = tcyesno.yes&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This will show only processed records.<br />
<br />
Good luck - post any questions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">18th August 2005, 22:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if I can do what I need with a query.extension.  The field I need to check is on another table.  Can you somehow check a field on another table in a query.extension?  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">18th August 2005, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, if I get what you mean.  Just think like you are writing a where clause, use the ':' to represent a variable outside the query, such as a different table field:<br />
<br />
Updated example, where tihra100 is the main table for the session:<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
     query.extension = &quot;tihra100.tano = :tihra900.tano&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
would only give you tihra100 records that have the same task as 'tihra900.tano'.  The tihra900.tano has to be set then at the time of the before program.  (you can also update the query later and use 'rebuild.query'...)<br />
<br />
Let us know what you mean specifically if that's not it.  Post your current skip.io code and we can see how to turn it into a query.extension.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcook331</div><div class="date">18th August 2005, 23:12</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is, there is no field on the main table to compare to.  The main table is like a Bill of material with a parent-child relationship.  The children have release dates on the main table.  The Parent, which is the one that determines if the record should be shown, does not.  To get its release date I have to go to another table.  It's then a matter of released = true or false and not whether or not a main table field is equal to something.  Can I still make the query extension work?    Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">18th August 2005, 23:18</div></div><div class="posttext">O, I see.<br />
<br />
No, not straightforward, that I can see.  Maybe someone can see how.<br />
<br />
For that you need to include the other table in the sql, and you can only do that in Baan V or higher.  <br />
<br />
O I remember now - is your skip.io in the 'after.read' section?  Try the read.view section instead.</div></div><hr />
