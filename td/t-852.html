PID and PPID assignments are managed and stored in the running kernel structures so unless you hack these I would not know any other way. Why would you want to change that though?<br />

If anyone does know a way, I would be happy to know how :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">popeye</div><div class="date">23rd January 2002, 23:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok ... here is my problem.<br />
<br />
We have a session for Approving Purchase Reqs.<br />
Assuming the user is logged on to Company 800.<br />
So ... in this session he'll be viewing the records for Company 800.<br />
Now he wants to view the info for Company 815.<br />
<br />
This is fairly simple for him. All he has to do is<br />
1. Close the session.<br />
2. Change the Company (Menu Browser).<br />
3. Start the session again.<br />
<br />
For some vague reason, my client is not willing to do this.<br />
Too much effort - It seems :) Grrrrrrrrr<br />
I tried convincing him  --- No luck.<br />
<br />
He wants to change the Company without exiting the session.<br />
<br />
I do not want to use tablename._compnr etc in the script.<br />
The program logic is pretty complex. I do not want to break my head over it.<br />
<br />
I thought of switch.to.company()<br />
That does not suit my needs.<br />
<br />
Is there any other way?<br />
<br />
Please let me know.<br />
Thanks.<br />
Cheers,<br />

I can't see the connection between a process PPID and the Baan company number in a client process. I think your client is refusing to accept standard Baan functionality :D<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is possible using Baan code but I am sure there are other people who can answer that. Any takers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">popeye</div><div class="date">24th January 2002, 01:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Pat,<br />
    Here is the link between PPID and the problem I am trying to<br />
    solve.<br />
<br />
    I was trying to do the following:<br />
    1. Whenever the user selects the new company, I capture <br />
        it in free$. I also store the PID of the current process in <br />
        free$.<br />
    2. I activate/zoom to the same session.<br />
    3. In the &quot;before.program&quot;, I chk if free$ has a valid <br />
        company+PID.<br />
        If yes, I do the following.<br />
        a) Kill the original session (PID is stored in free$).<br />
        b) Switch to the New Company (switch.to.company)<br />
        Now I have the new instance of the session with info from<br />
        the &quot;new&quot; company.<br />
       <br />
     But ... when I kill the &quot;old&quot; session, it's still there in the <br />
     background since it's child (&quot;new&quot; session) is still active.<br />
<br />
    Hence I wanted to &quot;delink&quot; the two processes.<br />
    ... Hence the Question? How do I play around with the PPID?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Madhu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">24th January 2002, 03:42</div></div><div class="posttext">That seems like a lot of work to just switch the company.  The way I did it was to take all of my functions and make them a library where I pass the company number.  My user finally agreed to input the company he wanted the data from. The problem was that he only wanted certain data from our simulation company.  Is there a reason why you could not set a button on the form and do a switch .to.company - toggle,ask for company or something.? I know you said you did not want to use switch.to.company, but it seems that offers the best solution so far.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I do not know of anyway to do this using process id's.  If you do figure out a way to do this using PID's then please post it.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">victor_cleto</div><div class="date">24th January 2002, 12:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Why don't you create a specific BW settings that enable that client to start within the correct company number and also the session he wants to run straight away?<br />
<br />
Like this, he doesn't need to clos the current, he just needs to login again with a specific BW settings.<br />
You can even prepare two specifc sessions, one that connects to the correct 800 and another to the 815, just in case he needs to see the data from 800 while working in the 815!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could u just check whether the functioon set.pgrp() can be useful in ur case.  It can be used as set.pgrp(some.pid,some.pid) to set the group id of the process(some.pid)  to a new group id <br />
<br />
I had used it in combination with the related functions to start a independent process from a parent process. <br />

I have found it to work quite well, but I am usually doing process routines.  Is the problem the data on the form comes in with the old company?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">popeye</div><div class="date">25th January 2002, 00:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
   Thanks for the posts.<br />
   Here is what I don't like about switch.to.company.<br />
<br />
  Although I m able to change the company, the &quot;top bar&quot;   (for lack of a better term) still shows the old company.<br />
  <br />
  See the attached pic (I have changed to 475, but the Bar still shows 400).<br />
<br />
  Unless somebody knows how to make that work.<br />
 <br />
  Also I have a query extension (before.program).<br />
  How will I execute that part, when I do a switch.to.company?<br />
<br />
  Hence I was activating another instance and <br />
  1. changing the Company in the before.program section<br />
  2. killing the &quot;old&quot; session<br />
<br />
  But with this, the old process remains hanging (till I close out the<br />
  child session).<br />
<br />
  Thanks.<br />
Regards,<br />
MAdhu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vgobiraj</div><div class="date">25th January 2002, 00:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Within the session there must be an choice/option to change company.<br />
<br />
1. Specify New Company<br />
2. activate(&quot;session&quot;)       | Activates the same session <br />
3. execute(end.program)  | This will end the current program<br />
<br />
<br />
Other solution can be if the functionality permits then<br />
there can be logical table sharing. So in one screen user<br />
sees data from both the companies.</div></div><hr />

function main()<br />

Anyways ... I got a very simple solution from ~Vamsi.<br />
Will post it after I am done with it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">popeye</div><div class="date">25th January 2002, 02:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
	Here is ~Vamsis solution.<br />
<br />
	I have a Control Session which calls the Main Session.<br />
	The Control Session does not have a form linked to it.<br />
<br />
	Here is the code in tdpuro143m001 (Control Session).<br />
	<br />
declaration:<br />
	domain	tccomp	   hold.comp<br />
		<br />
before.program:<br />
	hold.comp = get.compnr()<br />
	while (1)<br />
		if hold.comp = 0 then <br />
			exit()<br />
		else<br />
			switch.to.company(hold.comp)<br />
			hold.comp = lval(zoom.to$(&quot;tdpuro143m002&quot;, Z.SESSION, &quot;tdpuro143m001&quot;, &quot;&quot;, 0))<br />
		endif<br />
	endwhile<br />
<br />
	Here is the code in tdpuro143m002 (Main Program)<br />
	<br />
choice.user.0:		| 400<br />
on.choice:<br />
		exit(400)<br />
	<br />
choice.user.1:		| 475<br />
on.choice:<br />
		exit(475)<br />
<br />
	It works just fine (except for the flash when the sessions close and open).<br />
	<br />
	Thanks a lot Vamsi for the easy fix.<br />
<br />
Modified the posting with the addition of code tags.<br />

<br />
I was wondering if you could do away with the second button. Just rename the first button to &quot;Switch Company&quot;. <br />
<br />
Your code would then become <br />
choice.user.0:	| 400<br />
on.choice:<br />
	if curr.company = 475 then<br />
		exit(400)<br />
	else<br />
		exit(475)<br />
	endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Am writing from home. Do not remember the predefined variable for the current company number. Replace curr.company with that variable :).<br />
<br />
Alternatively you should atleast disable the button for the active company. I do not remember if it is possible to disable buttons in Baan IV.</div></div><hr />
