I want to run 5 sessions step by step in one main session. In my structure, <br />
5th session depends on 4 th sessions  , 4 th session depens on 3th session and like that. I know job managment in Baan but I don't know exactly  sessions' run time.I mean that When one sessions' work  finish , other must start  up to 5 th sesion. <br />
<br />
Thanks all in advice.</div></div><hr />

If using a job works then I would do it that way, but if you need to check reports and such you could always use a function server.  With a function server you could always validate the data between session to make sure everything went just fine, then launch the next session.  I use this type method to load our simulation company - creating milestones, contract requirements, costing links, etc.<br />

I don't know sessions's running time , it can be change according to  processed data. <br />

Any idea ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">14th October 2004, 17:49</div></div><div class="posttext">One suggestion (I'm sure there are several ways) - you can use AFS coding to call each session from one main session.   You will have to create and code that main session, and there's a lot of work learning the AFS coding methods.  I suggest starting at the sticky at the top of the AFS forum.</div></div><hr />

But I need coding samples. I don't know exactly all AFS functions and I don't have enough information about AFS. I want to write<br />
code for running 5 sessions in one main session and  error control .<br />
In addition to this , IS AFS compatible witt Baan IV 3c ? <br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

But How can I know that running process finished ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jp.aalders</div><div class="date">15th October 2004, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">using AFS you now that the session has finished when the stpapi.end.session<br />
statement is passed in the program script. This works fine, I've written an AFS session which is processing re-scheduling messages of the MRP automatically and afterward is running the MRP net-change again.<br />
<br />
Works fine.</div></div><hr />

Refer to the posting - can we know the process id of sessions started using AFS?  (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=6485&amp;highlight=pstat)<br />
<br />
There are some print/process sessions which use - execute(end.program). In that case the session is already closed before the stpapi.end.session() call.<br />
You can get the process id of the AFS session and check its status using the pstat().<br />
<br />
But when you are already executing - stpapi.continue.process() or stpapi.form.command() you dont have to check if the process is completed or not. When its done processing it goes to the next statement.<br />
<br />
stpapi.form.command(session.code, 5, &quot;exec.cont.process&quot;, error)<br />
error = stpapi.get.mess.code(session.code, error)<br />
if not isspace(error) then<br />
	message(error)<br />
endif</div></div><hr />

If you don't want to use AFS and all of these sessions are tyep 4 sessions then you can create your own custom session and run all the session from this session. For. e.g. I have custom session that does following<br />
1. Report prouction order complete<br />
2. Back Flush Material<br />
3. Generare O/B for sales order<br />
4. Print Pickiing list<br />
5. Release O/B<br />
6. Print Packing slip<br />
6. Email packing slip (custom made)<br />
7. Print Sales Invoice<br />
8. Record Freight Information<br />
<br />
All this logic is in one session. There is a standard Baan IV function load_dll and execute_dll that you can use to call each session. <br />
If these are not type 4 session then you can use AFS or the wiselink product from fullscope. I have found that to be a good product.<br />
