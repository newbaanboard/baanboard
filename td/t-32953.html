<br />
I am trying to open a session's help with help viewer. I succeeded to open the help viewer object (ottstphelp) but I can not start this object with the help text that I want. <br />
<br />
My code is so far is as follows:<br />
<br />
function zoom.help()<br />
{<br />
	zoom.to$ (&quot;ttstphelp&quot;,z.session,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,0)<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you know if I can import some variables to this session ? what can be the variable names that I can use ? <br />
<br />
Any help, clue will be appriciated :) <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Dogu</div></div><hr />

Can't the user just click help about session.  This may or may not help, but try bic_info on the session and see if it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dogu_00</div><div class="date">20th March 2007, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Mark,<br />
<br />
The main reason is that I want to open the help viewer when a user logs  into BAAN automatically (I have already a 3gl script that runs in BMS_MASK in background for password aging) <br />
<br />
So this help session will have links to other help sessions for our customized sessions, <br />
<br />
But now you questioned it..., may be I can do a simple session instead that opens automatically and has this help that I want. The user just needs to open the help of this session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">20th March 2007, 14:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way is to write your help in a file and use the display.file() function that is in ottdlldisplay DLL. Check this link for the syntax:<br />

I hope it helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">20th March 2007, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">That's OK Mark.<br />
<br />
I think a better solution is to build a 3GL session. It can include links.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th March 2007, 15:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah - but with your solution he can force them to view the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th March 2007, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops - I meant to say view some text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dogu_00</div><div class="date">20th March 2007, 16:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies, display.file is a good function. Can be useful in other things also... <br />
<br />
What I like about the help viewer (ottstphelp) object is that it is possible to use hypertexts, by this way linking session execution and running other helps are very easy... Ex:  %SEtiitm0101m000 etc.<br />
<br />
But of course eventhough it is very cumbersome to produce graphical screens, 3GL is the most complete solution I guess. If no other suggestions comes for tt stphelp ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">20th March 2007, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you thought about a 4GL session with start option 60?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is another one of those undocumented features (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=36550) of Baan.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Can you add it to the thread of undocumented features (http://www.baanboard.com/baanboard/showthread.php?t=36550) or shall I?</div></div><hr />

I'll appreciate your posting<br />
<br />
gooooch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">george7a</div><div class="date">3rd March 2010, 08:43</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want me to document this, I'll need to know a bit more about the object. Do you have the full documentation of how does it work? for example, how can I view the &quot;how to use&quot; the session? or a specific field help?<br />
<br />
In your code, what is the 3rd argument that the object takes (&quot;6&quot; in your example)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goooch</div><div class="date">3rd March 2010, 10:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear George, I think I can not help a lot. But maybe my story helps.<br />
Yesterday I wanted  to add in my special program a function that opens help on any table in baan. I found no information about how to do it on the BaanBoard but this thread was found. &quot;So zoom does not work&quot; I thougth. If I were a tools programmer I prefer parameters to be passed as arguments. With bic_info and simple function get.indexed.var I found &quot;help.argument&quot; array that had some interesting information: session code and 5. When I opened tdpur041 table help there were tdpur041 and 6.<br />
Then started a ottstphelp script from menu with these arguments I got the same help. So it was enough for me. Some troubles with starting as a child were solved with standard algorithm of creating a mwindow and a new process.<br />
At this moment I guess only that the first parameter is an object code and the second is a number - 5 for session and 6 for tables.<br />
<br />
<br />
gooooch</div></div><hr />
