Currently I am only aware of the Recently Used Sessions, Menu Navigation, and Bookmark Page methods.  It would be nice to have more user friendly interface for roles and sessions in LN please.</div></div><hr />

Our never Version of the &quot;run&quot; program tracked history of that they ran using it.  It would track the last 10 or 20 sessions - when you opened you could scroll thru, pick a session and then just hit continue.  This was in 4c4 - and probably something nicer running around in LN.</div></div><hr />
