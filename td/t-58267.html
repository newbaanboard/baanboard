Could u check the value of previous.choice or update.status or choice in before.choice section of update.db . It  may be equal to text.manager.<br />
<br />
I used to store the text to a string array before and after text maintenace and compare the same to c if it's  equal (to determine whether it's changed or not)</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you for your answer. I just tried it with that:<br />
<br />
choice.update.db:<br />
before.choice:<br />
message(&quot;update.status: &quot; &amp; str$(update.status) &amp; &quot; previous.choice: &quot; &amp; str$(previous.choice) &amp; &quot; choice: &quot; &amp; str$(choice))<br />
<br />
The result is always: update.status=21, previous.choice=21, choice=15, if I modify the text or not.<br />
<br />
So this seems not to work. But there is still the way with a text array, as you do it. How do you determine the array size? Do you dynamically allocate the memory or do you work with a fixed array size?<br />
<br />
Kind regards</div></div><hr />

Please see the reply from NPRao as below<br />
You can use the text.to.buf() before the program is started and then again when the session is exiting or saving data, then compare the memory/array buffers - cmp.mem()<br />

<br />
thanks for the link. Seems that there is no way, except to compare the text. What I dislike with this version, is that you have to take care about the maximum line number. OK if there is no other solution I will use it.<br />
In my case there is a possible other solution: I think I can the &quot;before.save.object&quot; in the DAL. In my case it should be enough, if I recognize that the system persists something. ... I will see...<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support</div></div><hr />

       Did you have a look to the table tttxt002. It has field &quot;Last Modified&quot;.<br />
       I think if we check the field &quot;Last Modified&quot; for your text number then if it is near by to the current time (say difference of few seconds) then we can consider as the text was changed.<br />
<br />
       Am not sure if this helps, but just wanted to higlight table tttxt002. May be we can even find out with one more solution.<br />

U can check function text.present.in.language to get number of lines in text to determine string array dimension . and then use the same to compare either using cmp.mem or element by element whatever convenient /suitable to u.</div></div><hr />

<br />
brilliant idea. I just checked it. This time is only modified, if the text is really changed.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
