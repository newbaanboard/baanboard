Sub: Discrepency in insertion of records into table b/w debug &amp; normal mode.<br />
<br />
In one of our customizations, we are calling baan stnd function tdsls4102.update.occurrence() to update the sales order related tables whenever we insert a new line. It should update the Sales Order History table twice, one with -ve record (old Qty) and other with +ve record (new Qty).<br />
<br />
Here were are facing a strange issue, when we are running the session in normal mode sometimes it is only updating with 1 record instead of two records. But same session when we run in debug mode, it is updating correctly with two records. <br />
<br />
We even added some delay between the updates but still it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Have anyone have faced similar issue? <br />
<br />
Please suggest.<br />
<br />
thanks &amp; regards,<br />
Satish</div></div><hr />

<br />
we also faced similar problem while updating our customised table, our was a slightly different case. we were calculating and then updating Gate Entry number for our customisation. When we ran session in debug mode it worked fine, but showed problem when we ran it in compiled mode.<br />
<br />
We solved the problem by transferring our logic of first free number to DAL script of that table, which was earlier coded in program script.<br />
<br />
I am not sure whether my post will solve your problem since your's is standard table and you might no have DAL script code with you. but what my intent is that you should try inserting records using DAL. I feel that would solve your problem<br />
<br />

<br />
thanks for the reply, but as we are in Baan IV Version we cannot implement DAL insertion.<br />
Please suggest any other way.<br />

<br />
In our scenario, whenever we are modifying a record, it was comparing the time and trying to insert a record with same time and getting failed.<br />
<br />
So, we have added a delay of 1 sec with suspend(1000) so that related save.trtm gets increment and then it is inserting a new record consistently successfully.<br />
