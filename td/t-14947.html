<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r_bharose</div><div class="date">1st April 2004, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking if there is way to capture the field in the report? eg. supplier code. <br />
<br />
This is my requirement.<br />
Purchase order to be send to supplier, when the print purchase order is fired. I would have a table to maintain email addresses by supplier.<br />
<br />
When the user fires the report, the report is send to the supplier using the stored email address. I would have a custom &quot;ttstpconv&quot; invoking &quot;BLAT&quot; in background. The problem with this approach is to find the Purchase Order code for which the print command is fired. Once I know the purchase order code I can send email to predifined email address of the supplier.<br />
(This can be extended to other reports as well)<br />
<br />
<br />
Anybody with hint or idea.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<br />
I would like to have a more generic solution.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
U can write following code in the report script and use the from to purchase order number.<br />
<br />
<br />
declaration:<br />
domain tcorno fromorno,toorno<br />
<br />
before.program:<br />
           import(&quot;orno.f&quot;,fromorno)<br />
           import(&quot;orno.t&quot;,toorno)</div></div><hr />

Since Print Purchase Order is one of our order steps I created a separate session to run the print purchase order.  What the program did was allow the user to enter a purchase order range. It always ran the batch &quot;accounting&quot;,  so the user(auditors or accounting folks) could not actually finalize a purchase order.  This way I knew if it made it to the report it was already sent to the vendor.  In your case you may need to check the purchase order status, so that way they did not send the PO multiple times to the vendor.  Each PO from this session was handed individually to the print PO session - 1 report per purchase order.  Also I prevented them from sending it to devices like file or display - nothing like getting 100 reports on your terminal. :)<br />
