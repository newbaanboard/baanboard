<br />
In VB, for example, you can say:<br />
<br />
    Dim strNewLine As String<br />
<br />
    strNewLine = Chr(13)<br />
<br />
<br />
How does that work in Baan? I need to append a newline character to a string but don't know how to do it. I'd rather not use a function that &quot;does it for me.&quot;<br />
I'd like to know how to do it myself. Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">3rd February 2003, 10:19</div></div><div class="posttext">klesch (on the other thread): Add chr$(10) to the end of each line that you write to a file. Maybe opening a file in binary mode before that is a good idea.<br />
<br />
(If your file will only be used in Windows environment, then chr$(10) &amp; chr$(13) can be used.)Some background:  On the old typewriter, a newline was 1 line feed (roll paper one position up) and 1 carriage return (that is where the return is from) where the paper was moved to the right hand side, thus positioning the cursor on the first position on the left hand side.<br />
<br />
DOS and also Windows is fully backward compatible, so they maintain a chr$(10)&amp;chr$(13) sequence as a &lt;EOL&gt; (end-of-line), where Unix (and also Baan) do only use the more efficient  chr$(10) only.</div></div><hr />
