Does anyone have any experience with integrating a Kardex system or know of partners that specialize in this area? I am believing this may be something every customer does custom as I am not finding much online for integration vendors in the space.<br />
<br />
Any hints/tips/thoughts are appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shah_bs</div><div class="date">2nd September 2020, 01:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I was not involved with the product Kardex, so not familiar with its functionality, but being part of the team that supports SAP, I would get emails from the team that was working on the project about Kardex interface to SAP.<br />
<br />
If it helps any, it was a 100% customization of the flow of data from and to KARDEX. So, unless BAAN already has something built, you have to define and build your own interface.</div></div><hr />

Kardex offers a wide range of interfaces which looks very easy for the first time. But when we got to the implemention, there were some details that made it necessary for us to implement workarounds because they could not configure our needs. We decided to use a simple file interface (Unix -&gt; Windows); this works very stable.<br />
