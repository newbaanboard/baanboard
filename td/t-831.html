<br />
Back thirsting for more knowledge!<br />
<br />
I am still on my custom module that I have been creating and want to get into modifying the scripts behind the maintain sessions.<br />
<br />
There are two tables so two scripts and the functions that I want to incorporate into the scripts are updating between the tables and validations.  These will also need to look at other BaaN tables such as our customer table and installation table.<br />
<br />
How should I go about doing this?<br />
<br />
Can anyone here talk me through it?<br />
<br />
I am awaiting my BaaN development course but that won't be for a few montrhs and I want to get cracking now!!<br />
<br />
Cheers guys</div></div><hr />

I would suggest that you take a look at the first five chapters of the programmer's manual and then post more specific questions.  This can be found in Baan IV GUI by clicking on Tools, selecting Help, Using Session, and then choosing &quot;Programmer's Information&quot;.</div></div><hr />
