<br />
I am creating an Exchange on tdltc001 that will update the oudt (date) field. My import file contains the four primary fields plus the oudt field. My ASCII file format = cprj | item | cntr | clot | oudt<br />
<br />
When I test my XCH scheme my record keeps on getting skipped. I'm guessing that because tdltc001.clot is right justified Baan is not reading my import file correctly. This is also confirmed when I view the record in GTM when I enter my primary keys including the lot number I always have to scroll back a couple of records to see the one that I'm after.<br />
<br />
My import file looks like below, columns 1 and 3 are meant to be blank -<br />

<br />
I tried this but had troubles getting my syntax correct and the script would not compile.<br />
<br />
If the name of my exchange field is 'clot' what will the correct syntax be?<br />
<br />
I've read the Baan help for tt.align.according.domain but I'm still unsure. It also says that the string in and string out need to be the same size of the doman. My clot string in (the import file) as you can see is not the same size, the domain is 26 characters. The same can be said for the string out. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">22nd June 2004, 15:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I would expect it to look something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
     long rc<br />
     domain tdltc.clot  somelot<br />
     rc = tt.align.according.domain(clot,somelot,&quot;tdltc.clot&quot;)<br />
     return(somelot)<br />
<br />
<br />
Where clot is your string paramenter and the condition returns multibyte string.  I would expect the import string for the table to have 26 characters for this format.  Again I have not really tried this, but would think it should work.<br />

Thanks for your syntax.<br />
<br />
I think I tried something along these lines. <br />
<br />
When I run the 'Check Syntax' I get an error saying - <br />
<br />
&quot;Unresolved reference to function 'tt.align.according.domain'<br />
<br />
What does this mean?<br />

<br />
As I only want to change the oudt value my XCH settings are as follows: -<br />
<br />
Maintain Table Relations - tuxch0121m000<br />
<br />
Table = tdltc001<br />
Add Record = No<br />
Overwrite = Yes<br />
Update Record = No<br />
Delete Record = No<br />
<br />
Maintain Field Relations - tuxch0122m000<br />
<br />
Field = cprj Overwrite = No Update = No<br />
Field = item Overwrite = No Update = No<br />
Field = cntr Overwrite = No Update = No<br />
Field = clot Overwrite = No Update = No<br />
Field = oudt Overwrite = Yes Update = Yes<br />
<br />
These are the settings that I have used in other XCH schemes to update certain table columns.<br />
<br />
Am I missing anything here?<br />

1. Set your Update Record = YES - also made no difference. I didn't expect it to as I have created other XCH schemes to do the same process in other tables using the settings I have for this troublesome XCH.<br />

<br />
My next thought(if it qualifies as such) had to do with why you have to scroll back in GTM.  On my system when I enter pimary key fields I get the exact record.  Even if I add spaces to the front and back of the lot.  Is it possible one of the table indexes maybe corrupt?  Do you have this same problem on a test system where you could probably re-org the table.  I just really do not see why you need to do something special for this table.  I am just wondering if something between the domain, DD and table is confused.<br />

I have tried to re-org the table on our test box but the issue remains. <br />
<br />
Even when I do a search in GTM using the values already loaded it jumps to the next record. <br />
<br />
The tdltc.clot domain is left justified so I'm confused as to why GTM and the search zoom session on tdltc0101m000 show the data justified to the right?<br />

<br />
May I suggest to set insert to yes and see if the number of records skipped will now be the number of records with reference error? If a record doesn't exist, the record will be skipped without a message. Even the insert maybe depending on a condition script where you check if the records is present, then records will be skipped due to condition.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mark_h</div><div class="date">29th June 2004, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">We ran into something like this once on projects or something.  We got a patch from Baan and things got really strange.  Some sessions were showing the field as left justified and GTM was showing it as right justified.  The really strange thing is when inserting in the session the field went into the table as left justified.  When you did an insert in GTM it went into the table as right justified.  I do remember that I had to copy the domain from the standard layer to our test layer to fix the problem(convert to RDD) - the domain was correct in the standard layer(right justified).  I can not remember if I had to do anything to the sessions - maybe just recreated RDD for our test VRC.  Not sure if this is the same as what you are seeing.   I am going to check my email archives to see if I still have any of the messages - I did just clean out all of 2001/2002 emails.<br />
<br />
On our system both GTM and the sessions show it as right justified.<br />

<br />
I've now got Baan support on to this and they are telling me that the tdltc.clot domain should be right justified. They are presuming that a solution has changed the domain to left and that's causing the issue. Sounds a lot like the problem you had.<br />
<br />
On your system what justification does the tdltc.clot domain have in the standard layer?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lbencic</div><div class="date">30th June 2004, 19:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if this is related or not, but it sounds like a problem we had some time ago.  The fields of a right justified domain were being stored left justified.  That was ok for a while, as all related fields were the same, but when we ran a convert to runtime on one table, the fields went to right justified (as per the domain), hosing the references.    Turns out the problem was that someone had put an entry for that domain in the &quot;Modify Code Alignment&quot; session (ttadv4107m000, under Tools / Software Installation / Installation in Baan V).  I really don't know what the correct use of that session is, but it seems pretty dangerous to me.  I don't think the settings in this session are taken into account during a normal reconfigure - at least they were not when we ran it on Baan IV about a year ago.  Check and make sure there is not an entry here for your lot domain.</div></div><hr />
