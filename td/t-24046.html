The original form only had one option for search. My session is based on timrp943 table. When I added the option on the form to change the search order,and i scroll to the next record, I am getting the following errors:<br />
host variable expected after ':'<br />
Syntax error: '.' not expected<br />
Found 2 errors durig scanning/parsing<br />
Error 302 (SQL Syntax not correct) on select<br />
How can I get this to work?</div></div><hr />

What kind of form is this 1, 2 or 3 also it would help if you can send screen dump. And how many indexes does this table have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">13th May 2005, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that the table shows only one index, but in GTM i can see 2 indexes.<br />

<br />
When you say table shows only one index, do you mean its in table definition session in tools ?<br />
<br />
And how GTM is showing 2 indexes if its only one table definition, is it the right company you are looking into ?, Also can you check is this table is the main table for the session.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps once you are through with above<br />
<br />
Actually the table definition and GTM should be in sync:<br />
<br />
Step 1: Do a convert to run time for the table definition and run a reconfig also for same int he respective company<br />
<br />
Step 2: If even then the problem exist, do a convert run time for the session also.</div></div><hr />

Is is in the program script??</div></div><hr />

<br />
After copying it to proper VRC did you followed the 2 steps that i have mentioned in my previous reply. Try doing it, i think the problem should get resolve. Because Change order is Baan Standard and i don't think any thing in script should effect that.<br />
And did you check that the table you are mentioning is Main table for that session, then only its going to work otherwise not.</div></div><hr />

You can also check with change key option in maintain session. There might be select only one index.<br />

<br />
If you are using BAAN IV it is on ttadv2100m000 Maintain Session, i think its Ctrl F4 just check it on this session. In that it has got how many index are currently applied to session .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ltannous</div><div class="date">19th May 2005, 17:53</div></div><div class="posttext">I have updated the indexes in the session, create runtime, but still the same errors as mentioned in the first posting. Would this have anything to do with the program script?</div></div><hr />
