Is there possible to dynamic change the label of a form command? For a field, there is a function to change the label, What I need is to dynamic defined the description of some buttons linked to form commands.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance.<br />

Check the box for 'label font' (next to color, right side) when adding the field to the form.  The field will appear to be a label on the form.  You can change the contents and effect (bold, reverse, etc.) in the script based on other factors - buttons pressed, field content, calling session, etc.).</div></div><hr />

Well - I think they are trying to do a dynamic change of the text on a button. I do not know of a way to do that. <br />

Now what you could do, and I am not sure if this is the case, is write various synchronized sessions.  So lets say the key field on the session was item.  So the top or main session has item on it - then the lower session (based off item type make or buy)could display production orders or another session could display purchase orders.  Then the two lower sessions could have different buttons on them.  So the purchase orders could have a button to zoom to display lines.  Then the production order session could zoom to display planning.  Something like this might work for you - but it is a lot of work(at least for me) to just have different button text.  There are probably better options, but that was the first thing that popped into my mind.</div></div><hr />
