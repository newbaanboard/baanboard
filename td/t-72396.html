<br />
I have a Customized session. Its Session Type is Maintain, and its Window Type is List window.<br />
I disabled Save Record(s) in standard commands, but whenever the record is going to change (by first record, next record, previous record, and last record), the session will always ask if the user wants to save the data. It only happens when at least one of the input field has data in it.<br />
In this case, there is nothing to save. The input fields are for other actions.<br />
Therefore, I want it to stop asking to save anything in this session.<br />
How can I do that?</div></div><hr />

It can be done and users got used to &quot;store input without saving&quot;, but in fact Baan was not intended to be used in this way. Remember that the 4GL also makes a transaction so just pushing a db.retry.point and commit.transaction here and there will probably cause problems in data integrity as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't quite understand, but all of the input fields in the session are not table fields. So, there will be no effect to data integrity.<br />
The fields are created in program script and only used in the form and a calculation process, so there is no need for the session to keep saving when no data in the main table will be changed at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OmeLuuk</div><div class="date">19th November 2019, 15:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, well this makes it a bit different. So:<br />
<br />
 You have a display session on your main table<br />
 The records of the maintable are shown<br />
 along with calculated fields which tend to change or be changed by the user<br />
 These (possible) modifications do not alter the data in the maintable<br />
 In spite of that, yet the session wants to save the record on the maintable<br />
 ... probably because fields are changed.<br />
<br />
My guess would be: point 1 is not correct: you use a maintain session instead of display session. Now transaction handling of 4GL engine kicks in but since you do not allow changes on the maintable on changed fields, there is nothing to commit.<br />
<br />
You can force a database update every time STP wants to save a record, but that would be wrong - the record is never changed.</div></div><hr />

As stated in my first post, the session is a maintain session. All other speculations are correct.<br />
<br />
You can still have display session and take input right?<br />
<br />
I did try to change it to display but it is still the same. Nothing changes at all. The input fields are still active and the session still asks if you want to save just like in maintain session.</div></div><hr />
